HEADLINE: Exchanges in Latest Debate Highlight a New Dynamic in the Republican Field

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
Fred D. Thompson tried to salvage his faltering presidential campaign at a debate Thursday night with a barrage of sharp attacks on the ''liberal'' policies of Mike Huckabee, the fellow Southerner whom he clearly sees as a rival in the South Carolina primary.
 The performance by Mr. Thompson, which including several pointed one-liners, capped a debate that showed the altered terrain of the Republican field as it moved beyond contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.
 Mitt Romney took on Senator John McCain, the victor in New Hampshire, over economic issues in an effort to sway voters in Michigan before its primary on Tuesday. Mr. Huckabee and Mr. Thompson tussled over South Carolina voters. And Rudolph W. Giuliani took a muted swipe at Mr. McCain in an effort to win over security-minded voters before the Jan. 29 Florida primary.
 But it was Mr. Thompson's performance, in which he shook off the laid-back style that has defined his candidacy, that provided some of the liveliest moments of the debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C.. 
 ''This is a battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party and its future,'' said Mr. Thompson, who has staked his run on a strong showing in South Carolina. The primary there is Jan. 19.
 ''On the one hand,'' he said, ''you have the Reagan revolution, you have the Reagan coalition of limited government and strong national security. And the other hand, you have the direction that Governor Huckabee would take us in. He would be a Christian leader, but he would also bring about liberal economic policies, liberal foreign policies.''
 Mr. Thompson then lit into Mr. Huckabee, the former Baptist preacher and Arkansas governor who won the Iowa caucus, for wanting to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, for supporting what he called ''taxpayer-funded programs for illegals'' and for wanting to sign a law restricting smoking.
 ''That's not the model of the Reagan coalition, that's the model of the Democratic Party,'' he said.
 Mr. Huckabee, for his part, responded with trademark humor. ''The Air Force has a saying that says if you're not catching flak, you're not over the target,'' he said. ''I'm catching the flak; I must be over the target.'' 
 The debate, which was sponsored by the South Carolina Republican Party, was actually more of a series of separate minidebates that happened to be held simultaneously and in the same place, reflecting the strategies of each candidate. Mr. Huckabee and Mr. McCain were frequently the target of attacks. 
 Mr. Giuliani, coming off distant finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, at one point noted that Mr. McCain was not the only candidate who supported the increased troop presence in Iraq. 
 ''I'd also like to say something to my friend John,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''John gets great credit for supporting the surge. But, John, there were other people on this stage that also supported the surge. The night of the president's speech, I was on television. I supported the surge, I've supported it throughout.''
 Mr. McCain responded that he had criticized the old strategy in Iraq before President Bush adopted the new strategy. 
 ''My point was that I condemned the Rumsfeld strategy and called for the change in strategy,'' he said, referring to former Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. ''That's the difference.''
 Mr. Huckabee, who is looking for a strong showing in Michigan and a win in South Carolina to show that his victory in Iowa was more than a fluke, tried to appeal to voters in both states with a populist message. 
 ''We need to make sure that we communicate that our party is just as interested in helping the people who are single moms, who are working two jobs and still just barely paying the rent as we are the people at the top of the economy,'' he said. 
 Although the debate was held in South Carolina, Mr. Romney -- who has pulled his advertising out of the state after a year-long effort to court Republicans there, concentrating instead on Michigan -- turned the very first question, about the economy, into an appeal for Michigan votes.
 ''I know that there are some people who think, as Senator McCain did -- he said, you know, some jobs have left Michigan that are never coming back,'' he said. ''I disagree. I'm going to fight for every single job. Michigan, South Carolina, every state in this country. We're going to fight for jobs and make sure that our future is bright.''
 Mr. McCain tried to give back as good as he got.
 ''One of the reasons why I won in New Hampshire is because I went there and told them the truth,'' he said. ''And sometimes you have to tell people things they don't want to hear along with things that they do want to hear.''
 That appeared to be a not-too-veiled swipe at Mr. Romney, who has been dogged during the campaign by accusations that he has changed his positions on issues like abortion rights, which he once supported but now opposes, for political gain. 
 ''Let's have a little straight talk,'' Mr. McCain said. ''There are some jobs that aren't coming back to Michigan. There are some jobs that won't come back here to South Carolina. But we're going to take care of them. That's our goal. That's our obligation.
 ''We need to go to the community colleges and design education and training programs so that these workers get a second chance. That's our obligation as a nation.'' 
 Mr. Thompson leavened his responses with the kind of one-liners that many supporters had hoped he would use sooner. 
 Asked about the United States response in a confrontation with Iranian speedboats, Mr. Thompson said, ''I think one more step and they would have been introduced to those virgins that they're looking forward to seeing.'' At another point, he offered that ''you can tell that the news is good coming out of Iraq because you read so little about it in The New York Times.''
 He also went after Mr. McCain on immigration.
 ''I disagree with my friend John McCain on the bill that they proposed last year,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''I disagree with my friend Governor Huckabee when he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants.''
 Mr. McCain championed a controversial Senate bill that would have offered a pathway to citizenship to the 12 million illegal immigrants in the country, provided they cleared certain hurdles.
 Asked what he would do as president about illegal immigrants in the country, Mr. McCain said he would make sure to secure the border but did not back away from his views. While those who committed crimes would be deported, he said, others would be addressed in ''as humane and compassionate a way as possible.''
 In response, Mr. Romney put forth a hard-line stance on the issue, arguing that the illegal immigrants in the country should be given some time to arrange their affairs but that all should be required to go home and ''get in line with everybody else.''

HEADLINE: Troubled Giant In Home Loans Close to Rescue

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and ERIC DASH; Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Countrywide Financial, the troubled lender that became a symbol of the excesses that led to the subprime mortgage crisis, is close to being acquired by Bank of America for slightly more than $4 billion in stock, people briefed on the transaction said Thursday. 
 Directors for both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to be announced Friday, these people said. 
 Shareholders, however, may be disappointed with the price, which is nearly $500 million less than Countrywide's value on Thursday. Because it is an all-stock transaction, Countrywide investors will benefit if Bank of America stock rises, which it did yesterday.
 As the nation's largest mortgage lender, Countrywide helped fuel the housing boom by offering loans to high-risk borrowers. But as home prices began dropping last year and borrower defaults soared, Countrywide's lending practices came under the spotlight of legislators, regulators and consumer advocates. 
 With financial pressures mounting, Countrywide's stock price collapsed in 2007, falling 80 percent, wiping out $20 billion in market value. Earlier this week, Countrywide's shares plummeted further as speculation about a bankruptcy filing roiled the market, a rumor the company denied. 
 Countrywide shares soared 51 percent, to $7.75 Thursday on news of a possible sale. The shares are down 83 percent from $45.26 last January.
 Both Bank of America, led by Kenneth D. Lewis, and Countrywide, overseen by Angelo R. Mozilo, declined to comment. But the people briefed on the deal said that negotiations had been going on for about a month.
 While a sale of Countrywide, based in Calabasas, Calif., is not expected to affect borrowers, it would underscore the complexities and financial challenges that have engulfed the mortgage industry -- from lax lending standards to loose regulatory oversight and the intersection of Main Street homeownership with Wall Street financial engineering. 
 ''Bank of America has always wanted a larger presence in mortgage banking and Ken Lewis has also said that they would wait to buy until blood is running in the streets,'' said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners in New York. ''Mozilo must have thought there was a chance Countrywide wouldn't survive.''
 Almost 150 mortgage lenders failed last year and 43 were acquired by healthier institutions, according to Mortgagedaily.com. Banks and brokerage firms have also suffered steep losses, and several chief executives have been forced out. 
 As defaults have surged, investors who once flocked to risky mortgage loans for their higher yields have shunned them. Troubles in the housing market have also generated larger concerns about the economy as a whole and the possibility that the country may enter a recession.
 News of the possible sale came a day after Countrywide disclosed that 7.2 percent of the loans in its servicing portfolio were delinquent last month, up from 4.6 percent in December 2006. Foreclosures also more than doubled last month, to 1.44 percent of unpaid principal balances versus 0.70 percent in December 2006. 
 For Bank of America buying Countrywide is a bet that it can salvage its $2 billion investment in a preferred stock issued by the company in August; Bank of America paid $18 a share for a 16 percent stake. 
 But Countrywide's problems have only worsened, leaving Bank of America with big losses. On Thursday, shares of Bank of America rose 56 cents, to $39.30.
 Although the terms of the deal are unclear, if the sale goes through Bank of America would be taking on significant legal liabilities stemming from Countrywide's lending practices. 
 Countrywide Credit Industries opened for business in New York City in 1969, the creation of Mr. Mozilo, a butcher's son from the Bronx, and David Loeb, a founder of a mortgage banking firm. The company became the nation's largest lender in the early 1990s. By last year, it had become a $500 billion home loan lender with 900 offices and $200 billion in assets. Mr. Loeb died in 2003. 
 In addition to originating mortgages, Countrywide is the largest servicer of them, overseeing the administration of $1.4 trillion worth of loans. The company also has a bank overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision; an insurance unit; a subsidiary that provides borrowers with loan closing services like appraisals and flood certifications; and a broker-dealer that trades securities. It employs 51,000 people.
 Countrywide showed spectacular growth in both earnings and share price over the years. But in recent months it became clear that its growth was fueled by increasingly loose lending practices. Last year, even as defaults rose, the company was slow to recognize that it needed to change its business practices and lend more conservatively. 
 In August, as financial markets froze on fears that the subprime mortgage woes were spreading into other parts of the economy, Countrywide was forced to draw down all of its $11.5 billion credit line. 
 ''Countrywide has been a rogue lender with a rogue leader,'' said Martin Eakes, chief executive of the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group. ''Bank of America would be a responsible home for fixing the problems that Countrywide has created.''
 Through acquisitions, Bank of America has transformed itself from a small regional bank into a national powerhouse. In 2003, for example, it paid $48 billion for FleetBoston Financial, which gave it the most branches, customers and checking accounts of any United States bank. In 2005, Bank of America became the biggest credit card issuer when it bought MBNA for $35 billion. 
 By purchasing Countrywide, Bank of America would combine its 5,800 branches with the mortgage lender's coast-to-coast network, helping Mr. Lewis achieve his goal of becoming the biggest player in every major consumer finance category. 
 If the deal goes through, Bank of America would brush up against a federal cap that prevents a bank holding company from controlling more than 10 percent of the nation's deposits. Because Countrywide Bank is a federally insured savings and loan, the rule does not apply.
 Seeking to ease any regulatory concerns, representatives for the companies were in Washington on Thursday to brief regulators.
 Mr. Mozilo is expected to remain as chief executive of Countrywide until the deal closes, probably in the third quarter, people briefed on the transaction said. After that, he would serve on a transition team and would remain with the combined company on an interim basis.
 He could be entitled to an exit package of roughly $72 million. That would be on top of the $410 million in pay, including $285 million in option gains, that Mr. Mozilo has taken home since he became Countrywide's chief executive in 1999.
 Selling Countrywide gets Mr. Mozilo out of a tightening financial vise. But doing so at a stock price below $10 is certainly not what he probably envisioned. Indeed, just last March, as the subprime crisis was starting to unfold, Mr. Mozilo crowed that Countrywide would benefit from the spreading mess. ''This will be great for Countrywide,'' he told an interviewer, ''because at the end of the day, all of the irrational competitors will be gone.''

HEADLINE: Clinton to Seek Package to Lift Confidence in Economy

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Adjusting her campaign to address increased fears of a recession, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that she would call for quick enactment of a $70 billion emergency spending package and for a possible $40 billion tax rebate later if economic conditions worsen.
 Mrs. Clinton said her proposal, to be announced on Friday in California, would aid lower-income families facing foreclosures of their mortgages, subsidize home heating assistance, extend jobless benefits and create jobs in the energy and environment sector. 
 ''I have been looking at the latest unemployment numbers, and I really think it is imperative that we start to move to help people dealing with the housing market and give the country a jolt of confidence in the economy,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a telephone interview while campaigning in Nevada. 
 She added that she ''absolutely'' believed that it was possible for Democrats in Congress to work with the Bush administration to enact a stimulus package early this year, despite the rising discord of the presidential campaign.
 ''There is clearly room for bipartisan cooperation,'' she said, adding that Mr. Bush appeared to be looking ''more at the tax code'' as a way of lifting the economy while her package would provide a mix of spending increases and tax relief.
 The plan from Mrs. Clinton, Democrat of New York, is the first specific stimulus package to be proposed by a presidential candidate from either party, or by a Democratic leader in Congress, but it is not likely to be the last. Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has signaled that House Democrats will propose their own stimulus package when they return to Washington next week. Senate Democratic leaders are tentatively talking about something similar. 
 Brendan Daly, Ms. Pelosi's spokesman, said Thursday that her proposal had yet to be worked out but that it would be ''temporary, timely and targeted'' to the middle class, a phrase that has gained currency among many Democrats as they prepare for likely Republican attacks on them as profligate spenders.
 President Bush has said he is studying the possibility of a stimulus package that Republicans say would most likely emphasize tax cuts rather than spending. They say Mr. Bush will probably not decide whether to make such a proposal or settle on details until later this month.
 Mrs. Clinton has also called for increased spending on energy, housing and other needs over the next several years, paid for by savings elsewhere. But her stimulus package would not be financed by tax increases or other spending cuts. 
 ''One of the cornerstones of our presidential campaign is that every new initiative must be paid for,'' said Neera Tanden, Mrs. Clinton's policy director. ''But fiscal stimulus is the exception to that rule. The principle is that the spending should be temporary and not add to long-term deficits.''
 The campaign has been discussing the stimulus package for more than six weeks, said Gene B. Sperling, a senior economic adviser to the campaign who directed domestic policy at the White House under President Bill Clinton. ''After the job numbers went negative last week, she decided the case for action was strong enough,'' Mr. Sperling said. 
 Others in Mrs. Clinton's campaign have said that she hopes to capitalize on her victory in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday over Senator Barack Obama of Illinois by returning to more substantive policy themes in an effort to show a depth of experience in government.
 The Clinton package is to include $30 billion for an ''emergency housing crisis fund'' for states to help low-income families unable to make mortgage payments and in danger of losing their houses. Last year she proposed $5 billion for such a fund.
 In addition, Mrs. Clinton's package would channel $25 billion to help low-income families pay heating bills this winter, a tenfold increase of the existing federal program. Her proposal would also include $10 billion to extend unemployment insurance for people unable to find jobs.
 Another $5 billion would go for alternative energy programs like home weatherization and low-emission automobiles. In November, Mrs. Clinton proposed $15 billion for such programs over several years, but the new proposal would move up part of that for this year.
 Ms. Tanden, the Clinton policy director, said the $40 billion tax rebate would be put together but not take effect unless economic circumstances worsened. This is similar to a proposal by Martin Feldstein, a professor of economics at Harvard and a former economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan.
 Like other Democratic presidential candidates, Ms. Clinton has called for tax cuts enacted in 2001 to expire or be rescinded for families making $250,000 or more a year. She has called for the revenues to be used for health care.

HEADLINE: Calls Grow for Bloomberg to Make Up His Mind

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and RAY RIVERA; Jonathan P. Hicks contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Nearly every day a tiny new development trickles out from the stealth presidential campaign of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire mayor of New York.
 He has talked with Chuck Hagel and Sam Nunn, potential running mates. He has delivered a tart critique of the presidential field. He is conducting intricate polling to test his appeal in all 50 states.
 Mr. Bloomberg's dalliance with the idea of running for president has stretched on and on, with his enthusiastic approval despite the public denials. But even before actually entering the contest, Mr. Bloomberg may have already risked losing something: people's patience.
 The political parlor game -- Will he run? When will he decide? How much could he spend? -- that has so delighted Mr. Bloomberg is suddenly sparking a backlash. Editorial pages from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Post, The Village Voice and The New Yorker have taken him to task. Members of the administration have been rolling their eyes and referring to Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's political architect, as the deputy mayor for presidential politics. 
 And a recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University found that 61 percent of New Yorkers thought Mr. Bloomberg had a ''moral obligation'' to serve out his full term. The survey, of 1,162 New York City voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, also found that while 16 percent wanted to see him run for president rather than for governor, 32 percent did not want him to run for either office.
 ''People might be saying, 'C'mon, do your job,'<0>'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the polling institute at Quinnipiac. ''Maybe people are thinking, 'Look, it's such a long shot; why don't you think about what to do about traffic congestion in Bay Ridge?'<0>''
 Others offered a blunter assessment.
 ''It's a very long prelude, and I think it is becoming a very old story very fast,'' said Robert Zimmerman, a communications specialist who is one of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's fund-raisers. ''Mike Bloomberg has failed to make a case that he represents an independent movement, as opposed to a former Democratic liberal, former Republican, former Bush-backer running a campaign of opportunism.''
 To be sure, there is little indication that ordinary voters around the country have given much thought to a Bloomberg candidacy, especially given the dramatic primary races in the two major parties. But his enormous wealth and willingness to spend it make him someone who cannot be ignored within the political world. 
 At this point, the fatigue with Mr. Bloomberg's national ambitions seems highest within the political chattering class, but it could spread if the mayor continues to dance around his intentions without saying clearly what they are, analysts said. The speculation began in earnest last June, when he switched his registration from Republican to independent.
 ''With the way that he's playing this right now, it features all the things that we like least about Michael Bloomberg,'' said David S. Birdsell, dean of the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College. ''It features him as the testy, hard-to-satisfy critic of candidates who are already in the race, and it buttresses, the longer this goes on, the aloof critic role we might associate with a billionaire above the political fray rather than the dedicated politician and competent manager.''
 Adding to the potential for national ennui, Mr. Birdsell said, was ''the very long and frustrating Fred Thompson dance over the summer,'' which reduced the tolerance for indecision.
 ''That is going to make everybody considerably more focused on getting him to declare and to not have an erosion of enthusiasm that Fred Thompson experienced,'' he said.
 Closer to home, though, the impatience is already palpable, and could grow as the city's economic situation turns more dire. After five years of ballooning surpluses, the Independent Budget Office last week projected a $3.1 billion deficit in 2009 and $4.6 billion in 2010, driven by the housing slump and softening Wall Street profits.
 ''There's been a sea change where we're moving into choppier fiscal waters that we haven't had to navigate before,'' said Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president. With the convergence of what is shaping up to be a painful budget process this month and the presidential campaign calendar, he said, ''they're going to have to show their cards.''
 ''He has this great political good will,'' he said, ''but this is the day-to-day work of being the mayor and it's going to be hard to do the day-to-day work while slipping off to Oklahoma, unless we New Yorkers know what the program is.''
 George Arzt, a political consultant who was press secretary to Mayor Edward I. Koch, said that Mr. Bloomberg was risking the political fate of Mayor John V. Lindsay, whose 1972 presidential campaign took a hit when Brooklyn's powerful Democratic Party boss, Meade H. Esposito, urged him to end his cross-country campaigning and address the city's growing economic ills.
 In a comment that was splashed across front pages at the time, Mr. Esposito said, ''Little Sheba better come home.''
 ''There are people who have been watching Kevin Sheekey for a long time doing what he's doing now,'' Mr. Arzt said, adding that they wonder, ''What's the endgame?''
 Stu Loeser, the mayor's chief spokesman, said that he did not worry about New Yorkers becoming frustrated with Mr. Bloomberg's handling of his national ambitions, and that the speculation helped bring Mr. Bloomberg more attention to advance his agenda in Washington and elsewhere.
 ''I'm not sure that increased speculation or increased elevation is harmful,'' he said. ''We spent part of the day in Albany yesterday, and judging from reaction of the rank-and-file members that we met with, it seemed that they were more focused on what the mayor had to say than less.'' 
 And others played down the notion that Mr. Bloomberg was sowing ill will because the city is largely perceived to be well run.
 ''I find just as many people who like that he's a big star as are concerned that he's out of town too much,'' said Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a likely candidate for mayor in 2009 who represents parts of Brooklyn and Queens. ''Now, obviously, you don't want to be caught giving a speech in California if the streets are clogged with snow in Queens, but so far, so good.''
 Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College polls tracking New York politics, said he does not believe frustration will grow over Mr. Bloomberg's denials of interest in the presidency, mainly because there is not a groundswell of support for him to run.
 ''I'm thinking about when Mario Cuomo was hemming and hawing for several years, and I think that was more frustrating for people because there was a huge support base for him to do it,'' Mr. Miringoff said. ''And that's not there right now for Bloomberg.''
 A WNBC/Marist poll of 505 registered voters released last week said 60 percent of New York State voters wanted a strong third political party, but only 27 percent said they thought Mr. Bloomberg should run and only 12 percent thought he would win.
 Whether momentum will build for his candidacy remains to be seen. Although there are several groups working to support an independent run this year, one of them, Unity08, is significantly scaling back its operations and stopping its project designed to help independent candidates get on the ballot. In a letter released to members Thursday,organizers said that they did not have enough members or money to get on the ballot in all 50 states and create an online convention to nominate a bipartisan ticket. 
 Two of their leaders, the letter said, were forming a committee to draft Mr. Bloomberg ''should the circumstances seem right.''

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger's Budget Includes 10% Cuts

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Faced with billions of dollars in deficits, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced a stark state budget on Thursday, including 10 percent cuts in most departments, early release for thousands of inmates and the closing of dozens of state parks. 
 The governor also declared a fiscal state of emergency, sending the Legislature into a special session for 45 days to find a way to make up the current deficit of $3.3 billion. 
 ''We are facing a very tough situation,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said before announcing his $141 billion budget, down $4 billion from last year.
 As in other heavily populated states, revenue in California has plummeted because of troubles in the housing market. The state is also making large debt payments from voter-approved bond measures and deficit spending. 
 The worst fiscal news may yet come. State projections show that the deficit will increase to $14.5 billion by summer 2009. 
 Few departments are spared in the governor's budget. Forty-five parks would be completely or partly closed, including those with redwoods, waterfronts and historical sites. Officials expect layoffs in some agencies. Among those losing their jobs are lifeguards on state beaches.
 Education, which generally counts for 40 percent of the budget, would lose $4 billion. The state's well-regarded university system would receive $109 million less than last year. 
 Perhaps the most controversial plan would reduce the crowded prisons by 22,000, a move that would involve early release and relaxed parole requirements to take effect as soon as this summer. 
 State prison officials said those releases, which would require approval by the Legislature, would not include anyone convicted of serious, violent or sex crimes or anyone who had been violent in prison. 
 Echoing the concerns of many lawmakers, Speaker Fabian Nunez of the Assembly said releasing prisoners could ''put the public at risk.'' Mr. Nunez, a Democrat, also questioned whether sharply reducing spending would be enough to right the fiscal ship.
 ''I think it's clear that cut and borrow is not working,'' he said, adding that tax increases were to be ''a last resort.''
 In his State of the State speech on Tuesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger used the budget squeeze as a justification to announce a proposed amendment to the State Constitution that would effectively cap annual spending and add budget-cutting powers for the governor. 
 He revisited that theme on Thursday, calling the crisis a ''historic opportunity'' to change the way California spends.
 ''I want everybody to understand that the economy is not the villain here,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said, noting that the state is losing $400 million to $600 million a month. ''The economy contributes a little bit to the problem. But the villain is the system itself, the budget system.''

HEADLINE: A New Clinton, Going Door to Door in Nevada, Asks for Help

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
The all-new, listening and accessible Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton took her message door to door on Thursday night in a heavily Hispanic working-class neighborhood near downtown Las Vegas. She knocked on doors with campaign workers, urging voters to caucus for her in the coming Democratic contest. 
 As moments go, the walk down the street of small lots and tidy houses was about as spontaneous as a 500-guest wedding. People along the block were told that she would be coming to the Clinton-friendly neighborhood, and live-news trucks outnumbered onlookers in the street. 
 Many residents still seemed thrilled to see Mrs. Clinton, as she expressed admiration for their homes and introduced small children to her daughter, Chelsea. 
 ''I need your help,'' Mrs. Clinton said again and again, at one point tapping on her heart with a closed hand. 
 Ray Kincaid seemed mildly shocked to be standing talking to a hoarse Mrs. Clinton in his neighbor's yard. 
 ''We're going to do everything we can to get a president who cares about the middle class,'' she told him.
 ''Cool, I appreciate that,'' said Mr. Kincaid, who is 20 and not registered to vote.
 A campaign worker pressed a caucus commitment form in his hand. 
 ''Uh, can I get a picture first?'' Mr. Kincaid asked. 
 Later, Mrs. Clinton repaired to a nearby Mexican restaurant, where she sat at a large round table and talked with residents over chips and salsa about housing foreclosures, which have hit Nevada worse than anywhere in the nation. 
 Mrs. Clinton said she would like to freeze interest rates for five years, and create a federal program that would help homeowners get ''through a bad time,'' to prevent foreclosures. Mrs. Clinton also said she believed ''we're slipping into a recession.''
 Both events, clearly intended to tap into Clark County's large Hispanic population, stood in stark contrast to Mrs. Clinton's last visit to Nevada, when she gave a stump speech from a stage far from supporters in a nature preserve and then departed majestically whence she came. 
 Mrs. Clinton came to Nevada, which holds its first major Democratic caucus on Jan. 19, with the help of local Democratic support and a one-day jump on her opponent Senator Barack Obama, who arrives Friday to begin campaigning here. The neighborhood where she sought votes is in the Assembly district of Ruben Kihuen, a kingmaker among Democrats.
 Although polls here are notoriously unreliable, and none have been conducted in weeks, Mrs. Clinton held a double-digit lead over Mr. Obama in the fall, though even her supporters believe that has eroded since she lost the Iowa caucuses before winning in New Hampshire five days later. 
 Mrs. Clinton's team is hoping that her new campaign style, appealing more directly to voters, will help her in Nevada, which for years was all but ignored by national candidates. 
 ''I'm very committed to reaching out and meeting the people in this state,'' Mrs. Clinton said. When asked about her teary-eyed moment in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton referred to having ''that connection and that empathy'' that might appeal to voters. 
 Mr. Obama has his own newfound advantages here. On Wednesday, he collected the much-coveted endorsement of the Culinary Workers Union, with its 60,000 members who are expected to convey voters to caucus sites while educating a much-confused population about how the caucuses will work.
 Mr. Obama has also gotten the nod from the local Service Employees International Union, a politically potent union that represents more than 17,500 people throughout the state. 
 Mr. Obama released an advertisement on Thursday in the Las Vegas and Reno markets that highlights his remarks at the Jefferson-Jackson dinner speech this month in Des Moines. Further, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who endorsed Mr. Obama on Thursday, called influential local reporters to try to diminish Mrs. Clinton's impact on the day of her arrival. 
 Mrs. Clinton tried to capitalize on being first to arrive at this new Democratic battleground. She received a warm reception at the packed Mexican restaurant, where supporters were turned away. 
 The crowd broke out into ''Hillary, Hillary!'' especially in response to lines like, ''All of our problems are interconnected, but we treat them as if one were guacamole and one were chips.''

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Lets Key Interest Rate Stand

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY and JULIA WERDIGIER; Carter Dougherty reported from Frankfurt, and Julia Werdigier from London.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday but signaled that it could raise it pre-emptively if generous wage deals threatened to ignite inflation.
 In a recognition that financial turmoil stemming from the United States mortgage market has not abated, the bank also announced that it would inject $20 billion into the financial system at the end of the month, making use of a currency swap agreement with the Federal Reserve for the second time in two months.
 The central bank's benchmark interest rate is 4 percent, where it has been since June 2007. The Bank of England also kept its key rate steady, at 5.5 percent, ignoring nudges from politicians to soften the blow of slowing growth. 
 Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, had pointed remarks for European labor unions, particularly those in Germany, which are gearing up for annual wage negotiations. Mr. Trichet warned in stark terms that the bank would respond with rate increases if rising energy and food prices passed through into wages, a phenomenon known as second-round effects on inflation.
 ''The pre-emptive aspect is fundamental,'' he said. ''Our message is that you have to know that we will not tolerate the start to second-round effects.''
 Mr. Trichet spoke after a meeting of the central bank's rate-setting body in Frankfurt, the first since the euro zone expanded to 15 members with the addition of Cyprus and Malta on Jan. 1.
 After nearly six months in which the bank's communication has focused on soothing jittery financial markets, Mr. Trichet broadened his remarks to include pointed references to companies and employees whose individual decisions across Europe will determine whether inflation rises. 
 He also explicitly called for the elimination of policies, still in effect in some parts of Europe, that index wages to inflation.
 ''The bank has made a conscious shift to focus more on wage and price-setters around the economy, and not only financial markets,'' said Julian Callow, chief Europe economist at Barclays Capital in London. ''They need to get that message out.''
 Inflation in the 15-nation euro area hit an annual rate of 3.1 percent in December, well above the central bank's target of just below 2 percent. That number reflects rising prices for food and oil, which hit $100 a barrel this month, but the central bank expects inflation will subside around midyear, provided the wage-price spiral the bank is warning against does not materialize.
 As the euro-zone economy has gathered steam over the last few years, the central bank has often issued tough warnings about wages early in the year, hoping that its threats of a rate increase avoid the need to actually do so.
 Despite rising concern that the United States is near or in a recession, Mr. Trichet played down fears of spillover effects in Europe.
 He said that ''the global economy will on balance remain resilient with a slowing in economic growth in the United States being mitigated by the continued strength of emerging market economies.''
 The European Central Bank did acknowledge for the first time in the initial paragraph of its opening statement -- its main vehicle for communicating with financial markets -- that the ''risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity are on the downside.'' But Mr. Trichet emphasized that despite the clouding outlook for growth, the bank was ''not neutral'' on the question of higher rates.
 ''If anything, they want us to believe right now that they might hike,'' said Audrey Childe-Freeman, chief Europe economist at CIBC World Markets in London. ''We have no indication that they might cut right now.''
 In putting dollars into credit markets, the central bank was joined by the Swiss National Bank, which will auction off $4 billion next week. The Fed already has similar moves planned, and Mr. Trichet said the action should help ease the logjam resulting from close trans-Atlantic financial integration.
 ''The opening of the market in New York could be a little bit under tension because of the demand and requests coming from European banks,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 In Britain, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, in an unusual hint to the British central bank, said this week that inflation there is among the lowest in the Group of 7 industrial nations, giving the Bank of England enough room to cut interest rates. Most economists expect a rate cut once the bank has more data on inflation trends. Inflation in Britain is running about 2 percent as the growth outlook remains murky because of soft consumer spending and falling housing prices.
 ''It was a close call, and it's highly likely that they will cut rates in February,'' said Amit Kara, an economist at UBS in London.

HEADLINE: Giant Write-Down Is Seen for Merrill

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch is expected to suffer $15 billion in losses stemming from soured mortgage investments, almost double its original estimate, prompting the firm to raise additional capital from an outside investor. 
 Merrill, the nation's largest brokerage firm, is expected to disclose the huge write-down when it reports earnings next week, according to people who have been briefed on its plans. The loss far exceeds the $12 billion hit many Wall Street analysts had forecast. 
 To shore up its deteriorating finances, Merrill is now in discussions with investors in the United States, Asia and the Middle East, including American private equity firms, to raise about $4 billion in the coming days, these people said. 
 The developments underscore the rising toll that the mortgage crisis is taking on many once-proud Wall Street banks. In recent months Merrill and several other firms have grabbed financial lifelines from wealthy foreign governments. Further investments by so-called sovereign wealth funds could prompt scrutiny by Congress. 
 The latest moves at Merrill come as John A. Thain, who became the company's chairman and chief executive in December, struggles to bolster the firm's capital, burnish its reputation and avoid the toxic internal battles that have hurt the firm in the past. 
 Mr. Thain, who won plaudits as head of the New York Stock Exchange, has wasted little time. After he took over last month, Merrill Lynch promptly sold a $5.6 billion stake to Temasek Holdings, which is controlled by the government of Singapore, and Davis Selected Advisers, a money management firm based in Tucson. 
 During a meeting in December in London, Mr. Thain told anxious employees that Merrill expected further losses after an $8.4 billion write-down in the third quarter. He also said the firm would require additional capital. He said the fourth quarter would be a ''very bad quarter,'' those attending recalled. 
 Mr. Thain has made clear that Merrill would not sell its 49 percent stake in BlackRock, the global money management firm. But he has said that Merrill is considering selling noncore assets like its stake in Bloomberg, the financial news and information company founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. In a research report, Brad Hintz, a securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that stake was worth about $4 billion. 
 Mr. Thain also said at the London meeting that Merrill's management style needed to change. Recalling his days as a co-president of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Thain said that he wanted employees to build consensus. 
 Among other things, that means Merrill will now pay fewer bonuses based on individual performance and instead focus on the performance of a team. Many employees received bonuses this week that included a greater portion of stock than in the past. 
 Merrill is hardly alone in seeking capital from overseas. United States financial institutions have raised more than $29 billion from foreign governments and their related investment entities, according to the market research firm Dealogic. 
 In recent months, the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, Singapore's lesser-known government fund, invested $9.7 billion in UBS; Citigroup sold a $7.5 billion stake to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority; and the China Investment Corporation poured $5 billion into Morgan Stanley.
 If a foreign government takes another big stake in Merrill, Congress might ratchet up its scrutiny of sovereign wealth funds, which have ballooned thanks to rising oil prices and booming emerging markets. 
 On Thursday, SenatorCharles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, expressed concern about the amount of money American financial institutions are contemplating raising from sovereign wealth funds. 
 ''Foreign investment, in general, strengthens our economy and creates jobs,'' Senator Schumer said. ''Because sovereign wealth funds, by definition, are potentially susceptible to noneconomic interests, the closer they come to exercising control and influence, the greater concerns we have.'' 
 So far, none of the foreign investors that have bought into United States banks have sought management roles. ''All have been very consciously structured to be passive,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell, who has worked on a number of these deals. ''None have asked for directors.'' 
 In addition to seeking funds from outside investors, which heavily dilutes the stakes of existing shareholders, Merrill Lynch has sought alternative ways to raise capital. In December, it agreed to sell most of its commercial finance business, Merrill Lynch Capital, to General Electric, raising about $1.3 billion in equity.
 Mr. Hintz, the securities analyst, suggested another option would be to reduce the firm's fixed-income business by a third, which would add about $3 billion in capital.
 He estimates that Merrill will write down its $27 billion of combined collateralized debt obligation and subprime-related exposures by $10 billion and report a loss of $5.10 a share for the fourth quarter. Any write-down above $20 billion, he said, would ''significantly increase leverage and would threaten the credit ratings of the firm.'' 
 During the London meeting, Mr. Thain said that Merrill would have to build its presence in China as well as expand its principal investing businesses, including private equity, commercial real estate and infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Forget Pundits, Giuliani Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani began running the following television commercial on Thursday in Florida, where he is competing most heavily, urging voters not to discount him based on news media coverage of his losses in Iowa and New Hampshire: 
 PRODUCER 08Media. 
 THE SCRIPT An announcer says: ''With pundits and politicos handicapping the campaign like the Super Bowl, it's easy to lose sight of what's at stake -- an economy in peril, a country at war, a future uncertain. The media loves process. Talking heads love chatter. But Florida has a chance to turn down the noise, and show the world that leadership is what really matters.'' Mr. Giuliani then says, ''I'm Rudy Giuliani, and I approved this message.''
 ON THE SCREEN An old-fashioned television set shows a rapid-cut montage of some of the best-known talking heads on television, like George Stephanopoulos, Chris Matthews and Bill O'Reilly, and the screen eventually breaks into six squares, as if the Brady Bunch had merged with CNN's Situation Room. Then the screen goes dark, and the television set shows charts of rising gasoline prices, black and white scenes of soldiers, and a girl nestling her head on a father. Then, after more shots of talking heads, the advertisement moves outside the box of the old-fashioned television and shows Mr. Giuliani, coming into focus, giving a speech. Then a fade to black, as the words of his slogan ''Tested. Ready. Now.'' appear one by one. Then back to Mr. Giuliani, and the words ''Rudy '08.''
 ACCURACY Studies have shown that campaign coverage during this election has been more focused on tactics, strategy and the horse race than the issues. And Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary showed that polls and pundits can be wrong. 
 SCORECARD With a sixth-place finish in Iowa, behind Representative Ron Paul of Texas, and a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire (only narrowly ahead of Mr. Paul), Mr. Giuliani has to persuade the voters of Florida not to count him out as a loser as he nearly disappears from news coverage of the race, which is focusing on the winners in Iowa and New Hampshire and the coming contests in Michigan and South Carolina, where Mr. Giuliani is not making a major effort. He focuses on the two issues -- security and fiscal matters -- that have been at the core of his campaign. But the advertisement seems to go further than Mr. Giuliani does on the stump when it describes the economy as being ''in peril,'' which may signal that he is going to try to tap into the growing economic anxiety of many voters.

HEADLINE: Former U.N. Chief Will Try To Resolve Crisis in Kenya

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Kennedy Abwao contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
With no sign of a breakthrough in the Kenyan political crisis, it appears that a high-profile mediator may be flying in to help: Kofi Annan.
 The African Union announced on Thursday that Mr. Annan, the former secretary general of the United Nations, was taking over the role played by President John Kufuor of Ghana, who is also the chairman of the African Union. 
 Mr. Kufuor spent the past two days in Kenya trying to broker a truce between the government and opposition leaders to end the crisis here, which erupted after flawed elections last month and left hundreds dead from violence. Mr. Kufuor failed to get the two sides even to meet, but he insisted that all was not lost.
 ''Both sides agreed there should be an end to the violence, and they also agreed there should be dialogue,'' he said.
 Mr. Annan will lead a panel of African dignitaries who are coming to try to bring the two sides together, Mr. Kufuor said.
 There was no immediate comment from Mr. Annan about the new role, but Ban Ki-moon, his successor at the United Nations, views the choice as a ''positive development'' and called Mr. Annan on Thursday morning to express his ''strong support,'' Mr. Ban's spokeswoman said.
 Many diplomats here are pessimistic that a solution will be found anytime soon because neither Mwai Kibaki, Kenya's president, nor Raila Odinga, the top opposition leader, is budging. Both claim to have won the presidential election on Dec. 27. Western observers have said that there was widespread evidence that the president's party interfered with the vote tallying process and rigged the results to stay in power. 
 Mr. Kibaki has moved ahead with unilaterally naming cabinet members, which opposition leaders called a ''slap in the face'' and which American officials called disappointing.
 On Thursday, opposition leaders said Mr. Kibaki refused to sign an agreement that had been approved by the World Bank that recommended a transitional government and an investigation into the election results. World Bank officials in Kenya did not return phone calls. Alfred Mutua, a Kenyan government spokesman, said that the document had been prepared by World Bank officials and that the president rejected it because it was ''meant to favor certain groups.''
 Both the government and opposition leaders, who have blamed each other for the surprise burst of bloodletting in such a stable country as Kenya, are now blaming each other for the lack of progress in negotiations.
 ''The government had offered dialogue, which was to be facilitated by President John Kufuor, but Orange Democratic Movement leaders have not been responsive,'' a government statement said, referring to Mr. Odinga's political movement.
 Salim Lone, an Odinga spokesman, said: ''The government was obviously never serious about negotiations. To tell you the truth, we're getting discouraged.''

HEADLINE: FED CHIEF SIGNALS ECONOMY NEEDS MORE RATE CUTS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Presenting a bleak picture of a deteriorating national economy, Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, strongly suggested on Thursday that the Fed would cut interest rates soon, perhaps by a large amount.
 ''The outlook for real activity in 2008 has worsened,'' Mr. Bernanke said after describing all the forces dragging down the economy. ''We stand ready to take substantive additional actions as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.'' 
 With fears rising that the economy is sliding into recession, Mr. Bernanke's blunt assessment is expected to encourage politicians to call on Congress to take steps that would stimulate growth beyond what the Fed can achieve through lower interest rates. 
 Many analysts now expect the Fed's policy makers to cut half a percentage point off the Fed's benchmark interest rate, reducing it to 3.75 when they next meet, on Jan. 29 and 30. They expect the Fed to continue cutting, to 3 percent or even lower by summer, to prevent -- or at least mitigate -- a recession. The goal would be to get people to borrow and spend more. 
 Consumer spending, however, may already have hit a wall. Shortly before Mr. Bernanke spoke, at a Washington luncheon, the nation's biggest retailers announced that holiday sales gains were the weakest in the last five years. Only Wal-Mart gained ground, after it slashed prices to draw jittery consumers.
 ''Bernanke should have made this commitment to cut rates aggressively two or three months ago,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''Will it be enough? It will be close. With aggressive rate cuts, some fiscal stimulus and a bit of luck, maybe we'll avoid a recession.''
 The stock market responded with uncertainty at first to Mr. Bernanke's remarks, but then chalked up solid gains. The Dow Jones industrial average surged as he spoke, then fell back, then rose again, closing up nearly 1 percent, to 12,853.09.
 Encouraged by other developments as well, including reports that the nation's largest mortgage lender was about to be acquired by Bank of America, traders apparently concluded that the Fed was at last committed to a more vigorous effort to lift the economy, and to reverse the recent slide in stock prices, which often go up in response to rate cuts. 
 ''Maybe the Fed and the market are not quite on the same page yet,'' said Richard Berner, co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, ''but they are getting a lot closer.''
 Mr. Bernanke's gloomy assessment of the economy represented a turning point for the Fed. Until now, most of the Fed's top policy makers, starting with Mr. Bernanke, had spoken publicly of their ''uncertainty'' about what lay ahead. They have cut their benchmark interest rate, the federal funds rate, by a full percentage point since mid-September in response to the credit crisis and the housing downturn. 
 But they accompanied each cut with a statement that stopped well short of declaring that the economy was clearly in trouble.
 Evidence of deterioration has accumulated, however, since the policy makers' last public statement in mid-December. Within the last week, the Labor Department has reported a sharp jump in the unemployment rate; AT&T said that a number of customers were not paying their bills; American Express reported weaker spending by its cardholders; and the nation's retailers released their disappointing holiday sales figures. 
 Acknowledging the evidence, President Bush, speaking in Chicago on Monday, said the nation faces ''economic challenges'' and ''we cannot take growth for granted.'' 
 The mounting evidence has suggested to a growing number of economists and politicians that the Fed by itself cannot stem the economic slide and that Congress must help with fiscal policy in the form of a tax rebate for low-income families, extended unemployment insurance or some other subsidy. 
 Without addressing the growing demands for fiscal stimulus, Mr. Bernanke devoted most of his talk, at a forum sponsored by Women in Housing and Finance and the Exchequer Club, to a review of the economic damage, which he said had increased in recent weeks.
 Housing starts and new-home sales are off 50 percent from their peaks, he said. Foreclosures are rising, and so is the number of households behind on their mortgages. In the financial markets, the subprime shock ''has contributed to a considerable increase in investor uncertainty,'' he reported, adding that the Fed is seeing ''considerable evidence that the banks have become more restrictive in their lending to firms and households.''
 Offering an explanation for the Fed's reluctance to act more aggressively sooner, Mr. Bernanke said that economic growth seemed ''to have continued at a moderate pace'' until recently, when new information increasingly indicated that ''the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced.''
 The Fed, Mr. Bernanke said, had counted on an expanding job market to ''support moderate growth'' in consumer spending. But the government reported Friday that hiring had fallen almost to zero in December and the unemployment rate had jumped to 5 percent from 4.7 percent -- a rare one-month surge that almost always indicates coming hard times.
 ''It would be a mistake to read too much into any one report,'' Mr. Bernanke said of the jobs report. ''However, should the labor market deteriorate, the risks to consumer spending would rise.'' 
 In a 13-page speech, the Fed chairman devoted only one paragraph to the risk of inflation, although some of his colleagues at the central bank have cited inflationary pressures as a reason to go easy on rate cuts. Mr. Bernanke acknowledged these concerns but clearly put them on the back burner.
 ''Thus far,'' he said, ''inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well anchored, and pressures on resource utilization have diminished.''
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had successfully pumped money to banks and other lenders damaged in the mortgage crisis. Lending to banks directly from the Fed's discount window, he said, had not worked as well as auctioning fixed multibillion-dollar sums. 
 Among other advantages, he explained, the auctions gave the Fed greater control over how much money was entering the financial system and the effect on interest rates. The auctions, he said, ''may thus become a useful permanent addition to the Fed's toolbox.''
 In his speech, Mr. Bernanke carefully avoided any discussion of a recession, which would be an extended period of contracting economic activity and falling employment. But some economists argue that such a downturn may be unavoidable -- or already have started -- despite the Fed's recent efforts to contain the damage from the housing collapse and credit market turmoil. 
 ''However much the Fed cuts rates between now and the spring,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Global Insights, ''the die is cast for a pretty rough six months and a very high risk of recession.'' 
 Asked about the possibility of a recession, Mr. Bernanke sidestepped the question. As a Princeton University economist before he came to Washington, he said, he had served on a committee charged with setting the official starting and ending dates of each recession.
 ''You really cannot make a determination,'' he said with a sly grin, ''until well after the event.''

HEADLINE: Civil Rights Tone Prompts Talk of an Endorsement

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, said he was rethinking his neutral stance in his state's presidential primary out of disappointment at comments by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton that he saw as diminishing the historic role of civil rights activists.
 Mr. Clyburn, a veteran of the civil rights movement and a power in state Democratic politics, put himself on the sidelines more than a year ago to help secure an early primary for South Carolina, saying he wanted to encourage all candidates to take part. But he said recent remarks by the Clintons that he saw as distorting civil rights history could change his mind.
 ''We have to be very, very careful about how we speak about that era in American politics,'' said Mr. Clyburn, who was shaped by his searing experiences as a youth in the segregated South and his own activism in those days. ''It is one thing to run a campaign and be respectful of everyone's motives and actions, and it is something else to denigrate those. That bothered me a great deal.'' 
 In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Mrs. Clinton, who was locked in a running exchange with Senator Barack Obama, a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, over the meaning of the legacies of President John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., tried to make a point about presidential leadership. 
 ''Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964,'' Mrs. Clinton said in trying to make the case that her experience should mean more to voters than the uplifting words of Mr. Obama. ''It took a president to get it done.''
 Quickly realizing that her comments could draw criticism, Mrs. Clinton returned to the subject at a later stop, recalling how Dr. King was beaten and jailed and how he worked with Johnson to pass the landmark law. Clinton advisers said her first remark had not captured what she meant to convey. And they said she would never detract from a movement that has driven her own public service.
 ''She has spent the majority of her life working for poor families, poor children, fighting for the principles that Martin Luther King stood for,'' said Minyon Moore, a senior adviser. ''The Clintons have a track record.''
 Mr. Clyburn, reached for a telephone interview Wednesday during an overseas inspection of port facilities, also voiced frustration with Mr. Clinton, who has described Mr. Obama's campaign narrative as a fairy tale. Mr. Clinton was not directly discussing civil rights, but Mr. Clyburn saw the remark as a slap at the image of a black candidate running on a theme of unity and optimism.
 ''To call that dream a fairy tale, which Bill Clinton seemed to be doing, could very well be insulting to some of us,'' said Mr. Clyburn, who said he and others took significant risks more than 40 years ago to produce such opportunities for future black Americans.
 The fight for the black vote in the state primary has been under way for months. One legacy Mrs. Clinton had hoped to inherit from Mr. Clinton was his strong support among black voters. Even after Mr. Obama's entry into the race, Mrs. Clinton did not give up hope of winning a substantial share of the African-American vote. She worked hard to win endorsements from prominent black leaders like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a highly respected civil rights activist, even as her opponent won celebrity backing from Oprah Winfrey. 
 After Mrs. Clinton lost to Mr. Obama in Iowa, even her top supporters judged the South Carolina Democratic primary, set for Jan. 26, to be out of reach. Representatives of both campaigns were virtually ceding much of an African-American voting bloc that could represent half of the primary electorate to Mr. Obama by virtue of his strong victory in Iowa.
 But Mrs. Clinton's triumph in New Hampshire on Tuesday restored some sense of competitiveness in the Democratic race in a state that also has a serious Republican rivalry under way. 
 As a result, Mr. Clyburn's stamp of approval could carry significant last-minute weight given his standing among African-Americans and his deep political connections throughout the state, as well as the role he played in winning the right for South Carolina to have the showdown.
 ''His influence would be extraordinary if he should endorse somebody,'' said Don Fowler, a longtime South Carolina Democratic activist and former national party chairman who is backing Mrs. Clinton. 
 Mr. Clyburn, who plays down the importance of personal endorsements, did not convince national party leaders to give South Carolina a coveted early primary slot in order to play kingmaker. He said he saw it as a way to bring millions of dollars to the state, showcase the tourism industry and rebuild a Democratic Party that has struggled in a state dominated by conservative Republicans.
 ''This is a real shot in the arm for us,'' said Mr. Clyburn, who is known for eager pursuit of economic benefits for the state and its minority population.
 He also helped promote three Democratic presidential debates in South Carolina, one at his alma mater, South Carolina State University, one at the Citadel and one still to come, in Myrtle Beach on Jan. 21. That event is sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus, and Mrs. Clinton could face questions there about her statement. 
 Last week, Mr. Clyburn spent a day in Charleston touring the Air Force base, a local charter school and a family support program to mark the first anniversary of his party's taking the majority in Congress and his own rise to the No. 3 party post in the House. He reveled in his accomplishments, those of a boy who was 13 when the public schools were ordered desegregated and who was discouraged by a customer at his mother's beauty shop from pursuing an interest in politics -- an interest she saw as out of reach for a black youth.
 Mr. Obama's allies in South Carolina said he surged there after his triumph in Iowa, which was seen as providing reassurance to black voters still skeptical of his ability to win over white voters. Mrs. Clinton's backers regained their hope after Tuesday's victory, but state analysts say they believe Mr. Obama has a significant advantage among blacks.
 ''I don't think Obama will be disappointed in South Carolina,'' said Cleveland Sellers, director of the African-American studies program at the University of South Carolina.
 Last week, Mr. Clyburn said his extended family was divided over the presidential choices, with a daughter in the Obama camp and a cousin aligned with John Edwards. He said he had found it difficult to stay out of the thick of things.
 ''It is very, very hard, no doubt about it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tide to Make Its Super Bowl Debut

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THEY say time and tide wait for no man, but Tide has waited a long time to be advertised on the Super Bowl. Soon, Tide, the biggest detergent brand in America -- sold by the biggest advertiser in America -- will appear for the first time on the biggest day for advertising in America.
 Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, has bought time during the Fox Broadcasting coverage of Super Bowl XLII on Feb. 3 for a commercial for the Tide to Go instant stain remover. The 30-second spot, by Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, is scheduled to appear in the game's second quarter. 
 Procter joins two dozen or so marketers, both well known and would-be, that are paying Fox a record or near-record amount to run commercials in the game. The average cost of each 30 seconds of commercial time is estimated at $2.7 million, compared with $2.6 million for spots in Super Bowl XLI in February 2007.
 Among the other advertisers are Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, FedEx, General Motors, PepsiCo, Toyota Motor and several movie studios. 
 Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, has sold all but one of the 63 30-second commercials that it plans to run in the game, a spokesman for Fox Sports, Lou D'Ermilio, said Thursday.
 Demand for commercial time in Super Bowl XLII was strong even before the writers' strike upended the prime-time schedules of the major networks and cast into doubt the fate of popular fare like ''C.S.I.,'' ''Grey's Anatomy'' and the broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony. As early as the end of October, Fox had only about seven of the 30-second spots in the Super Bowl left to sell. Usually at that time of year, there are two or three times that many slots still unsold.
 One reason for that appeal is robust demand for commercial time in all sports programming, Mr. D'Ermilio said, on Fox or not. High demand during the Major League Baseball season last year continued through the spate of college football bowl games that ended Monday with the Bowl Championship Series title game.
 Another reason for the ardor for Super Bowl spots is the magnitude of recent changes in the media marketplace. The Super Bowl is one of the few so-called big events that remain available to marketers eager to reach tens of millions of consumers at the same time; more than 90 million Americans typically watch each game.
 ''It's the last bastion of mass marketing, with incredible reach,'' said Jim Nail, chief strategy and marketing officer at Cymfony, a research company that is part of the TNS Media Intelligence unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
 ''If you've got to sell a lot of beer or chips, or you have something big to announce, it's a great venue,'' he added, despite steep costs that otherwise may be ''really hard to justify.''
 Viewers also respond to Super Bowl spots much differently than to commercials in most other TV shows.
 Ever since a spectacular Apple commercial called ''1984'' turned up during the 1984 Super Bowl, consumers have come to expect superior commercials, stuffed with celebrities, special effects, surprise endings, hit music, anthropomorphic animals and other enticements to pay attention.
 As a result, rather than change the channel or leave the room for a beer when the selling starts, the audience sticks around, talks about the spots the next day and even goes to Web sites like AOL and YouTube to watch them again.
 At every Super Bowl party, there is usually someone ''who says, 'Shhhhhhh! Here comes this cool commercial,'<0>'' Mr. Nail said.
 It is that buzz factor Procter is hoping to capitalize on.
 ''The Super Bowl is the one time you watch a show and don't want to miss the commercial breaks,'' said Suzanne Watson, Tide brand manager for North America at Procter in Cincinnati.
 ''Given the wide appeal for Tide to Go and the broad audience for the Super Bowl,'' she added, ''it's a perfect fit.''
 Tide to Go, which was introduced in 2005, is particularly fitting for a Super Bowl berth, Ms. Watson said, because of its properties as a quick stain remover.
 ''There are thousands of parties that night,'' making Super Bowl Sunday ''the biggest stain-based occasion of the year,'' she added. ''With Tide to Go right there, you don't have to get up to clean your shirt or pants.''
 One reason this year's Super Bowl has become more desirable for Procter than Super Bowl X or even XX is the growing number of women who tune in the game. In some years, more women have watched the Super Bowl than the Oscars, a show with such potent female appeal that it has been nicknamed on Madison Avenue ''the Super Bowl for women.''
 Another reason is that Procter has started seeking Tide buyers beyond the traditional market of women, adding pitches aimed at men and students of both sexes. 
 The Tide to Go commercial will be supported by a wide-ranging marketing campaign, Ms. Watson said, that will include the Internet, public relations and promotions.
 Such nontraditional elements ''can really connect with consumers outside the laundry room,'' she added, ''and in their daily lives.''
 Ms. Watson declined to discuss details of the campaign or the commercial because, she said, it was too soon.
 The Tide to Go commercial is only Procter's third in the Super Bowl. The first, for Charmin bathroom tissue, ran in 2004. The second, in 2006, was for Gillette, which Procter had acquired months before.
 The initial Procter foray into the Super Bowl -- in a commercial created by another Publicis agency in New York, Publicis Worldwide -- drew mostly negative reviews. It was one of only two spots that Bob Garfield, the ad critic for the trade publication Advertising Age, slighted with 1.5 stars; he gave lower scores to just two spots and higher scores to 31.
 ''We haven't been focused on how this TV spot will measure relative to others,'' Ms. Watson said. ''We just want to do the best in communicating with our consumers.'' 
 Translation from marketing-speak: The pressure is on.

HEADLINE: A Long-Dry California River Gets, and Gives, New Life

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: INDEPENDENCE, Calif. 

 BODY:
What Los Angeles took a century ago -- a 62-mile stretch of river here in the parched Owens Valley -- it is now giving back.
 One of the largest river-restoration projects in the country has sent a gentle current of water meandering through what just a year ago was largely a sandy, rocky bed best used as a horse trail and barely distinguishable from the surrounding high desert scrub.
 Mud hens dive for food. A blue heron sweeps overhead. Bass, carp and catfish patrol deep below. Some local residents swear they have even seen river otters. 
 So much reedy tule has sprouted along the banks, like bushy tufts of hair, that officials have called in a huge floating weed whacker, nicknamed the Terminator, to cut through it and help keep the water flowing -- a problem inconceivable in years past.
 The river, 2 to 3 feet deep and 15 to 20 feet across, will not be mistaken for the mighty Mississippi. And an economic boon promised to accompany the restoration has yet to materialize.
 Yet the mere fact that water is present and flowing in the Lower Owens River enthralls residents nearly 100 years after Los Angeles diverted the river into an aqueduct and sent it 200 miles south to slake its growing thirst.
 ''This is infinitely better than before,'' said Keith Franson, a kayaker pumping up his boat on the banks this week and preparing to explore a stretch of the renewed river. ''You got birds, herons, terns, all sorts of wildlife coming back in because life is coming back in the river.''
 Francis Pedneau, a lifelong Owens Valley resident who had sparred with Los Angeles city officials over access to fishing sites, said word was spreading among fishing enthusiasts about new spots along the river. Mr. Pedneau said he had actually caught fewer bass this past season, ''probably because the schools are more spread out now.''
 But Mr. Pedneau, 69, has praise for the project, even though he, like many old-timers, is generally suspicious of Los Angeles, given the tension-filled history behind its acquiring water and land here (the inspiration for the 1974 movie ''Chinatown'').
 ''The river didn't look anything like it does now,'' he said. ''I never thought I would live long enough to see this.''
 Los Angeles officials are in a celebratory mood. Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa plans to come here next month when engineers temporarily step up the flow as part of regular maintenance. 
 The flow is carefully controlled, kept at a minimum of 40 cubic feet per second, well above the 5 cubic feet per second in the parts that had still managed to have something of a stream after the river was diverted.
 Los Angeles agreed to restore the river as part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the Owens Valley Committee, a local group, and the Sierra Club over what it called the excessive pumping of groundwater in the valley in the 1970s and 1980s to increase drinking water supplies beyond what the city was taking from the river.
 Under the settlement, Los Angeles, working with Inyo County on the $24 million project, has also taken steps to restore the cottonwoods, willows and wetlands that flourished along the river decades ago and drew an array of wildlife.
 Near the river's delta, the released water is recaptured, with most of it used to control dust on Owens Lake, which the diversion had dried up, and the rest sent back into the aqueduct and on to Los Angeles.
 The city still gets about 50 percent of its water, including groundwater, from the valley, down about a third in the past several years because of environmental obligations like the river restoration. 
 Mr. Villaraigosa, who has promised to patch up relations with the Owens Valley, said ending litigation and reviving the river sent an important message.
 ''By releasing this water, we are demonstrating our commitment to environmental stewardship and a new era in terms of our relationship with Owens River residents,'' he said. ''We can't claim the mantle of the cleanest, greenest big city in America if we continue to degradate the environment in places like the Owens Valley.''
 Not all disputes are settled.
 The Owens Valley Committee and the Sierra Club, while largely pleased so far, said they would like to see Los Angeles more closely monitor the wildlife and habitat making a comeback. Better management of the burgeoning ecosystem, they say, will ensure its success.
 ''We will have concerns if certain species that should be here are not returning,'' said Mike Prather, a birder and a committee member.
 Brian Tillemans, who manages the project for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said it was working on a plan. But the department generally prefers a ''build a habitat and they will come'' approach, Mr. Tillemans said, which costs less and allows nature to take the lead.
 ''The best we can do is optimize the habitat, and nature will take its course,'' Mr. Tillemans said. Within three years, he said, trees will line the banks, drawing more wildlife and naturally controlling weeds and underbrush.
 One species locals hope to see more of is humans.
 Some businesses have noticed a slight increase in people coming to see or play on the river, and the Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce, one of the larger business development groups here, plans to revise its tourist guide to play up the restoration. 
 ''People are starting to come at odd times of the year, like now, to visit, but what we look forward to is it making a great deal of difference in the long term,'' said Kathleen New, the chamber president and a lifelong resident.
 ''Right now, it's a lot of local people going out and getting wet and acting foolish,'' Ms. New said. ''It's marvelous.''
 Mr. Franson, the kayaker, prepared to launch his inflated boat. Some forays have been long, he said, and others cut short by the tule, but they were all a pleasure.
 ''I may just get around the corner and I'm stuck,'' he said. ''But, look, this was completely dry not long ago and now it is not.''

HEADLINE: Oil Is Blamed For Widening Trade Deficit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Record oil prices widened the United States trade deficit in November as the cost of imported petroleum outpaced a modest rise in exports.
 The gap between what Americans import and export grew 9.3 percent, to $63.12 billion, the biggest deficit in 14 months, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Imported oil accounted for more than half of the total. 
 Export sales rose again in November, by 0.4 percent, to a record $142.3 billion, but decelerated from a 0.9 percent increase in October. 
 Export sales have accelerated in recent months on the back of a record-low dollar, as foreigners seek bargains. Some economists say foreign demand has kept the American economy from slowing more substantially as domestic business suffers from the housing downturn. 
 A slowdown in export growth may be troubling in light of the increasingly bearish forecasts for this year's economy. But the drop-off may be temporary; the trade deficit shrank in September to its lowest level in two years, and November's data was strongly influenced by the record-high price of crude oil.
 Crude petroleum imports jumped 17.3 percent in a month when oil approached $100 a barrel. The increase, which capped a 12-month period in which oil imports rose 58.8 percent, pushed total import sales up 3 percent, to $205.4 billion. 
 Import prices were unchanged in December, according to a separate Labor Department report Friday, down from a 3.3 percent increase in November.
 The October trade deficit was revised lower, to $57.7 billion, a drop of about $50 million, the government said.
 The trade deficit with China through November was $237.5 billion. The November deficit with China dipped slightly to $24 billion, down from a record $25.9 billion. 
 China reported Friday that its trade surplus with the world through December rose 47.7 percent, to $262.2 billion, with the December surplus at $22.7 billion, up 9.5 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: In an Ancient Culture, America's Team Takes Root

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

DATELINE: ACOMA PUEBLO, N.M. 

 BODY:
To the north, the Sky City casino draws truckers off Interstate 40 with its billboard advertisements promising loose slots and low limits. 
 To the south, the towering sandstone mesa attracts tourists to a reservation without electricity or running water, with houses made from adobe clay and a church built in 1629. 
 Gilbert Concho, a 60-year-old master potter and spiritual elder of the Acoma tribe here, navigates these worlds. In his house, halfway between the traditions on the reservation and the new economy of the casino, he has transformed a spare bedroom into a shrine to the Dallas Cowboys.
 It appears to have been designed by the team's owner, Jerry Jones, himself: 40 Cowboys T-shirts, 15 pairs of socks, a dozen hats, 10 jackets, 2 blankets, a wine bottle bearing Mel Renfro's likeness, a pennant, an ashtray and a tortilla warmer, all awash in blue and silver. 
 Even here, in what the Acoma describe as the oldest continuously occupied village in the United States, the Dallas Cowboys connect a community fighting to maintain ancient traditions while adapting to the modern world. 
 Concho worries constantly. He frets about losing the next generation to drugs and alcohol and teenage pregnancy. He dwells on his declining health. And he wonders, like much of America, if the pop starlet Jessica Simpson is messing with the confidence of Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. 
 ''I worry we're losing our traditional ways,'' Concho said, sitting on a bed in his shrine, his feet tucked into Cowboys socks and moccasins. He abruptly switched topics. ''And tell Romo to stay away from Jessica,'' he said. ''We have a game to win this weekend.'' 
 Concho's ancestors settled in Acoma Pueblo around 1150. They built their village on the mesa, 367 feet above the valley, positioned strategically to defend against raiders. (Presumably, not the ones from Oakland.) 
 The pueblo looks like a set for a Western movie. In fact, John Wayne made several films here. A Tim McGraw video and two Toyota commercials were also shot on the mesa. 
 Inside the church, which was built without nails but with beams carried 30 miles from Mount Taylor, the tour guide Fred Stevens carries a knit stocking cap with Romo's name stitched across the front. 
 He pointed to the oldest confessional and oldest classrooms in the United States, to the candles that spiral 25 feet up from the altar -- red to represent their native religion, white to represent the Catholicism of the Spanish who enslaved the people here. 
 Outside the mission is a cemetery, measuring 400 feet by 400 feet, and 40 feet deep. The tribe prefers the term replanted, instead of buried, because members believe they came from the earth and will eventually return to it. Humps of clay surround the cemetery, with eyes, noses and ears carved into them. They are soldiers guarding the dead. 
 The tribe has about 3,600 members, and 10 to 15 families live year-round in the pueblo. Theirs is a matriarchal society. The women own the houses on the mesa, each inherited by the youngest daughter in a family. 
 The Acoma practice a religion heavy on song, ritual and ceremony. They grow corn, beans and squash in the valley below. They infuse pop-culture influences with Spanish, Mexican and Indian traditions. 
 The best example is the Cowboys, America's team, their favorite in all of football. And like anywhere else, the Cowboys inspire strong feelings.
 ''I hate them,'' said Gary Keene, another guide who lives on the pueblo. ''Too many Cowboys fans around here. The only good thing to come out of Texas, in my opinion, was ZZ Top.'' 
 Everything in Acoma connects -- the people and the traditions, the ancestors and the spirits, the animals and the plants and the soil. Even football. 
 Concho discovered the game in seventh grade. He played defensive tackle, fullback and middle linebacker in six seasons for the varsity. 
 Before games, he painted stripes on his face, a red one from dark clay on top and a shiny purple stripe on bottom. This served as a blessing from a higher power, he said, and a reminder of his ancestors. It kept him healthy, kept him safe. 
 ''I always wanted to be that warrior,'' said Concho, whose black hair is now flecked with gray. ''Like the times when I used to think, What was it like back then? When we were fighting the Spanish and all that.'' 
 The Battle of Acoma started in 1598, when warriors killed 13 Spanish soldiers. The conquistador Juan de Onate and 70 men retaliated by killing hundreds in the tribe. Gaspar Perez de Villagra described the battle in a poem, with its descriptions of the mangled dead, pierced flesh and quivering bodies. 
 After the three-day battle ended, de Onate cut the feet off the remaining adult men and enslaved the entire pueblo. The history of Acoma is defined by this kind of tragedy and sadness. The people here learn of persecution, prosecution and genocide. A resiliency remains, born from traditions passed from one generation to the next. 
 Concho knows that resiliency, that sadness. He worked the graveyard shift in the nearby uranium mines for 20 years, 2,500 feet deep inside the shaft. He said he beat alcoholism, only to wake up 10 years ago with an unfathomable pain in his stomach. 
 Two of his siblings died from Hodgkin's disease, but tests and scans have revealed nothing so far. In his shrine, he keeps a Cowboys bag with his medication: the insulin for his diabetes, the morphine for his pain, the 20 pills he swallows every day. 
 Diabetes, alcoholism and the effects from the uranium mines are common on the reservation.
 The pain subsides for a few hours most Sundays in the fall, when the Cowboys are on the satellite dish and Concho rests in his comfortable green easy chair. 
 ''Sometimes I feel down about my illness and my stomach,'' he said. ''I'm scared. But I always love the Cowboys. They are my favorite team.'' 
 With the energy he still has, Concho makes the intricate pottery that line shelves in his living room. He leads prayers. He writes songs performed on sacred holidays. He speaks in schools and wonders, he said, if children ''really believe anymore.'' 
 He wants to ensure the traditions are passed on.
 ''Just like beating the drum, you know,'' Concho said. ''Everything must be passed down.''
 Including this obsession with the Cowboys. 
 Tina Torivio, a 36-year-old tribe member, swears she has been a Dallas fan since birth. In high school, she dreamed of becoming a Cowboys cheerleader. On a trip to Dallas in 1983, she begged relatives to drive her around the empty stadium. 
 She watched games with her father before he died. Years later, she said, it feels as if he is sitting next to her, shouting in spirit at the television. 
 Children at school never understood. They used to ask Stevens, the guide, Shouldn't you like the Redskins or the Chiefs? ''I didn't think Indians liked Cowboys,'' he said. 
 As the tour continued, Stevens pointed to huts where Cowboys fans live, to stands of pottery made by women who swoon over Romo. He told stories of catching people in cars during sacred ceremonies, listening to games. Of villagers bringing generators to the mesa to catch the Cowboys on TV. Of being unable to contain his excitement after the Cowboys won the Super Bowl and his boss sending him home from work. 
 Of all the fans here, only Concho has made the pilgrimage of about 700 miles to Texas Stadium for a game. He went on Thanksgiving two years ago, with tickets from a friend, the former Cowboy and author Pat Toomay. Sheryl Crow sang the national anthem. Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey signed his book. Cowboys guard Larry Allen, his favorite player, stopped to talk. 
 ''One of the best days of my life,'' Concho said.
 On Wednesday, he rested on a bench at the scenic viewpoint. Several miles behind him, the casino continued to churn out the money with which the tribe built new schools and civic centers. Front and center, the old village rises in the distance, a postcard in sandstone. 
 Caught between these worlds, Concho stared in silence across the valley. His leather Cowboys jacket glistened in the sun.

HEADLINE: Some Debt Trends Are Good. This Isn't One of Them.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
E-mail: norris@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMERICAN credit card debt is growing at the fastest rate in years, a fact that may signal coming trouble for the banks that issue them.
 The Federal Reserve reported this week that the amount of revolving consumer credit that is outstanding hit $937.5 billion in November, seasonally adjusted, up 7.4 percent from a year earlier. 
 The annual growth rate has now been over 7 percent for three months running, the first such stretch since 2001, when a recession was driving up borrowing by hard-pressed consumers.
 The surge in credit card borrowing comes as credit card default rates are gradually rising, albeit from low levels, and may reflect the fact that it has become harder for consumers to borrow against the value of their homes, both because home values have fallen in many markets and because mortgage lending standards have tightened.
 ''We believe that credit card performance will noticeably deteriorate during the year,'' Fitch Ratings said in a report this week, ''given spillover from residential mortgages, weaker economic trends and higher levels of unemployment.'' 
 One of the largest credit card issuers in the country, Capital One, warned that its profits would be lower than expected, in part because of rising credit card delinquencies.
 Increases in outstanding credit card debt can indicate a strong economy, as confident consumers spend more, or it can indicate the opposite, as troubled consumers find it harder to pay their bills. The fact that the November increases in credit card debt came during what appears to have been a weak holiday shopping season could be an indication of the latter.
 The figures in the accompanying charts are based on seasonally adjusted figures. Before such adjustments, credit card balances always build up in November and December as holiday purchases are made, and then fall in January and February. A smaller-than-normal increase in December, when the figures are reported next month, may be expected from the reports of poor sales from chain stores. 
 If the increase in outstanding debt is a normal one, that could indicate that payments slowed because consumers are having trouble making ends meet. The same would be true if the declines in January and February are smaller than usual.
 A turnaround in trends for home equity loans could also be a sign of consumer worries. In the spring, as credit tightened, the amount of outstanding home equity loans fell and credit card debt rose. That could indicate that consumers turned to credit cards when new loans were no longer being approved.
 But the amount of outstanding home equity loans bottomed out in April, and over the past six months is up 5 percent. 
 That increase may reflect the nature of home equity loans, which typically give consumers the right to borrow up to a certain amount of money. It seems likely that the latest increases reflect borrowing by consumers with pre-existing lines of credit that they are now tapping, rather than newly approved loans.
 The holiday sales data indicated that consumers cut back in late 2007. But the consumer credit numbers would seem to indicate that they wound up further in debt anyway. Those are not good signs for the economy as 2008 begins.

HEADLINE: Awards Season, And the Swag Goes to ...Few

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. 

 BODY:
The Hollywood writers' strike has claimed many casualties in the past few weeks, including this Sunday's Golden Globes award ceremony, an important precursor to the Oscars. And now it threatens another beloved Tinseltown institution: the swag bag.
 In addition to statuettes and red-carpet exposure, celebrities at the movie industry's big award shows get their choice of free luxury items donated by companies looking to promote their products. Stacks of eyelash-strengthening serum, pearl necklaces and expensive Croton watches sat on tables in the penthouse of the Thompson Hotel on Thursday, ready to be ravished by freebie-seeking celebrities. 
 Typically one of Hollywood's most abundant species, none had arrived by 11 a.m. That worried Gavin B. Keilly, the organizer of one so-called ''gift suite'' still scheduled for Sunday's awards. The Globes were scaled back to a press conference after nominees promised not to cross the picket lines of a broadcast ceremony. Had the strike also frightened the A-list away from the gift suites? 
 ''Some nominees have an ill taste in their mouths, but we still have plenty of great stars on their way,'' said Mr. Keilly to a fretful vendor offering $5,000 worth of free cosmetic dentistry. 
 Mr. Keilly, 36, operates GBK Productions, one of 6 companies staging major gift events for the rich and famous in conjunction with the Golden Globes, down from 10 the year before. Award season swag (a word that originally referred to the proceeds of a burglary but has taken on gentler connotations in Hollywood) has blossomed into a $25 million business, event planners estimate. 
 Certainly, Mr. Keilly -- something of a star in the giveaway economy because of the lavishness of his events -- was not about to allow a strike to halt the gravy train. The Globes ceremony may be canceled, but for Mr. Keilly, the swag must go on.
 Still, GBK, which charges companies as much as $15,000 for the opportunity to give away merchandise, expects revenue from the event to decline $100,000 from last year. Only 20 companies opted to participate, down from 50, and several jumped ship at the last minute, like Dreamweaver Lifestyle Management & Concierge, which planned to bestow $5,000 vacation packages on nominees. 
 ''Due to rumors that celebrities weren't going to be there, we decided it wasn't in our best interest,'' said Lisa Stiver, the company's lead lifestyle designer.
 In a typical year, only high-profile nominees and presenters are invited to the gift suites. But for many celebrities, solidarity with their striking brethren is seen as more important than their inalienable right to free stuff. 
 ''For an A-list star, attending a gift suite during a strike would result in an instant loss of stature,'' said Dale Olson, a Hollywood publicist who has advised stars from Marilyn Monroe to Shirley MacLaine. ''I would advise them not to go anywhere near such an abomination.''
 That may change depending on what happens with the Globe telecast. On Friday, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which presents the awards, announced that NBC would no longer have the exclusive right to broadcast the event. As a result, writers canceled plans to picket outside. 
 GBK had already ''opened its arms a little wider,'' as Mr. Keilly put it. So instead of Leonardo DiCaprio and Helen Mirren, who both rolled through the suite in 2007, the big names on Thursday included Shar Jackson, most famous for her relationship with Kevin Federline, the former husband of Britney Spears, and Claudia Jordan, one of the models on ''Deal or No Deal.'' 
 Isaiah Washington, the actor who was fired from ''Grey's Anatomy'' after repeating a gay slur about a cast mate at last year's Golden Globes, showed up. ''When I commit to something, I stick with it like a bulldog,'' he said, standing near a table stacked with $400 jars of ''skin trauma'' cream. 
 GBK is one of hundreds of small companies trying to cope with the trickle-down effects of the writers' strike, which is now entering its third month. The Golden Globes alone pumps about $80 million into the local economy, according to the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation.
 It is easy to see how the losses stack up. The opulent parties held after the Golden Globes can cost $750,000 each when catering, parking and space rental fees are included, according to planners. Those coping with lost revenue include wardrobe stylists, hair and makeup services and limousine drivers. Even the red-carpet suppliers are hurting: Town and Country Event Rentals lost over $100,000 after the Globes canceled its order for 30,000 square feet of carpet. 
 As dance music thundered from the Thompson Hotel sound system, Mr. Keilly explained why he did not call off his event, as some rival gift suite organizers had done. 
 ''We do this to honor the actors and to be able to raise money for charity,'' he said. ''It's a win for the celebrities, a win for the vendors, a win for our charities and a win for me.'' 
 GBK gives 20 percent of its income from gift suites to charity. This year, the Writers Guild of America support fund will benefit, among others.
 Mr. Keilly organized vendors at the Thompson Hotel into various rooms, then strategically sprinkled white rose petals on the floors. In the first room, Russia Hardy was chopping vegetables. Ms. Hardy, wearing a low-cut cocktail dress, was offering celebrities free delivery of a juice called iZO Cleanze. (''A comprehensive bowel, kidney, liver, gall bladder, blood, parasite and heavy metal detox program delivered to your door daily,'' according to the brochure.)
 ''When your body doesn't spend so much energy digesting it can focus on healing itself,'' she said.
 Kunal Nayyar, an actor with a supporting role on the CBS sitcom ''The Big Bang Theory,'' was looking over the displays of natural exfoliation mitts, wireless curling irons and gift certificates for Lasik eye surgery. Mr. Nayyar seemed most interested in 3Lab, a vendor from New Jersey offering designer lotions. ''This is great,'' he told the company's president, Spencer A. Kanis, of the ''skin trauma'' cream. ''The raw ingredients are only found in India? Really?''
 Mr. Kanis, who has participated in four of Mr. Keilly's events in an effort to gain celebrity endorsements, said he almost stayed home this time. 
 ''I got very nervous because the buzz surrounding the Globes was very negative,'' said Mr. Kanis, who reconsidered in part out of loyalty. ''At the end of the day, I figured that if anybody can pull this off it is Gavin Keilly.''

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the effect of the cancellation of the Golden Globes award ceremony on the practice of giving lavish gifts to Hollywood celebrities misinterpreted a comment by the actor Isaiah Washington. When Mr. Washington said, ''When I commit to something, I stick with it like a bulldog,'' he was referring to his foundation to help people in Sierra Leone, one of several charities supported by fees paid by companies who want to give away their products. Mr. Washington was not referring to participating in the gift giveaway himself.

HEADLINE: Lack of Supervision Noted in Deaths of Home-Schooled

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS

 BODY:
Ten states and the District of Columbia, where Banita M. Jacks was charged on Thursday with four counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of her four daughters, have no regulations regarding home schooling, not even the requirement that families notify the authorities that they are educating their children at home.
 The lack of supervision of the home-schooling process, some experts say, may have made it easier last year for Ms. Jacks to withdraw her children from school and the prying eyes of teachers, social workers and other professionals who otherwise might have detected signs of abuse and neglect of the girls. 
 Instead, the children, ages 5 to 17, slipped through the cracks in multiple systems, including social services, education and law enforcement. Their decomposed bodies were discovered earlier this week by United States marshals serving eviction papers on the troubled family.
 The absence of any home-schooling regulations in Washington is largely the result of advocacy and litigation by the Home School Legal Defense Association, which since its founding in 1983 has transformed the landscape for families home schooling their children. Once against the law in all but five states, home schooling is now legal throughout the country and highly regulated in just six states, New York among them. About 1.1 million of the 50 million school age children were home schooled in 2003, the National Center for Education Statistics says. 
 For sure, the fact that Ms. Jacks's children last attended school in March in no way accounts for their deaths, which the medical examiner said occurred more than two weeks ago. There was evidence that the eldest girl had been stabbed and that the others had signs of strangulation and other trauma. Ms. Jacks denies responsibility, saying the children died in their sleep and were possessed by demons.
 Officials at the Home School Legal Defense Association, in Purcellville, Va., acknowledge that children schooled at home, as Ms. Jacks said hers were, are in rare instances the victims of abuse. But such cases generally occur in families already known to law enforcement or social service agencies who may have ''missed the signs and signals,'' said Ian M. Slatter, a spokesman for the association, and ''being in school wouldn't all of a sudden make those children safe.''
 That view is disputed by other experts.
 Clive R. Belfield, a professor of economics at Queens College and formerly a researcher at the National Center for the Study of Privatization in Education at Columbia Teachers College, said that ''limited compliance and follow-up'' gave abusive families ''an excuse to get out of being observed.''
 Mitchell L. Stevens, an associate professor of education and sociology at New York University, said school officials, who are required by law to report suspicion of child abuse, were society's best watchdogs of how parents treat children.
 ''Home schooling removes children from a lot of that surveillance,'' Mr. Stevens said, adding that the vast majority of home schooling families are ''overwhelmingly trustworthy people who place a very high value on parental autonomy.'' And thanks to the advocacy of the legal defense fund, he continued, ''they have been largely successful since the late 1980s in getting the law to favor parental rights.''
 One example of that, in 1991, disrupted an effort by the District of Columbia to regulate home schooling, with rules that included unannounced home visits and required teachers certification for parents doing the instruction. Christopher Klicka, senior counsel for the Home School Legal Defense Association, met with District officials, told them they were on shaky ground because of the 1st, 4th and 14th amendments, and the rules were rescinded.
 Among his plans, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty of Washington promised ''to establish better tracking and monitoring of home school families.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan Prepares for First Of 2 Major 2008 Elections

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
Voters went to the polls here on Saturday in the first of two closely spaced elections that will shape this self-governing island's strategy for dealing with mainland China, its rival. 
 Opinion polls and most political analysts suggest that the election will renew control of Parliament by the opposition Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, before the March 22 presidential election. The party's popular candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, is expected to campaign on avoiding confrontation with Beijing. 
 For the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, and his governing Democratic Progressive Party, the parliamentary election could be a gauge of public support for his plan to hold a controversial referendum alongside the presidential election to ask voters to support the island's bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan. Its formal name is the Republic of China. 
 China condemns the referendum as a step toward formal separation, and the United States has called it provocative and an unnecessary step that raises tension across the Taiwan Strait. 
 But, in the last months of his second and final term, Mr. Chen and the party's presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, are refusing to back down. 
 Senior officials of the Democratic Progressive Party say that the referendum is an important protest against China's continuing military buildup opposite the island and its moves to reinforce Taiwan's international isolation. 
 ''We feel it is important we have a strong reaction to Chinese suppression of our international space,'' said Hsiao Bi-khim, a Democratic Progressive Party member of Parliament, or the Legislative Yuan. 
 ''It has been suffocating,'' she added. 
 Reports in the Taiwanese news media this week suggested that Malawi, one of only 24, mostly impoverished, countries that recognize Taiwan, was considering switching its diplomatic allegiance to Beijing in return for economic assistance. 
 Mr. Chen's critics say that the referendum is an attempt to deflect attention from what they describe as his lackluster record of economic management over almost eight years in office, largely as a result of failing to capitalize fully on China's soaring growth. 
 And they say that it unnecessarily raises tensions with Beijing, while at the same time alienating the United States, an ally that is crucial to deterring China from using force to achieve its aim of bringing the island under its control. 
 Other critics say that Mr. Chen has a record of successfully combining elections with controversial referendums as a tool for mobilizing supporters. 
 The Kuomintang, once one of the world's richest political parties, governed Taiwan for 51 consecutive years before Mr. Chen's election in 2000. 
 Mr. Ma acknowledges that Taiwan needs a capable military and a strong relationship with Washington to counter the risk of conflict with China. But he and his supporters say that Taiwan should treat China as more of an opportunity than a threat. 
 The parliamentary elections will also test Taiwan's efforts to streamline its political system and improve the conduct of sometimes fiery and violent debate in the Legislative Yuan. 
 Under a new system for this election, the number of parliamentary seats will be halved to 113, from 225. 
 Of these, 73 will represent electoral districts, 6 will be elected by indigenous people and 34 will be at-large seats, drawn from a list of nominees based on their parties' share of the vote. 
 One immediate effect of the new system, according to analysts, is that candidates have been concentrating on local issues, including health, education and public works in their electorates rather than foreign policy or ties with China.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Teaching in China

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''1977 Exam Opened Escape Route Into China's Elite'' (news article, Jan. 6): 
 I taught modern American and British literature to some of those gifted students in Wuhan, China, from 1979 to 1981. I can attest to their talents and determination, and I am not surprised that they now have positions of influence throughout the nation. 
 Many of those students were taught by worker-peasant-soldiers turned teachers, young people assigned to academic posts during the Cultural Revolution for political, not academic, reasons. 
 And although many of those young teachers were smart and savvy, they generally did not have the intellectual capacities of the class of '77 students. This caused tension and jealousy, and I would assume that those tensions still manifest themselves in generational strife behind the scenes of political and economic power.
 Furthermore, by 1978, examinations for college entrance were no longer open to everyone. It was back to normal. Aspirants had to get permission from the leaders of their work units to apply, which meant that students of the elite invariably got the first shot. 
 Many of those students of '78 and onward were capable, but the democratic door to opportunity was closed. I wonder what the impact of that continues to be on China and its growing divisions among the rural, the urban, the elite and the majority.

HEADLINE: Anxiety for Luxury Brands as Tiffany Reports Slowdown

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Not even luxury retailers are immune.
 The upscale jeweler Tiffany & Company said Friday that the number of purchases at its American stores dropped during the holiday shopping season, a sign that a pullback in consumer spending that started at the low end of American retailing is percolating up to high-end merchants.
 The slowdown was unexpected, and it sent jitters through the world of luxury-goods makers, who had seemed invulnerable over the last five years, even as energy prices surged and the housing market began to sputter. 
 The Tiffany results were among the clearest evidence yet that wealthy consumers -- and middle-class shoppers who sometimes splurge on luxury items -- are starting to tighten their purse strings.
 Saks Fifth Avenue, Coach and Nordstrom have all experienced a slowdown in growth this holiday season. They are careful to emphasize that the truly rich are still shopping with abandon -- Louis Vuitton merchandise, for instance, was a hit in December -- but they concede that just about everybody else is starting to cut back. 
 At Tiffany, for example, the most disappointing categories were not $50,000 engagement rings, but jewelry priced from $1,000 to $10,000, executives said. 
 ''The greatest amount of weakness was in the mid-tier luxury consumer,'' Michael J. Kowalski, the chief executive of Tiffany, said in an interview. 
 Over all, United States retail revenue at Tiffany rose 4 percent between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, to $450 million, because the average amount spent by each shopper rose compared with last year, offsetting the drop in the number of purchases.
 But nearly all of that 4 percent growth can be traced to foreign consumers, who capitalized on the weak dollar to buy jewelry. Tiffany said that without foreign buyers, its domestic sales would have been unchanged from last year. The company likewise credited a 10 percent increase in sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan to foreign shoppers. 
 Sales at Tiffany's American stores open at least a year -- a carefully watched barometer in retailing, known as same-store sales -- fell 2 percent, a bigger drop than the company had predicted.
 Shares of Tiffany dropped $4.52, or 11 percent, on Friday to close at $35.80 a share.
 Mark L. Aaron, vice president for investor relations, said total sales were below expectations.
 ''We entered the holiday season facing well-known challenging conditions,'' he said. Even so, he added, ''the magnitude of the softness was more than we expected.''
 At the very high end, the number of consumers buying Tiffany jewelry priced over $50,000 rose, but the average amount they spent dropped slightly. 
 Tiffany is still on track to meet its fourth-quarter earnings forecast, and executives said they were pleased with results for 2007 to date. Indeed, Mr. Kowalski cautioned against reading too much into the slowing United States sales, which did not materialize until mid-December. 
 ''To draw a conclusion that there is a chink in the luxury armor after five weeks would be extremely premature,'' he said.
 David Schick, a retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, is not so sure. ''Tiffany is not making mistakes in merchandise and marketing,'' he said. ''So if Tiffany is doing the right thing and business is down in the U.S., it gives you a glimpse of how the high-end consumer is doing.''
 Tiffany's worldwide sales rose 8 percent in November and December, to $867 million, based on strong sales in China, Hong Kong and Australia. 
 In the United States, however, the picture was less rosy. At Tiffany's suburban New York stores, which are patronized by a relatively affluent group of consumers, same-store sales fell 10 percent.
 One of the company's strongest product categories was also its least expensive: silver jewelry priced under $1,000. 
 The chief financial officer, James N. Fernandez, said Tiffany was struggling to forecast its performance over the next year, given the cloudy economic picture. 
 ''There is uncertainty about the macro conditions and the state of consumer spending in the U.S.,'' he said. ''Providing guidance now would be a disservice to our investors.''

LAYOFFS AT ENGINE MAKER Rolls-Royce Group, a leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, said that it would trim nearly 6 percent of employees from its payroll. The company aims to cut up to 2,300 managerial, professional and clerical staff in Britain, the United States, Germany, the Nordic countries and elsewhere. In July, Rolls-Royce reported a net profit for the first half of $:306 million ($597 million at current exchange rates), half the amount reported for the same period in 2006. (AP)
 CIT REPORTS A LOSS The CIT Group, the independent commercial finance company, had a fourth-quarter net loss of $125 million to $135 million as it wrote down its student-loan business and added to reserves for bad mortgages. The write-off at the student lending business will probably reduce net income by $300 million, the lender said. The increased reserves for credit losses, primarily in its home lending portfolio, will reduce net income by about $190 million. CIT is exiting the mortgage-lending business, which once accounted for about 10 percent of the company's income.

 SLOW DECEMBER AT BEST BUY The Best Buy Company, the electronics retailer, said December sales growth at stores open at least 14 months slowed to 1.5 percent, from 7 percent a year earlier. Total sales in December rose 11 percent as Best Buy gained market share from a rival, Circuit City Stores. Sales were $7.3 billion in the five weeks ended Jan. 5, the company said. Best Buy reaffirmed its forecast for annual earnings of as much as $3.20 a share and sales of $40 billion. Analysts project profit of $3.17 a share and revenue of $40.2 billion. December sales were strongest in video game consoles and software, flat-panel televisions, and laptop computers. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 ECONOMIC SLIP IN BRITAIN British factory output fell unexpectedly in November, data showed, adding weight to the view that the economy slowed sharply at the end of last year. Britain's Office for National Statistics reported that manufacturing output fell 0.1 percent in November after a 0.3 percent gain in the previous month. The broader measure of industrial production also fell 0.1 percent after October's revised 0.5 percent increase. Analysts had forecast a 0.1 percent rise in both measures. (REUTERS)
 CABLE SYSTEM TO CHINAVerizon Communications, the phone company, won permission to operate a 10,600-mile underwater cable system that will connect the United States and China. Verizon and its partners, which include Beijing-based China Telecom Corporation and the Chunghwa Telecom Company in Taipei, are spending $500 million on the project, which has received approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Construction is under way and should be completed before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Verizon said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 INSIDER TRADING CASE A federal judge in New York declined to throw out an insider-trading case against a former Credit Suisse investment banker, paving the way for his retrial next week. Federal District Judge Richard M. Berman, who had declared a mistrial in December in the case against Hafiz Muhammad Zubair Naseem, left, ruled that he did not find that ''either the government or the defendant suffered any prejudice'' because of the decision, according to a ruling released on Friday. The judge declared a mistrial on the second day of the trial after finding that two jurors had failed to follow instructions. Mr. Naseem, a Pakistani national who worked for Credit Suisse's Global Energy Group, is accused of leaking inside tips to a co-defendant, Ajaz Rahim, who has an arrest warrant pending against him.

 SAC CAPITAL PRESIDENT LEAVING Brian Cohn, president of SAC Capital Advisors, plans to leave the hedge fund firm after working with founder Steven A. Cohen for 11 years. Mr. Cohn, 40, will take time off and has not accepted another job. He joined SAC, based in Stamford, when it was about five years old and managed $300 million. The firm oversees $15 billion in equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and takes longer term stakes in companies. ''We thank him for his many contributions to SAC's success and wish him all the best in his future endeavors,'' an SAC spokesman, Jonathan Gasthalter, said. Mr. Cohn declined to comment.

HEADLINE: With Economy Slowing, All Speeches Are Turning to It

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Reporting was contributed by Elisabeth Bumiller, Nick Bunkley, Adam Nagourney and Jeff Zeleny.

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich. 

 BODY:
Presidential hopefuls of both parties pivoted sharply to the economy on Friday, proposing new federal spending plans, help for homeowners facing foreclosures and tax cuts and making promises to preserve and create new jobs.
 With many economists saying the nation is edging toward recession and Michigan, in financial distress, holding its primary on Tuesday, the candidates sought to provide both expressions of sympathy and promises of substantive relief. 
 The rush to engage with voters on the issue is the latest evidence that the campaigns are being reshaped by the slowing of the economy. 
 Although the economy is sure to have evolved by Jan. 20, 2009, the campaign debate puts a new focus on how the candidates approach economic policy and highlights the partisan and ideological divides that President Bush and the Democratic-led Congress face in trying to settle on a package to blunt the effects of the slowdown.
 The dialogue on Friday echoed that of 1992, when the economy was slowly emerging from a deep recession and Bill Clinton, the relatively unknown governor of Arkansas, defeated President George Bush by focusing almost exclusively on the financial struggles of the middle class.
 ''This economy may be working for some people but it sure isn't working for everybody,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, said as she discussed a $70 billion stimulus plan to a local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in City of Commerce, Calif. ''One thing we have to decide is whether we are going to let this economy slide into a recession.''
 John Edwards said that plan mirrored proposals he announced weeks ago in Iowa.
 Campaigning on Friday in Summerville, S.C., Mr. Edwards pointed to his upbringing as the son of a mill worker to make the case that he is the candidate for the Democratic nomination ''who understands what it means when the jobs leave, when the mills close, what it does to families, what it does to communities, and who has real ideas about what we can do about it.''
 In Michigan, Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and the son of a former Michigan governor, said the state, with the nation's highest unemployment, was suffering a ''one-state recession'' and promised aid to struggling auto companies and other manufacturers. 
 Mr. Romney's proposals include cuts in the capital gains taxes, subsidies for technology development, pruning regulations and investing in infrastructure.
 ''Michigan is in some respects like the canary in the mine shaft,'' Mr. Romney, a Republican, said at an automotive technology laboratory at Macomb Community College in Warren, a blue-collar suburb of Detroit that often votes Republican. ''Michigan is going through a 10-year recession, and Washington says we're aware of it, and instead of helping just heaps on mandates.
 ''If Washington keeps doing that and Michigan does worse and worse, it's not just going to be confined to Michigan. What happens to Michigan will happen to the rest of the country.''
 Mr. Romney took a swipe at Senator John McCain of Arizona, a chief rival who won the 2000 Michigan Republican primary.
 ''What have you done?'' Mr. Romney said, making clear he meant Mr. McCain. ''What kinds of things have you done to ease the burden on business?''
 He also reminded his audience that Mr. McCain had said that many of the jobs that had been lost here were not coming back. Mr. Romney said that as president he would fight to restore auto jobs in Michigan and other manufacturing states.
 Mr. McCain said that was an unrealistic promise and all but accused Mr. Romney of pandering to Michigan voters.
 ''I'd be embarrassed to tell people in Michigan and South Carolina that all these jobs are coming back,''' Mr. McCain said in a telephone interview from South Carolina. ''They aren't coming back.''
 Mr. McCain said his emphasis was on the future, specifically job retraining. 
 Mr. McCain said that the economy had become a major campaign issue, particularly in Michigan, and that he would explain his plan to create jobs at his events here in the next three days.
 Mr. McCain's senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Friday that Mr. McCain's plan would immediately end the alternative minimum tax, cutting taxes for millions. The tax was originally intended to ensure that upper-income people did not escape income taxes through using deductions and shelters. But the A.M.T. has steadily increased the tax bills of middle-income people. Repealing it would do nothing to help lower-income people.
 Mike Huckabee, the Republican former governor of Arkansas, also focused on the strains in the Michigan and national economies in remarks to the Detroit Economic Club.
 Mr. Huckabee has struck a populist tone on the economy, differentiating himself in particular from Mr. Romney, who represents a more traditional strain of Republican thinking.
 ''There was a time in this country when Michigan saved America,'' Mr. Huckabee said, ''and now it may be time for America to help save Michigan. Michigan is in trouble. We owe it to Michigan to help it, just like we had to do for the people of the Gulf Coast.''

HEADLINE: Cleveland Sues 21 Lenders Over Subprime Mortgages

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MAAG

DATELINE: CLEVELAND 

 BODY:
Cleveland is suing 21 of the nation's largest banks and financial institutions, accusing them of knowingly plunging the city into a financial crisis by flooding the local housing market with subprime mortgage loans to people who could never repay. 
 The city is seeking ''at least'' hundreds of millions of dollars in damages, Cleveland's law director, Robert J. Triozzi, said Friday. The list of defendants includes some of the most prominent firms on Wall Street, like Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial. 
 Mayor Frank G. Jackson said in an interview on Friday that the companies would be ''held accountable for what they've done.''
 ''We're going after them to get the resources we need to rebuild our city,'' Mr. Jackson said.
 The financial crisis has hit Cleveland especially hard, with more than 7,000 foreclosures in each of the last two years, Mr. Jackson said. Entire city blocks have been abandoned. The city's budget has been strained by the effort to maintain thousands of boarded-up homes, and by the cost of responding to a rise in violent crime and arson.
 The major banks involved did not return calls about the lawsuit. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch, Mark Herr, said, ''We're declining to comment right now.'' 
 The Cleveland suit is separate from one filed Tuesday in federal court by the City of Baltimore against Wells Fargo, accusing it of violating fair-housing laws by singling out African-Americans for high-interest mortgages.
 The Cleveland suit, filed Thursday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court under the state's public nuisance law, asserts that the financial institutions created nuisances across broad swaths of Cleveland because their loans led to widespread abandonment of homes. ''We've torn down 1,000 abandoned houses, and haven't even made a dent,'' Mr. Jackson said.
 The drop in homeownership, and a steep decline in population -- to 444,000 residents in 2007 from almost a million in 1950, according to census figures -- has drained Cleveland's budget. In December, Mr. Jackson announced that the city was unable to borrow money and would be forced to postpone or permanently shelve millions of dollars in public works projects.
 ''The strain on our budget is too much,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''These companies have knowingly created a public nuisance by exploiting the city of Cleveland.''
 Several Cleveland suburbs have expressed interest in joining the case as a class-action suit, Mr. Triozzi said. Because the city is suing under a state statute, cities outside Ohio could not join. ''This case is about what these Wall Street bankers did to Cleveland,'' Mr. Triozzi said. 
 Instead of aiming at the banks that originally made subprime mortgage loans in the city, the lawsuit is against those firms that bundled the loans into securities to be divided into shares and sold on the stock exchange. This process, and the large fees the firms generated from the work, Mr. Triozzi said, drove their effort to make as many loans as possible during an era of low interest rates and a prolonged housing boom.

HEADLINE: The Battle Of the Mitts

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Ever since Barack Obama won big in Iowa, Mitt Romney has been running as a ''change'' candidate. It is a little strange to see a guy whose party has been in power for years standing in front of a big blue ''Washington is Broken'' sign, but I think we have already determined that Romney is nothing if not really, really adaptable.
 ''I brought change, and they can only talk about change,'' he says in his stump speech, citing his work as an Olympics czar (change is better parking) and businessman (change is fewer employees). He also vows to turn Washington ''inside out.'' 
 We will pause here briefly to envision what interesting trinkets would come tumbling out of the Bush Justice Department.
 For a long while, Romney seemed the logical Republican nominee since he has a great resume, a lovely family from whom he is not estranged and a ton of money. (At his campaign stops, Mitt jokingly thanks his wife for agreeing to invest so much of the family fortune on his presidential prospects. Ann Romney's smile has begun to seem a little thin at this point.) 
 Unfortunately, there's something about Romney's perfect grooming, his malleability and his gee-whiz aura that seems to really irritate both the other candidates and the voters. ''Most Americans want the next president to remind them of the guy they work with, not the guy who laid them off,'' says a Mike Huckabee ad running in Michigan. (It doesn't tackle the follow-up question of whether most Americans would like the guy they work with to be handling nuclear proliferation.) 
 Mitt is making his stand in Michigan, one of the many, many states he calls home. Since Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, it's an early test of what the Republicans are going to do if the big campaign issue is the tanking economy.
 Rudy Giuliani, who has been lurking somewhere in the Everglades, emerged this week bearing a humongous tax-cut plan for corporations and investors. It showed the wisdom of the current Giuliani campaign strategy, which involves pretending that he is not really running anyplace where people actually vote.
 Fred Thompson reacts stonily to any suggestion that the rich should not always get richer, and it was a real treat to watch him in New Hampshire when a debate moderator asked about a windfall profits tax on oil companies. Fred stared at him as if he'd heard a really foul obscenity, or been asked to convert to Scientology.
 In the latest debate this week in South Carolina, Mitt laced into John McCain for making the rather obvious point that some of the lost Michigan jobs aren't coming back.
 ''I disagree,'' Romney announced firmly. ''I'm going to fight for every single job in Michigan, South Carolina, every state in this country.'' This called up interesting visions of Mitt the payroll-slashing businessman and Mitt the workers' friend battling one another to the death over an imperiled tool-and-die maker. It would be sort of like ''Spiderman 3,'' without the weepy subplots.
 McCain claims there's not going to be a recession and that the big domestic challenge is cutting pork from the federal budget. ''I saved the taxpayers $6 billion on a bogus tanker deal. I'm called the sheriff by my friends in the Senate who are appropriators,'' he said in the debate. In fact, he said it twice. McCain has been sounding as if he's on autopilot lately, and although he's a vigorous 71, the endless electioneering has clearly been wearing on him. 
 Mike Huckabee's campaign is a mixture of feelings, which are all on the side of the average working stiff, and policies, which are all on the side of the stock exchange. His sidekick, Chuck Norris, has his own stump speech that seems to blame our economic woes on ''sheiks and Arabs'' who ''come over here, buy millions of dollars of merchandise and take it back to their homeland and don't pay any taxes on it.''
 It's quite an assortment of Republican options. What bothers voters about Romney, as it turns out, is not his Mormonism but his inherent Mitt-ness. Fred Thompson is the Republican establishment dream candidate. (Social conservative, instinctive rich guy and he's been a lobbyist, so he gets it.) Unfortunately, he reminds most other people of Mr. Potter, the banker in ''It's a Wonderful Life.''
 Rudy's actual problem is not that he failed to campaign enough in Iowa and New Hampshire, but that he showed up just often enough for the voters to get a sense of what he's really like when he isn't heroically covered in dust from a terrorist attack. 
 Huckabee seems to be a nice guy, but conservatives are afraid he'd break up the old evangelical-plutocrat Republican alliance and most liberals are restrained by their irrational attachment to the theory of evolution. 
 ''I feel like Will Smith in 'I Am Legend' -- I'm the last guy standing that's not a zombie,'' said McCain.

HEADLINE: Still Waiting to Seize the Moment

 BODY:
Visiting the Middle East this week, President Bush sounded an unaccustomed note of diplomatic urgency. He insisted that Israel and the Palestinians will conclude a peace agreement before he leaves office in early 2009, and he tried to rhetorically prod the process along. 
 Rhetoric is, of course, better than nothing -- especially after Mr. Bush spent seven years refusing to get involved. The problem is that there really isn't much time. And while Mr. Bush has to worry about his legacy, the rest of the world has to worry about the even deeper disillusionment and fury that would follow if this too-long-delayed peace effort fails. 
 It has been six weeks since Mr. Bush hosted the Annapolis peace conference. Six weeks and one presidential visit later, and nothing on the ground has changed.
 Despite longstanding pledges, the Israelis are refusing to stop expanding settlements while the Palestinians aren't doing enough to halt violence against Israel. 
 We understand that all of the core negotiating issues -- borders, security, refugees and Jerusalem -- are hugely difficult. But Israelis and Palestinians won't be willing to think about making compromises until they see tangible improvements in their lives. 
 For the first time, Mr. Bush did say that Israel must compensate Palestinians who left or were driven from their homes in what is now Israel. He also warned both sides that they are going to have to make difficult compromises on their borders. 
 Coming from Mr. Bush, that was seen as a full-court press. But he's going to have to press a lot harder. 
 The trip did produce one so-called deliverable -- from Washington. In time for the president's arrival, the administration finally named a top official -- Air Force Lt. Gen. William M. Fraser III, assistant to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff -- to mediate disputes over the two sides' compliance with previous agreements. 
 Officials could not say how the general would do his job, or even whether his judgments would be made public. If there's any chance of this working, Washington must be willing to hold both sides publicly accountable. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, are weak leaders who need maximum support and pressure to make and implement the hard decisions required to reach a peace agreement. 
 Mr. Bush said he would pressure the two sides when necessary, and he also promised to return to the region in May for Israel's 60th anniversary -- and maybe more often if needed. We hope that means that the president is finally and truly engaged.
 Mr. Bush plans to spend the rest of his trip visiting several Arab countries. Like the president, many of the leaders he will meet with have also spent years claiming that they want a Palestinian state and peace in the region -- while doing very little to make it happen. Mr. Bush should prod those leaders to play against their own type.
 They can start by providing more economic and political support for Mr. Abbas. And they must find ways to reach out to Israel, making it clear that a peace deal would bring with it true regional acceptance.

HEADLINE: Bush and Congress Seen Pushing for Stimulus Plan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Congressional leaders, increasingly concerned about a possible recession, are moving closer to agreeing that an economic stimulus package is needed soon, Washington officials said Friday.
 A Republican familiar with the administration's thinking said Mr. Bush would present ideas to stimulate the economy, most likely in the form of tax relief, in his State of the Union message on Jan. 28. Mr. Bush will not decide on the details until he returns from the Middle East next week.
 Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are also suggesting that they might be able to put aside longstanding partisan differences and work on a stimulus measure, lawmakers and aides said Friday. 
 In a fresh sign of the possibility of an agreement on a roughly $100 billion package of tax cuts and spending to spur the economy, Nancy Pelosi of California, the speaker of the House, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, wrote to President Bush on Friday saying, ''We want to work with you.'' 
 On Monday, Mr. Bush acknowledged that Americans were ''anxious about the economy'' and said he was studying what actions to take. But this Republican, speaking anonymously to avoid pre-empting the White House, said, ''If the decision was going to be 'no,' he wouldn't have put that out there.''
 Some Democrats say they could support tax relief focused on lower-income people and, perhaps, even tax cuts for corporations, if the White House and the Republican Congressional leadership accept some spending increases like extended unemployment benefits or aid to states to help them avert spending cuts.
 Responding to Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid's letter, Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Bush had instructed aides to get views from all sides as he decided on a possible economic package. 
 ''We would of course want to proceed in a bipartisan way,'' Mr. Fratto said, adding Mr. Bush planned to meet, perhaps next week, with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid to report on his Middle East trip. 
 Some lawmakers said that calls from the presidential campaign trail for limiting partisanship and changing the way Washington works were resonating on Capitol Hill, but that it would still not be easy for the administration and Democrats to bury their ideological differences on an economic rescue package. One model could be the bipartisan measure combining tax rebates, corporate tax relief and unemployment benefits that Congress approved in the last economic slump, in March 2002.
 But these Democrats said the White House would have to agree not to try to attach favorite measures like repealing the estate tax or making permanent Mr. Bush's 2001 and 2003 cuts, just as Democrats would have to refrain from attaching extraneous spending. 
 ''It would make sense for the president to do something in a bipartisan way,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''But I'm scared to death to even talk about tax rebates because of what that might open up.''
 A senior Republican aide said: ''Republicans will have to talk about making the tax cuts permanent and all that kind of stuff. Democrats are going to want things on their long-term agenda. But if you figure those cancel each other out, there's probably a playing field where everyone can agree.''
 Democrats appeared to be further along in their thinking than the administration, having decided in December to spend the early part of 2008 blaming Mr. Bush for the economic anxieties of the middle class. Until recently, Republicans in Congress and in the presidential campaigns have said the economy was healthy.
 With the House returning next week, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the House Democratic caucus leader; Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the Democratic whip; and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, plan to give major economic speeches in Illinois, Washington and at Harvard. 
 Democrats are also planning a party retreat at the end of the month where they are scheduled to hear from Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, among other economic experts. Ms. Pelosi plans to meet with Mr. Bernanke on Monday.
 Still, some Bush administration officials say any action should be sooner rather than later. ''Time will be of the essence,'' Henry M. Paulson Jr., the treasury secretary, said Friday on Bloomberg Television. ''So I think we want to do something as quickly as possible if we do it.''
 The tone changed quickly over the last few weeks, especially after the level of unemployment grew, oil prices reached $100 a barrel, the stock market stumbled and the housing crisis worsened. Leading Republican and Democratic economists soon began voicing fears of a recession, with some even suggesting one had already begun. New polls show Americans are increasingly alarmed, and the topic has figured more and more in presidential debates. On Tuesday, New Hampshire primary voters in both parties cited the economy as their top concern. 
 Mr. Bernanke laid out a bleak picture of the economy on Thursday and suggested that the Fed would cut interest rates soon. That has made it more acceptable for lawmakers to discuss the need for actions to avoid being blamed for failing to respond.
 The first presidential candidate, indeed the first leading Democrat, to offer a package was Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who on Friday proposed $70 billion in spending for housing, heating subsidies and state aid and $40 billion in tax rebates if conditions worsened. 
 Mrs. Clinton's package drew on the thinking of leading Democratic policy makers, many of whom served under President Bill Clinton and are advising Democratic leaders in Congress.
 One of those advisers, Gene B. Sperling, was on Capitol Hill on Friday for meetings with Democrats. Mr. Sperling worked closely with Ms. Pelosi on the economic stimulus package that she brokered with Mr. Bush shortly after she became minority leader.
 Leading Democrats said they envisioned a proposal of at least $100 billion, which economists say is the minimum needed to counter a recession that many for now say would probably be short.
 Many Democrats are reciting what they call the ''three T's'' for the stimulus package, that it should be temporary, timely and targeted to low- and middle-income Americans. The mantra is intended as a shield against Republican attacks that Democrats would go on a spending spree, as well as Republican calls to make Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent after they expire in 2010.
 Republicans are expected to emphasize tax cuts for individuals and businesses. Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, said tax relief to spur business investment would be especially useful now.
 ''These issues aren't really in dispute,'' Mr. Hassett said. ''If you want to do a stimulus package, it should juice up activity this year and then go away. But it has to have two components, one for individuals and one for business firms to spur capital investment.''
 Mr. Hassett and other Republican economists also warned that a package that was caught up in grandstanding on both sides might come too late to do any good. In 1992, for example, after President George Bush invited Democrats to submit a stimulus package, both sides argued as the recession came and went. 
 But many Republicans said there was a risk of their seeming indifferent to the economic situation, especially to Americans in danger of losing their homes because of the subprime mortgage crisis, and a risk of holding a package hostage to their long-term tax-cutting agenda.
 Democrats are hardly united, however. Some are likely to demand spending for public works as part of any package. Others say they are worried that they will be accused of violating the party's promise to ''pay as you go'' by offsetting any tax cuts or spending increases with savings.
 But most Democrats are saying that, at a time of an economic downturn, they do not need to stick to that promise.
 ''Once pay-go is set aside, you could really see the discussion take off,'' a Democratic Congressional aide said. ''You could start to align the House and Senate and then triangulate with the White House on what could be done on a faster track.''

HEADLINE: Take the Turnpike, and Pay $48?

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and DAVID W. CHEN; Jonathan Miller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Driving the family car on the New Jersey Turnpike from the Lincoln Tunnel to the Delaware Memorial Bridge -- just about the length of the highway -- could rise to $48 from $5.85. For truck drivers, navigating that same stretch of highway would soar to $186 from the current $23.
 With a sense of resignation in his voice, Ed Daly, who had stopped for a snack at the Joyce Kilmer rest area, just north of Exit 8A, said, ''Tolls fall heaviest on the working man.'' 
 The fiscal gymnastics Gov. Jon S. Corzine has proposed to stabilize New Jersey's sagging economy may lay beyond the reach of many truck drivers in their semis and parents in their S.U.V.'s. But at least one crucial element of his plan they understand: his intention to boost tolls sharply. And they probably don't know the full extent of it. 
 If Mr. Corzine's plan can win the battle for public approval and the votes of state legislators, drivers will be paying more than eight times what they pay now by 2022, and New Jersey will go from having some of the cheapest toll roads in the country to some of the most expensive. 
 The leap in tolls will help reduce the state's $32 billion debt load and finance major transportation projects, like the widening of the turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, and the construction of a second Hudson River rail tunnel into Pennsylvania Station.
 To pay for those and other projects, Mr. Corzine wants to increase tolls by 50 percent every four years, beginning in 2010 and ending in 2022. Tolls would also rise up to an additional 3 percent per year for 75 years to account for inflation. What's more, the initial toll increase in 2010 would include four years of inflation adjustments, backdated to 2006.
 Governor Corzine, who has seen opposition to his plan for bailing out the state mount in the year since he began talking about it, now faces complaints that the burden on drivers could end up choking the state's economy. Commuters, vacationers and truckers rely heavily on New Jersey's toll roads to get to and from New York and Philadelphia, as well as Newark Liberty International Airport, the Port of New Jersey and the warehouses that line the center of the state.
 Trucking companies say they will have little choice but to pass along the toll increases to their customers, who in turn will probably raise consumer prices. Working families may end up joining the migration to North Carolina, Georgia and other states where the cost of living is lower. And for those who stay, economists say the higher tolls could mean less money spent at a restaurant or hardware store, or drivers clogging local roads to avoid the tolls.
 ''There will be strategies emerging to avoid bearing those costs,'' said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. 
 By Thursday, two days after unveiling his controversial plan, Mr. Corzine was already offering sweeteners to try to gain support -- that he might introduce discounts to regular users of the state's toll roads, and the possibility of not turning a busy highway connecting New Jersey and Staten Island into a toll road, as originally proposed. He also noted that about half of the people who pay to use the turnpike are from out-of-state.
 That means little to Mr. Daly, a sales manager for a communications company in Clifton, who said that he traveled the turnpike every day, spending $50 a month in tolls. Once the first increases take effect in 2010, that would jump to $75, and he would have to absorb the difference by himself.
 ''Talk about a regressive tax,'' he complained.
 Yet as Mr. Corzine said on Tuesday when he unveiled his plan, he had done the math and was willing to face the consequences. Now he is bracing for a backlash in Livingston on Saturday, at the first of 21 town hall meetings. He had already provoked some grumbling by making residents who planned to attend register online or by telephone. 
 Still, the public meetings will be no consolation for truckers, particularly for those who own their vehicles.
 Walter Krupski, a resident of Stewartsville, N.J., who has been a long-haul trucker since 1976, says the higher tolls will be a significant burden. At one time Mr. Krupski, who has his own trucking company, used to employ several drivers, but he says he no longer does because of soaring health care costs. Today, Mr. Krupski, 50, is a self-employed trucker and has no health insurance.
 On Thursday, he was on Interstate 81 in West Virginia carrying a load of beer from North Carolina to New Jersey. He said that that nine-hour drive would typically earn him $500, and that his profit would be about $50, after fuel, insurance, tolls and other costs. But if tolls were to go up as Mr. Corzine plans, Mr. Krupski said he would eventually have to spend another $13, cutting his profit by more than 20 percent.
 If Mr. Krupski can persuade companies to factor those increases into the one- and two-year contracts he typically signs, then he expects that the higher costs will ultimately be absorbed by consumers.
 ''It's eventually going to dribble down to the consumer,'' Mr. Krupski said. ''Goods and services in New Jersey are going to go up because of this.'' As he put it, ''You can take a little hit, a little hit, but sooner or later you got to get that money back or else you're going to go out of business.''
 More than anything, truckers want to know when the tolls will go up and by how much, and since the increases are not scheduled to go into effect until 2010, they have time to factor the higher costs into negotiations with their customers.
 ''If you increase one of my costs in 30 days, I can't go back to the shippers,'' said Matthew Wright, the chief executive of Apgar Bros., a midsize trucking company in Bound Brook, who is president of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association. ''At least I know what I'm dealing with it and I can sit down with a shipper. Just having the predictability is a useful tool.''
 Mr. Corzine's chief of staff, Bradley Abelow, said he was aware of the burden the higher tolls would have on the state's businesses, but insisted that the payoff was worth the financial pain.
 ''The truckers and folks in the shipping business -- their livelihoods are attached to what their costs are of being on the road,'' Mr. Abelow said. But, he added, ''we need to find a way to invest in capital in our transportation infrastructure, and the truckers are going to bear part of that cost.''
 Still, the majority of the 680 million vehicles that travel the turnpike and parkway each year are not trucks, but cars driven by voters. 
 Ron Willever, a driver for a car service, who was at the Vince Lombardi stop on the turnpike on Thursday afternoon, put it this way, ''You might as well just sell your car.''

HEADLINE: Citing Drop in Inmate Population, Spitzer Plans to Close Four Prisons Upstate

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE and LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
The Spitzer administration announced on Friday a plan to close a medium-security prison and three minimum-security camps upstate, citing the declining crime and prison population across the state. Officials said the move would save taxpayers upward of $70 million in the next few years.
 The closing of the four prisons -- the medium-security Hudson Correctional Facility in Columbia County and the minimum-security camps Pharsalia in Chenango County, Gabriels in Franklin County and McGregor at Mount McGregor Correctional Facility in Saratoga County -- will be felt in the counties where the prisons have provided steady, good-paying jobs. 
 Republican lawmakers and the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association were highly critical of the plan, announced just days after Gov. Eliot Spitzer's pledge to work more closely with Republican leaders. 
 ''We are very concerned with his plan, especially in light of the governor's push to release criminals out of prison early through the parole system,'' said Mark Hansen, a spokesman for the Republican Senate majority. ''We have some very serious questions about his plan. We want to see his justification for this.'' Mr. Hansen said Mr. Spitzer's announcement was particularly distressing to lawmakers whose districts are home to the centers and whose communities depend on prison employment. 
 But officials from the New York State Department of Correctional Services said the proposed closings were not expected to cause significant layoffs because many employees could be absorbed into other prison department jobs.
 The officials said all four complexes were operating at about half capacity with a total of 939 inmates and 584 full- and part-time employees.
 The inmates will be transferred to other medium-security prisons when the four prisons are closed in January 2009, said Brian Fischer, the corrections commissioner. State law requires that such closings be announced a year in advance. 
 ''This is long in the works,'' Mr. Fischer said. ''We've been looking at this on and off for the last three, four years, and each year the number of inmates has gone down. The minimum-security facilities are underutilized. We have empty dorms. It's a good economic and management decision.''
 The closings are expected to save taxpayers $10.4 million in operating costs in the fiscal year 2008-9, $33.5 million annually in operating costs beginning in 2009-10 and $30 million in prison capital expenditures, according to the corrections department.
 Mr. Fischer said the closings would allow the corrections department to bolster programs for sex offenders, mental health treatment and community re-entry. New laws have enabled the department to move more nonviolent offenders out of correctional facilities and into their communities. 
 Over the past decade, the number of inmates at medium-security prisons decreased by 18 percent and the number at minimum-security facilities fell by 47 percent, according to corrections data. But this decline was countered by the rise of more violent offenders entering the system. Mr. Fischer said that the cost of meeting the physical and mental health needs of this new inmate population was rising and that the department's resources needed to be redirected to meet those needs.
 Larry Flanagan Jr., the president of the corrections officers' union, said in a statement on Friday that the union did not support the closings.
 ''We respect the fact that state leaders face trying fiscal times and many difficult decisions in the upcoming session,'' Mr. Flanagan said. ''But we remain committed to our members and the communities they work and live in. Along with educating all public officials that closing prisons should never be a first option.''
 The state's 69 correctional facilities held 62,243 inmates as of Friday, down from a peak of 71, 538 in 1999, the corrections department said. The department has about 31,000 employees. 
 ''I'm sure they have some concerns about the loss of certain jobs,'' Mr. Fischer said of the plan's critics. 
 ''There will be some impact, no question, on the local communities,'' he said. ''But my concern is that I have 32,000 employees. I have to be concerned about where I am going to place my employees in the long haul.''
 Separately on Friday, the New York State Office of Children and Family Services announced it would close six residential detention centers upstate for low-level juvenile offenders as part of a continuing effort to overhaul the juvenile justice system.
 The agency hoped to cut a total of 241 beds in the system's nonsecure and limited-secure facilities by next year.
 The centers being closed serve juveniles convicted of misdemeanors. None of the secure detention facilities that serve children convicted of more serious crimes will be closed.
 Juveniles usually sent to the nonsecure centers will instead be allowed to return to their communities on the condition that they and their families accept intensive counseling in their neighborhoods and homes for a period set by a family court judge.
 Gladys Carrion, the commissioner of the Office of Children and Family Services, said the governor had proposed to use savings from the closings, which the budget office estimated would be $16 million a year, to help pay for such locally based rehabilitation services. 
 ''What these children need is intervention and support,'' Ms. Carrion said. ''We want them to transition safely into the community and not go directly into the penal system, which happens too frequently now.''
 The state has been shrinking the residential detention system for children 16 and younger for years because it is widely seen as expensive and ineffective. The average annual cost of keeping a child in one of the centers runs from $140,000 to $200,000.

HEADLINE: INQUIRY FOCUSES ON WITHHOLDING OF DATA ON LOANS

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
An investigation into the mortgage crisis by New York State prosecutors is now focusing on whether Wall Street banks withheld crucial information about the risks posed by investments linked to subprime loans.
 Reports commissioned by the banks raised red flags about high-risk loans known as exceptions, which failed to meet even the lax credit standards of subprime mortgage companies and the Wall Street firms. But the banks did not disclose the details of these reports to credit-rating agencies or investors.
 The inquiry, which was opened last summer by New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, centers on how the banks bundled billions of dollars of exception loans and other subprime debt into complex mortgage investments, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Charges could be filed in coming weeks.
 In an interview Thursday, Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said his office was conducting a similar review and was cooperating with New York prosecutors. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating. 
 The inquiries highlight Wall Street's leading role in igniting the mortgage boom that has imploded with a burst of defaults and foreclosures. The crisis is sending shock waves through the financial world, and several big banks are expected to disclose additional losses on mortgage-related investments when they report earnings next week.
 As plunging home prices prompt talk of a recession, state prosecutors have zeroed in on the way investment banks handled exception loans. In recent years, lenders, with Wall Street's blessing, routinely waived their own credit guidelines, and the exceptions often became the rule.
 It is unclear how much of the $1 trillion subprime mortgage market is composed of exception loans. Some industry officials say such loans made up a quarter to a half of the portfolios they saw. In some cases, the loans accounted for as much as 80 percent. While exception loans are more likely to default than ordinary subprime loans, it is difficult to know how many of these loans have soured because banks disclose little information about them, officials say. 
 Wall Street banks bought many of the exception loans from subprime lenders, mixed them with other mortgages and pooled the resulting debt into securities for sale to investors around the world. 
 The banks also did not disclose how many exception loans were backing the securities they sold. In prospectuses filed with regulators, underwriters, in boilerplate legal language, typically said the exceptions accounted for a ''significant'' or ''substantial'' portion. Under securities laws, banks must disclose all material facts about the securities they underwrite. 
 ''Was there material information that should have been disclosed to investors and/or ratings agencies which was not? That is a legal issue,'' said Howard Glaser, a consultant based in Washington who worked for Mr. Cuomo when he was secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration.
 Mr. Blumenthal said the disclosures offered by banks in their securities filings appeared to be ''overbroad, useless reminders of risks.'' 
 ''They can't be disregarded as a potential defense,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''But a company that knows in effect that the disclosure is deceptive or misleading can't be shielded from accountability under many circumstances.''
 Under Connecticut law, Mr. Blumenthal could bring only civil charges in his inquiry. In New York The Martin Act in New York gives the attorney general broad powers to bring securities cases, and Mr. Cuomo could bring criminal as well as civil charges. 
 Mr. Cuomo, who declined to comment through a spokesman, subpoenaed several Wall Street banks last summer, including Lehman Brothers and Deutsche Bank, which are big underwriters of mortgage securities; the three major credit-rating companies: Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings; and a number of mortgage consultants, known as due diligence firms, which vetted the loans, among them Clayton Holdings in Connecticut and the Bohan Group, based in San Francisco. Mr. Blumenthal said his office issued up to 30 subpoenas in its investigation, which began in late August.
 Officials at Wall Street banks and the American Securitization Forum, which represents industry, declined to comment, as did the due diligence firms. Credit-rating firms would not say if they had been subpoenaed but said that they were generally not provided due diligence reports, even when they asked for them.
 The S.E.C. is also examining how Wall Street banks sold complex mortgage investments. The commission has about three dozen active investigations in the area, said Walter G. Ricciardi, the deputy director of enforcement. ''We have not yet concluded whether the securities laws were broken,'' he said. 
 Investment banks that buy mortgages require lenders to maintain standards outlining who is eligible for loans and how much they can borrow based on their overall credit history. But as home prices surged, subprime lenders, which market to people with weak credit, relaxed their guidelines. They began lending to people who did not provide documents verifying their income -- so-called no-doc loans -- and made exceptions for borrowers who fell short of even those standards. 
 The New Century Financial Corporation, for instance, waived its normal credit rules if home buyers put down large down payments, had substantial savings or demonstrated ''pride of ownership.'' The once-highflying lender, based in Irvine, Calif., filed for bankruptcy last year.
 William J. McKay, who was the chief credit officer at New Century, said the company usually made exceptions so homeowners could borrow more money than they qualified for under its rules. In most cases, the decisions raised borrowers' credit limits by 15 percent, he said.
 New Century measured pride of ownership in part by how well buyers maintained their homes relative to their neighbors, Mr. McKay said, adding that this usually was not enough on its own to qualify a borrower for an exception. 
 Investment banks often bought the exception loans, sometimes at a discount, and packaged them into securities. Deutsche Bank, for example, underwrote securities backed by $1.5 billion of New Century loans in 2006 that included a ''substantial'' portion of exceptions, according to the prospectus, which lists ''pride of ownership'' among the reasons the loans were made.
 Nearly 26 percent of the loans backing the pool are now delinquent, in foreclosure or have resulted in a repossessed home; some of the securities backed by the loans have been downgraded. 
 Mr. McKay defends the lending and diligence practices used in the industry. He said Wall Street banks examined exception loans carefully and sometimes declined to buy them. But they often bought them later among mortgages that New Century sold at a discount, he said. 
 Some industry officials said weak lending standards, not exceptions, were largely to blame for surging defaults. ''The problem is not that those exceptions are going bad -- you don't have a lot of exceptions in the pools,'' said Ronald F. Greenspan, a senior managing director at FTI Consulting, which has worked on the bankruptcies of many mortgage lenders. ''To me it's a more fundamental underwriting issue.''
 To vet mortgages, Wall Street underwriters hired outside due diligence firms to scrutinize loan documents for exceptions, errors and violations of lending laws. But Jay H. Meadows, the chief executive of Rapid Reporting, a firm based in Fort Worth that verifies borrowers'incomes for mortgage companies, said lenders and investment banks routinely ignored concerns raised by these consultants. 
 ''Common sense was sacrificed on the altar of materialism,'' Mr. Meadows said. ''We stopped checking.''
 And as mortgage lending boomed, many due diligence firms scaled back their checks at Wall Street's behest. By 2005 , the firms were evaluating as few as 5 percent of loans in mortgage pools they were buying, down from as much as 30 percent at the start of the decade, according to Kathleen Tillwitz, a senior vice president at DBRS, a credit-rating firm that has not been subpoenaed. These firms charged Wall Street banks about $350 to evaluate a loan, so sampling fewer loans cost less. 
 Furthermore, it was hard for due diligence firms to investigate no-doc loans and other types of mortgages that lacked standard documentation. 
 ''Years ago, it used to be, 'Did the due diligence firm think it was a good loan?'<0>'' Ms. Tillwitz said. ''We evolved into the current form, which is, 'Did I underwrite these loans to my guidelines, which can sometimes be vague and allow exceptions?'<0>''
 The attorneys general are leaning heavily on due diligence firms to provide information that could prove damaging to their clients, the investment banks.
 These firms played such a critical role in the mortgage securities business that New Century set aside up to eight large conference rooms in its offices where due diligence experts reviewed loan files. With billions of dollars worth of loans being traded monthly, these specialists had to keep up with a frenetic pace.
 ''There was somebody in most of the rooms all the time,'' Mr. McKay said.
 Federal lawmakers have highlighted due diligence in mortgages as a potential problem. A bill by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, that the House passed last year would require federal banking regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission to create due diligence standards. Another measure introduced by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, would subject banks to class-action lawsuits unless diligence was conducted by an independent firm.
 In recent months, Moody's and Fitch have said that they would like to receive third-party due diligence reports and that the information should be provided to investors, too. Glenn T. Costello, who heads the residential mortgage group at Fitch, said his firm would not rate securities that include loans from lenders whose procedures and loan files it was not allowed to review.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Ponder Divergent Rate Policies

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Can Europe's economy stay on track even if the United States goes off the rails?
 This old question is being asked with new urgency across the Continent, after a startling divergence this week in how the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve are reading economic tea leaves.
 The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled Thursday that the Fed would cut rates to try to ward off a recession. Earlier that day, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, told a news conference here that the signals on European growth were mixed. 
 A growing number of economists, convinced Europe is not as insulated from America's woes as many Europeans would like to believe, are questioning why, at such a sensitive moment, the European Central Bank is warning it might raise interest rates. 
 ''The E.C.B. sees the glass as half full; the Fed sees it as half empty,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ''It's not a difference in the data; it's a difference in the analysis.''
 The simplest explanation for the European Central Bank's hawkish demeanor is its inflation-fighting mandate. 
 Mr. Trichet, for example, has warned labor unions not to use Europe's inflation rate of 3.1 percent as a pretext for demanding steep wage increases. 
 But while Mr. Trichet has thrust himself into German labor negotiations, several economists argue that the bank is underestimating the impact in Europe of an American recession.
 The bank, Mr. Mayer said, still does not believe that the credit crisis originating in the American mortgage market poses a grave risk to Europe's economic prospects. That is why the bank, he said, is threatening a rate increase when it should be preparing for a rate cut.
 Disputing another train of thought popular in Europe, Jacques Cailloux, head of euro area economic research for the Royal Bank of Scotland, said, ''The E.C.B is wrong in its assessment that the emerging markets can offset the U.S. downturn.'' 
 He added, ''The whole idea of globalization is at odds with the thesis of decoupling.''
 Decoupling refers to the argument that Europe is not as dependent on the United States as it once was because Europe's exports to China and other emerging economies have grown so much faster than its exports to the United States.
 The thesis became fashionable in the last year as an explanation for the growth rate in the United States slowing as big European economies accelerated.
 In its World Economic Outlook last spring, the International Monetary Fund suggested that the faltering American economy had limited impact on world growth because American economic fragility was rooted in a troubled housing market -- a national phenomenon that was less subject to global contagion.
 The chapter was titled, ''Decoupling the Train'' but the authors put a question mark after the title, cautioning that housing woes could spill over into other areas of the American economy, in which case the troubles in the United States could become the world's troubles.
 This has proved to be the case, as the mortgage problems have mutated into a credit crisis that has become trans-Atlantic. European banks, like their counterparts in the United States, have been forced to write down billions of dollars in the value of complex securities backed by subprime mortgages.
 The European Central Bank responded as forcefully as any central bank to the turmoil caused by the credit squeeze. This week, it said it would inject another $20 billion into the financial system, the latest in a stream of liquidity injections since August.
 But Mr. Trichet has stopped short of saying that the financial crisis could halt European growth. At a news conference here on Thursday, after the bank left its benchmark rate unchanged at 4 percent, he said the signals on Europe's growth were mixed. ''Our baseline scenario remains one of ongoing growth, but risks are clearly on the downside,'' he said.
 For Mr. Mayer and other economists, the question is not whether the credit crisis will dent Europe's economy but when. Housing sales in Spain and Ireland -- two of Europe's hottest property markets -- have already dried up, he said, and France will not be far behind.
 ''Europe suffers from the same problems as the U.S. does,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''The trade linkages between Europe and the U.S. may have come down in recent years, but that is beside the point.''
 Mr. Cailloux of Royal Bank of Scotland said there was even a correlation between Germany's exports to China and its exports to the United States. As China exports less to the United States, Mr. Cailloux said, it has less demand for German exports, like machine tools. 
 ''Europe's exports to Asia are indirectly related to final demand in the U.S.,'' he said.
 This coupling will soon become apparent to the European Central Bank, Mr. Cailloux predicted. The bank's next shift in monetary policy, he said, would be a rate cut, not a rate increase.

HEADLINE: Japanese Approve Bill On Afghan War Mission

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Japanese government on Friday pushed through a special law authorizing its navy to resume a refueling mission in the Indian Ocean as part of the American-led military effort in Afghanistan. 
 In an extremely rare parliamentary move, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's governing Liberal Democratic Party used its two-thirds majority in Parliament's lower house to override a rejection of the law by the opposition-controlled upper house, an action not taken since 1951.
 The refueling mission, which was suspended in November after the opposition Democratic Party gained power in the upper house last summer, is expected to resume by the end of the month. 
 ''That our country can participate again in the 'war against terror' truly has great significance,'' Mr. Fukuda said in a statement. 
 A Japanese refueling vessel and a destroyer had operated in the Indian Ocean since 2001, supplying 132 million gallons of fuel to warships from the United States, Britain, Pakistan and other countries. Though the mission was not considered militarily significant, it carried political significance for a country whose military activities are severely curtailed by its pacifist Constitution. 
 The Democratic Party said it would endorse only missions led by the United Nations and said the Liberal Democrats were slavishly following the United States. 
 In forcing through the legislation, Mr. Fukuda, who took over the leadership from former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September, risks a backlash from a public that is divided over the mission. The public remains much more concerned about the economy and other issues. 
 J. Thomas Schieffer, the United States ambassador to Japan, immediately issued a statement welcoming the law. 
 Mr. Fukuda's approval ratings have fallen into the 30s because he has been unable to pass other legislation in Parliament since taking over as prime minister. 
 The Democratic Party, whose approval ratings have surpassed the governing party's in recent polls, is expected to press with renewed vigor for a dissolution of the lower house of Parliament and a general election.
 Yukio Hatoyama, the opposition party's secretary general, said his party enjoyed a greater popular mandate because it had won in the upper house election last summer. 
 ''The bill that was rejected by the upper house, based on the people's will, should have been abandoned,'' Mr. Hatoyama said, condemning the override. 
 Mr. Fukuda does not have to call a general election until the fall of 2009. But with the impasse in Parliament, he will probably be forced to do so and seek a popular mandate later this year.

HEADLINE: At a Child-Murder Trial, Raising Questions All Parents Face

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
 The prosecutor posed a series of questions about the challenges of raising children, the necessity of discipline, the ubiquity of corporal punishment, and the matter of how hard is too hard.
''Could you ever imagine a circumstance where you had to discipline a child and you got so mad that you lost it?'' she asked prospective jurors in the Brooklyn courtroom.
 Across the room, in a blue ribbed sweater and a leather jacket, sat Cesar Rodriguez, the stepfather and the accused killer of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, the victim of one of the most notorious murders in the city's recent history.
 Two years -- the anniversary was Friday -- after Nixzmary was found beaten to death in her family's Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment, Mr. Rodriguez's trial began this week with jury selection. 
 But seating a jury has also been particularly delicate, because unlike, say, a shooting, which most potential jurors have never experienced, what happened to Nixzmary Brown was a version, albeit a monstrously perverted one, of a universal human experience. 
 Every adult was once an unruly child in need of discipline. Every parent has had to discipline an unruly child. Of the dozens of jurors excused so far, several said the case reminded them too much of their own rough upbringings.
 And so, during the jury selection process, known as voir dire, the lawyers for both sides have taken great pains to frame the familiar concept of parental discipline in ways that support their theories.
 On Thursday, the prosecutor, Ama Dwimoh, chief of the Crimes Against Children Bureau of the Brooklyn district attorney's office, encouraged the prospective jurors to draw a clear line between discipline and abuse.
 ''When you were slapped on your arm, or twisted on your ear, did you ever suffer an injury?'' she asked. And later, ''Could you ever imagine a set of circumstances where you had a child and to punish them you were going to restrain them, tie them to a chair?''
 Mr. Rodriguez's lawyer, Jeffrey T. Schwartz, presented the issue as a much more slippery one.
 ''Would you all agree with me that parenting is a tricky subject?'' he asked. ''Would you agree that when it comes to parenting there is no absolute?'' He asked for a show of hands: How many of the prospective jurors had been hit as children? (Most.) How many had been hit with a strap or a belt? (Many.) 
 ''Cesar Rodriguez is not being charged with being a bad parent,'' he reminded the jury. ''He's being charged with murder. Can you all agree to keep that distinction?''
 Like everything else about the case, selection has been agonizingly slow. After four days and about 150 candidates, only 11 jurors of the 18 (there will be 6 alternates) have been picked.
 Much of this, of course, reflects the difficulty of finding people who have not already made up their minds about the case, which received considerable attention in the news media.
 One woman said Friday after being excused, ''I just read too many physical details about the case that made me feel nauseous. I can't physically be here.'' 
 It has also been tough to find 18 people able to put off all plans they have for the next five weeks, the expected length of Mr. Rodriguez's trial.
 Mr. Rodriguez, 29, said in a jailhouse interview with reporters that he had beaten Nixzmary frequently, sometimes using ''all my force.'' 
 But his lawyers said his wife, Nixzaliz Santiago, delivered the fatal blow. She will be tried separately after Mr. Rodriguez's trial.
 Both are accused of chronically abusing Nixzmary: depriving her of food, tying her to a chair and often locking her in her room, where she used a cat litter box. Nixzmary's battered, emaciated body was found in her home on Greene Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Jan. 11, 2006. 
 Mr. Rodriguez, then a newly unemployed security guard, told the authorities that on her last night alive, Nixzmary, one of five children in the household, took some yogurt without his permission and jammed his computer printer.
 So, he said, he dunked her head in a cold bath. Prosecutors said he also slammed her head on a faucet. They said her DNA was found beneath his fingernails. He was charged with second-degree murder.
 Nixzmary's death sparked one of the periodic paroxysms of hand-wringing and reform that accompany notoriously horrific child murders in the city. It is credited with single-handedly prompting a 150 percent increase in reports of child abuse in the last two years, a development that experts say has overwhelmed the Family Court system and lengthened stays in foster care.
 The Administration for Children's Services, which knew something of Nixzmary's abuse and missed chances to intervene, has tightened its guidelines on following up with allegations of child abuse.
 The cases against Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Santiago, meanwhile, have bogged down in endless motions and challenges to witnesses and psychologists' reports. 
 Mr. Schwartz tried to stop the clock again on Friday, telling the judge, L. Priscilla Hall of State Supreme Court, that he had just learned that prosecutors planned to hold Mr. Rodriguez responsible for helping Ms. Santiago cause Nixzmary's death, in addition to charging him with causing it directly himself. He said this threw a wrench in his plan to blame Ms. Santiago for the murder. The prosecutors said their plan had been laid out in court papers going back two years.
 And the prospective jurors flowed into and out of the courtroom, by the dozens, offering one reason after another why they could not serve. 
 On Friday, the judge spent two hours re-interviewing panel members who heard one prospective juror, a guard at Rikers Island, tell the court that he thought Mr. Rodriguez might have been housed on his unit. Jurors are not typically told that a defendant is incarcerated.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 19, 2008; February 22, 2008

 CORRECTION:
 An article last Saturday about jury selection in the murder trial of Cesar Rodriguez, the stepfather of Nixzmary Brown, a 7-year-old Brooklyn girl who was beaten to death two years ago, misidentified her home address in Bedford-Stuyvesant. It was Greene Avenue, not Green Street.
 An article on Jan. 12 about jury selection in the murder trial of Cesar Rodriguez, a Brooklyn man accused of fatally beating his 7-year-old stepdaughter, Nixzmary Brown, referred incorrectly to Mr. Rodriguez's courtroom attire. He wore handcuffs as he was led into and out of the courtroom while prospective jurors were absent; he was not wearing handcuffs, hidden beneath his leather jacket, in the presence of prospective jurors. A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message the day the article ran; this correction was delayed for research.

HEADLINE: Debt Relief Made Harder for Homeowners

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
Bankruptcy filings began climbing last year, as the housing crisis and rising consumer debt began to take their toll. 
 Filings plummeted in 2006 after reaching unusual heights in 2005, when consumers rushed to declare bankruptcy before a tough new law took effect that October. Total filings of both consumer and business bankruptcies last year were still far below what they were in 2004, the last ''normal'' year.
 Still, the number reached nearly 819,000 in 2007, according to Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, a bankruptcy data and management company in Oklahoma City. Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sEconomy.com, predicts it will exceed one million this year. 
 ''The traditional reasons for bankruptcy -- illness, divorce and job loss -- haven't gone away,'' said Deborah K. Thorne, an assistant professor of sociology at Ohio University whose expertise is in consumer debt and bankruptcy. ''With houses no longer A.T.M.'s for paying bills, that escape route is gone.'' 
 Nevada, with 10,666 filings in 2007, had the highest year-over-year increase in bankruptcy filings, at 110 percent, according to court records that A.A.C.E.R. examined. California, the nation's most populous state, was second with 70,638 filings, up 87 percent. With 38,981 total filings, Tennessee had the most per capita.
 People have two main options in seeking bankruptcy protection. They can file under Chapter 7, the so-called fresh start, which eliminates many unsecured debts like credit card charges and medical bills. Or they can file a Chapter 13 reorganization plan, which allows them to save their homes and cars but often requires that they repay some unsecured debts.
 Consumers who make more than their state's median income must pass a means test to file for Chapter 7, a crucial new element of current bankruptcy law. ''It is rare for a household with income less than $100,000 not to pass the Chapter 7 means test,'' said Henry J. Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys.
 For those who do not pass the test, their only other bankruptcy remedy is usually Chapter 13.
 According to an analysis of court records by Robert M. Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law, about 30 percent of those filing for bankruptcy protection throughout 2004 chose Chapter 13. But last November, Chapter 13s accounted for almost 40 percent.
 John Rao, a bankruptcy specialist and lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center in Boston, said he saw a spike six months ago in Chapter 13 filings because of consumers' mortgage problems.
 Professor Lawless, a bankruptcy specialist, also saw a connection between foreclosures and Chapter 13 filings. ''The new law has contributed to a higher percentage of Chapter 13s, but the mortgage crisis undoubtedly plays a role,'' he said. ''Distressed homeowners traditionally file Chapter 13 to save their homes.''
 In Las Vegas, Judge Bruce A. Markell of United States Bankruptcy Court has seen a larger percentage of Chapter 13s lately. But an increasing number are ''placeholder'' filings by consumers who have no possibility of affording their mortgages' resetting interest rates, he said.
 Unless a creditor is very diligent, a Chapter 13 filing stays a foreclosure for two or three months, Judge Markell explained: ''The placeholder filing buys you time to time to maneuver, to find another location.'' 
 But James F. Molleur, a bankruptcy lawyer in Saco, Me., said federal oversight, required under the new law, is also increasing the percentage of Chapter 13 filings, by focusing on debtors who file for Chapter 7. ''The Department of Justice's Trustee Program, which supervises bankruptcy law,'' he said, ''is conducting audits and investigations, looking for above-median-income debtors who file Chapter 7s and aggressively working to push them into Chapter 13s.''
 Jane Limprecht, a spokeswoman for the United States Trustee Program at the Justice Department, said it had no comment on Mr. Molleur's claim.
 Legislation pending in Congress could spur still more people to choose Chapter 13 to save their homes. For primary residences, the bills would allow bankruptcy judges to lower interest rates and reduce values to the current appraisals. These powers are similar to those that bankruptcy judges have for other types of secured loans under Chapter 13.
 ''Current bankruptcy law makes it easier for debtors to keep vacation homes, investment property and yachts than it does for them to keep their residences,'' said Mr. Sommer, of the bankruptcy lawyers' association. 
 The financial services industry opposes the legislation. Steve Bartlett, president and chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, an association in Washington representing the nation's largest lenders and securities dealers, said such changes would be ''a disaster for both consumers and the economy'' because they would drive up rates on new mortgages for everyone else and further disrupt the global securities market.
 Proponents of the 2005 bankruptcy law say it is working. ''For anybody who has real hardships and can't repay their debts, the bankruptcy safety net remains as strong as ever,'' Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who sponsored the legislation changing the bankruptcy rules as a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in an e-mail message.
 ''The reforms to bankruptcy law have helped ensure that people who are able to repay their debts are taking responsibility for at least some of their bills,'' Senator Grassley said. 
 Lois R. Lupica, a professor at the University of Maine School of Law, argued that there have never been many abusers in the bankruptcy system. ''What reform -- and I use that word loosely -- did was to make bankruptcy more expensive and cumbersome to file, and to scare people away from it.''
 Professor Lawless said that with consumers' debts higher than ever, ''only the increased cost of filing bankruptcy under the new law'' explains why there are fewer filings than under the old law. The new law's ambiguities, as well as increased liability for lawyers and demands for more paperwork on short deadlines, have pushed up legal fees considerably, he said. 
 ''You have to pay for Chapter 7 legal fees upfront in cash,'' he said. ''You can be too poor to go bankrupt.'' 
 Judge Markell in Nevada said the normal fee for a Chapter 13 in Las Vegas is now around $4,300, up from about $2,700 before the new law. 
 Chapter 13 may be the only remedy for wealthy consumers whose homes are worth less than they owe or who have unmanageable unsecured debts. ''Some considering bankruptcy will be shocked to find they may not be able to get a clean slate under the new law,'' said Jeffrey S. Conner, a San Francisco real estate lawyer. 
 Not everyone who wants a Chapter 13, which has always had debt limits, can get one. ''It's easy to be over the caps with home prices in places like California, and people who can no longer file a Chapter 7 are neither fish nor fowl,'' said David A. Tilem, a bankruptcy lawyer in Glendale, Calif. Their only bankruptcy remedy is a pricey plan under Chapter 11, which is used mostly by businesses. 
 Edward Alexander, 42, a Maine Army National Guard recruiter in Sanford, Me., decided to declare bankruptcy last year after a lender foreclosed on his house in Key West, Fla. The house had a $300,000 appraised value, $100,000 less than Mr. Alexander owed.
 ''I panicked,'' he recalled. ''I figured the lender was going to come after me hard.'' 
 Pushed over Maine's median income by his National Guard per diem, Mr. Alexander passed the means test for a Chapter 7. But Mr. Molleur advised him to make a filing under Chapter 13, through which he will pay a total $2,000 over five years on the $100,000 delinquency and avoid tax liability on it. ''I feel like the lead balloon over my head has gone away,'' Mr. Alexander said.
 Mr. Molleur has a different take. ''The Trustee Program feels vindicated by having more Chapter 13s to pad their statistics,'' he said, ''but many unsecured creditors do not really benefit.''
 Joseph Giacobbe, a mortgage specialist in Manhattan, and his wife felt the long arm of the United States Trustee Program after filing for Chapter 7 last April. They sought relief from $69,000 in unsecured debt, including $52,000 in credit card bills, partly incurred when the couple quit their jobs to care for Ms. Giacobbe's ailing parents.
 Filing for bankruptcy has been a nightmare, Mr. Giacobbe said.
 From his experience in the mortgage business, Mr. Giacobbe said he believed that only a Chapter 7 would help the couple's beleaguered credit scores recover quickly. 
 About two weeks after filing, the Giacobbes learned they were being audited at the direction of the Trustee Program, their lawyer, Stephen G. Doherty of Doylestown, Pa., said. 
 Ultimately, the Trustee Program argued that based on the couple's income and expenses, the couple did not qualify for a Chapter 7. Rather than fight the federal government in court, the Giacobbes voluntarily converted to a Chapter 13. A judge dismissed the Giacobbes' case on Wednesday after a trustee said payments had not arrived, and Mr. Doherty is now working to have the case reinstated.
 Crystal Erickson, 33, an artist and teacher in Portland, Me., is considering bankruptcy as she tries to communicate with her lender about a two-family dwelling she and her fiance, Dobol Luak, 34, a student, bought in September 2004. Ms. Erickson said the couple were not informed that they were taking out an interest-only loan with resetting interest rates. 
 The couple managed to make payments after the first reset but could not afford them after the second one last summer. The lender moved to foreclose late last year. 
 In a Chapter 13 case, a judge can change the terms of a loan for consumers who were victims of predatory lending.
 ''We don't want to move,'' Ms. Erickson said. ''We're part of this community, and from working with kids who live in public housing, I see that communities are created or destroyed depending on whether people have ownership in their homes.''
 Mike Henry, 48, a maintenance technician and single father from Madisonville, Tenn., said he reluctantly filed for Chapter 7 protection last year after spending most of his savings to pay medical bills. His legal fees were $1,350 and his court costs were $299.
 ''I felt a little relieved, but mostly guilty because I've always paid my debts all my life,'' Mr. Henry said.

HEADLINE: Getting Started, via the Web

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
NEARLY half of all mortgage shoppers use the Internet to do research on mortgages. How they find reliable information, though, is anyone's guess.
 As the housing market boomed, and brokers and lenders searched for places to advertise their services to prospective borrowers, the number of mortgage-related informational Web sites mushroomed. A recent Google search for ''fixed-rate mortgages,'' for instance, yielded more than 671,000 results. 
 So how does one choose mortgage sites? Carefully, according to Brad Strothkamp, who reviews financial services Web sites for Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm. ''It's a challenge,'' Mr. Strothkamp said. 
 For those unfamiliar with mortgages, there are established commercial Web sites like LendingTree.com and Bankrate.com that have tutorials on the borrowing process and the types of mortgages available, and guides for selecting products. 
 Other organizations, like the Mortgage Bankers Association and the Federal Reserve Board, also feature useful online tutorials. (The Mortgage Bankers' home loan guide is at HomeLoanLearningCenter.com, while the Fed's guide is at federalreserve.gov/pubs/mortgage/mortb--1.htm)
 From there, Mr. Strothkamp said, consumers should choose one of two separate paths, depending on how far along in the mortgage process they are. 
 Those who have just begun considering a new home loan will want to get a sense of the market conditions at a glance, and for them, Bankrate.com and HSH.com are among the popular publishers of current interest rates for various mortgage products.
 For those who are ready to make a home purchase or a mortgage refinance, Mr. Strothkamp recommended Web sites like LowerMyBills and LendingTree, where borrowers submit financial information and then receive loan offers, via e-mail, from lenders and brokers.
 Financial counselors also suggest that borrowers consult with a broker or a lender recommended by a friend or family member, and check their local bank for deals before negotiating. 
 Despite the shrinking mortgage market -- the industry lost more than 100,000 jobs, or 20 percent of its work force, from late 2006 through late 2007 -- new Web sites continue to sprout. Mr. Strothkamp says he believes two of them -- MortgageGrader.com and MortgageMarvel.com -- deserve consideration.
 MortgageMarvel is similar to Bankrate.com, in that consumers can get a quick look at interest rates for the loan they are considering, and then click directly to a lender's site to complete a loan application. MortgageMarvel requests basic information, including the loan amount, property value and ZIP code, then returns a list of rates offered by specific lenders. Unlike Bankrate, the site does not include advertisements, which makes it easier to navigate, Mr. Strothkamp said.
 MortgageGrader is a mortgage broker licensed in New York, Florida, California and Idaho, with more states to follow this year. The site accepts loan applications and displays mortgage offers within seconds. For finding and processing the loan, the site charges a flat fee of just under 1 percent of the mortgage amount. 
 Unlike the Web technology used by many mortgage brokers that offer online applications, MortgageGrader's does not disclose to lenders the address of the property on which the mortgage will be taken. Jeff Lazerson, the company's chief executive, says this prevents lenders from increasing the interest rates of borrowers in marginal areas.
 Mr. Lazerson's company received financing from the Ford Foundation. This, Mr. Strothkamp said, is a positive sign.

HEADLINE: Will Foreign Stocks Start to Disappoint?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
FOREIGN stock markets have been an ideal refuge from troubles at home: decelerating economic and earnings growth, subprime mortgages, a subpar housing market and a tumbling dollar. But after years of strong outperformance abroad, some fund managers are bringing their investors' money home.
 Profit-taking accounts for some of the desire to lighten up on foreign holdings, along with a belief that runaway bull markets have left many stocks trading at valuations that leave little scope for further gains. There is also concern that if conditions here continue to deteriorate, there may be few places anywhere for stock owners to hide.
 Foreign investing ''could become much less profitable for a whole host of reasons,'' warned Bill Riegel, head of global equity portfolio management at TIAA-CREF. While the distant future is bright for many overseas economies and markets, he said that ''it will be more difficult in the short run to make as much easy money internationally as has been made over the last two-plus years.''
 Michael L. Avery, chief investment officer of Waddell & Reed, says he detects ''a lot of anxiety'' among investors who have gone in quest of that easy money. He expressed some doubts of his own, even as he stated the case for overseas investment. 
 ''It makes more sense to us to look at companies that provide products or services to those who are enjoying faster growth than in the United States,'' he said. But he acknowledged that foreign economies will be hard-pressed to maintain their strength if American economic growth flags.
 ''If the U.S. economy does slow dramatically, is the rest of the world going to continue to grow?'' Mr. Avery asked. ''My gut tells me the answer is yes, but I have no way to prove that.''
 Whatever his gut says, another voice is telling him to be cautious over the next few months. He said he has hedged against declining share prices by selling short futures contracts pegged to indexes of foreign stocks, like the DAX in Germany and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, as well as American indexes.
 ''I'm not sure about the investment horizon between now and the end of the first quarter,'' Mr. Avery said.
 WHETHER they prefer foreign stocks or not, investment advisers are following the value of the dollar closely. Its relentless descent against other currencies over the last two years has made French designer handbags and Japanese cameras more expensive, and it has had the more salutary effect of raising prices of foreign stocks for Americans.
 The dollar's decline is invoked to support the bullish case for investing abroad -- and the bearish case.
 David Antonelli, global chief investment officer at MFS Investment Management, pointed out in a recent conference call with journalists that currency movements accounted for much of the superior returns of foreign stock indexes in the last few years.
 The more muted gains for overseas markets, when expressed in local currencies, persuade him that their strength is likely to persist. ''We think there should be more outperformance coming from international markets from earnings and valuations,'' Mr. Antonelli said.
 Other investors view the dollar's poor run differently. They cite the outsized impact on comparative returns as evidence that it is time to take the money -- whether in euros, British pounds, Japanese yen or Swiss francs -- and run.
 So many people are convinced that the dollar can only continue to fall, they say, that it is prudent to consider the possibility that it will move the other way. If it does, it will depress prices of foreign stocks for dollar-based investors.
 ''If you wanted to be a real contrarian, you would sell exposure outside the U.S. and make a big bet on the dollar,'' Mr. Avery said.
 Fund managers who are disinclined to do that are convinced that growth -- in broad economies, consumer spending and corporate profits -- will remain stronger abroad. Their view is held widely among ordinary investors. A report by Citigroup notes that a net $20.9 billion was removed from domestic equity funds last year through October, the most recent month for which figures were available, while international stock funds experienced a net inflow of $123.7 billion. 
 William Fries, co-manager of the Thornburg International Value fund, thinks that investors are merely making up for lost time.
 ''One of the reasons that we have continued to see cash flow into international funds is that a majority of retail investors have not participated to a great extent'' in the rally in overseas markets, he said. He pointed out that the foreign companies account for a far greater share of the global stock market than is reflected in the typical American portfolio.
 ''I would not characterize it as a trend that's long in the tooth,'' Mr. Fries said. ''We're still able to identify promising companies that are available at reasonable prices.''
 His other selections in Asia include Shinhan Bank in South Korea, a leader in consumer lending, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which operates the stock market there and should benefit when Chinese citizens are allowed to trade stocks listed in Hong Kong, Mr. Fries said.
 The hallmark of his choices in Europe is stable earnings growth. He mentioned Novo Nordisk, a Danish health care company; the German utility E.ON; and several telephone companies: France Telecom, Telefonica in Spain and the British mobile phone service provider Vodafone.
 Mr. Riegel, at TIAA-CREF, is sticking with multinational blue chips and avoiding businesses that rely on exports to the United States, in line with his cautious outlook. ''If we tip over into a gloom-and-doom scenario, you want big companies to help protect yourself,'' he explained.
 Two of his favorites are pharmaceutical companies, Bayer in Germany and Roche in Switzerland. He also likes the German conglomerate Siemens, which has a new, restructuring-minded chief executive. Siemens is also benefiting from ''selling a tremendous number of goods and services into China,'' he said.
 Mr. Riegel finds the pickings slim among Asian stocks. Valuations are too high in mainland countries, he said. As for Japan, the market ''is looking very cheap, but the government there has repeatedly shot itself in the foot'' by not putting into effect measures that might stimulate economic growth.
 Nintendo, the game console maker, is an exception to two of his rules: it is a Japanese company that exports to the United States. He likes it anyway because its ''new Wii platform is something that just inspires total awe.''
 The platform is even attracting older people -- ''a whole new group of users that were never imagined to be customers,'' as he put it. He noted that the Wii has become a fixture in retirement homes, where residents play golf and tennis on it.
 MR. AVERY at Waddell & Reed is also an admirer of Nintendo, and for the same reason.
 ''They have broadened the demographic of the video game user beyond the kid with a shaggy haircut and torn T-shirt,'' he said. ''That's pretty clever.''
 His other selections include Rio Tinto, the British-Australian mining concern; Veolia Environnement, a French producer of water treatment systems; and China Mobile. That phone company is adding more than six million subscribers a month, he noted, yet mobile phone use is still far less common in China than it is in the developed world when measured by percentage of the population.
 Apart from considering holding stocks like these, Mr. Avery encouraged investors to be extremely circumspect about putting money into global markets today.
 ''We think the best strategy is to be as defensive as you can possibly be and take a wait-and-see approach,'' he said. ''You don't need to be a hero here.''

HEADLINE: A Power Trip With Green Detours

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
HEAR the noise, feel the thunder, experience the lightning! Detroit is firing up the pyrotechnics as it prepares to play host to the 2008 North American International Auto Show. Perhaps all the hoopla will make it easier for the industry to forget, just for a while, the stark new realities of the showroom, where car buyers seem to be falling out of love with the kinds of vehicles that made Detroit the capital of the automobile world.
 The huge auto show at Cobo Center downtown, where press previews start Sunday and doors open to the public on Saturday, Jan. 19 (through Jan. 27), is historically a loud, flashy and mostly unapologetic celebration of tire-burning, gas-guzzling, budget-busting vehicles, from big trucks and S.U.V.'s to racy sports cars and ostentatious luxury cruisers. Despite the considerable lip service that will be paid to green technologies, and a sizable fleet of concept cars showcasing various green ideas, the theme song of the show could well be ''And the Band Played On.'' 
 The auto industry in America faces a historic transformation. The playing field changed last Dec. 19, when President Bush signed a federal law mandating a 40 percent improvement in fuel economy by 2020. Later, 16 state governments and several environmental groups sued the federal government for the right to enact tougher emissions laws. And the year ended with new vehicle sales at the lowest level since 1998, amid shrinking demand for Detroit's bread-and-butter models.
 So, what significant new model introductions are Detroit's Big Three showcasing here? Essentially, it seems, even more of the same-old, same-old.
 Ford is unveiling the new full-size F-150 pickup, still the nation's most popular vehicle despite a sales meltdown late last year. (F-150 sales plunged by 105,000 units in 2007.) Development of the F-150, a truly crucial product for the troubled Ford Motor Company, was reportedly delayed for several months in 2006 for unspecified engineering changes intended to make the truck more competitive. Those changes, however, did not include making the F-150 smaller, lighter, less expensive or more environmentally friendly.
 At the show, Ford is also unveiling the Explorer America, a concept vehicle that suggests the next-generation Explorer may look a lot like a Brinks armored car. Ford says the next Explorer will be powered, like several of its new vehicles, by smaller, lighter, more efficient engines that can be souped-up with turbochargers and direct fuel injection. 
 Ford's new 2009 F-150 will have some company, as Chrysler is expected to introduce a rival truck, the 2009 Dodge Ram, with a cattle run through the downtown streets.
 The new Ram is said to have a more comfortable suspension, a nicer interior and other convenience features. But the Ram's improvements, like those for the F-150 (which will be offered in a new, high-end Platinum model) have little to do with environmental concerns.
 The other hometown company, General Motors, will put aside its greener-than-green marketing campaign for a while to make the show's most over-the-top introduction -- a 620-horsepower Corvette ZR1 -- the fastest, most powerful and most expensive Chevrolet in history. The Elvis of the auto show, this $100,000-plus limited-edition supercar has received breathless coverage in the enthusiast press.
 Lest showgoers fail to grasp G.M.'s message of horsepower hegemony, the company is also introducing a high-performance Cadillac, the CTS-V, offering 500-plus horsepower.
 These unveilings are coming, in a bit of awkward timing, just days after G.M. announced that it would not replace the Cadillac Northstar V-8 engines that are proving a tougher sell when the company's latest V-6s cost less, weigh less and get better mileage with little loss of performance.
 So where is that next generation of vehicles capable of meeting those federal mandates, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and pioneering uses of alternative forms of propulsion? They seem to exist, for the most part, still somewhere over the rainbow and in television commercials. 
 Sales of the second-generation Toyota Prius hybrid, a relatively old model due for replacement before long, nonetheless soared 70 percent last year, with more than 180,000 sales in the United States alone. But Detroit automakers still have no equivalent vehicle -- a compact sedan with a full hybrid system and a design not shared with gasoline models -- though they have had since 1999 to develop one. A potential game-changer like the Chevrolet's Volt electric vehicle won't arrive until 2010, G.M. says.
 Last fall at the Frankfurt Motor Show, organizers emphatically pushed a ''sustainable mobility'' theme that seemed to signal a shift in industry attitudes toward more eco-friendly vehicles. Most manufacturers responded enthusiastically, showcasing every green idea in their brain trusts. The approach drew applause from the public, the environmental community, government leaders and even investors. 
 But the spirit of Frankfurt seems to have hit a headwind in Detroit, where automakers show no signs of hopping off the horsepower bandwagon anytime soon. And the high-revving parade is likely to continue at auto shows in Chicago and New York, where the pony car performance wars will be rekindled with the debuts of three production cars: the 2010 Mustang, the 2009 Dodge Challenger and the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro. From an environmental standpoint, perhaps the most significant introduction is a version of the Saturn Vue Green Line with a new two-mode hybrid system. The Vue will have the first application in a front-drive vehicle, and the first with a V-6 engine, of a new gas-electric hybrid system developed jointly by G.M., BMW and the former DaimlerChrysler. The system, which G.M. says can improve city fuel economy by as much as 40 percent, previously made its debut in full-size trucks with four-wheel drive and V-8 engines. But the two-mode system, which will have limited production, is expected to cost thousands of dollars extra.
 Chrysler will unveil three concept vehicles to serve as showcases for advanced environmental technologies. But while these are technologically feasible, they are likely to be well beyond the limited development budget of the privately owned Chrysler. 
 Otherwise, the roster of Detroit debutantes is heavily laden with fairly conventional S.U.V.'s, car-based crossover wagons and big-engine sports cars. Only a handful of new sedans are being introduced, including the Hyundai Genesis, an upscale rear-drive sport sedan with a powerful V-8 and the Volkswagen Passat CC, a four-door car with a coupelike roofline. Mitsubishi is showing a sporty coupe, the Concept-RA, a hint of the next Eclipse.
 Variations of vehicles introduced at overseas auto shows will be also make their debuts, including a BMW 1 Series convertible; a sedan version of the Ford Verve subcompact car; and BMW's X6 crossover. Land Rover is showing a sleek LRX concept, currently in development in limbo until the company's ownership picture is clarified; Tata, of India, is believed to be close to a deal with Ford to buy both Land Rover and Jaguar.
 S.U.V.'s and crossovers continue to proliferate. Honda is showing the next generation of its popular Pilot. Mercedes-Benz is offering its new GLK, a smaller crossover based on the C-Class, which will compete with the BMW X3. Nissan has the Forum, a new minivan-meets-shoebox concept; and Hummer has the scaled-down HX, a concept that may signal the brand's aspiration to expand overseas.
 After taking some heat for its previous introductions of monstrous trucks, like the Tundra pickup and Sequoia S.U.V., Toyota will use the 2008 Detroit show to highlight two small, efficient vehicles: the Venza compact crossoverand the A-BAT hybrid, which has been called a Prius pickup truck.
 With hybrid show cars proliferating, even a custom coachbuilder like Fisker Coachbuild is getting into the act. The company, which has been rebodying BMW and Mercedes sports cars, will be showing a premium-priced plug-in hybrid luxury sedan.

HEADLINE: A War of the States Over Dredging Rules

BYLINE: By TIM WACKER

 BODY:
IN October, Connecticut officials told the Post Road Boat Yard in Westchester that the marina had until Nov. 1 to produce the necessary New York permits before they would sign off on plans to place material from dredging in Long Island Sound.
 Normally, the permits, which are required by both states, take at least four months to acquire, but New York issued the marina a permit in just 10 days. 
 That Connecticut had set such a short deadline, and that New York rushed to meet it, is a reflection of a long-running feud between the two states over the dumping of dredge spoils in the Sound.
 ''The marinas are a ball in a Ping-Pong game the two states have been playing for years,'' said Daniel S. Natchez, an environmental engineer and 20-year industry veteran who was handling the state and federal dredging permit applications for the Post Road marina, which is in Mamaroneck Harbor. ''Basically, what Connecticut was doing with that deadline was thumbing its nose at New York State.'' 
 Such are the complexities of dredging in Long Island Sound.
 The 1,320-square-mile Sound is almost evenly owned by Connecticut and New York, but the states have fought for years over who gets to dump what, and where, and marina owners say they have been caught in the middle. Larger boats can no longer reach some marinas, industry officials say. 
 Connecticut says that placing dredge materials in the Sound is the only economically feasible way to keep its river-fed ports open and thriving. New York says the sediment dredged from Connecticut's old industrial ports is so polluted that it is a prime suspect in the demise of the Sound's lobster industry. New York wants alternatives explored and used.
 The upshot, Mr. Natchez and state and federal officials involved in the disputes say, is that when it comes to setting dredging policy concerning the Sound, the states have worked against each other more than they have cooperated. 
 Federal efforts to work out an agreement with the states are under way. Under a settlement reached last year, the plan for disposing of dredging materials must be in place by 2014 or all dredge dumping in the Sound must stop.
 ''I wouldn't call it petty infighting, I'd call it philosophical warfare,'' said Michael Ludwig, an aquatic resources specialist who worked on Sound issues for three decades for the National Marine Fisheries Service before going into private consulting last year.
 The interstate battle, however well intentioned by both sides, has been costly, he said.
 ''In the process, access to Long Island Sound is drying up,'' Mr. Ludwig said. ''Many marinas that used to be able to hold bigger boats can't anymore because they couldn't get or use the necessary dredging permits.''
 Historically, Connecticut's Westbrook Harbor channel, to which the public has access, has been kept at nine feet deep by the Army Corps of Engineers. These days it is close to two feet deep in some spots and rarely deeper than five at low tide, said Rives Potts, general manager at Pilots Point Marina in Westbrook, Conn.
 Access to the marina itself could also stand some dredging, but New York's opposition to dumping in the Sound has made dredging difficult and expensive, Mr. Potts said. That has put a chill on all dredging projects, public and private, he said, and that has put a damper on business at Pilots Point.
 ''A lot of our service business was large boats, but they just don't come here anymore,'' he said. ''We used to have 110 employees. Now we have 75, and it's due to the poor channel depth. At the same time, the cost of dredging has gone way up and the cost of permitting has gone way up.''
 The conflict results in part from federal legislation called the Ambro Amendment. Named after Jerome A. Ambro, a United States representative from Long Island from 1975 to 1981, this 1980 amendment made Long Island Sound the only non-ocean in the country protected under the stringent testing requirements of the 1972 Ocean Dumping Act. That gives New York powerful tools to challenge dredge dumping plans.
 Despite the Ambro Amendment, dredge dumping in the Sound still occurred after 1980. Most notably, 1.3 million cubic yards of Thames River-bottom sediments were dredged in 1996 and dumped in the Sound so the Seawolf submarine could be berthed in Groton, Conn. Shortly after, a disfiguring disease known as shell burn started turning up in lobster caught in the shadow of the dump site, and fishermen from New York's nearby Fishers Island put the blame on the dredge material.
 New York went to federal court to halt the project, saying the dredge material did not meet Ocean Dumping Act standards, and a settlement was reached that resulted in greater enforcement of the Ambro Amendment. 
 That is when dredging bills at Pilots Point Marina started to skyrocket, Mr. Potts said. The cost for dredging has risen to $15 per cubic yard, from $7 before the Ambro Amendment, Mr. Potts said. Even a small dredging project like that at Post Road can be more than 20,000 cubic yards, Mr. Natchez said. 
 The cost of testing sediments for contaminants before dredging has also soared, Mr. Potts said.
 The dispute between the states entered a new phase three years ago when the United States Environmental Protection Agency intervened. It tried to get areas of the Sound historically used as dumps for dredge material exempted from the Ocean Dumping Act, but New York objected, citing the presence of contaminants like polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and radioactive material in sediments from the Housatonic River in Connecticut.
 In its 25-page document challenging the E.P.A. action, New York also said that the presence of radioactive cobalt-60 from Thames River sediments in ''the open-water marine environment could result in rendering certain commercially and recreationally important marine species unacceptable for human use.''
 Those objections resulted in a settlement last year in which the E.P.A. called on the Army Corps of Engineers to work with the two states to prepare a dredge-material management plan that will assess the dredging requirements for each port on the Sound and how best to test for contaminants in the sediments there. The plan must also explore alternatives to dumping dredge materials in the Sound and examine when such alternatives can or must be used.
 Michael F. Keegan, project manager for the Corps of Engineers, called forging the plan ''a daunting task,'' but said, ''I see a great spirit of cooperation and trying to move forward here.''
 George Wisker, an environmental analyst with Connecticut's Office of Long Island Sound Programs, said the state gets five or six dredging applications a year for projects that affect anywhere from a few dozen to several thousand boats. 
 Mr. Wisker said that working with New York on the dredging-material management plan had been and would continue to be a challenge. But he said he was optimistic that the states had turned a corner in their dispute.
 The bigger problem, he said, will be getting Congress to finance the plan, which the Corps of Engineers has estimated would cost $16 million. The 2008 federal budget includes only $2.6 million for the plan, and it has yet to be approved. 
 Without federal money, the plan will not advance, Mr. Wisker said. ''People have strong feelings on both sides,'' he said, ''but we're trying to craft something that will work for all of us.''

HEADLINE: What's Next?

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
LOOKING back, 2007 was supposed to be the year that the Manhattan residential real estate market slowed down and began to look a bit more like the slumping national market. 
 But that didn't happen. While there were periods when condominiums and co-ops sat unsold because buyers and sellers couldn't agree on prices, the year ended with the average price of a Manhattan apartment rising to a record $1.4 million, though the number ballooned in part because so many wealthy buyers purchased extraordinarily expensive condos. 
 No one is predicting that 2008 will be a repeat of 2007. The sprawling pieds-a-terre may still sell for millions at the Plaza and 15 Central Park West, but in general, economists are predicting that prices will drop in some segments of the market and in some neighborhoods around the city. 
 ''New York has had a very good run, and there are still a lot of people sitting around with cash,'' said Christopher Mayer, the Paul Milstein professor of real estate at Columbia Business School. ''But that doesn't last forever.'' 
 There are already signs of a more sober market ahead: Wall Street workers may face leaner bonuses this year and in years to come, borrowers may have a harder time getting mortgages and foreign buyers may reconsider the potential returns of investing in New York. 
 Mr. Mayer said that a national recession could weaken Manhattan prices even further because fewer workers could afford to buy in the borough. 
 Diane M. Ramirez, president of Halstead Property, is less concerned about a recession because the inventory of property on the market is currently low. She said that in the recession of the late '80s, Manhattan dropped sharply because the city had an oversupply of apartments. ''We had a deeper, longer recession than most cities,'' she said. ''We lost 20 to 50 percent value.'' 
 When trying to gauge the real estate market -- or, for that matter, the city's economic outlook -- the first stop is always Wall Street.
 Wall Street jobs make up 5 percent of the total jobs in New York City but 23 percent of the city's total wages, according to data tracked by the New York State DepartmenticesLabor. Annual bonuses are also tracked by real estate brokers with a fanatical devotion. 
 History shows that a great deal of the bonus money is used to buy real estate. Financial workers are typically the first buyers to show up with the cash in the spring buying market, and this helps shape demand for apartments.
 ''That energy of the bonus money really does get the spring market percolating,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''The bonus tends to be the starting gate for them.''
 While it may seem counterintuitive, considering how much havoc the subprime crisis has brought to the financial industry, one analyst is predicting that 2007 bonuses, which workers will receive over the next couple of months, will be about the same as last year's record bonus year for some bankers.
 These workers are compensated based on their performance for the whole year, and most banks did well leading up to the credit crisis last summer. So, while workers may not earn more than they did in 2006, they could still have plenty of money to put toward real estate. 
 Alan Johnson, the managing director of Johnson Associates, a firm that tracks compensation data, said that over all, bonuses should remain flat for a broad spectrum of the financial industry. ''This year was a pretty good year for bonuses, roughly on par with 2006, some of them less, some of them more,'' he said.
 But, he said, that won't necessarily be true a year from now, and this knowledge could keep traders and investment bankers from splurging on real estate this year as they have in past years. 
 ''Everybody sees the storm clouds on the horizon,'' because Wall Street firms have already had write-downs of more than $100 billion from their mortgage-backed securities businesses, Mr. Johnson said. ''If you're going to commit to some big purchase, it makes you pause. Your pay may go down.'' 
 He predicts that by the end of 2008 employees at the top will be hurt the most: those whose total compensation of salaries and bonuses is more than $1 million could see cuts by 40 to 50 percent; those in the $500,000 to $1 million range could see cuts of about 20 percent; and those with pay of less than $500,000 could see 10 percent cuts. 
 Shai Shustik, the president of the brokerage firm Manhattan Residential Inc., which has many clients who work on Wall Street, says they are proceeding with more caution. ''I don't think people are as gung-ho and anxious to get out there and spend everything they made, like they did in 2007,'' he said. ''People aren't going to stretch as much.'' In the past, ''the guys who tell you they're spending $2 million spend $2.4 million or $2.6 million,'' he said. ''Now, they want to stick to $2 million.''
 Many of these Wall Street employees might also find that their bonuses are being paid less in cash and more in stock. 
 Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, said that one banker who had negotiated the contract on a $9 million town house had to pull out of the deal because he found out he would receive only $750,000 in cash from his total bonus. The remainder would take other forms, like stock, meaning that he would have less to spend in the near term on real estate. ''He's gone from the $9 million to $10 million range to the $5 million to $6 million range,'' she said. ''Everyone in general is being more conservative.''
 Moving beyond bonuses, the fallout from the mortgage crisis is likely to touch a broad swath of the real estate market. Qualifying for mortgages, for instance, may be more problematic this year for buyers in all price ranges. The mortgage crisis, which was set off by defaulting subprime loans last summer, has forced lenders to tighten their standards across the board in both Manhattan and the boroughs. 
 Richard Barenblatt, a mortgage broker with the Apple Mortgage Corporation, advises his clients to prepare themselves for far stricter mortgage requirements than they would have faced six months ago. 
 For starters, lenders expect borrowers to make higher down payments for co-ops and condos. He said that before the broad defaults on subprime mortgages forced banks this past summer to tighten standards, buyers with good credit applying for full-income verification loans could qualify for mortgages worth 95 percent of the purchase price up to $1 million. Now these same buyers qualify for mortgages valued at only 90 percent of the price up to $1 million. 
 Some lenders are also requiring borrowers to have more money in reserve; for example, borrowers applying for jumbo mortgages -- those surpassing $417,000 -- may need to show that they have the equivalent of up to 12 months of mortgage payments in cash after closing. 
 Mr. Barenblatt encourages buyers to pay down credit card balances below 40 percent of their total combined credit card limits; for buyers with debt levels above that, he said, banks are less likely to approve mortgages.
 He also thinks buyers should talk to their lawyers about getting mortgage and appraisal contingencies written into their contracts. A contingency is a clause that allows a buyer to back out of a deal if he or she can't find a mortgage, if the lender changes the terms of the mortgage before closing or if an appraisal comes in unexpectedly low. In the past, sellers in Manhattan have often balked at contingencies, because there was usually another buyer waiting in the wings willing to buy without one. Mr. Barenblatt also encourages buyers to try to get preapproved for mortgages.
 Condo buyers might find extra scrutiny when visiting the mortgage broker because lenders have seen too many cities around the country where new condos are sitting vacant or unfinished. 
 Some major lenders in New York have stopped giving mortgages at condo projects where the developer has not sold 90 percent of the units. These banks are imposing even stricter standards than those Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are putting into effect on March 1 for mortgages below $417,000, according to Brad German, a spokesman for Freddie Mac. The threshold for the two government lenders: 51 percent of units must be sold. 
 ''We changed our guidelines in response to shifts in the real estate market, including oversupplies in Florida, Las Vegas, Arizona and other condo markets outside of New York City,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Our mortgage purchase guidelines are national in scope.'' 
 These national guidelines are making it more difficult for condo buyers in Manhattan. Foreign buyers and financial industry employees have paid top dollar for these new apartments in the last year precisely because they required less money down and had more flexible requirements than co-ops. 
 Ms. Cohn of Manhattan Mortgage tells of clients who have had mortgage applications rejected by some banks because the building where they wanted to buy was not 90 percent sold out. ''There has been an apocalyptic change in the lending market,'' she said. ''Banks that were market leaders have eliminated numbers of programs and products and have made sweeping changes.'' 
 Foreign buyers, who have made about a third of the condo purchases in the last 18 months, have done so because they see it as a wise investment considering the weakness of the dollar, said Mr. Mayer of Columbia Business School. But, he added, even foreign buyers will walk away from deals if they don't think Manhattan prices will remain strong or if they cannot expect high returns on their investments.
 ''They don't need to buy real estate to make a bet on the dollar,'' he said. 
 All of these situations could create a window of opportunity for buyers. In fact, certain market segments have already started to show signs of slowing. 
 Sofia Kim, who is the head of research for StreetEasy.com, said that out of the 24,000 apartments listed by the site at some point in 2007, about 20 percent, or 4,800, had cut prices, by an average of 8 percent. 
 Most sellers who cut their prices were offering one- and two-bedroom co-ops, Ms. Kim said. These price cuts were concentrated on the Upper East Side and in Chelsea, Greenwich Village and Midtown. In the coming year, she expects that sellers may continue to cut their prices if sales are slow.
 Prices in Inwood and Hudson Heights, in the northern reaches of Manhattan, had dropped about 5 percent by the end of last year, according to fourth-quarter data released by Halstead Property. 
 Data from the Corcoran Group, tracking sales in Brooklyn in the fourth quarter of 2007, show that prices on certain types of apartments in coveted neighborhoods like Park Slope and Fort Greene had dropped slightly.
 Some neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint have had 15 percent price drops from their peak in the summer of 2005, and sellers are negotiating deals, said David Maundrell, the president of Aptsandlofts.com, a Williamsburg brokerage. 
 Brooklyn buyers, he said, have been especially fortunate in negotiating deals on new condos. Developers of new condos with fewer than 10 units have agreed to pay closing costs for buyers, while developers of larger projects have been willing to negotiate on price. ''Most of my guys in the larger buildings will consider any offer,'' Mr. Maundrell said.
 Prices in New York City are not expected to be significantly affected by foreclosures this year, as the number of foreclosures in the city's outlying neighborhoods is rising, but still low. Fourth-quarter data tracked by PropertyShark.com show that there were 605 foreclosures throughout New York City in the fourth quarter of 2007, a 71 percent increase over the 354 foreclosures in the same period in 2006. 
 But that is in a city of three million households and represents only 0.02 percent of New York City inventory. That's far less than in Miami, which has a 0.25 percent foreclosure rate, and Los Angeles, which has a 0.21 percent foreclosure rate. 
 Ryan Slack, the chief executive of PropertyShark, said that the New York numbers may rise steadily through 2008, but they will still represent only a tiny share of the overall market. ''They're not that high a percentage of the inventory,'' he said. ''If you're selling into the market, you're going to be more affected by the dynamics of buyers and sellers than foreclosures.''
 The rental market, which has been exceptionally tight for the last few years, is also showing some signs of loosening up. Marc Lewis, the chief operating officer of rentals and investment sales at Century 21 Fine Homes and Estates, says that the rental market slowed in the middle of September and has not picked up since. 
 The December survey of 10,000 apartments tracked by the Real Estate Group New York shows that the rental market fell from the previous month, especially on the Upper West and East Sides, and in Midtown East, Gramercy Park and SoHo. Some declines were striking; rent in studios in doorman buildings in the financial district, for example, dropped by $503, to $2,559 a month. 
 Mr. Lewis said there were fewer new hires relocating to Manhattan for jobs and paying high rents. He said that landlords were much more willing to pay commissions, offer a free month's rent or both. And, he said, they're much more willing to negotiate on apartments that rent for more than $2,000.
 ''If they have an apartment that's empty for a week or two or a month, they'll entertain an offer,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''It's definitely going to continue for the next three, four or five months.''
 In the end, economists and real estate brokers say they don't expect Manhattan to suffer as severe a housing slump as the rest of the nation because there hasn't been as much overbuilding. 
 That's because banks stopped lending to developers to build more condos and developers turned nearly a third of the sites into other uses like hotels, offices and rental buildings, said Robert Knakal, the chairman of the commercial real estate brokerage Massey Knakal Realty Services Inc., based on what he saw from the projects that his company had marketed. 
 In addition, more of the condos that were built were snapped up by more Wall Street bankers and foreign buyers than some real estate industry experts had originally expected.
 ''What this means for the consumer is that there will be product available for them to look at, but not a significant oversupply,'' Mr. Knakal wrote in an e-mail message. He added, ''Buyers who are on the sidelines waiting for prices to drop significantly before buying may be there for a long time.''

HEADLINE: Building a Star Fund, at Its Brother's Expense

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
EVEN in mutual fund families, parents play favorites. It now turns out that fund families sometimes use advertising budgets for the benefit of some of their funds, to the detriment of others.
 Fund favoritism has been documented before, but a new study, ''Spillover Effects of Marketing in Mutual Fund Families,'' takes the subject a step further. The authors of the working paper, which has been circulating for several months in academic circles, are two finance professors at RSM Erasmus University in the Netherlands, Joop Huij and Marno Verbeek. A version is online, on the Social Science Research Network.
 Favoritism could be a big problem for investors because very few funds these days are stand-alone offerings. More than 95 percent of domestic equity funds in the United States are owned by companies that also own at least one other fund, according to the study. This proportion has grown steadily over the years; in 1992, it was around 80 percent. 
 To appreciate the new study's findings, it may be helpful to understand what could lead fund families to even want to play favorites. What advantage can they gain by doing so? Wouldn't the funds that are disadvantaged fare worse in direct proportion to the benefit realized by the favored funds?
 The answer lies in the way investors typically react to fund performance rankings. A fund that finishes at or near the top of the rankings is likely to attract a substantial amount of new money. Yet, curiously, funds that are in the middle or even near the bottom of those rankings do not typically suffer proportionately large outflows. In other words, top-ranked funds enjoy a benefit much greater than the disadvantage seen for lower-ranked funds.
 This asymmetry provides a fund family with the motivation to play favorites. Because the earnings of a mutual fund company are a function of total assets under management among all its funds, it will earn more when one of its funds is at or near the top of the rankings -- regardless of where its other funds may be ranked. In effect, a conflict of interest exists between a fund family's drive to maximize its overall income and the desire of investors in each of its funds to earn the greatest possible return.
 Consider two hypothetical fund families, each with a pair of mutual funds. Imagine that each of the two funds in the first group gains 20 percent in a given year, while the two funds in the second family gain 40 percent and 0 percent, respectively. The average performance of the two families' funds will be the same, but if the pattern found in past research persists, the fund family that will have the greatest net inflow of assets -- and, hence, the one whose total management fees will grow fastest -- will be the one with the star performer and the dud.
 This pattern holds even when one of a family's funds is at or near the very bottom of the ratings. Though past research has found that this bottom performer will experience a significant number of redemptions from disgruntled investors, the outflow of cash will still be disproportionately less than the inflows typically seen when a fund is at the top of the heap.
 One early academic study, discussed in this column more than four years ago, found evidence of favoritism in the ways fund families sometimes allocate trades among their individual funds. When a family receives an allotment of shares from a company going public, for example, it will often assign a disproportionate number to funds that are within shouting distance of the top of the rankings. In addition, that study found, a family's poorer-performing funds will sometimes take the opposite side of trades undertaken by the family's star funds; this has the effect of transferring performance to those stars.
 (That earlier study, ''Favoritism in Mutual Fund Families? Evidence on Strategic Cross-Fund Subsidization,'' was conducted by two finance professors at French business schools, Jose-Miguel Gaspar of Essec and Massimo Massa of Insead, along with Pedro Matos, now a finance professor at the University of Southern California.)
 The new study from the professors in the Netherlands is the first to find evidence that fund families are also playing favorites in allocating advertising expenses among individual funds. The authors studied all diversified equity funds in the United States that were part of a fund family over the dozen years from January 1992 through 2003. In the complex econometric tests the authors devised, they came across a subset of funds whose inflows were significantly greater than they would have expected, based on funds' rankings alone.
 In fact, the inflow patterns of these funds matched those of other funds that had been advertised aggressively. And yet the funds in this subset had little or no advertising budget. The most likely explanation for this phenomenon, the professors argue, is that these funds' advertising expenses were being subsidized by other funds in the same families.
 Can advertising expenses, which typically amount to less than 1 percent of total assets under management, really make that much difference in a fund's attractiveness? Astonishingly, they can. Just a few hundredths of a percentage point of performance often separate the top-ranked fund and the one in, say, 10th or 20th place. Yet the top-ranked fund will typically attract much more cash than the one whose performance is only slightly worse. So even a tiny improvement in the bottom line can translate into a big difference in a fund's popularity and size.
 It is important to emphasize that the conclusion reached by the authors of this new study is based on a circumstantial case against fund families in general. They have no direct evidence of favoritism by any particular group of funds. But the authors argue that deliberate manipulation of advertising expenses among individual funds is the most likely cause of patterns that emerged from their statistical tests.
 THE new study thus provides more evidence of a conflict of interest between a fund family's owners and investors in each of that family's funds. To be sure, there may be counterbalancing benefits, such as access to a bigger research department and more efficient trading desks.
 But Professor Verbeek said in an e-mail message: ''It is unlikely that the benefits of being part of a fund family always outweigh the costs of sometimes subsidizing brethren funds. Investors need to be aware that a fund family is not necessarily motivated to maximize the returns of each of its funds.''

HEADLINE: No Quick Fix To Downturn

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
As leaders in Washington turn their attention to efforts to avert a looming downturn, many economists suggest that it may already be too late to change the course of the economy over the first half of the year, if not longer. 
 With a wave of negative signs gathering force, economists, policy makers and investors are debating just how much the economy could be damaged in 2008. Huge and complex, the American economy has in recent years been aided by a global web of finance so elaborate that no one seems capable of fully comprehending it. That makes it all but impossible to predict how much the economy can be expected to fall before it stabilizes.
 The answer could be a defining factor in the outcome of the fiercely contested presidential election. Not long ago, the race centered on the war in Iraq.
 But now, as candidates fan out across the country, visiting places as varied as the factory towns of Michigan and streets lined with unsold condominiums in Las Vegas, voters are increasingly demanding that they focus on the best way to keep the economy from slipping off the tracks. 
 The measures now being debated in Washington and on the campaign trail -- tax rebates, added help for the unemployed and those facing sharply higher heating bills and, most immediately, a move by the Federal Reserve to further cut interest rates -- could certainly moderate the severity of a downturn. Democrats and the Bush administration are considering a package of such measures that could reach $100 billion.
 But the forces menacing the economy, like the unraveling of the real estate market and high oil prices, are too entrenched to be swiftly dispatched by government largess or cheaper credit, some economists say.
 ''The question is not whether we will have a recession, but how deep and prolonged it will be,'' said David Rosenberg, the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch. ''Even if the Fed's moves are going to work, it will not show up until the later part of 2008 or 2009.''
 In the view of many analysts, the economy is now in a downward spiral, with each piece of negative news setting off the next. Falling housing prices have eroded the ability of homeowners to borrow against their property, threatening their ability to spend freely. Concerns about tightening consumer spending have prompted businesses to slow hiring, limiting wage increases and in turn applying the brakes anew to consumer spending.
 Not everyone is convinced that the American economy is headed for a recession, defined as six months of economic contraction. The economy often serves up indications of distress that later turn out to be false warnings.
 But some economists think a recession may have begun in December. In the last two weeks, there have been signs that a substantial downturn may already be unfolding. The Labor Department reported a sharp slowdown in job creation in December. Retailers said that sales last month were extremely disappointing, capping the worst gain for a holiday season in five years. A widely watched index showed manufacturing slowing, despite a weak American dollar that has encouraged growth in exports. 
 The construction of new homes has already fallen by some 40 percent since the peak in 2006. The sales of new homes have fallen even faster, suggesting that a large oversupply of places to live will continue to drag down prices. 
 Home prices have dropped by about 7 percent since the peak in 2006, but some experts suggest they could fall by another 15 to 20 percent before hitting bottom. 
 ''There is still a long way to go,'' said Nouriel Roubini, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University and chairman of the research firm RGE Monitor.
 Mr. Roubini has long predicted the real estate downturn would cause a severe recession. He envisions foreclosures accelerating this year, and banks counting fresh losses. That could make them less able to lend and further slow economic activity, not just in the United States but around the world. 
 ''We're facing the risk of a systemic financial crisis,'' Mr. Roubini said. ''It's not just subprime mortgages. The same kind of reckless lending has been occurring throughout the financial system. And it's not only mortgages: Now it's credit cards and auto loans, where we see problems increasing. The toxic junk is popping up everywhere.'' 
 Banks, including commercial banks and investment banks, have so far acknowledged losses of some $100 billion, yet anxiety persists that more large write-offs are coming.
 ''Firms will go to great lengths to hide or delay reporting losses,'' said Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. ''What we know now therefore might only be the tip of the iceberg.''
 In a speech on Thursday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, zeroed in on the nervousness of bankers as a prime factor slowing the economy, even as the Fed tries to stimulate it with cheaper credit.
 ''Developments have prompted banks to become protective of their liquidity and balance sheet capacity and thus to become less willing to provide funding to other market participants,'' he said. His comments were widely construed as an assurance that the Fed would soon cut rates again. The Fed already dropped rates three times during the last four months of 2007.
 Wall Street has clamored for the Fed to keep lowering rates, cognizant that cheaper credit is generally good not just for encouraging borrowing and spending but also for corporate profits. 
 But some economists fear that lower rates will simply provide a short-lived boost at the expense of the economy's longer-term health: Cheap money encourages foolish investments, they say, which is precisely how Americans came to experience the evaporation of wealth in the Internet era, followed by housing prices rising beyond any reasonable connection to incomes. 
 ''This appears to be a panic on the part of the Fed,'' said Michael T. Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners, a research and trading firm. ''The housing bubble was a reaction from the effort to protect us from the collapse of the tech bubble. What's the next bubble going to be as a consequence of trying to protect us against this?'' 
 Mr. Darda asserts that the economy would be fine if left to its own devices, maintaining that the job market is healthier than most economists think. He contends that the December jobs report is likely to be revised to show that far more jobs were created than the 18,000 reported by the Labor Department. 
 ''That could be important in terms of reversing the direction,'' Mr. Darda said. ''We need to see evidence that the labor market isn't falling apart. That's critical.'' 
 But most economists seem convinced that the economy has slowed significantly, and say it is the severity of a downturn that is in doubt, not the existence of one.
 ''If we have a recession with a modest consumer retrenchment, and the rest of the world holds up, this could be three quarters of disappointment,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''The risk is a more dramatic decline for the consumer.''
 There is little doubt that the Fed will lower its benchmark rate later this month, making it cheaper for banks to lend money to one another. But there is more doubt whether Washington can quickly agree on fiscal policy moves -- that is, raising spending or cutting taxes -- in an election year in which the White House and Congress are controlled by different parties.
 A recession could pack enormous political consequences. Over the last century, the economy has been in a recession four times in the early part of a presidential election year, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. In each of those years -- 1920, 1932, 1960 and 1980 -- the party of the incumbent president lost the election. 
 Much discussed now in Washington and on the campaign trail is a potential rebate for taxpayers, similar to one that seemed to lubricate spending during the last recession six years ago. But worries remain over whether such a move could exacerbate inflation, and some doubt that the benefits would be felt rapidly enough to justify the risks.
 While tax rebates can encourage spending and generate jobs, Mr. Roubini said, the government cannot afford to unleash the significant amounts -- $300 billion or $400 billion -- that he believes would be required to ensure a substantial rebound in economic growth.
 ''Whatever they're going to do,'' he said, ''it's going to be cosmetic.''
 And most economists concur that even meaningful policies will probably take several months to filter through such an enormous economy. By the time they take effect, the country could already be in a recession.

HEADLINE: Pity the Professionals

 BODY:
Pity the Professionals
 To the Editor:
 Alex Williams's ''Falling-Down Professions'' (Sunday Styles, Jan. 6) was entertaining but missed a point regarding the creative nature of medicine. 
 I am a general internist. My sister is a consultant. We probably spend equal amounts of our day engaged in creative thought. Doctors are problem-solvers in much the same way consultants have to be: examining an issue (cluster of symptoms), diagnosing the problem (illness) and designing a plan to help rectify the situation (treat or perhaps cure disease). 
 I don't suffer from a lack of creativity in my day; I suffer from being overburdened by silly and uncompensated paperwork, much like the doctor quoted in the article who had to fill out requisition forms for new tires for his patient's wheelchair. 
 If consultants had to start writing several letters a day to companies in order to justify their suggestions (on their own time, for free), and then be told their letters weren't good enough and they needed to rewrite them, consulting, too, would lose some of its luster.
 DAWN HARRIS, M.D., Brookline, Mass.
 To the Editor:
 The demand for competent, highly trained physicians is rapidly outgrowing the supply across all specialties. That means that the hedge fund traders who chose finance over a career in medicine will soon have a difficult time finding excellent doctors to care for their families. 
 That means doctors could be packaged as securities that would be traded on a commodities exchange. As the doctors' value increases, the traders can at least make more money, even though they can't find an obstetrician to deliver their children.
 ANTHONY PROVENZANO, M.D., Bronxville, N.Y.
 To the Editor:
 When I chose to become a lawyer, I knew long hours and hard work would yield uncertain results. Social status was not on the menu; lawyers I know who have it inherited it from their families, not from their profession.
 To confirm this, all I have to do is read the hate mail that ensues every time my firm represents an indigent defendant. The fierce hostility toward the concept of ''innocent until proved guilty'' and toward the law profession in general and defense attorneys in particular can be overwhelming.
 Anyone who thinks a law career will be the path to social status would do well to readjust that thinking.
 PRICE QUENIN, New Orleans
 To the Editor:
 I read ''The Falling-Down Professions'' with resigned bemusement. As a practicing primary care physician for 25 years, with a son in law school who has secured a job in New York that guarantees him at least $200,000, I don't think the comparison between professions is accurate. 
 To illustrate: a well-dressed patient recently stood at my front desk holding a cup of Starbucks coffee that must have cost $6, while explaining to my receptionist that he did not have $5 for his co-pay. I told him to hand over his coffee and I would consider the matter settled. I can't imagine that in a few years my son will be asking his client to hand over his Rolex. 
 DAVID BLEEKER, M.D., Hackensack, N.J.
 To the Editor: 
 While ''The Falling-Down Professions'' cataloged a number of the reasons that doctors are increasingly frustrated, it missed perhaps the key economic issue: debt. 
 Medical training lasts a minimum of 7 years, and for surgeons and medical subspecialists it may be 10 or more years. Barring wealthy parents, a student entering college today might expect to accrue a half-million dollars in loans and interest before entering practice. Imagine being 30 years old, with no assets, no pension, a beat-up car and no savings -- and several thousand dollars of monthly interest payments. It doesn't take a business degree to figure out why medical training could be a bad deal. 
 NATHAN K. COBB, M.D., Boston
 To the Editor:
 ''The Falling-Down Professions'' decries the loss of status and job satisfaction among lawyers and doctors, but elevates those in the consulting and investment banking industries.
 As someone who interned in the consulting field as an undergraduate but is now in medical school, I recall my consulting experience as lucrative but full of long days spent in cubicles and doing work that provided little more for me than money. (As for investment banking, everyone I know who has done it gets burned out within a few years and has to quit.) 
 Up to my teeth in books and working long hours, I can tell you that I have little doubt about the choice I made.

 Oh, My Lithe Ski Club
 To the Editor:
 I was disappointed to see how Allen Salkin portrayed the Miramar Ski Club in ''Oh, My Poor Arthritic Ski Club'' on Jan. 6.
 Mr. Salkin signed up for the New Year's trip, one that typically attracts the long-term members. We are grateful to the founding members who (literally) built the club. But they are being replaced by newer, much younger members. A later trip, Jan. 4 to 6, attracted 15 skiers in their 20's and 30's -- who all had a blast with this ''poor arthritic ski club.''

HEADLINE: Clearing Way for the Giants on the Road Without Throwing a Block

BYLINE: By JOHN BRANCH

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
The Giants have won eight games in a row on the road, and no one helps them go -- literally go -- the way Jim Phelan does.
 He is a slight man with glasses, thin blond hair and an accent carved in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. And without him, the Giants would not go anywhere.
 Phelan is the team's director of administration. His primary role is to arrange travel for the Giants, which becomes particularly dicey come the postseason, when locations and game times are decided with little warning. 
 He oversees nearly every aspect of every trip: charter flights and seating charts, hotel reservations and room assignments, menus and meeting rooms, buses and police escorts. 
 Phelan is the one who seats Tom Coughlin in an exit row in economy class because the coach likes to be near his players rather than in the first-class cabin with his assistants and the team's management. Phelan is the one responsible for General Manager Jerry Reese's lone special request: Rold Gold braided pretzels in his hotel room.
 If the Giants beat the Cowboys on Sunday, no one will congratulate Phelan. If they lose, he may hear about beds that were too soft, food that was too heavy, weather that delayed the flight or a traffic jam that stalled the bus. 
 ''No news is good news is the best way to put it,'' he said.
 The Giants are unable to explain why they were 3-5 at home but won eight in a row on the road, matching the N.F.L. season record. A good place to start looking for answers is in Phelan's office at Giants Stadium. It marks the destination of a successful journey itself. Phelan began as a Giants ball boy in 1979. 
 As the team prepared for its wild-card playoff game against Tampa Bay, Phelan was thinking ahead, so the rest of the Giants did not have to. Phelan may be the only person with the Giants who does not take it one game at a time. 
 He had no idea if the Giants would beat the Buccaneers, even if he was wearing his lucky shirt, but he knew that they would play the next game at Dallas or Green Bay if they won. So Phelan made some calls. He had a hunch they were headed to Dallas.
 Phelan learned that the Marriott Las Colinas, where the team has stayed the past two trips to Dallas, did not have space this weekend. Neither did the Omni, which Coughlin has liked in the past. That is why the Giants were headed Saturday to a Hilton near the airport. There were 200 rooms available, and that is where Phelan decided they would stay. As always, he asked when the mattresses had last been changed.
 Buses left Giants Stadium at 11:30 a.m. for a 1 p.m. flight to Dallas. United Airlines has for years provided the team's charter out of Newark Liberty International Airport. Fans do not see the Giants ambling through terminals, because they go through security elsewhere and board the plane from the tarmac. 
 The Giants usually fly in a Boeing 757, but Phelan ordered a larger 767 this weekend. About 135 people usually travel with the Giants -- 53 players, about 20 coaches, owners and their families, executives and dozens of employees. This weekend, about 165 were expected. The extras were mostly members of the Mara and Tisch families, the co-owners of the team. Everyone gets a first-class meal.
 Phelan tries to seat most players next to empty seats, delicately balancing their size, seniority and ego. Rookies are pushed to the back. On rare occasions when Coughlin's wife, Judy, comes along, as she planned to this weekend, she sits next to him in the exit row.
 The complex choreography of taking the Giants on the road requires two people. Jeff Conroy is the team's manager of special events, but he is better known as the advance man.
 Conroy flew to Dallas on Friday morning, had lunch and a walk-through with the hotel's convention manager, then met other hotel staff members, including the chef and the heads of reservations and security. 
 When the team plane lands, Conroy is expected to be there with the buses. 
 ''Jeff's worry is that I'm going to arrive too early,'' Phelan said Thursday. ''And it happens, because when they see New York Giants, they seem to clear the air space for them.''
 Conroy hands room keys and itineraries to owners, coaches and Reese. Players and the team's staff get theirs at tables set up in the hotel lobby. Players that have been in the league at least three years usually get their own rooms. For this weekend, Phelan ordered 27 singles and 13 doubles. A round-the-clock security guard is placed on each floor, and no guests are allowed in players' rooms.
 Early in the week, players may request extra tickets or extra rooms for relatives or friends (paid for by the players, not the team). For the December game at Buffalo, players requested six extra rooms. This weekend, they requested 67.
 Coughlin, controlling with his players, is not overly picky about the team's travel. He wants good beds and good food. He wants a table in his room so he can work on his laptop and watch television, and he does not like the smell of cigar or cigarette smoke.
 ''Atlanta,'' Conroy said of the last time Coughlin had to change rooms.
 ''We couldn't smell it, but we had to move him,'' Phelan said. ''You don't argue it.''
 Like a veteran player, John Mara, the team president, wants only a king bed. 
 ''He's like, 'Take care of the head coach, take care of our general manager and take care of my mom,'<0>'' Phelan said.
 Phelan sets the menu, with an eye to a chef's specialty or regional cuisine -- seafood in Tampa, Fla., or burritos in Texas, for example. The team eats dinner, a late-night snack (cheeseburgers, usually), breakfast and, for late games, a pregame meal at the hotel. Buses arrive to take the entourage to the game, with a police escort. After the game, the buses take everyone to the airport, the charter flies to Newark, and buses carry everyone back to Giants Stadium. 
 On Thursday and Friday, Coughlin and his players dismissed questions about beating the Cowboys or playing for the Super Bowl. The Giants cannot look ahead. But Phelan has to. On Thursday, not knowing the winner of Saturday's N.F.C. divisional game, he had to figure out the contingencies if the Giants advanced.
 ''Green Bay, it's the Radisson Paper Valley in Appleton,'' Phelan said. He planned to make calls to Seattle before the weekend.
 After all, someone has to think beyond Sunday. A team has to go on the road to build a winning streak there.

HEADLINE: Uncertainties in the Shadow of Unrest

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THE violence that erupted in Kenya after a disputed presidential election on Dec. 27 raised questions for those planning a trip to one of Africa's most popular safari destinations. Is it safe? Can I postpone? If I cancel can I get my money back? Am I covered under travel insurance? 
 Travelers have been surfing government sites, reaching out to tour operators and trolling TripAdvisor.com for answers. Many are getting mixed messages. Members of the London-based Federation of Tour Operators, which includes some of the biggest tour companies in Britain, suspended package tours to Kenya last weekend because of the political unrest and offered customers alternative trips or refunds. Meanwhile, many American tour operators have been insisting that business is operating as usual with safari parks open and airlines flying on schedule. 
 Shortly after the election, the Kenya Tourist Board reported that the main scheduled international carriers into Nairobi for the North American market, including Kenya Airways, British Airways, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Emirates, were operating normally. Domestic carriers, it said, were also on schedule, and tours were operating ''normally with little disruption.'' 
 Nevertheless, some tour operators have taken precautions. For instance, Micato Safaris has been arranging for many of its clients to bypass Nairobi -- where riot police used tear gas and water cannons on Jan. 3 to turn back crowds who tried to rally -- and instead has been flying travelers directly to the game parks by chartered aircraft. It has also posted its own staff members at Nairobi hotels to assist guests scheduled to spend the night there. 
 The United States and British governments have been strongly urging travelers to weigh the risks of travel to Kenya. On Jan. 2, Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued an advisory against all but essential travel to Kenya. The State Department had already urged Americans in an Oct. 18 travel warning to carefully consider the risks of travel to the country, citing ''continuing terrorist threats and increasing incidents of violent crime.'' A public announcement on Dec. 31 followed the election violence. 
 Control Risks, a risk-consulting company, has been advising clients to defer nonessential travel to Kenya and has recommended those already in the country to remain at their destination and avoid overland travel when possible. While foreigners are not being targeted, said Laura Winthrop, a vice president, ''there is an incidental risk of being caught up in clashes.'' 
 More than 300 people have been killed in ethnic clashes, and the violence has hit resort towns like Mombasa on the coast and Nairobi, where tourists arriving on evening flights often stay the night before heading out to game parks. A Jan. 4 statement from the American Embassy in Kenya said that while security was improving, visitors should still expect interrupted flights, a large police presence in the troubled areas and cash shortages at banks and ATMs.
 Despite the volatile situation, airlines and tour operators report few cancellations by tourists. But the impression that Kenya is one of the more stable African nations is fading fast. Scenes of migrating wildebeests and elephants in the Masai Mara have been replaced with news photographs of rioting in Nairobi, churches burned to the ground and citizens fleeing the country. 
 After seeing such images, Andrea Macari, a clinical psychologist from Great Neck, N.Y., rerouted her $30,000 two-week trip to Africa to avoid traveling in Kenya. Originally, Ms. Macari and her husband, Dylan Mitchell, were scheduled to use Nairobi as a jumping-off place to Rwanda for gorilla tracking before heading back to Kenya for a safari. Now the couple is bypassing Kenya completely by flying into Uganda, connecting to Rwanda and taking charter flights to get around. They have replaced their Kenyan safari with a stay at a tented camp in the Serengeti in Tanzania.
 ''I'M not going on a vacation to be anxious all the time for my safety,'' said Ms. Macari, who departed for her trip without knowing if she would get a refund for the canceled Kenya safari. 
 Lisa Gramlich, a pediatric anesthesiologist from Chicago, who left for Kenya with three friends on Jan. 7, also took precautions. Two of the travelers who planned to take a public bus to Kilimanjaro will now fly there. And instead of shopping and sightseeing in Nairobi, Ms. Gramlich plans to stay on the grounds of her resort while she is in the capital. In a situation like this, she said, ''the likelihood of becoming a victim of robbery or something becomes just a little more heightened.'' 
 Most travel insurance policies will not cover the cancellation of a Kenyan safari, which can easily cost $400 a day a person, not including airfare, because civil unrest is considered an exclusion. But airlines, hotels and tour operators have been doing their best to accommodate travelers. 
 Virgin Atlantic, which flies from the United States to Nairobi via London, has waived all change fees and is allowing customers to change their travel dates without penalty for up to a year. At press time, Kenya Airways was offering travelers a full refund for flights canceled 24 hours before departure. Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which runs the popular Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi, is offering to rebook guests to the Fairmont Zanzibar in Tanzania. Travelers booked at the Norfolk later this month may postpone or cancel reservations and receive a refund.
 Continuing unrest could be a considerable blow to Kenya's tourism industry, which is expected to bring in $900 million and more than a million visitors this year. 
 ''We're very, very concerned because the images paint a very ugly picture,'' said Jake Grieves-Cook, managing director of the Nairobi-based GameWatchers Safaris and former chairman of the Kenya Tourist Board. ''If there is a resolution without delay, we will be able to recover very quickly. If it drags on, it could have a very, very serious impact on the economy and the Kenyan people who depend on tourism for their livelihood.''

HEADLINE: A Long Haul, and No Place to Park His Rig

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: Jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Ridgefield 

 BODY:
 THE low winter sun had set, the temperature was shivering down into the teens, and Jerry Slaton was hauling a 53-foot trailer and a headache familiar to every trucker who traverses New Jersey. He needed a place to park both his truck and himself for the night, in a state where hospitality toward his profession is a scarce commodity.
 He had left Evansville, Ind., two days and 900 miles earlier with a load of baby food that he delivered to a warehouse in Elizabeth, and he had no prospect for a westbound load until morning. His dispatcher suggested the big truck stop in Bordentown, 50 miles south. Mr. Slaton, who has been driving to New Jersey for eight years, knew the Vince Lombardi Service Area had more parking spots than anyplace else along the New Jersey Turnpike, so he headed north instead, gambling that he was early enough to claim one. 
 ''It's brutal out there, man,'' said Mr. Slaton, 51, after he had circled the lot and found all 250 spaces full at 7:30 p.m. before finally parallel-parking between two other late arrivals along the perimeter fence. ''You've got to get here before sundown.''
 It's nerve-rattling enough to navigate New Jersey in a car when you know you have a bed awaiting you at the end of your journey. Try it in an 80,000-pound truck that doubles as your home when you don't know where you'll be sleeping that night.
 New Jersey is so inhospitable to long-haul truckers that it regularly tops the worst-state polls in several categories in the annual reader survey conducted by Overdrive Magazine, an industry journal. But in the newest survey, in the January issue, it achieved a rare distinction when it was once again judged to offer the ''least available overnight parking,'' a title it has held without interruption since the question was added to the poll in 2000. No other state has such a consistent record of dissatisfaction in any single category.
 ''No one wants to pay attention to the industry that is really making our economy function,'' said Gail Toth, executive director of the New Jersey Motor Truck Association, a trade group. ''No one seems to be taking that one step back and saying, 'Who is that poor soul who drove through the night to get it here?'<0>''
 Every evening the pattern is the same across New Jersey. Federal laws require truckers to rest for 8 hours at a stretch after 10 hours of duty, but the state doesn't have enough spots for them to park and sleep. Once the few big commercial truck stops fill up, and then the rest areas along major roads, truckers start parking wherever they can, including, most hazardously, along the shoulders of the highways, a practice that has resulted in several fatalities in the state in recent years. The later it gets, the harder it is to find a place.
 ''There are long stretches, especially along 78 and 80, where there is absolutely nothing unless you pull off of the interstate, and once you get off there's not all that much in that stretch either,'' said Ted Matthews, director of freight planning for the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, which just completed an 18-month study that found a shortage of 1,300 overnight truck parking spots in its 13-county area.
 Erin Phalon, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, which has 180 truck parking spaces at rest areas along its roads, said: ''We recognize that there is a need for additional truck parking spaces; however, that need competes with departmental needs in the areas of road maintenance and safety projects.'' 
 After Mr. Slaton found his makeshift spot for the night, he walked through the packed lot toward his Burger King dinner, past the idling trucks lined up in tight rows, chuffing like horses in a corral. TV lights flickered through the windshields of some cabs, as their drivers reclined on their bunks. But most of the trucks in this dense, transient village along a swampy bend of the Hackensack River were dark and slumbering, as the lights of Manhattan sparkled in the distance.
 ''When you get about 30 miles in from Pennsylvania, you can just feel the tension,'' said Mr. Slaton, who tries to get back home each weekend to Morganfield, Ky., for services at his Assembly of God church, where he plays guitar with two of his three children in a gospel group, Anointed by U. He gets an extra $100 from the company he drives for -- ''war pay,'' they call it -- whenever he crosses the Hudson River into New York City. ''I get the willy birds whenever they ask me to come here.''
 His meal finished, he headed back to his truck -- a blue 1999 International with 700,000 miles on it, rimed with road salt from his snowy trip across Ohio and Pennsylvania -- and he paused to absorb the sight of the Empire State Building, still wearing its red, white and green Christmas lights. ''It's very impressive, but it's not someplace I'd want to live. All they see is concrete.'' 
 As he climbed back in, to watch television for a while before getting some sleep, another truck came nosing through the lot, sniffing for a spot that wasn't there. It was from Missouri, and its driver finally gave up and went out to park along the access road, where, as the night deepened, the line lengthened toward the turnpike, truck by truck.

HEADLINE: Letters Why Reading Matters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In her essay ''You Are What You Read'' (Dec. 23), Leah Price refers to the National Endowment for the Arts' report ''To Read or Not to Read: A Question of National Consequence'' and questions what is at risk. 
 The report is amply clear in this respect. At risk is the ability to read with proficiency any piece of sustained writing, from great literature to newspaper editorials, from office memos to instruction manuals. As Americans lose the capability for active and engaged literacy, they run greater risks academically, socially, culturally, civically and economically.
 SUNIL IYENGAR Washington The writer is the director of research and analysis for the National Endowment for the Arts.
 To the Editor:
 If we grant Leah Price's argument that '' 'reading for literary experience' has never been more than one use [of literacy] among many,'' should we really take comfort from her idea that in a future without that experience, ''the file, the list, the label, the memo ... are the genres that will keep reading alive''? What kind of life would that be, and would it be better or worse than the life that reading and readers now enjoy? 
 In such a future, what would keep reading from being reduced to mere literacy, reading devoid of the imaginative and interpretative activity through which readers may become more tolerant and judicious citizens, neighbors, colleagues and friends? This is precisely the grim eventuality that the National Endowment for the Arts is attempting to prevent by publishing its report. It is discouraging that a Harvard English professor would carp at this laudable effort, and risk consigning us to a world where the demise of ''reading for literary experience'' is a matter of indifference.
 SEAN KEILEN Princeton, N.J. The writer is a lecturer in English at Princeton University.
 To the Editor:
 Leah Price observes that 19th-century commentators worried that reading was decadent, harmful and feminine. It is also worth remembering the series of advertisements for Charles Eliot's Harvard Classics, which appeared in The Times Book Review for much of the early 20th century. The ads touted Eliot's selections from the classics with headlines like ''How to Get Rid of an Inferiority Complex'' and ''What 15 Minutes a Day Has Done to My Husband's Earning Power.'' The Harvard Classics ads were complemented by those for the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which let readers know ''There IS an aristocracy in America! It is an Aristocracy of Knowledge,'' and for the publishing house of Nelson Doubleday, which advertised ''The Famous Pocket University -- a Liberal Reading Education.'' For part of the 20th century at least, reading was seen as fundamental.
 EDWIN BATTISTELLA Ashland, Ore. The writer is a professor of English and writing at Southern Oregon University.

HEADLINE: Having a Little Work Done (at the Mall)

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
ANDREW RUDNICK snickered when he first saw a medical spa offering Botox and laser hair-removal services on a visit to a Las Vegas mall in 2002. He laughed at the thought of someone -- anyone -- shopping for the latest fashions, grabbing a bite to eat and then, oh yeah, strolling in for a quick shot of Botox to zap out a nasty wrinkle. 
 ''I couldn't understand why anybody in a mall would walk in and have their legs lasered, never mind Botox,'' he recalled. He parked himself on a bench near the spa and watched in amazement as shoppers strolled in. He owned a weight-loss and laser center in Boston at the time, and the sight was a revelation. ''I counted the traffic in and out and saw the revenue, and said, 'Wow! This is a retail business.' '' 
 Returning to Boston, he scouted retail locations. He dropped the weight-loss part of his business to focus on skin care and laser treatments, renamed the company and opened his first Sleek MedSpa that same year. He has since opened six more -- near Boston and in New York and Florida, all in upscale malls or retail areas. ''It took off like a bat out of hell,'' he said. 
 Thanks in part to television shows like ''Extreme Makeover'' and ''Nip/Tuck,'' the number of Americans seeking chemical peels, laser procedures, Botox shots and wrinkle-filler injections is soaring. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, such ''noninvasive'' treatments have increased more than 700 percent since 1997. Botox received Food and Drug Administration approval in 2002. 
 THE stampede of doctors and entrepreneurs rushing to fill that demand has left some doctors and plastic-surgery trade groups wondering about the expertise of some of the people providing these services. For many Americans, price and convenience come first, with few questions about the experience and qualifications of the person injecting the treatments.
 For its part, Sleek MedSpa says some of its outlets have on-site physicians while others have doctors as medical directors off-site, and nurse practitioners and physician's assistants who handle day-to-day treatments. If there were an emergency a nurse couldn't handle, the nurse would call 911, Mr. Rudnick said. He added that no such emergency had ever arisen. 
 Kim Wanderley, 39, a stay-at-home mom from Parkland, Fla., said she thought it was ''great'' when she spotted a Sleek MedSpa at the Town Center mall in Boca Raton in 2006. ''If it had been in Ohio, people might have blinked twice, but this is South Florida,'' where vanity rules, she said. ''People do not take aging lightly, without a fight, here.'' 
 While Sleek MedSpas lack the feng-shui ambience of a traditional beauty spa, they don't exude the sterile atmosphere of a doctor's office, either. The spa in Boca Raton is contemporary and sophisticated, Mrs. Wanderley said, with videos of cosmetic procedures streaming across a flat screen, skin-care products lining another wall and before-and-after picture brochures scattered around the waiting room. 
 And it's convenient. ''I can be in and out in a half-hour,'' she said, and ''it gives me an excuse to go to the mall afterward to do a little shopping.'' If a procedure causes redness or bruising, the spa offers a convenient back-door exit to the parking lot. 
 Mrs. Wanderley acknowledges that 10 years ago, she would have thought this ''way too excessive and ridiculous,'' she said. ''But now I'm one of the bozos on the bus.'' She started out requesting microdermabrasion facial treatments and has since added Botox shots and Restylane filler injections to her medspa repertoire. 
 Mr. Rudnick estimates that 50 percent of his company's mall clients are walk-ins like Mrs. Wanderley. Sleek MedSpa's revenue, which was $1.5 million in 2002, surged to more than $14 million in 2007, Mr. Rudnick says, and he expects that total to double this year. Profit margins are in the 20 to 25 percent range, he said, and over the next four years he expects to open 40 more locations in 25 cities. 
 Sleek MedSpa is among dozens of companies operating medical spas, often called medspas. Hannelore Leavy, founder and executive director of the International Medical Spa Association, estimates that there are 2,000 to 2,500 medspas nationwide, up from 25 in 2002. 
 There has also been a surge in the number of nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. Of the 11.5 million cosmetic procedures performed in 2006, more than four in five were noninvasive treatments, according to the aesthetic plastic-surgery society. From 1997 to 2006, the number of surgical cosmetic procedures rose 98 percent, and noninvasive treatments jumped 747 percent. 
 Nonsurgical treatments ''are effective, they're safe and they're affordable -- and there's no down time,'' said Dr. Foad Nahai, a plastic surgeon in Atlanta and president of the society. 
 Some doctors' offices are joining in. In New York, Dr. Bruce K. Moskowitz, an ophthalmologist and oculofacial plastic surgeon, says demand on the cosmetic side of his business has skyrocketed, to 50 percent of his business, from 25 percent 15 years ago. To meet demand, he opened a medspa in his office; patients in the waiting room can read brochures about Botox and fillers when they come in for eye checkups. 
 Dr. Moskowitz's qualifications for cosmetic procedures run long and deep, given that he had been using Botox for facial twitching disorders as far back as 1991, long before the F.D.A. approved it for cosmetic use. And his oculofacial expertise gave him insight into how facial muscles and nerves respond to filler injections and other cosmetic treatments.
 Industry experts attribute the surge in cosmetic procedures to aging baby boomers as well as to television shows. 
 Marian Salzman, author of more than a dozen books on cultural trends and current affairs, said she predicted 10 years ago in ''Next: Trends for the Near Future'' that cosmetic procedures would become mainstream. 
 Affordable and walk-in cosmetic surgeries were among the trends she had forecast, Ms. Salzman said. ''I used to say they're going to be as prevalent as salons,'' she recalled, adding that ''people used to roll their noses up at me and say it's obscene, it's ridiculous.'' 
 The youngest boomers, those born from 1955 to 1964, are driving the trend, she said. ''They will do absolutely anything to prolong youthfulness to stay in the game,'' she said, ''and if that means a filler here or Botox there or hair implant there, then so be it -- they'll do it.''
 At the same time, television shows helped make cosmetic procedures appear safe and stylish. By the time the Motley Crue frontman Vince Neil went under the knife in 2005 before millions of viewers on ''Remaking Vince Neil'' on VH1, cosmetic surgery had truly arrived in mainstream America.
 ''Virtually every office patient I see talks about the reality TV shows,'' says Dr. Paul Wigoda, a plastic surgeon who runs a cosmetic surgery business in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., owns the MeDaySpa in Miami Beach and is medical director of two Sleek MedSpas in Florida. After watching the shows, he says, patients feel more comfortable about the procedures.
 DR. NAHAI and other plastic surgeons worry that shows like ''Extreme Makeover'' gloss over the risks, and edit out the bruising and recovery. ''I tell every patient -- forget the word 'cosmetic,' and remember the word 'surgery,'<0>'' he said. ''And there's no such thing as surgery without risk.'' 
 Lou Gorfain, an executive producer of ''Extreme Makeover,'' which was broadcast on ABC, dismissed such criticism, saying, ''We did show the bruising and the pain and risky surgery that it is.'' And Linda Klein, a producer and medical adviser of ''Nip/Tuck'' on FX, said the series tries to show that surgery is ''not a pretty sight'' -- and emphasized that the show is fictional. 
 The death of Kanye West's mother in November, from complications following a tummy tuck and breast reduction surgery, pushed concerns about procedures into the spotlight. 
 Sometimes, surgical horror stories can make noninvasive procedures look more attractive. Still, even nonsurgical procedures, like Botox shots and laser treatments, have their own risks, especially if the person giving the treatment isn't fully trained, cautioned Dr. Richard D'Amico, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons and chief of plastic surgery at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, N.J. In the wrong hands, he said, lasers can burn and Botox can cause drooping eyelids or paralysis until the toxin wears off in three to six months.
 In the most dire case, if an injection gets into a blood vessel and the product gets into the retinal artery, a patient could be blinded, Dr. D'Amico said. 
 He said it was crucial that people check the credentials and experience of those who offer cosmetic treatments. 
 Even the kind of doctor needs to be scrutinized, he said. In the past, cosmetic procedures were done solely by plastic surgeons, dermatologists and ocular plastic surgeons. Today, even podiatrists and dentists are moving into the field. No federal or state laws regulate what doctors can or cannot do once they have state licenses, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 
 Some just take weekend courses on cosmetic procedures and then set up shop, Dr. Nahai said. Only those certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons have undergone formal training of at least six years in plastic surgery and passed an exam on the procedures, Dr. D'Amico said.
 Taking a weekend course or watching someone on a DVD isn't enough, Dr. Nahai said. ''If an airline told you the pilot had simply watched someone fly a plane as his only training, would you want him to take you up in the air?'' he asked.
 Many people are attracted by the price, savoir-faire settings and convenience of medspas. Unlike doctors' offices, most are open seven days a week. 
 Kristen Salera, 24, from South Weymouth, Mass., started getting chemical peels after seeing a Sleek MedSpa in Braintree, Mass., last year. Troubled by acne, she had been curious about cosmetic procedures but had never consulted a plastic surgeon. After dropping into the medspa, she was impressed with the staff and the cost.
 ''Friends who went to a medical office paid double what I was paying,'' she said. Later, she signed up for mesotherapy, in which injections go into areas of fat, to dissolve hard-to-lose cellulite on her upper thighs.
 Many experts say medspas are in their infancy, with tremendous growth potential. Aging baby-boomers are driving much of the demand, with 12,000 Americans turning 50 every day, or one every eight seconds, according to AARP. ''This is a huge market,'' said John Buckingham, chief executive of Solana MedSpas, a development and consulting company that helps doctors and entrepreneurs set up medspas. 
 New drugs on the horizon may bring more price competition, thus attracting more consumers. The Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation is awaiting F.D.A. approval of a Botox alternative, Reloxin; it is expected to get the green light in 2008 and will compete head-to-head with Botox, from Allergan. 
 Most of the youth-enhancing effects of Botox and cosmetic fillers wear off within three to nine months, making it necessary for patients to get repeat shots. This aspect makes industry experts view the business as largely recession-proof.
 The treatments are also seen as a stepping stone to possible plastic surgery. ''This is a gateway drug. I started with microdermabrasion and already I'm doing Restylane as well,'' said Mrs. Wanderley, who doesn't rule out plastic surgery at some point. 
 IN addition to Sleek MedSpa, the industry includes chains like Sona MedSpa International, Pure Med Spa, Dermacare Laser and Skin Care Clinics and American Laser Centers, which was recently sold to two private equity firms for about $230 million.
 Despite the boom, some other medspas have flopped. Skin Nuvo International, which operated 40 mall-based clinics, had problems with its hair-removal equipment and wound up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2005. And HealthWest Inc. and SkinKlinic have closed shop.
 Mr. Rudnick is bullish on the sector's growth and is already planning a network of full-service cosmetic surgery facilities. The first opened adjacent to his New York medspa in October. 
 ''We know one thing for sure: people aren't getting any younger,'' he said. ''We know another thing for sure: they all want to look younger.''

HEADLINE: It Finally Came: The Year of the REIT Retreat

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
AFTER rewarding investors with rich returns for the last seven years, real estate mutual funds reversed course in 2007, ending the year with sizable declines, as the sector succumbed to the turmoil in the credit markets. 
 But not all investors sustained big losses. Those holding certain global-focused funds saw some gains or suffered smaller setbacks. 
 ''Many emerging markets have strong economic growth and good opportunities,'' said David Kruth, a senior portfolio manager of the Goldman Sachs International Real Estate Securities fund, which has significant exposure to Asia and Latin America and has been one of the better-performing funds. 
 While nearly all property funds declined last year, the worst performers were domestic funds. They, in turn, were affected by a downturn in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, companies whose portfolios include properties like office buildings, hotels, shopping centers and warehouses. 
 The REIT retreat -- which followed years of colossal gains that helped elevate fund returns -- reflected concerns that the problems of the subprime mortgage industry and the softening housing market might weaken the economy and hurt demand for commercial space. There has already been an abrupt halt in the frenetic pace of REIT mergers and acquisitions, many involving leveraged buyouts by private firms. These takeovers were partly responsible for the advance in REIT prices.
 Lagging behind most other mutual fund categories, real estate funds posted negative returns of 13.8 percent, on average, for 2007 and 11.9 percent, on average, for the fourth quarter, according to Morningstar, the research firm. And not surprisingly, disappointed fund investors decided to sell more than buy. The net flow of money out of real estate funds totaled $7.16 billion in 2007, according to the fund tracker AMG Data Services, the first annual redemption in eight years. By comparison, AMG Data said that just over $5 billion flowed into the funds for all of 2006. But there were a handful of bright spots, including Asian funds like Cohen & Steers Asia Pacific Realty A, up 12.52 percent for the year, though off 6.8 percent for the quarter, and the CGM Realty fund, which was the No. 1 performer, returning 34.4 percent for the year and 5.6 percent for the quarter. CGM loaded up on mining companies like the Potash Corporation of Canada and the Mosaic Company of Plymouth, Minn., reflecting a broader definition of real estate by the fund manager, G. Kenneth Heebner.
 Fund managers and industry watchers had been predicting year after year that real estate funds would run out of steam. Even so, last year's dismal performance, which began in earnest in the second quarter, was stunning for a fund category that had surpassed most others for much of the decade.
 ''It's the only classification that can boast seven consecutive years of positive performance in the whole equity universe,'' said Tom Roseen, a senior research analyst at Lipper, another fund tracker.
 Some of the biggest gains came in 2006, when the funds returned an average of nearly 34 percent. For the five years through December, the annualized return has been 18.3 percent. (By contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 5.5 percent last year and 12.7 percent, annualized, over the five-year span.) 
 SO now the question emerges among investors: Can this once-highflying sector make a quick comeback? Many experts say that a lot hinges on the health of the economy in 2008.
 ''The worst may or may not be over for REITs, but the concerns about the economy and the subprime market are still there,'' said Andrew Gogerty, an analyst at Morningstar.
 T. Ritson Ferguson, chief investment officer at ING Clarion, agreed. ''If we, in fact, go into a recession,'' he said, ''and I mean a true recession of negative growth, I think there could be some more downside in U.S. real estate.''
 Some fund managers said they expect to be especially vigilant in their domestic choices, seeking out those real estate companies that are better positioned to withstand a slowdown. 
 ''We've had an interesting period in the last two years or so -- a rising tide lifted all boats, even REITs with mediocre portfolios -- but now the market is starting to sort through all this,'' said Samuel A. Lieber, the chief executive of Alpine Woods Capital Investors, whose Alpine U.S. Real Estate Equity fund lost 23.4 percent last year. ''I think we'll have to be very selective.'' 
 Some beaten-down REITs may now offer good value, Mr. Roseen said, in particular in industrial and office buildings. ''I think even shopping centers might do O.K. over the long haul,'' he added, ''because they have long-term lease contracts.''
 Mr. Heebner of CGM Realty also favors retail developers, including the Macerich Company and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, as well as industrial companies like ProLogis Trust and the AMB Property Corporation. 
 Despite lingering economic worries, industry analysts say, the fundamentals for commercial real estate in the United States are generally positive. Unlike the housing market, supply and demand on the commercial side remain in balance in most markets across the country, they say. (Average occupancy rates of commercial property nationwide are in the low- to mid-90 percent range, while the rate of rent growth remains healthy, says Ross L. Smotrich, a senior managing director at Bear Stearns.) 
 But analysts still see more potential overseas -- and judging by the proliferation of new global real estate funds, so do the fund companies. Among the funds introduced last year were the CNL Global Real Estate fund, the ING Asia-Pacific Real Estateand European Real Estate funds, and the Janus Adviser Global Researchand Global Real Estate funds. ''All of a sudden all these fund shops have an international exposure,'' Mr. Gogerty said.
 He and others say the best opportunities right now are in Asian and emerging markets, where the economies have been strong and demand for new buildings and infrastructure even stronger. Europe, meanwhile, continues to recover from its own real estate slump, especially in countries like Britain, though some fund managers say that there could be value there as well.
 ''I think the underlying growth dynamics are very much in place, in particular for the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- and, broadly speaking, other areas of the world,'' said Mr. Lieber, whose Alpine International Real Estate Equity fund was up 2.8 percent last year. ''In Russia, they have a dearth of new housing, so I think there are some tremendous opportunities there,'' he said.
 MR. KRUTH of Goldman adds Mexico and Hong Kong to the list. Mexico ''has a strong economy, and from a housing perspective, several million homes need to be built to fill demand,'' he said, while Hong Kong ''has a lack of supply in office space.'' His Goldman Sachs International Real Estate Securities A fund, off 2. 6 percent last year, has among its top holdings two large Hong Kong property companies, Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. and Hongkong Land Holdings, as well as the Japanese companies Mitsubishi Estate and Mitsui Fudosan.
 Among Mr. Lieber's top stock picks are the luxury hotel developers Banyan Tree Holdings of Singapore, which manages and develops hotels in the Asia-Pacific region, and Orient-Express Hotels, which runs a global chain of high-end boutique hotels. In Europe, his picks include Unibail-Rodamco, a French-Dutch company and the largest European shopping mall owner, and the PIK Group of Russia, which is putting up residential housing around Moscow. Mr. Ferguson of ING Clarion, meanwhile, also likes Sun Hung Kai, along with the Chinese developer Agile Property Holdings. The largest holding in the ING International Real Estate A fund, which was up 0.6 percent last year, is the Westfield Group of Australia, an owner of shopping malls and a favorite of many fund managers. ''They have significant holdings in the United States and a growing number of malls in the United Kingdom,'' he said.
 While Mr. Heebner's CGM Realty fund has had foreign exposure as well, he seems to be shifting his attention back to the United States these days and, specifically, to REITs. At the start of 2007, around 80 percent of the portfolio was in REITs, he said, but by the end of the first quarter that level had fallen to around 27 percent. REIT holdings now make up 52 percent, he said.
 ''The move back to REITs,'' he explained, ''reflects the fact that the valuations have retreated.''

HEADLINE: Two Views of Innovation, Colliding in Washington

BYLINE: By John Markoff

 BODY:
AS the Senate prepares to tinker with the nation's patent laws this spring, it's worth recalling the law of unintended consequences.
 From the vantage point of a half-century, for example, it's clear that the formation of Silicon Valley involved serendipity more than intentional design.
 The co-inventor of the transistor and the founder of the valley's first chip company, William Shockley, moved to Palo Alto, Calif., because his mother lived there. Moreover, although the transistor was invented at Bell Labs in New Jersey, an antitrust lawsuit during the 1950s forced the AT&T phone behemoth to license the technology openly at a nominal charge. And, the venture capital industry, an important part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, was given a big boost by Congress in the late 1970s when legislation loosened pension fund regulations -- touching off an early wave of high-profile initial public offerings.
 Now, three decades later, Congress is likely to write legislation that could again reshape the contours of innovation and entrepreneurship for perhaps decades to come, in ways that are hard to predict. 
 Passed by the House of Representatives with relatively little debate, the Patent Reform Act of 2007 faces a bruising Senate fight this year. As it now stands, the bill would shift the balance of power in the legal quarrels between patent holders and possible infringers by significantly limiting damage awards. 
 Although it has become a perennial piece of proposed legislation in recent years, patent reform has acquired urgency in the past year, in the view of large technology companies. Intel, Microsoft, I.B.M. and Apple and others are increasingly finding that the nation's patent system has become a minefield, and they are looking for ways to limit the leverage of both small patent holders and patent ''trolls,'' or speculators who buy hundreds or thousands of patents. 
 Rather than depending on patents, large information technology companies can increasingly rely on their market power and cross-licensing relationships. As a result, they are trying to rein in huge patent settlements like the $612.5 million award that NTP Inc. won from Research In Motion, the maker of the popular BlackBerry wireless device, or the $1.52 billion award that Lucent briefly won against Gateway Inc. and Microsoft. (It was recently overturned.)
 It appears that the Senate leadership has sympathy for the large technology companies. Opposed to big tech is a small group of high-profile inventors, like the Segway designer Dean Kamen and the former Apple engineer and QuickTime co-inventor Steve Perlman, as well as venture capitalists and a growing array of smaller businesses that do not share the market power of the largest companies. They have joined forces with the pharmaceutical industry, which has traditionally relied on the protection of a strong patent system.
 The battle lines are now established, and legislators are being asked to grapple with the question of how best to protect innovation.
 On the one hand, in changing the nation's patent laws, Congress runs the risk of throttling the little guy -- the Stephen Wozniaks and the Steven Jobses -- who strike out from their garages with novel ideas that change the world. On the other hand, consumers have clearly benefited from the ability of large technology companies like Intel and Microsoft to use their prodigious market power to drive down prices.
 If we limit the incentive of the individual inventor in a garage to transform an entire industry, will there still be enough innovation in the corporate research labs of industrial giants?
 It is easy to see the imperfections of the current law and its impact on consumer products. For example, although the Apple iPhone has many superior features, its e-mail function is in most cases clunky when compared with the earlier R.I.M. BlackBerry. Industry executives say that's because Apple has been forced to tiptoe around the patents held by NTP. Although the patents have been largely invalidated by the United States Patent Office, there are still active lawsuits that NTP has brought.
 Mr. Perlman says the Supreme Court has already made two landmark rulings that he says have largely addressed the ''troll'' problem without harming independent inventors like himself. In one case, eBay v. MercExchange, the court limited the ability of a patent covering a small feature to be used as a weapon, as in the NTP-R.I.M. settlement. In April, the court went much further in KSR International v. Teleflex, substantially raising the bar for patent holders in proving that their invention is not obvious. The ruling will make many existing patents more vulnerable and make new patents harder to get as well.
 The peril of the new patent legislation as currently written, he argues, is that it would allow the nation's dominant high technology companies to largely control the pace of innovation, leading to a situation the country has seen once before -- in the American auto industry.
 ''Detroit is a very clear example of what happens when you have large companies who have already established they're the winners,'' he said.
 Under the proposed law, what are known as the ''Georgia-Pacific factors,'' a set of 15 guidelines that courts now use for determining damages in patent cases, would be boiled down to a single concept of ''apportionment.'' Damage calculations would be based on an economic analysis to ensure that a royalty damage award captures only the economic value attributable to the patent's specific contribution over previous inventions.
 Because the very nature of innovation in the computer industry is to increase performance while reducing cost, this change will create a perverse incentive for inventors, Mr. Perlman argues. If an invention reduces the cost of a device, ''then your apportionment becomes less and less,'' he said.
 BACKERS of the new legislation are skeptical that the limits would have any major impact on incentives for individual inventors.
 ''I have to say I'm frankly astonished that apportionment has been this controversial,'' said Mark A. Lemley, an intellectual-property scholar at Stanford who has testified in support of the legislation. ''I can't think of a straight-faced argument that you as a patent owner are entitled to more than your invention has contributed to a product.''
 Congress watchers expect the bill to pass this year, even if the pendulum swings back partly toward the individual inventor before it clears the Senate. That would largely be because opponents may calculate that they have their best chance to water it down under the current Congress and administration. 
 For his part, Mr. Perlman, who has been awarded 73 United States patents, is fretting that a new patent law may permanently shift the balance between the big guys and the little guys.
 ''I need as much patent protection as I can get,'' he said. ''Otherwise Microsoft will clone a crummy version of one of my inventions, and I'll be bowled over.''

HEADLINE: A War of the States Over Dredging Rules

BYLINE: By TIM WACKER

 BODY:
IN October, Connecticut officials told the Post Road Boat Yard in Westchester that the marina had until Nov. 1 to produce the necessary New York permits before they would sign off on plans to place material from dredging in Long Island Sound.
 Normally, the permits, which are required by both states, take at least four months to acquire, but New York issued the marina a permit in just 10 days. 
 That Connecticut had set such a short deadline, and that New York rushed to meet it, is a reflection of a long-running feud between the two states over the dumping of dredge spoils in the Sound.
 ''The marinas are a ball in a Ping-Pong game the two states have been playing for years,'' said Daniel S. Natchez, an environmental engineer and 20-year industry veteran who was handling the state and federal dredging permit applications for the Post Road marina, which is in Mamaroneck Harbor. ''Basically, what Connecticut was doing with that deadline was thumbing its nose at New York State.'' 
 Such are the complexities of dredging in Long Island Sound.
 The 1,320-square-mile Sound is almost evenly owned by Connecticut and New York, but the states have fought for years over who gets to dump what, and where, and marina owners say they have been caught in the middle. Larger boats can no longer reach some marinas, industry officials say. 
 Connecticut says that placing dredge materials in the Sound is the only economically feasible way to keep its river-fed ports open and thriving. New York says the sediment dredged from Connecticut's old industrial ports is so polluted that it is a prime suspect in the demise of the Sound's lobster industry. New York wants alternatives explored and used.
 The upshot, Mr. Natchez and state and federal officials involved in the disputes say, is that when it comes to setting dredging policy concerning the Sound, the states have worked against each other more than they have cooperated. 
 Federal efforts to work out an agreement with the states are under way. Under a settlement reached last year, the plan for disposing of dredging materials must be in place by 2014 or all dredge dumping in the Sound must stop.
 ''I wouldn't call it petty infighting, I'd call it philosophical warfare,'' said Michael Ludwig, an aquatic resources specialist who worked on Sound issues for three decades for the National Marine Fisheries Service before going into private consulting last year.
 The interstate battle, however well intentioned by both sides, has been costly, he said.
 ''In the process, access to Long Island Sound is drying up,'' Mr. Ludwig said. ''Many marinas that used to be able to hold bigger boats can't anymore because they couldn't get or use the necessary dredging permits.''
 Historically, Connecticut's Westbrook Harbor channel, to which the public has access, has been kept at nine feet deep by the Army Corps of Engineers. These days it is close to two feet deep in some spots and rarely deeper than five at low tide, said Rives Potts, general manager at Pilots Point Marina in Westbrook, Conn.
 Access to the marina itself could also stand some dredging, but New York's opposition to dumping in the Sound has made dredging difficult and expensive, Mr. Potts said. That has put a chill on all dredging projects, public and private, he said, and that has put a damper on business at Pilots Point.
 ''A lot of our service business was large boats, but they just don't come here anymore,'' he said. ''We used to have 110 employees. Now we have 75, and it's due to the poor channel depth. At the same time, the cost of dredging has gone way up and the cost of permitting has gone way up.''
 The conflict results in part from federal legislation called the Ambro Amendment. Named after Jerome A. Ambro, a United States representative from Long Island from 1975 to 1981, this 1980 amendment made Long Island Sound the only non-ocean in the country protected under the stringent testing requirements of the 1972 Ocean Dumping Act. That gives New York powerful tools to challenge dredge dumping plans.
 Despite the Ambro Amendment, dredge dumping in the Sound still occurred after 1980. Most notably, 1.3 million cubic yards of Thames River-bottom sediments were dredged in 1996 and dumped in the Sound so the Seawolf submarine could be berthed in Groton, Conn. Shortly after, a disfiguring disease known as shell burn started turning up in lobster caught in the shadow of the dump site, and fishermen from New York's nearby Fishers Island put the blame on the dredge material.
 New York went to federal court to halt the project, saying the dredge material did not meet Ocean Dumping Act standards, and a settlement was reached that resulted in greater enforcement of the Ambro Amendment. 
 That is when dredging bills at Pilots Point Marina started to skyrocket, Mr. Potts said. The cost for dredging has risen to $15 per cubic yard, from $7 before the Ambro Amendment, Mr. Potts said. Even a small dredging project like that at Post Road can be more than 20,000 cubic yards, Mr. Natchez said. 
 The cost of testing sediments for contaminants before dredging has also soared, Mr. Potts said.
 The dispute between the states entered a new phase three years ago when the United States Environmental Protection Agency intervened. It tried to get areas of the Sound historically used as dumps for dredge material exempted from the Ocean Dumping Act, but New York objected, citing the presence of contaminants like polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and radioactive material in sediments from the Housatonic River in Connecticut.
 In its 25-page document challenging the E.P.A. action, New York also said that the presence of radioactive cobalt-60 from Thames River sediments in ''the open-water marine environment could result in rendering certain commercially and recreationally important marine species unacceptable for human use.''
 Those objections resulted in a settlement last year in which the E.P.A. called on the Army Corps of Engineers to work with the two states to prepare a dredge-material management plan that will assess the dredging requirements for each port on the Sound and how best to test for contaminants in the sediments there. The plan must also explore alternatives to dumping dredge materials in the Sound and examine when such alternatives can or must be used.
 Michael F. Keegan, project manager for the Corps of Engineers, called forging the plan ''a daunting task,'' but said, ''I see a great spirit of cooperation and trying to move forward here.''
 George Wisker, an environmental analyst with Connecticut's Office of Long Island Sound Programs, said the state gets five or six dredging applications a year for projects that affect anywhere from a few dozen to several thousand boats. 
 Mr. Wisker said that working with New York on the dredging-material management plan had been and would continue to be a challenge. But he said he was optimistic that the states had turned a corner in their dispute.
 The bigger problem, he said, will be getting Congress to finance the plan, which the Corps of Engineers has estimated would cost $16 million. The 2008 federal budget includes only $2.6 million for the plan, and it has yet to be approved. 
 Without federal money, the plan will not advance, Mr. Wisker said. ''People have strong feelings on both sides,'' he said, ''but we're trying to craft something that will work for all of us.''

HEADLINE: Across America, Deadly Echoes of Foreign Battles

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG and LIZETTE ALVAREZ. 
Research was contributed by Alain Delaqueriere, Amy Finnerty, Teddy Kider, Andrew Lehren, Renwick McLean, Jenny Nordberg and Margot Williams.

 BODY:
Late one night in the summer of 2005, Matthew Sepi, a 20-year-old Iraq combat veteran, headed out to a 7-Eleven in the seedy Las Vegas neighborhood where he had settled after leaving the Army.
 This particular 7-Eleven sits in the shadow of the Stratosphere casino-hotel in a section of town called the Naked City. By day, the area, littered with malt liquor cans, looks depressed but not menacing. By night, it becomes, in the words of a local homicide detective, ''like Falluja.''
 Mr. Sepi did not like to venture outside too late. But, plagued by nightmares about an Iraqi civilian killed by his unit, he often needed alcohol to fall asleep. And so it was that night, when, seized by a gut feeling of lurking danger, he slid a trench coat over his slight frame -- and tucked an assault rifle inside it. 
 ''Matthew knew he shouldn't be taking his AK-47 to the 7-Eleven,'' Detective Laura Andersen said, ''but he was scared to death in that neighborhood, he was military trained and, in his mind, he needed the weapon to protect himself.'' 
 Head bowed, Mr. Sepi scurried down an alley, ignoring shouts about trespassing on gang turf. A battle-weary grenadier who was still legally under-age, he paid a stranger to buy him two tall cans of beer, his self-prescribed treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.
 As Mr. Sepi started home, two gang members, both large and both armed, stepped out of the darkness. Mr. Sepi said in an interview that he spied the butt of a gun, heard a boom, saw a flash and ''just snapped.''
 In the end, one gang member lay dead, bleeding onto the pavement. The other was wounded. And Mr. Sepi fled, ''breaking contact'' with the enemy, as he later described it. With his rifle raised, he crept home, loaded 180 rounds of ammunition into his car and drove until police lights flashed behind him.
 ''Who did I take fire from?'' he asked urgently. Wearing his Army camouflage pants, the diminutive young man said he had been ambushed and then instinctively ''engaged the targets.'' He shook. He also cried.
 ''I felt very bad for him,'' Detective Andersen said.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Sepi was booked, and a local newspaper soon reported: ''Iraq veteran arrested in killing.''
 Town by town across the country, headlines have been telling similar stories. Lakewood, Wash.: ''Family Blames Iraq After Son Kills Wife.'' Pierre, S.D.: ''Soldier Charged With Murder Testifies About Postwar Stress.'' Colorado Springs: ''Iraq War Vets Suspected in Two Slayings, Crime Ring.'' 
 Individually, these are stories of local crimes, gut-wrenching postscripts to the war for the military men, their victims and their communities. Taken together, they paint the patchwork picture of a quiet phenomenon, tracing a cross-country trail of death and heartbreak.
 The New York Times found 121 cases in which veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan committed a killing in this country, or were charged with one, after their return from war. In many of those cases, combat trauma and the stress of deployment -- along with alcohol abuse, family discord and other attendant problems -- appear to have set the stage for a tragedy that was part destruction, part self-destruction.
 Three-quarters of these veterans were still in the military at the time of the killing. More than half the killings involved guns, and the rest were stabbings, beatings, strangulations and bathtub drownings. Twenty-five offenders faced murder, manslaughter or homicide charges for fatal car crashes resulting from drunken, reckless or suicidal driving. 
 About a third of the victims were spouses, girlfriends, children or other relatives, among them 2-year-old Krisiauna Calaira Lewis, whose 20-year-old father slammed her against a wall when he was recuperating in Texas from a bombing near Falluja that blew off his foot and shook up his brain. 
 A quarter of the victims were fellow service members, including Specialist Richard Davis of the Army, who was stabbed repeatedly and then set ablaze, his body hidden in the woods by fellow soldiers a day after they all returned from Iraq. 
 And the rest were acquaintances or strangers, among them Noah P. Gamez, 21, who was breaking into a car at a Tucson motel when an Iraq combat veteran, also 21, caught him, shot him dead and then killed himself outside San Diego with one of several guns found in his car.
 Tracking the Killings
 The Pentagon does not keep track of such killings, most of which are prosecuted not by the military justice system but by civilian courts in state after state. Neither does the Justice Department.
 To compile and analyze its list, The Times conducted a search of local news reports, examined police, court and military records and interviewed the defendants, their lawyers and families, the victims' families and military and law enforcement officials.
 This reporting most likely uncovered only the minimum number of such cases, given that not all killings, especially in big cities and on military bases, are reported publicly or in detail. Also, it was often not possible to determine the deployment history of other service members arrested on homicide charges. 
 The Times used the same methods to research homicides involving all active-duty military personnel and new veterans for the six years before and after the present wartime period began with the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.
 This showed an 89 percent increase during the present wartime period, to 349 cases from 184, about three-quarters of which involved Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. The increase occurred even though there have been fewer troops stationed in the United States in the last six years and the American homicide rate has been, on average, lower.
 The Pentagon was given The Times's roster of homicides. It declined to comment because, a spokesman, Lt. Col. Les Melnyk, said, the Department of Defense could not duplicate the newspaper's research. Further, Colonel Melnyk questioned the validity of comparing prewar and wartime numbers based on news media reports, saying that the current increase might be explained by ''an increase in awareness of military service by reporters since 9/11.'' He also questioned the value of ''lumping together different crimes such as involuntary manslaughter with first-degree homicide.''
 Given that many veterans rebound successfully from their war experiences and some flourish as a result of them, veterans groups have long deplored the attention paid to the minority of soldiers who fail to readjust to civilian life.
 After World War I, the American Legion passed a resolution asking the press ''to subordinate whatever slight news value there may be in playing up the ex-service member angle in stories of crime or offense against the peace.'' An article in the Veterans of Foreign Wars magazine in 2006 referred with disdain to the pervasive ''wacko-vet myth,'' which, veterans say, makes it difficult for them to find jobs.
 Clearly, committing homicide is an extreme manifestation of dysfunction for returning veterans, many of whom struggle in quieter ways, with crumbling marriages, mounting debt, deepening alcohol dependence or more-minor tangles with the law.
 But these killings provide a kind of echo sounding for the profound depths to which some veterans have fallen, whether at the bottom of a downward spiral or in a sudden burst of violence.
 Thirteen of these veterans took their own lives after the killings, and two more were fatally shot by the police. Several more attempted suicide or expressed a death wish, like Joshua Pol, a former soldier convicted of vehicular homicide, who told a judge in Montana in 2006, ''To be honest with you, I really wish I had died in Iraq.''
 In some of the cases involving veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, the fact that the suspect went to war bears no apparent relationship to the crime committed or to the prosecution and punishment. But in many of the cases, the deployment of the service member invariably becomes a factor of some sort as the legal system, families and communities grapple to make sense of the crimes.
 This is especially stark where a previously upstanding young man -- there is one woman among the 121 -- appears to have committed a random act of violence. And The Times's analysis showed that the overwhelming majority of these young men, unlike most civilian homicide offenders, had no criminal history. 
 ''When they've been in combat, you have to suspect immediately that combat has had some effect, especially with people who haven't shown these tendencies in the past,'' said Robert Jay Lifton, a lecturer in psychiatry at Harvard Medical School/Cambridge Health Alliance who used to run ''rap groups'' for Vietnam veterans and fought to earn recognition for what became known as post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
 ''Everything is multicausational, of course,'' Dr. Lifton continued. ''But combat, especially in a counterinsurgency war, is such a powerful experience that to discount it would be artificial.''
 Few of these 121 war veterans received more than a cursory mental health screening at the end of their deployments, according to interviews with the veterans, lawyers, relatives and prosecutors. Many displayed symptoms of combat trauma after their return, those interviews show, but they were not evaluated for or received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder until after they were arrested for homicides. 
 What is clear is that experiences on the streets of Baghdad and Falluja shadowed these men back to places like Longview, Tex., and Edwardsville, Ill. 
 ''He came back different'' is the shared refrain of the defendants' family members, who mention irritability, detachment, volatility, sleeplessness, excessive drinking or drug use, and keeping a gun at hand.
 ''You are unleashing certain things in a human being we don't allow in civic society, and getting it all back in the box can be difficult for some people,'' said William C. Gentry, an Army reservist and Iraq veteran who works as a prosecutor in San Diego County.
 When Archie O'Neil, a gunnery sergeant in the Marines, returned from a job handling dead bodies in Iraq, he became increasingly paranoid, jumpy and fearful -- moving into his garage, eating M.R.E.'s, wearing his camouflage uniform, drinking heavily and carrying a gun at all times, even to answer the doorbell.
 ''It was like I put one person on a ship and sent him over there, and they sent me a totally different person back,'' Monique O'Neil, his wife, testified. 
 A well-respected and decorated noncommissioned officer who did not want to endanger his chances for advancement, Sergeant O'Neil did not seek help for the PTSD that would later be diagnosed by government psychologists. ''The Marine way,'' his lawyer said at a preliminary hearing, ''was to suck it up.''
 On the eve of his second deployment to Iraq in 2004, Sergeant O'Neil fatally shot his mistress, Kimberly O'Neal, after she threatened to kill his family while he was gone.
 During a military trial at Camp Pendleton, Calif., a Marine defense lawyer argued that ''the ravages of war'' provided the ''trigger'' for the killing. In 2005, a military jury convicted Sergeant O'Neil of murder but declined to impose the minimum sentence, life with the possibility of parole, considering it too harsh. A second jury, however, convened only for sentencing, voted the maximum penalty, life without parole. The case is on appeal. 
 As with Sergeant O'Neil, a connection between a veteran's combat service and his crime is sometimes declared overtly. Other times, though, the Iraq connection is a lingering question mark as offenders' relatives struggle to understand how a strait-laced teenager or family man or wounded veteran ended up behind bars -- or dead.
 That happened in the case of Stephen Sherwood, who enlisted in the Army at 34 to obtain medical insurance when his wife got pregnant. He may never have been screened for combat trauma.
 Yet Mr. Sherwood shot his wife and then himself nine days after returning from Iraq in the summer of 2005. Several months before, the other soldiers in his tank unit had been killed by a rocket attack while he was on a two-week leave to celebrate the first birthday of his now-orphaned son.
 ''When he got back to Iraq, everyone was dead,'' his father, Robert Sherwood, said. ''He had survivor's guilt.'' Then his wife informed him that she wanted to end their marriage. 
 After the murder-suicide, Mr. Sherwood's parents could not help but wonder what role Iraq played and whether counseling might have helped keep their son away from the brink.
 ''Ah boy, the amount of heartbreak involved in all of this,'' said Dr. Jonathan Shay, a psychiatrist for the Department of Veterans Affairs in Boston and the author of two books that examine combat trauma through the lens of classical texts.
 An Ancient Connection
 The troubles and exploits of the returning war veteran represent a searing slice of reality. They have served as a recurring artistic theme throughout history -- from Homer's ''Odyssey'' to the World War I novel ''All Quiet on the Western Front,'' from the post-Vietnam-era movie ''The Deer Hunter'' to last fall's film ''In the Valley of Elah.''
 At the heart of these tales lie warriors plagued by the kind of psychic wounds that have always afflicted some fraction of combat veterans. In an online course for health professionals, Capt. William P. Nash, the combat/operational stress control coordinator for the Marines, reaches back to Sophocles' account of Ajax, who slipped into a depression after the Trojan War, slaughtered a flock of sheep in a crazed state and then fell on his own sword.
 The nature of the counterinsurgency war in Iraq, where there is no traditional front line, has amplified the stresses of combat, and multiple tours of duty -- a third of the troops involved in Iraq and Afghanistan have deployed more than once -- ratchet up those stresses.
 In earlier eras, various labels attached to the psychological injuries of war: soldier's heart, shell shock, Vietnam disorder. Today the focus is on PTSD, but military health care officials are seeing a spectrum of psychological issues, with an estimated half of the returning National Guard members, 38 percent of soldiers and 31 percent of marines reporting mental health problems, according to a Pentagon task force.
 Decades of studies on the problems of Vietnam veterans have established links between combat trauma and higher rates of unemployment, homelessness, gun ownership, child abuse, domestic violence, substance abuse -- and criminality. On a less scientific level, such links have long been known.
 ''The connection between war and crime is unfortunately very ancient,'' said Dr. Shay, the V.A. psychiatrist and author. ''The first thing that Odysseus did after he left Troy was to launch a pirate raid on Ismarus. Ending up in trouble with the law has always been a final common pathway for some portion of psychologically injured veterans.''
 The National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study, considered the most thorough analysis of this population, found that 15 percent of the male veterans still suffered from full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder more than a decade after the war ended. Half of the veterans with active PTSD had been arrested or in jail at least once, and 34.2 percent more than once. Some 11.5 percent of them had been convicted of felonies, and veterans are more likely to have committed violent crimes than nonveterans, according to government studies. In the mid-1980s, with so many Vietnam veterans behind bars that Vietnam Veterans of America created chapters in prisons, veterans made up a fifth of the nation's inmate population. 
 As Iraq and Afghanistan veterans get enmeshed in the criminal justice system, former advocates for Vietnam veterans are disheartened by what they see as history repeating itself. 
 ''These guys today, I recognize the hole in their souls,'' said Hector Villarreal, a criminal defense lawyer in Mission, Tex., who briefly represented a three-time Iraq combat veteran charged with manslaughter.
 Brockton D. Hunter, a criminal defense lawyer in Minneapolis, told colleagues in a recent lecture at the Minnesota State Bar Association that society should try harder to prevent veterans from self-destructing. 
 ''To truly support our troops, we need to apply our lessons from history and newfound knowledge about PTSD to help the most troubled of our returning veterans,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''To deny the frequent connection between combat trauma and subsequent criminal behavior is to deny one of the direct societal costs of war and to discard another generation of troubled heroes.''
 'The Town Was Torn Up'
 At the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution in Nebraska, Seth Strasburg, 29, displays an imposing, biker-style presence. He has a shaved head, bushy chin beard and tattoos scrolled around his thick arms and neck, one of which quotes, in Latin, a Crusades-era dictum: ''Kill them all. God will know his own.'' 
 Beneath this fierce exterior, however, Mr. Strasburg, an Iraq combat veteran who pleaded no contest to manslaughter and gun charges in 2006, hides a tortured compulsion to understand his actions. Growing up in rural Nebraska, he read military history. Now he devours books like Lt. Col. Dave Grossman's ''On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society'' and Dr. Shay's ''Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming.''
 Because Mr. Strasburg is introspective, he provides a window into the reverberations of combat violence within one veteran's psyche and from there outward. In Arnold, Neb., population 679, the unintentional killing last year by Mr. Strasburg of Thomas Tiffany Varney V, a pre-mortuary science major known as Moose, was a deeply unsettling event.
 ''To lose one young man permanently and another to prison, with Iraq mixed up in the middle of it -- the town was torn up,'' said Pamela Eggleston, a waitress at Suzy's Pizza and Spirits. 
 In late 2005, Mr. Strasburg returned to Arnold for a holiday leave after two years in Iraq. Once home, he did not easily shed the extreme vigilance that had become second nature. He traveled around rural Nebraska with a gun and body armor in his Jeep, feeling irritable, out of sorts and out of place in tranquil, ''American Idol''-obsessed America.
 During his leave, he shrank from questions about Iraq because he hated the cavalier ones: ''So, did you kill anybody? What was it like?'' 
 He had, in fact, killed somebody in Iraq and was having trouble dealing with it. Like several veterans interviewed, Mr. Strasburg was plagued by one death before he caused another one.
 In 2004, Sergeant Strasburg's section was engaged in a mission to counter a proliferation of improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, on the road west of Mosul. One night, posted in an old junked bus, he watched the road for hours until an Iraqi man, armed and out after curfew, appeared and circled a field, kicking the dirt as if he were searching for something. Finally, the man bent down, straining to pick up a large white flour sack, which he then dragged toward the road.
 ''In my mind at the time, he had this I.E.D. hidden out there during the day and he was going to set it in place,'' Mr. Strasburg said. ''We radioed it in. They said, 'Whatever, use your discretion.' So I popped him.''
 With others on his reconnaissance team, Mr. Strasburg helped zip the man into a body bag, taking a few minutes to study the face that he now cannot forget. When they went to search the flour sack, they found nothing but gravel.
 ''I reported the kill to the battalion,'' Mr. Strasburg said. ''They said, you know: 'Good shot. It's legal. Whatever. Don't worry about it.' After that, it was never mentioned. But, you know, I had some issues with it later.''
 Mr. Strasburg's voice broke and he turned his head, wiping his eyes. A reporter noted that he was upset. 
 ''I'm trying not to be,'' he said, then changed his mind. ''I mean, how can you not be? If you're human. What if I had waited?''
 ''Maybe I was too eager,'' he added. ''Maybe I wanted to be the first one to get a kill, you know? Maybe, maybe, maybe. And that will never go away.''
 Which bothers him, Mr. Strasburg said, telling himself: ''Get over it. You shot somebody. Everybody else shot somebody, too.''
 Shortly after Mr. Strasburg's military tour of duty ended, he returned to Iraq as a private contractor because, he said, he did not know what else to do with himself after eight years in the Army. ''I have no skill other than carrying a gun,'' he said.
 By late 2005, home on leave, he was preparing to return once more to Iraq in January.
 On New Year's Eve, Mr. Strasburg, accompanied by his brother, consumed vodka cocktails for hours at Jim's Bar and Package in Arnold. Toward evening's end, he engaged in an intense conversation with a Vietnam veteran, after which, he said, he inexplicably holstered his gun and headed to a party. Outside the party, he drunkenly approached a Chevrolet Suburban crowded with young people, got upset and thrust his gun inside the car. 
 Mr. Strasburg said he did not remember what provoked him. According to one account, a young man -- not the victim -- set him off by calling him a paid killer. Mr. Strasburg, according to the prosecutor, stuck his gun under the young man's chin. There was a struggle over the gun. It went off. And Mr. Varney, a strapping 21-year-old with a passion for hunting, car racing and baseball, was struck.
 Asked if he pulled the trigger, Mr. Strasburg said, ''I don't know,'' adding that he took responsibility: ''It was my gun and I was drunk. But what the hell was I thinking?''
 The Suburban drove quickly away. Mr. Strasburg jumped into his Jeep, speeding along wintry roads until he crashed into a culvert. Feeling doomed, he said, he donned his bulletproof vest and plunged into the woods, where he fell asleep in the snow as police helicopters and state troopers closed in on him.
 Mr. Strasburg had never been screened for post-traumatic stress disorder. Like many soldiers, he did not take seriously the Army's mental health questionnaires given out at his tour's end. ''They were retarded,'' he said. ''All of us were like, 'Let's do this quickly so we can go home.' They asked: 'Did you see any dead bodies? Did you take part in any combat operations?' Come on, we were in Iraq. They didn't even ask us the really important question, if you killed someone.''
 After his arrest, a psychologist hired by his family diagnosed combat trauma in Mr. Strasburg, writing in an evaluation that post-traumatic stress disorder, exacerbated by alcohol, served as a ''major factor'' in the shooting.
 A Judge's Harsh Words
 At the sentencing hearing in Broken Bow, Neb., in September 2006, however, the judge discounted the centrality of the PTSD. He called Mr. Varney ''the epitome of an innocent victim'' and Mr. Strasburg ''a bully'' who ''misconstrued comments'' and ''reacted in a belligerent and hostile manner.'' In a courtroom filled with Arnold townspeople and Iraq veterans, he sentenced Mr. Strasburg to 22 to 36 years in prison.
 Mr. Strasburg's mother, Aneita, believing that the shooting was a product of his combat trauma, started an organization to create awareness about post-traumatic stress disorder.
 Her activism, however, deeply offended the victim's parents, who run the Arnold Funeral Home. 
 ''I'm sorry, but it feels like a personal affront, like she's trying to excuse our son's death with the war,'' Barb Varney said, adding that Mr. Strasburg has ''never shown any remorse.''
 Thomas Tiffany Varney IV, the victim's father, expressed skepticism about Mr. Strasburg's PTSD and the disorder in general, saying, ''His grandfather, my dad, a lot of people been there, done that, and it didn't affect them,'' Mr. Varney said. ''They're trying to brush it away, 'Well, he murdered someone, it's just post-traumatic stress.'<0>''
 Mr. Strasburg himself, whose diagnosis was confirmed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, expressed discomfort with his post-traumatic stress disorder and its connection to his crime. ''It's not a be-all-and-end-all excuse, and I don't mean it to be,'' he said.
 As Mr. Strasburg prefers to see it, he had adapted his behavior to survive in Iraq and then retained that behavior -- vigilant, distrustful, armed -- when he returned home. ''You need time to decompress,'' he said. ''If the exact same circumstances had happened a year later'' -- the circumstances of that New Year's Eve -- ''nothing would have happened. It never would have went down.'' 
 Mr. Strasburg also voiced reluctance to being publicly identified as a PTSD sufferer, worried that his former military colleagues would see him as a weakling. ''Nobody wants to be that guy who says, 'I got counseling this afternoon, Sergeant,'<0>'' he said, mimicking a whining voice.
 Mr. Strasburg's former platoon leader, Capt. Benjamin D. Tiffner, who was killed in an I.E.D. attack in Baghdad in November, wrote a letter to Nebraska state authorities. He protested the length of the sentence and requested Mr. Strasburg's transfer ''to a facility that would allow him to deal with his combat trauma.''
 ''Seth has been asked and required to do very violent things in defense of his country,'' Captain Tiffner wrote. ''He spent the majority of 2003 to 2005 in Iraq solving very dangerous problems by using violence and the threat of violence as his main tools. He was congratulated and given awards for these actions. This builds in a person the propensity to deal with life's problems through violence and the threat of violence.
 ''I believe this might explain in some way why Seth reacted the way that he did that night in Nebraska,'' the letter continued. ''I'm not trying to explain away Seth's actions, but I think he is a special case and he needs to be taken care of by our judicial system and our medical system.''
 Many Don't Seek Treatment
 Unlike during the Vietnam War, the current military has made a concerted effort, through screenings and research, to gauge the mental health needs of returning veterans. But gauging and addressing needs are different, and a Pentagon task force last year described the military mental health system as overburdened, ''woefully'' understaffed, inadequately financed and undermined by the stigma attached to PTSD. 
 Although early treatment might help veterans retain their relationships and avoid developing related problems like depression, alcoholism and criminal behavior, many do not seek or get such help. And this group of homicide defendants seems to be a prime example. 
 Like Mr. Strasburg, many of these veterans learned that they had post-traumatic stress disorder only after their arrests. And their mental health issues often went unevaluated even after the killings if they were pleading not guilty, if they did not have aggressive lawyers and relatives -- or if they killed themselves first.
 Of the 13 combat veterans in The Times database who committed murder-suicides, only two, as best as it can be determined, had psychological problems diagnosed by the military health care system after returning from war.
 ''The real tragedy in these veterans' case is that, where PTSD is a factor, it is highly treatable,'' said Lawrence W. Sherman, director of the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. ''And when people are exposed to serious trauma and don't get it treated, it is a serious risk factor for violence.''
 At various times, the question of whether the military shares some blame for these killings gets posed. This occurs especially where the military knew beforehand of a combat veteran's psychological troubles, marital problems or history of substance abuse. 
 In some cases, the military sent service members with pre-existing problems -- known histories of mental illness, drug abuse or domestic abuse -- into combat only to find those problems exacerbated by the stresses of war. In other cases, they quickly discharged returning veterans with psychological or substance abuse problems, after which they committed homicides.
 Perhaps no case has posed the question of military liability more bluntly than that of Lucas T. Borges, 25, a former private in the Marines whose victims are suing the United States government, maintaining that the military ''had a duty to take reasonable steps to prevent Borges from harming others.'' The government is trying to get the claim dismissed.
 Mr. Borges immigrated from Brazil at 14 and joined the Marines four years later. After spending six months in Iraq at the beginning of the war, he ''came back different, like he was out of his mind,'' said his mother, Dina Borges, who runs a small cleaning business in Maryland.
 Assigned on his return to a maintenance battalion at Camp Lejeune, N.C., Private Borges developed a taste for the ether used to start large internal combustion engines in winter. 
 Mr. Borges did have a history of marijuana use, which he disclosed to the Marines when he enlisted, said Jeffrey Weber, a lawyer who represented the victims until recently. 
 But inhaling ether, which produces both a dreamy high and impairment, was new to him, and his sister, Gabriela, a 20-year-old George Washington University student, believes that he developed the habit to relieve the anxiety that he brought home from war.
 The Marines, aware of Mr. Borges's past drug use, also knew that he had developed an ether problem, but they never removed him from the job where he had ready access to his drug of choice, according to the lawsuit. They never offered him drug treatment, either, Mr. Borges's own lawyer said in court.
 Four months after he returned from Iraq, military officials moved to discharge Private Borges when he was caught inhaling ether in his car. They impounded the car, which contained several canisters of the government's ether, and sent Mr. Borges, who threatened to kill himself, to the mental health ward of the base hospital.
 ''He was finally under the care of a psychiatrist, but they pulled him from that because he was a problem and they wanted to get rid of him,'' Mr. Weber said. ''They processed him out, handed him the keys to his car, and his supervisor said, 'If you're not careful, you're going to kill somebody.'<0>'' 
 When Mr. Borges retrieved his 1992 Camaro, he discovered that the Marines had left their ether canisters inside -- they did not have anywhere to store them, officials said at trial -- and immediately got high. He then drove east down the westbound lane of a state highway, slamming headfirst into the victims' car, killing 19-year-old Jamie Marie Lumsden, the daughter of a marine who served in Iraq, and seriously injuring four others.
 Convicted of second-degree murder, Mr. Borges was sentenced to 24 to 32 years in prison.
 Lost in Las Vegas
 The Army has recently developed a course called ''Battlemind Training,'' intended to help soldiers make the psychological transition back into civilian society. ''In combat, the enemy is the target,'' the course material says. ''Back home, there are no enemies.'' 
 This can be a difficult lesson to learn. Many soldiers and marines find themselves at war with their spouses, their children, their fellow service members, the world at large and ultimately themselves when they come home. 
 ''Based on my experience, most of these veterans feel just terrible that they've caused this senseless harm,'' Dr. Shay said. ''Most veterans don't want to hurt other people.''
 Matthew Sepi withdrew into himself on his return from Iraq.
 A Navajo Indian who saw his hometown of Winslow, Ariz., as a dead end, Mr. Sepi joined the Army at 16, with a permission slip from his mother.
 For a teenager without much life experience, the war in Iraq was mind-bending, and Mr. Sepi saw intense action. When his infantry company arrived in April 2003, it was charged with tackling resistant Republican Guard strongholds north of Baghdad.
 ''The war was supposedly over, except it wasn't,'' Mr. Sepi said. ''I was a ground troop, with a grenade launcher attached to my M-16. Me and my buddies were the ones that assaulted the places. We went in the buildings and cleared the buildings. We shot and got shot at.''
 After a year of combat, Mr. Sepi returned to Fort Carson, Colo., where life seemed dull and regimented. The soldiers did not discuss their war experiences or their postwar emotions. Instead, they partied, Mr. Sepi said, and the drinking got him and others in trouble. Arrested for under-age driving under the influence, he was ordered to complete drug and alcohol education and counseling. Shortly after that, he decided to leave the Army.
 Feeling lost after his discharge ''with a few little medals,'' he ended up moving to Las Vegas, a city that he did not know, with the friend of a friend. Broke, Mr. Sepi settled in the Naked City, which is named for the showgirls who used to sunbathe topless there. After renting a roach-infested hole in the wall with an actual hole in the wall, he found jobs doing roadwork and making plastic juice bottles in a factory. Alone and lonely, he started feeling the effects of his combat experiences.
 In Las Vegas, Mr. Sepi's alcohol counselor took him under his wing, recognizing war-related PTSD in his extreme jumpiness, adrenaline rushes, nightmares and need to drink himself into unconsciousness.
 The counselor directed him to seek specialized help from a Veterans Affairs hospital. Mr. Sepi said he called the V.A. and was told to report in person. But working 12-hour shifts at a bottling plant, he failed to do so.
 In July 2005, when Mr. Sepi was arrested, he identified himself as an Iraq veteran. But, Detective Andersen said, ''He didn't act like a combat veteran. He acted like a scared kid.''
 Soon afterward, Nancy Lemcke, Mr. Sepi's public defender, visited him in jail. ''I asked him about PTSD,'' Ms. Lemcke said. ''And he starts telling me about Iraq and all of a sudden, his eyes well up with tears, and he cries out: 'We had the wrong house! We had the wrong house!' And he's practically hysterical.''
 As part of an operation to break down the resistance in and around Balad, Mr. Sepi and his unit had been given a nightly list of targets for capture. Camouflaged, the American soldiers crept through towns after midnight, working their way down the lists, setting off C-4 plastic explosives at each address to stun the residents into submission.
 ''This particular night, it was December 2003, there was, I'd say, more than 100 targets,'' Mr. Sepi said. ''Each little team had a list. And at this one house, we blow the gate and find out that there's this guy sitting in his car just inside that gate. We move in, and he, like, stumbles out of his car, and he's on fire, and he's, like, stumbling around in circles in his front yard. So we all kind of don't know what to do, and he collapses, and we go inside the house and search it and find out it's the wrong house.''
 Although Mr. Sepi said that he felt bad at the time, he also knew that he had done nothing but follow orders and that the Army had paid the man's family a settlement. He did not imagine that the image of the flaming, stumbling Iraqi civilian would linger like a specter in his psyche.
 Listening to Mr. Sepi recount the story of a death that he regretted in Iraq while grappling with a death that he regretted in Las Vegas, his lawyer grew determined to get him help. ''It was just so shocking, and his emotions were so raw, and he was so messed up,'' Ms. Lemcke said.
 An Unusual Legal Deal
 She found compassion for him among the law enforcement officials handling the case. The investigation backed up Mr. Sepi's story of self-defense, although it was never determined who fired first. It made an impression on the police that he was considerably outweighed -- his 130 pounds against a 210-pound man and a 197-pound woman. And it helped Mr. Sepi that his victims were drifters, with no family members pressing for justice. 
 The police said that Kevin Ratcliff, 36, who was shot and wounded by Mr. Sepi, belonged to the Crips and was a convicted felon; Sharon Jackson, 47, who was killed, belonged to NC, the Naked City gang, and an autopsy found alcohol, cocaine and methamphetamines in her blood.
 Buoyed by an outpouring of support from Mr. Sepi's fellow soldiers and veterans' advocates, Ms. Lemcke pressed the Department of Veterans Affairs to find treatment programs for Mr. Sepi. This allowed an unusual deal with the local district attorney's office: in exchange for the successful completion of treatment for substance abuse and PTSD, the charges against Mr. Sepi would be dropped.
 After about three months in jail, Mr. Sepi spent three months at a substance abuse program in Prescott, Ariz., in late 2005, where the graying veterans presented an object lesson: ''I don't want to be like that when I'm older,'' he said to himself. In early 2006, he transferred to a PTSD treatment center run by the V.A. in Topeka, Kan., where he learned how to deal with anger, sadness and guilt, to manage the symptoms of his anxiety disorder and, it seems, to vanquish his nightmares.
 ''For some reason, my bad dreams went away,'' he said. ''It's pretty cool.''
 Free to start life over, Mr. Sepi stepped tentatively into adulthood. Settling in Phoenix, he enrolled in automotive school and got a job as a welder for a commercial bakery. Once in a while, he said, a loud noise still starts his heart racing and he breaks into a cold sweat, ready for action. But he knows now how to calm himself, he said, he no longer owns guns, and he is sober and sobered by what he has done.
 ''That night,'' he said, of the hot summer night in Las Vegas when he was arrested for murder, ''if I could erase it, I would. Killing is part of war, but back home ...''

HEADLINE: On the Lookout for Out-of District Students

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM

 BODY:
AT 8 o'clock one morning, Juanita Ludwig and Vincent Constantino, employees of Clifton Public Schools, are knocking on the door at a house to check a tip. Someone had said a Clifton elementary school student did not really live there and was sneaking in from another district.
 Ms. Ludwig, the supervisor of counseling and student services, explains to the parent who answers the door that the district must check to see that the child lives there most of the time. ''We made sure there were age-appropriate toys for an 8-year-old child,'' she said. ''We explain to the parents that the child must stay at the house at least four nights a week.'' 
 ''They weren't upset,'' Ms. Ludwig said. ''A majority of people understand.'' 
 This time, Ms. Ludwig and Mr. Constantino, the district's domicile investigator, concluded that the student lived there full time. But that is often not the case.
 In the 2006-7 school year, the Clifton district, which has 10,500 students, investigated 625 reports of students illegally attending its schools; it caught 62 last year and 59 the year before. Those students cost the district hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
 Clifton is hardly the only district searching for students sneaking into its schools. While the State Department of Education does not keep statistics, administrators in suburban districts report that hundreds of tips are received and checked every year. 
 And there are many ways to find students who don't belong. Bounties, detectives, stakeouts with cameras, and hot lines that receive tips from anonymous callers are tools that some school districts use to combat the perennial problem of illegally enrolled students.
 Those who are caught can suffer consequences: For example, in Ewing, 13 families were asked to remove their children from its schools last year when attendance officers investigated and found the families did not live in the Mercer County community.
 There is strong anecdotal evidence that families, including some from Pennsylvania and New York, try to sneak into some of the state's top suburban districts, said Richard Vespucci, a Department of Education spokesman.
 ''It's been an issue on again and off again,'' he said. ''It's a bigger issue when the economic climate is weaker. It's climates like this where property taxes are a real issue and anyone spending public funds wants to show where they are spending the money.''
 Districts combat the problems in various ways. Clifton, for example, offers a $300 bounty to anyone reporting a student who turns out to be attending a district school illegally; it has paid once so far this school year, once last year and twice the year before. Students are required to reregister in certain grades in some districts, and attendance officers go to students' homes to verify they live there.
 School administrators say taxpayers demand the accountability. With the average per-pupil cost at about $12,000, taxpayers want to be assured that a student's ''permanent home is located within the school district,'' Mr. Vespucci said.
 In Cherry Hill, where about 400 such cases are investigated each year, the district got a tip a few years ago from a woman who lived in another South Jersey town. The woman said a fellow employee was bragging about sneaking her child into the Cherry Hill school district, said Don Bart, director of support operations for the district, which has almost 12,000 students. 
 The district's full-time attendance officer checked it out, and the student was asked to leave the district. ''We are just enforcing the law,'' Mr. Bart said.
 Under state law, a student a student may legally attend the school in the district where he or she resides the majority of the time. Out-of-district students are required to pay tuition. 
 Three years ago, the Clark Public School District hired a retired police officer to investigate cases of illegal students. The investigator has parked outside students' homes to see if they come out in the morning and checked documents like licenses and car registrations. 
 ''The key word here is domicile,'' Superintendent Vito Gagliardi said. ''The child must live in the house as a primary residence.'' 
 Dr. Gagliardi said the concern is not only for taxpayers, but also for a student who has to lie to teachers and classmates. ''In addition to protecting the tax dollar, this is unfair to the child,'' he said. Students whose parents take them to districts outside the one they live in have to be careful what they say, and it can be uncomfortable when someone wants to go to their house, he said. 
 In some cases in Clifton, investigators have followed buses or sat outside homes at 6:30 a.m. in an effort to see if students really live in the district, said Ms. Ludwig. The district also requires three proofs of residency. ''We are very vigilant,'' said Ira E. Oustatcher, assistant superintendent.
 With pressure on districts to reduce class size and stretch dollars, many taxpayers do not have patience for families sneaking into a district, be it for better schools, safety or convenience. 
 ''The school districts are not being coldhearted,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. ''There is a financial burden on them, and they have limited resources. This is painful for schools, but it's what the law says. It's been a nagging problem and fairly consistent over the years.''
 Ewing has one full-time attendance officer and four part-time officers, said Raymond Broach, the school superintendent. ''It's a pretty steady issue,'' he said. Students have been caught coming in from Bristol and Morrisville, Pa., across the Delaware River. 
 In Teaneck, Al Schulz, a retired police detective, is attendance officer. Sometimes, he watches to see if students are coming over the George Washington Bridge from New York, said David Bicofsky, the district spokesman. 
 ''You are talking $10,000 to $11,000 a year to educate a student,'' he said. ''You have to be vigilant for your taxpayers.''

HEADLINE: Three Approaches, And Each Paid Off

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
WHEN the stock market climbs, as it did in much of 2007, mutual fund managers can ride it upward, like hawks clustered in a rising column of warm air. But when it slides, as it did late in the year, smart picks -- and a dollop of luck -- matter more. Free rides become fewer. 
 In the fourth quarter, the market was dogged by recession worries and big losses on subprime mortgages and related securities at several leading investment banks. On top of that, the price of oil flirted with $100 a barrel. 
 Three mutual funds that thrived amid the tumult all stressed diversification more than the average fund does, and they used uncommon strategies or stretched beyond their original mandate. Grizzly Short, advised by Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, is a short fund, meaning that it makes money when stocks drop. The T. Rowe Price Africa & Middle East fund, in contrast, is a conventional long fund, seeking out shares with promising prospects, but it invests in two regions where few other funds tread. And Eaton Vance Dividend Builder, for its part, takes what's often a ho-hum undertaking -- utilities investing -- and tosses on some Tabasco sauce. It puts a big chunk of its shareholders' money to work abroad and seeks companies outside of the utility sector, its original focus. 
 Winning as Others Lose
 Matthew B. Paschke, co-manager of Grizzly Short, acknowledged that he couldn't help but celebrate when most stocks fell in the fourth quarter. ''I run a long account as well,'' he said. ''But shorting is so much more difficult that I find that I do get more excited about a good short than a good long pick.''
 Like any other short-seller, Mr. Paschke borrows shares of stock and agrees to sell them in the future, hoping that he'll be able to buy them at a lower price before he has to settle up. If all works as planned, the stock slips and Mr. Paschke buys shares, pocketing a profit. His niche is the opposite of the typical money manager's: instead of seeking companies with bright futures, the fund looks for possible heartaches and hassles -- and falling prices. 
 Leuthold Weeden relies on computer programs to pick stocks. With Grizzly Short, Mr. Paschke uses a ''vulnerability index'' that includes factors like insider sales and the probability of bankruptcy to rank stocks by the likelihood that they'll fall. If the index flags a company, he shorts it. ''We're religious about it,'' he said. ''We shorted a name today that I really didn't want to short. What we're trying to do is provide an unemotional approach to hedging market exposure.''
 In a falling market, the fund's returns should rise. ''Our benchmark is the inverse of the S.& P. 500,'' Mr. Paschke said. ''If the market's up 10 percent, we're going to be down 10 -- or more if we're underperforming. In the fourth quarter, we saw more stocks falling than rising, and that's an environment that we can shine in.''
 For the quarter, the fund, which carries no sales charge and had an expense ratio of 2.86 percent, returned 8.5 percent. For the year, it returned 6.6 percent. 
 Lately, the fund has shorted many financial companies and retailers. In contrast, with oil perched higher than a peregrine falcon, it has bet against few energy companies. 
 A Bet on the Middle East
 For many money managers outside the energy sector, high oil prices augur anxious times. But they have given Christopher D. Alderson, manager of T. Rowe Price Africa & Middle East, reason to exult. His new fund, which opened to investors in September, is effectively a wager on the financial future of the oil-rich Middle East. 
 ''We've got 90 percent of the fund in the Middle East, and that was the key reason that we did well in the fourth quarter,'' he said. The fund, which carries no sales charge and had an expense ratio of 1.75 percent, returned 21.6 percent for the quarter. 
 Emerging-market investing entails risks besides corporate missteps and economic turbulence. Investors also have to weigh perils like coups and wars, especially in volatile regions like parts of Africa and the Middle East. For that reason, Mr. Alderson advises against putting too much money in his fund. ''You definitely don't want to put all of your savings in this,'' he said, adding that a sensible allocation might be 5 percent of one's portfolio.
 That caution shouldn't suggest that Mr. Alderson, who has led T. Rowe Price's emerging-markets team for more than a decade, isn't bullish on these regions, particularly on the Middle East, whose economies have begun to wean themselves from dependence on oil, he said. Dubai, for example, is turning itself into a financial and tourism hub, and Abu Dhabi is investing heavily in roads, bridges and other forms of infrastructure so it won't be left behind. 
 ''We don't need $100-a-barrel oil for the fund to do well,'' he said. ''If oil went to $20, that would be a problem. But if it went to $60, that'd be just fine.''
 One of his picks that benefited from the Middle Eastern building boom was Orascom Construction Industries in Cairo. ''Fifty percent of their business is cement, and 50 percent is construction,'' he said. ''They have operations across the Middle East. They're quadrupling cement production and have an order book that lasts five years.'' 
 Utilities and Beyond
 Judith A. Saryan and Charlie Gaffney, co-managers of Eaton Vance Dividend Builder, hunt for stocks in foreign markets, too, though they prefer safer fare than Mr. Alderson's portfolio. Their fund was previously known as Eaton Vance Utilities, but its name and focus changed in August.
 ''The main reason we changed it was that the utilities sector was getting more and more concentrated,'' Ms. Saryan said. ''The number of names had been declining gradually.'' 
 She said that left too narrow a field to invest in. In addition, utility stocks have performed well over the last five years, so she and Mr. Gaffney saw fewer bargains. With a broader mandate, they still invest in utilities but will also consider any company, domestic or foreign, that recently raised its dividend or began issuing one. Such companies have traditionally outperformed the overall market. 
 Ms. Saryan and Mr. Gaffney also put a lot of their shareholders' money in foreign stocks -- recently 50 percent. Their international explorations have yielded holdings like the CEZ Group, the Czech Republic's leading power generator. ''They're one of the largest nuclear-power-plant owners in Europe,'' Mr. Gaffney said. ''So their plants are low-cost and low-carbon.''
 Looking abroad also led them to Acciona, a Madrid-based conglomerate with a power generation business that includes wind farms.
 ''We thought the wind business was undervalued,'' Mr. Gaffney said. 
 The fund returned 5.3 percent for the quarter and 22.9 percent for the year. Its Class A shares have an upfront sales charge of 5.75 percent, and it had an expense ratio of 1.06 percent.

Directing the Grants
 To the Editor:
 ''Can Foundations Take the Long View Again?'' (Re:framing, Jan. 6) presented the argument that grant makers should focus on grants for general operating expenses instead of supporting specific programs and services. 
 I couldn't disagree more. I am a grant maker of a public foundation, and our supporters rightfully expect that their donations are directed to programs that our mission specifies. If we were to provide grants for general expenses, the money could and most likely would be used for purposes outside our grant-giving mission and would not honor the intention of our donors.
 I also disagree with the idea that project-related grants sacrifice an organization's ability to focus on strategic work like advocacy. Organizations, if well managed, should be able to devote time to every aspect of their missions without sacrificing one thing for another. The challenge is to support organizations with a demonstrated track record of fiscal and program management that yields accountable and transparent results to donors and society at large.

 The Globalization Train
 To the Editor: 
 Unlike Alan Blinder in ''Stop the World (And Avoid Reality)'' (Economic View, Jan. 6), I have no problem with America's loss of faith in globalization.
 Sure, unemployment is currently at historically low levels, but flipping burgers at a fast-food restaurant is small compensation for a former steel worker whose job migrated to China. And funding a welfare program to cushion the economic pain is simply gratuitous paternalism. Under globalization, the rich have become much richer -- much as they did in the 1920s. It's time to make a change before another Depression engulfs America and the world.

HEADLINE: Michigan Voters Wary Of Revitalization Talk

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Amanda Cox contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: STANDISH, Mich. 

 BODY:
This quiet town, tucked between the thumb and the rest of the fingers in Michigan's mitten, feels worlds away from the struggling automobile factories of Flint and Detroit. But economic gloom has made its way here just as it has seeped through so much of this state.
 ''People come in looking for work, but how could I hire someone to help us?'' said Karen Dunn, 55, glancing around her empty coffee shop along Standish's main thoroughfare. ''To help with what?''
 In Michigan, where the unemployment rate, 7.4 percent in November, is the highest in the nation, people say the troubled economy is, by far, the most important issue any leader must address right now. 
 As they looked to Tuesday's primary, nearly all of about two dozen people interviewed here in recent days said they were relieved to see the presidential candidates finally speaking of the financial issues that worried them every day. 
 But many said they were also deeply skeptical of all the new economic promises: the sudden release of candidates' revitalization packages, talk of retraining programs, television commercials pledging help. While the economy seems now to have emerged as an issue among voters nationally, as job growth has stalled and oil prices hit $100 a barrel, Michigan, where the unemployment rate has been higher than the national average since September 2000, has been pondering the situation far longer. 
 People here have heard promises before.
 ''All of them are giving some sound bites about how they're going to change things, but it's hard to know whether any of it's real,'' Ms. Dunn's husband, Charles, a retired systems engineer from the automobile industry, said of the candidates. ''They say they are going to level the playing field with foreign countries, but where are the specifics? How do you do that?''
 In Standish, the seat of Arenac County, home to about 17,000 people, some say they have watched the state's economy falter before them. The county's unemployment rate was 10.1 percent in November; more significant, perhaps, is that 3.5 percent fewer people said they held jobs in November than a year ago, placing it among the top five counties in Michigan in terms of jobs lost.
 A lumber county in the late 1800s, Arenac has no single industry now. Farmers tend potatoes, beans, sugar beets and dairy operations. Tourism is central to the county's eastern edge along Saginaw Bay. Standish's biggest employer is the maximum security state prison, where 328 people work. But many residents say they once commuted to auto factories or worked for companies that supplied parts or uniforms or services to those factories. 
 ''The problem here, like all over this state, is that the auto industry is going in the toilet,'' said Al Marden, 62, who retired from the auto industry after 42 years. ''You didn't realize what boat you were in until you had 25 years in. And then there was nothing you could do.''
 Some here confessed that they had once studied the foreclosure notices in the local weekly newspaper -- usually five or six names -- for gossip, but said they could no longer bear to look now that the list had grown to several pages. They said they watched as lifelong friends moved away in search of better conditions; census officials estimate that Michigan lost 30,500 people in the year starting July 2006, one of only two states (along with Rhode Island) to lose population in that time. 
 Jeff Chaltraw, a local barber, said he once worked six days a week, dawn to 6 p.m., to handle the lines at his shop.
 ''Anymore, come 3:30 or 4 o'clock, I close up and just go home because there's nobody here,'' said Mr. Chaltraw, who is 55 and whose grandfather bought the barber shop in 1924. ''I don't know what any politician, what anyone, can possibly do to help the state of Michigan. It's really past gone.''
 Here, Democrats often pointedly blamed President Bush for economic woes and fondly reminisced about Bill Clinton's presidency, years when the nation felt flush. 
 ''When Bill Clinton left office, we had a great abundance in the bank, and now we don't know what's going on,'' Ed Burley, 70, said, adding that he was leaning toward voting for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and considered her candidacy a ''package deal'' with Mr. Clinton (and, hopefully, his cheerier fiscal days). 
 Republicans, meanwhile, angrily blamed Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat first elected in 2002, for the dire fiscal conditions. Some, particularly those of an earlier generation, reflected with nostalgia to what they considered happier times for Michigan and for the auto industry, when Gov. George W. Romney, the father of the Republican candidate Mitt Romney, ran the state in the 1960s. 
 ''I voted for his father and his mother too,'' Nancy Buttrick, 78, said, explaining her preference for Mr. Romney, whose mother, Lenore, made a failed bid for the Senate in 1970. ''As it is now, I've got a college graduate granddaughter who can't find a job.'' 
 Marian Forsyth, one of Ms. Buttrick's dining companions at the Standish Bakery and Restaurant, said Mr. Romney's business expertise at a private equity firm and as head of the troubled Salt Lake City Olympic Games was precisely what the region needed.
 ''A head for business is what can get the country out of this mess,'' Ms. Forsyth said, adding that Senator John McCain should serve as Mr. Romney's running mate to handle foreign affairs.
 State leaders for both political parties described the economy as the critical issue for candidates to answer here. Saul Anuzis, the Republican Party chairman, said the state's struggles -- and a desire to turn the national conversation toward the economy -- were among the reasons leaders here sought to have a primary early in the process.
 The early date, though, angered national leaders, and has set off waves of confusion among voters here, particularly among the Democrats. The Democratic Party has reprimanded the state and most of its candidates are not campaigning here; some, including Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards, had their names removed from the ballot, though Mrs. Clinton did not.
 Democrats here, particularly supporters of Mr. Edwards (whose anti-big-corporation message seemed to draw appeal here) and Mr. Obama, said they were not sure whether they would vote at all now. Supporters of Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obama are pressing voters to choose ''uncommitted'' as a sign of support for them, but people here seemed puzzled by the notion.
 Inside Standish's coin laundry, a woman who said did not want to be named for fear, she said, of never finding work again, told of being fired from her last job, watching her car be repossessed, and now waiting daily for a verdict on her late mortgage payments.
 But Kevin King, the mayor of Standish, said there were hopeful signs here too. A plastics company is adding at least 12 jobs. City leaders have closed the airstrip to make way for new industries that might come along. An Indian tribe has just opened a casino near Standish, creating scores of jobs and what Standish business owners hope will be a flood of customers.
 Whatever happens, Mr. King said, people can expect never to return to an earlier time here. His father worked for General Motors for 30 years, he said. In addition to being mayor, Mr. King said he taught at the school, coached the girls' basketball team and ran a drivers' education business.

The opposition Kuomintang party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections in Taiwan on Saturday. President Chen Shui-bian, who has antagonized China with his efforts to forge a national identity for the self-governing island, resigned as chairman of the governing Democratic Progressive Party to take responsibility for the loss. 
 The victory by the Kuomintang enhances its prospects of success at the voting for president in March, in which it is expected to continue campaigning for closer ties with China.
 At the close of counting, the official Central Election Commission said the Kuomintang had won 81 seats in the 113-seat Legislative Yuan, the Democratic Progressive Party won 27 and the balance went to minor parties and independents.
 Almost 60 percent of the 17 million eligible voters turned out in the first election under a new system in which the number of seats in the chamber was halved in an effort to streamline lawmaking and improve the quality of debate.
 ''It is the worst defeat since the founding of the D.P.P.,'' said a somber Mr. Chen. ''I feel very sorry and ashamed.''
 The Kuomintang's candidate for president, Ma Ying-jeou, cautiously welcomed the results, warning that the March race would still pose a difficult challenge for the party.
 ''We must use this victory as a stepping stone to winning the presidential election,'' he said.
 The outcome was widely interpreted as a clear repudiation of Mr. Chen's controversial policies aimed at shifting Taiwan toward independence.
 His plan to hold a referendum at the time of the election for president on a bid by the island to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan rather than its formal name, the Republic of China, predictably angered Beijing.
 It also drew unusually blunt criticism from the United States, Taiwan's most important military and political ally.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last month described the referendum as a ''provocative'' move that would needlessly raise tension across the Taiwan Strait without delivering any benefit for the Taiwanese people.
 China, which is continuing a rapid military buildup opposite Taiwan, regards the island as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force if it declares formal independence or indefinitely delays steps toward unification.
 Political analysts said voters were also disillusioned with Mr. Chen's economic management and parliamentary gridlock throughout his presidency.
 Corruption scandals linked to his relatives had also hurt the party's image, analysts said.
 The D.P.P.'s candidate for president, Frank Hsieh, who kept a relatively low profile in campaigning for the legislature, faces an uphill battle in the race against the popular and charismatic Mr. Ma.
 Mr. Ma, a Harvard-trained lawyer, has said Taiwan needs a strong military and close ties with the United States to counter the military threat from China. But he favors avoiding confrontation with Beijing while allowing closer economic ties.

PERSON: Jack Brod 

HEADLINE: Jack Brod, Early Tenant Of Skyscraper, Dies at 98

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Jack Brod, a businessman who over nearly eight decades gradually worked his way from the 7th floor of the Empire State Building to the 76th, where he reigned as the skyscraper's last original tenant, died last Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98.
 His daughter Tracy Taylor announced the death. 
 The long tenancy of Mr. Brod's Empire Diamond and Gold Buying Service prompted the building's owners to celebrate in 1996 by bathing the building's top in gold light. Eight years later, they invited him to flip the switch to turn the tower red, white and blue for July 4.
 On May 1, 1931, President Herbert Hoover had flipped a switch in the White House to illuminate the Empire State Building's lobby, opening the building that for more than 40 years would be the world's tallest. Two months later, Mr. Brod and his father arrived to start a new business, a collection agency that would profit from indebtedness spawned by the Depression.
 They had chosen a building nicknamed the Empty State Building because it was so slow to attract tenants in the dismal economy. The advantage was low rents. 
 Above the 14th floor, interior spaces were not finished; Mr. Brod recalled walking through an unfinished, board-covered lobby where workmen shoved wheelbarrows.
 Noting that many debtors repaid the collection agency with jewelry that could easily be resold at a profit, he and his father decided to become dealers in used diamonds, gold and silver. The Empire State Building location and the Empire name proved useful in radio advertisements.
 ''I don't have to tell people where I am,'' Mr. Brod said in an interview with CNN in 1996.
 He witnessed history, drama and comedy at his lofty address. He spoke of bizarre attempts to moor airships to the building's 1,250-foot mast, and of the day in 1945 when a B-25 bomber crashed into the 79th floor. He liked to say he was on King Kong's greeting committee, and each year he watched the 1933 movie at least twice.
 He saw his rent increase 30-fold (after adjustment for greater space), the elevators become automated, and the replacement of all 6,379 windows. On at least one Valentine's Day, he gave wedding bands to couples married atop the building.
 For years, Mr. Brod shared the limelight at Empire State Building occasions with an original elevator operator. When the elevator operator retired several years ago, Mr. Brod became the only ''original.'' 
 He professed to have become so jaded with celebrities visiting the building that he once said he was not sure whether he had met the queen of England. There is no doubt that he met Princess Grace, not to mention his favorite, Fay Wray, star of ''King Kong.'' 
 Irven Jack Brod was born on Nov. 29, 1909, in Newnan, Ga. His parents were immigrants from Russia who had changed their name from Brodsky. He attended the University of Alabama, moving to New York with his family before graduation.
 Mr. Brod had many jobs, including that of private investigator, before joining his father, Alexander, in the collection agency. During World War II, he was a corporal in the Army Air Corps, assigned to load bombs in England.
 He found time to buy antiques and other valuables from some of England's great houses whose owners had fallen on hard times, and he shipped boatloads home. 
 After the war, Mr. Brod returned to the Empire State Building, where his business innovations included an early jewelry catalog and a ''dial-a-diamond'' toll-free number. He offered an engagement ring that ''costs you nothing if she dumps you within 60 days.''
 Mr. Brod's other business interests included running a boatyard on City Island in the Bronx and a boat factory in Newfoundland. He sailed and skied well into his 80s, and almost until his death he commuted from his Midtown apartment using a motorized scooter.
 He was married and divorced three times, and in his last years he became an avid pen pal of the woman who had been his girlfriend in Alabama when he was 8.
 In addition to his daughter Tracy Taylor, Mr. Brod is survived by two sons, Alex of Los Angeles and Spencer of Dubai; a second daughter, Stephanie Warden of Seattle; and three grandchildren.
 Some of Mr. Brod's adventures at the Empire State Building were a little too exciting: In 1976, he and his staff were tied up and robbed of jewelry worth $600,000. Four years later, he shot a would-be burglar in the leg with the .38 revolver he carried in his belt.
 Then there were the suicides that tall buildings -- particularly the really, really big ones -- attract. According to a report in The Daily News in 2004, Mr. Brod was once offered a gold bridge that had popped out of the mouth of a jilted lover who had jumped.

HEADLINE: An Interstate War Over Dredging Rules

BYLINE: By TIM WACKER

 BODY:
IN October, Connecticut officials told the Post Road Boat Yard in Westchester that the marina had until Nov. 1 to produce the necessary New York permits before they would sign off on plans to place material from dredging in Long Island Sound.
 Normally, the permits, which are required by both states, take at least four months to acquire, but New York issued the marina a permit in just 10 days. 
 That Connecticut had set such a short deadline, and that New York rushed to meet it, is a reflection of a long-running feud between the two states over the dumping of dredge spoils in the Sound.
 ''The marinas are a ball in a Ping-Pong game the two states have been playing for years,'' said Daniel S. Natchez, an environmental engineer and 20-year industry veteran who was handling the state and federal dredging permit applications for the Post Road marina, which is in Mamaroneck Harbor. ''Basically, what Connecticut was doing with that deadline was thumbing its nose at New York State.'' 
 Such are the complexities of dredging in Long Island Sound.
 The 1,320-square-mile Sound is almost evenly owned by Connecticut and New York, but the states have fought for years over who gets to dump what, and where, and marina owners say they have been caught in the middle. Larger boats can no longer reach some marinas, industry officials say. 
 Connecticut says that placing dredge materials in the Sound is the only economically feasible way to keep its river-fed ports open and thriving. New York says the sediment dredged from Connecticut's old industrial ports is so polluted that it is a prime suspect in the demise of the Sound's lobster industry. New York wants alternatives explored and used.
 The upshot, Mr. Natchez and state and federal officials involved in the disputes say, is that when it comes to setting dredging policy concerning the Sound, the states have worked against each other more than they have cooperated. 
 Federal efforts to work out an agreement with the states are under way. Under a settlement reached last year, the plan for disposing of dredging materials must be in place by 2014 or all dredge dumping in the Sound must stop.
 ''I wouldn't call it petty infighting, I'd call it philosophical warfare,'' said Michael Ludwig, an aquatic resources specialist who worked on Sound issues for three decades for the National Marine Fisheries Service before going into private consulting last year.
 The interstate battle, however well intentioned by both sides, has been costly, he said.
 ''In the process, access to Long Island Sound is drying up,'' Mr. Ludwig said. ''Many marinas that used to be able to hold bigger boats can't anymore because they couldn't get or use the necessary dredging permits.''
 Historically, Connecticut's Westbrook Harbor channel, to which the public has access, has been kept at nine feet deep by the Army Corps of Engineers. These days it is close to two feet deep in some spots and rarely deeper than five at low tide, said Rives Potts, general manager at Pilots Point Marina in Westbrook.
 Access to the marina itself could also stand some dredging, but New York's opposition to dumping in the Sound has made dredging difficult and expensive, Mr. Potts said. That has put a chill on all dredging projects, public and private, he said, and that has put a damper on business at Pilots Point.
 ''A lot of our service business was large boats, but they just don't come here anymore,'' he said. ''We used to have 110 employees. Now we have 75, and it's due to the poor channel depth. At the same time, the cost of dredging has gone way up and the cost of permitting has gone way up.''
 The conflict results in part from federal legislation called the Ambro Amendment. Named after Jerome A. Ambro, a United States representative from Long Island from 1975 to 1981, this 1980 amendment made Long Island Sound the only non-ocean in the country protected under the stringent testing requirements of the 1972 Ocean Dumping Act. That gives New York powerful tools to challenge dredge dumping plans.
 Despite the Ambro Amendment, dredge dumping in the Sound still occurred after 1980. Most notably, 1.3 million cubic yards of Thames River-bottom sediments were dredged in 1996 and dumped in the Sound so the Seawolf submarine could be berthed in Groton. Shortly after, a disfiguring disease known as shell burn started turning up in lobster caught in the shadow of the dump site, and fishermen from New York's nearby Fishers Island put the blame on the dredge material.
 New York went to federal court to halt the project, saying the dredge material did not meet Ocean Dumping Act standards, and a settlement was reached that resulted in greater enforcement of the Ambro Amendment. 
 That is when dredging bills at Pilots Point Marina started to skyrocket, Mr. Potts said. The cost for dredging has risen to $15 per cubic yard, from $7 before the Ambro Amendment, Mr. Potts said. Even a small dredging project like that at Post Road can be more than 20,000 cubic yards, Mr. Natchez said. 
 The cost of testing sediments for contaminants before dredging has also soared, Mr. Potts said.
 The dispute between the states entered a new phase three years ago when the United States Environmental Protection Agency intervened. It tried to get areas of the Sound historically used as dumps for dredge material exempted from the Ocean Dumping Act, but New York objected, citing the presence of contaminants like polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, and radioactive material in sediments from the Housatonic River in Connecticut.
 In its 25-page document challenging the E.P.A. action, New York also said that the presence of radioactive cobalt-60 from Thames River sediments in ''the open-water marine environment could result in rendering certain commercially and recreationally important marine species unacceptable for human use.''
 Those objections resulted in a settlement last year in which the E.P.A. called on the Army Corps of Engineers to work with the two states to prepare a dredge-material management plan that will assess the dredging requirements for each port on the Sound and how best to test for contaminants in the sediments there. The plan must also explore alternatives to dumping dredge materials in the Sound and examine when such alternatives can or must be used.
 Michael F. Keegan, project manager for the Corps of Engineers, called forging the plan ''a daunting task,'' but said, ''I see a great spirit of cooperation and trying to move forward here.''
 George Wisker, an environmental analyst with Connecticut's Office of Long Island Sound Programs, said the state gets five or six dredging applications a year for projects that affect anywhere from a few dozen to several thousand boats. 
 Mr. Wisker said that working with New York on the dredging-material management plan had been and would continue to be a challenge. But he said he was optimistic that the states had turned a corner in their dispute.
 The bigger problem, he said, will be getting Congress to finance the plan, which the Corps of Engineers has estimated would cost $16 million. The 2008 federal budget includes only $2.6 million for the plan, and it has yet to be approved. 
 Without federal money, the plan will not advance, Mr. Wisker said. ''People have strong feelings on both sides,'' he said, ''but we're trying to craft something that will work for all of us.''

HEADLINE: Dancing Permitted

BYLINE: By GAIL FOSLER As told to EVE TAHMINCIOGLU. 
As told to Eve Tahmincioglu.

 BODY:
MY father was a strong influence in my life in terms of my values and performance, but he didn't believe that a woman should go to college. 
 I came along quite late in the lives of my parents. My mother was born in 1905 and my father in 1907. My mother fought very hard for my right to go to college. It was a big family battle. But he had to deal with both of us and finally gave in. 
 I loved economics, starting when I did a paper when I was a sophomore in high school. When I went to college at the University of Southern California, I registered that as my major. My father asked me what I had registered for, and I told him with a big smile on my face. He looked at me in horror and said, ''What are you going to do with that?'' 
 My father, in his own quiet German way, took pride in what I did, but it was baffling to him. 
 When I was a girl, my dad was worried about my lack of concentration. But as I looked back over the last few years recently, I thought to myself, ''You know, I've got this endurance.''
 In 1989, I joined the Conference Board, a business research group, as chief economist. I have had much success in 18 years but have faced some challenges. After 9/11, revenue fell by 25 percent. In 2004, I took on a new role running operations globally, and we created a research center in China. In 2006 I suddenly lost a close colleague to cancer. A tremendous amount of endurance was needed to stick it out, make it work. I never thought I could do it, but I did.
 I think that dates back to my cancer experience. I was 46 when they found the tumor in 1994. I had something called osteosarcoma, an unusual bone tumor on the femur. If you break the bone the cancer can disperse throughout your body and you die.
 I was doing athletics and weight training and detected that my inner knee was tender to the touch. I thought it might be tendinitis, but then I got violent pain in my leg. My husband and I have a place on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and we called the local orthopedist and had an X-ray done.
 When he came back to the office, he said, ''I'm afraid I have bad news for you.'' I had a tumor the size of a golf ball that had eroded half my femur and it was protruding out of the bone. 
 I feel like the hand of God in my life got me in the right place to get the X-ray. It so happened that the doctor had been a fellow at the Cancer Institute in Washington and worked with Dr. Martin Malwer. He said the only places he would send me were Johns Hopkins or to Dr. Malwer at Washington Hospital Center.
 This was 13 years ago, and the predominant protocol was amputation. But Dr. Malwer said he was tired of cutting people's legs off. I went through aggressive chemotherapy and then they took out a six-inch piece of the femur and essentially gave me a knee joint and femur. I've got a 30-inch incision in my leg.
 I would say the other parts of my body are now 120 percent. Sometimes I get tired and I limp, or if I don't exercise regularly I ache. But I can dance. Dancing is one of my passions, moving to the music with my husband. When I get out on the dance floor, my leg may swell up afterward, but you'd never know.
 People assume that when something like that happens to you, all the impact is telescoped into that one event, when in fact it continues to reverberate throughout your life.
 I had always been physically fit and healthy. I never even get colds. The cancer gave me compassion.
 When I see people walk with a cane, or they're in a wheelchair, or I see these wounded soldiers, it just gives me a sense of empathy beyond anything I would have had.

HEADLINE: Larry, Curly, Moe and the Economy

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
NOW for a few short notes on the economy -- and you can digest them along with your FiberCon and your English muffins.
 Clearly, the economy is slowing. The immense drop in home construction, the slowdown in lending, the falloff in retail sales, the general mood of the nation -- fanned by endless fear-mongering in the news media -- are taking their toll. There has been a noticeable gain in joblessness, although employment is still very strong by historical standards. Foreclosures are way up, though they still form a tiny percentage of all homes with mortgages.
 Banks have sometimes been reluctant to lend, and this is scaring markets plenty. The stock market is down sharply from six months ago. It is still at a high price-to-earnings multiple by historical measures, but it has fallen. 
 We have a situation that calls for highly stimulative measures from the Federal Reserve. These will involve lowering interest rates charged to the banks for loans, and creating money to improve liquidity. Help appears to be on the way, but more is needed. Please permit me to say why we are still behind the curve.
 The problem -- as the Fed perceived it until last week and maybe even now -- is that there are also signs of inflation. There are especially strong signs of inflation in oil prices. 
 Until this past week, the Fed has been reluctant to ease credit as much as some people would like, for fear of stoking too much demand and stimulating inflation. It's pretty much agreed by now that inflation comes from the demand side. Thus, as a matter of definition, because much of the increase in prices comes from oil price increases, one can safely assume that the Fed believes there is excess demand for oil. 
 A month ago, the Fed lowered rates by only a quarter of a percentage point instead of making the half-point cut that many were expecting. The Fed appears to have made a big mistake about oil and aggregate demand at the last rate-cut session -- for several reasons.
 First, the big drivers of added demand for oil are not really subject to Fed control. China, India and other developing nations are responsible for the bulk of increased demand. The Fed does not have the power to lower demand for oil in the developing nations, except in a very indirect way.
 In other words, punishing the United States economy because oil prices are high is attacking the wrong culprit. It's sort of like a Three Stooges movie in which the wrong person keeps getting hit on the head.
 Second, oil demand is largely based on weather at this time of year. The Fed has zero control over the weather, and most people will heat their homes even if there is a recession. Thus, that aspect of inflationary pressure will continue as it stays cold and will abate as the weather warms.
 Third, food prices are also a source of inflation. These prices are rising largely because of a highly debatable government policy that mandates production of a huge amount of ethanol for use in motor fuel. So much corn is taken up by this that less is left for feed crops. This pushes up the price of feed and makes consumers pay more for groceries.
 It's extremely questionable whether this is good policy. Ethanol, at this point, is believed by many to be an energy loser, because it can take more energy to make a gallon of ethanol from corn than ethanol produces. It is also believed to be more inefficient at powering vehicles than gasoline. Now, ethanol fans angrily rebut this, and technology may well end up making ethanol more efficient. But for now, why take land away from making food to make a fuel that basically adds little to energy conservation?
 Whatever the benefits or the problems of ethanol, the fact that it is taking up so much crop land is a big driver of inflation, and the Fed cannot do much about the effects of that.
 In short, the Fed was not stimulating the economy enough because of fears of oil price-driven inflation. But it should have been worrying more about credit and growth. That is why the comments last week by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, about leaving the door open to rate cuts were so reassuring. But he did not leave the door open wide enough.
 ALAS, the Fed is still behind the curve. There is a real solvency fear out there right now -- a fear to lend at all, even at apparently advantageous rates. The Fed must act decisively to calm these fears by reassuring lenders. 
 This might even take the form of legislation allowing the Fed to buy stock in large banks on a temporary basis. The banks are already largely socialized through federal deposit insurance. To add the prop of government capital infusions is not such a big step. 
 Let the Fed concentrate on stimulation. No matter what, we'll get through it all, but why make it more painful than it needs to be?

HEADLINE: The Afterlife of Cellphones

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the science and commerce of sleep.

 BODY:
1. Cellphones in Hell 
 Americans threw out just shy of three million tons of household electronics in 2006. This so-called e-waste is the fastest-growing part of the municipal waste stream and, depending on your outlook, either an enormous problem or a bonanza. E-waste generally contains substances that, though safely sequestered during each product's use, can become hazardous if not handled properly when disposed. Those products also hold bits of precious metals like silver, copper, platinum and gold.
 The Belgian company Umicore is in the business of reclaiming those materials. It extracts 17 metals from our unwanted televisions, computers and cellphones and from more ominous-sounding industrial byproducts like drosses and anode slimes. Umicore harvests silver from spent photo-developing solutions collected at American big-box stores and sells it to Italian jewelers. The company describes its work as ''aboveground mining.'' 
 Umicore has roots in actual mining. In the late 1800s, during the reign of King Leopold II, the firm mined copper in the African Congo and shipped it to a riverside smelter near Antwerp. Today the same property houses a sprawling, state-of-the-art $2 billion smelter and refinery. Here, metals are recovered and processed. Then they are sold, sometimes to Asia, where they are used to manufacture brand-new electronics. It's a reshuffling of the colonial arrangement: an abundant resource is sent from richer countries to poorer ones, made into goods, then sent back. That resource is our garbage.
 Umicore's smelter was burning furiously at 2,116 degrees Fahrenheit one afternoon last fall. Two heavy-set men in blue overalls sat in the control room, staring expressionlessly through heat-shielded windows. They were eye-level with the mouth of the smelter -- a pit 13 feet wide by 46 feet deep. A conveyor belt fed shredded circuit boards and scrap into the fire in a dim, fast blur. I imagined the black-and-white television in my mother's basement, or my first blue Nokia cellphone -- all the devices I'd gotten close to and outgrown -- spilling out and squealing like lobsters in a pot.
 The metals exit the smelter's base as a glowing sludge. It streams into another caldron the height of a house. From there, it moves into tanks of acid. The acid is electrocuted. As electricity flows through the mixture, copper accumulates on the tank's end plate. I watched a giant claw move across the ceiling, rip out the plate and, with a violent whack, cleave off a gleaming layer of 99.9 percent pure copper, with the unmistakable sheen of a new penny. It was thrilling to see something so clean and recognizable emerge from such an alien process.
 After explaining the final stages, Thierry Van Kerckhoven, Umicore's e-scrap manager, handed me another of the end products from this process: a one-kilogram bar of gold. It felt the way I thought it would, based on what you see in the movies: substantial, mesmerizing. It was worth about $24,000. ''This gold is recycled gold,'' Kerckhoven said. ''This gold is green gold.''
 Recycling feels good because we imagine it as just this kind of alchemy -- which Umicore achieves with impressive environmental controls. The centerpiece is a monstrous gas-cleaning-and-filtration system that captures and neutralizes enough of the carcinogenic and endocrine-altering chemicals produced from melting e-waste, according to Umicore, that the faint yellow emission finally released from its smokestack easily surpasses the European Union's air-quality standards. (Martin Hojsik, who campaigns against toxics for Greenpeace International, notes that the process followed by Umicore and its few, similarly equipped competitors around the world is ''not entirely clean'' but still ''the preferable solution'' for recovering metals from e-waste.) Ultimately, by weight, only 1/2 of 1 percent of the e-waste Umicore takes in cannot be safely sent back into the world in a usable form. ''There is often a discussion of separating what is valuable from what is toxic,'' Christian Hageluken, Umicore's senior manager of business development, told me. ''But sometimes they are the same thing.''
 This may never be more true than for cellphones. They are the most valuable form of e-waste. Each one contains about a dollar's worth of precious metals, mostly gold. And while single phones house far less hazardous material than a computer -- an old, clunky monitor can incorporate seven pounds of lead -- their cumulative presence is staggering. Last year, according to ABI Research, 1.2 billion phones were sold worldwide. Sixty percent of them probably replaced existing ones. In the United States, phones are cast aside after, on average, 12 months. And according to the industry trade group CTIA, four out of every five people in the country own cellphones.
 Umicore estimates that, together with its competitors, it received only 1 percent of all phones that were discarded globally in 2006. ''This of course is a lousy percentage,'' Hageluken said. ''Computers are also bad, but phones are the worst.'' Our obliviousness has mostly kept them from being recycled at all. When we do bother, we may not know, or be able to control, where the ''recycled'' phones go. Many enter a secondhand market in the developing world through a receding series of middlemen.
 Reuse, we are told, is as green a virtue as recycling. But with e-waste all the old ecological dogmas start to become ambiguous. Cellphones represent only a part of the world's e-waste problem. But they are a key to understanding how complicated it is. They also embody the kind of high-tech products that we will be throwing away more of: easier to upgrade than repair, increasingly disposable-seeming but also deeply personal. As governments around the world, from the European Union to New York City, propose or pass laws to require the recycling of e-waste, there's little consensus about what recycling actually means. No matter how close our relationship with our phones has become -- how faithfully we keep them with us, how we hold them to our faces and whisper into them -- we rarely wonder where they go when they die.
 2. Cellphones in Purgatory
 If we think at all about what to do with old phones, we may realize we can return them to the wireless industry. With the idea of extended producer responsibility gaining traction -- the notion that businesses should manage the disposal or recycling of their products -- most major carriers and manufacturers in the United States now run voluntary take-back programs. But because we stop wanting phones long before they're unusable, they also represent a kind of neglected value, there to be capitalized on. Seth Heine, who founded the company Collective Good in 2000, recognized this early.
 Collective Good is a profitable business that, as the name suggests, Heine also sees as a vehicle for philanthropy. People send in their phones, and Collective Good sells the ones that still work into a global secondhand market. A portion of each phone's resale or scrap value goes to one of more than 500 causes -- ranging from the Red Cross to the Humane Society to the Obama campaign -- selected by the phone's donor. Used phones are sold to people overseas who can't afford new ones, and hazardous waste is kept out of landfills. ''It's a self-cleaning oven,'' Heine says.
 When I visited his office outside Atlanta a few months ago, Heine was introducing a new venture, GreenPhone.com, which pays donors directly for their phones. Mail a BlackBerry Pearl, for example, to GreenPhone, and Heine will cut you a check for $65. And because Heine still isn't entirely comfortable with all the paper consumption this entails, GreenPhone also plants a tree for every check it writes.
 Heine is 40, a whip-smart and mildly self-righteous environmentalist with an M.B.A. and a boyish love of sports cars. There's a lava lamp on his desk, but also, hanging behind it, a motivational poster that says VISION. Recently, he moved most of his operation to a larger facility in Colorado. But phones were still arriving at the small Georgia warehouse when I was there; they come in prepaid envelopes printed off the company's Web site or from collection boxes at every Staples and FedEx Kinko's in the United States. Each month, Heine receives 20,000 phones of at least 800 different makes and models.
 They were scattered around the room: silver ones, a battered flip-phone with a sticker of a wolf on it. A store in Beverly Hills had been sending boxes of gold-plated, limited-edition Dolce & Gabbana Motorola Razr phones, turned in when customers traded up for something even newer. ''That phone can't be more than six months old,'' Heine said at one point. Later, he handed an employee a Nokia with a note rubber-banded around it. It was something a friend gave him at dinner; that happens all the time, he said, ''when you're the Fred Sanford of phones.''
 Heine's business succeeds or fails based on how well it can assess and then realize the value of each phone. ''I refer to that as the pachinko machine,'' he told me. ''You dump in a phone and it rattles around. It's got to come out somewhere at the bottom.'' The question is, where?
 Phones beyond repair, or with little value, are dispatched to Umicore for their gold. But because acquiring the phones costs so much -- all those individual, prepaid envelopes add up -- recycling them must be subsidized by reselling the reusable ones. The most valuable handsets find their way to a room across the hall from the storeroom, where two employees sell them on eBay. Most, however, are sold via private auction to a stable of about 20 different resellers. Some, once refurbished, will be sent to American consumers to replace broken phones under warranty or covered by insurance. But it's through the resellers, and the unfathomable network of resellers they sell to, that many also end up overseas, where the price of new phones can be prohibitively expensive.
 American wireless carriers like AT&T and Sprint offer new phones below cost, or free, as incentives to get customers to sign lucrative two-year service contracts. Users in much of the world don't purchase contracts, though. They buy chunks of prepaid minutes instead and can transfer their phone from one carrier to another more easily. Foreign carriers have no incentive to offer great deals. Phones we get free can cost upward of $200 in Latin America or Africa -- where customers have less to spend. ''A lot of people in the developing world will never own a new phone,'' Heine says. They depend on our castoffs.
 Ever-changing technology means that specific phones work only in specific networks, but relatively few are obsolete everywhere in the world. As one reseller says, ''There's always a place to put the phone.'' Small-time entrepreneurs known as aggregators prowl the Internet cobbling together orders of thousands of a single make and model. ''There are many, many thousands of us,'' Joseph Khan told me. Khan, who lives outside Los Angeles, works as a limousine driver but has a side business in phones. Recently, he claims, he purchased several thousand Qualcomm QCT-1000's for $11 each and resold them in Ukraine for $121 each. The QCT-1000 was introduced in 1996. ''The battery is the size of a printer!'' Khan says.
 The need to refurbish or even significantly repair most phones is another reason vast quantities of them end up overseas -- particularly in Asia, where cheap labor and replacement parts make the cost of fixing all sorts of phones with cameras and color screens and other features so low that many buyers do not even care if the phones turn on.
 America's largest phone-recycling company, ReCellular, based in Michigan, sells millions of phones annually to 375 refurbishers in 40 different countries. Some of these refurbishers, Mike Newman, a vice president of ReCellular, told me, ''are going to be highly sophisticated companies with really sparkling, huge plants,'' while others might consist of an entrepreneur with ''10 small stores in the Dominican Republic who has, in the back of one of them, a place where 10 people are doing some refurbishing -- just sitting on some benches and old tables, taking off the housings and fixing them.'' ReCellular handles the phones from most of the major recycling programs in America sponsored by wireless carriers, including Verizon, Sprint and AT&T. It expects to receive seven million phones this year. Financially, according to Newman, the ''backbone of these programs is the resale of usable phones.''
 It's hard to track ReCellular's or Collective Good's phones. But Jack Qiu, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who has studied the movement of used computers and phones in China, describes one route phones take. In Kowloon, in Hong Kong, Pakistanis and other immigrants (often asylum seekers) import phones from Europe by the shipping container. These are fixed or cannibalized for parts in stalls at a local market. In the past, Nigerians and other African exporters swept in to buy tens of thousands of phones at a time, particularly so-called ''14-day phones'' -- those that have been returned under warranty and used little. But recently, Qiu says, the markets for these phones have become saturated in African cities. So the Nigerians, needing to take their business to poorer African villages, have been leaving Hong Kong for Chinese cities like Guangzhou, where they can purchase cheaper, more heavily used phones from the larger refurbishing companies there. Many Nigerians have learned Mandarin in order to do business in Guangzhou, Qiu says, and the city now has an African-style coffee shop.
 Africa is one of the biggest markets for used phones. Seventy-five percent of all phones in the least-developed African nations are cellphones -- and usage in many places is increasing by 30 or 40 percent per year. Their impact can not be overstated, particularly where roads are poor and settlements separated by great distances, places that land lines never reached and now have no reason to do so. Consequently, cellphones are not easily abandoned -- and, when they are, someone somewhere is still likely to see some value in them. Jim Puckett, the coordinator of the Basel Action Network, a nongovernmental watchdog group that focuses on e-waste, visited Nigeria in 2005. He describes, at one Lagos electronics bazaar, repairmen sitting on dirt floors under shelves of scavenged parts, jury-rigging phones back together, over and over again, until the things are absolutely dead.
 ''I've never seen the real end,'' Qiu says. ''I've seen landfills in China full of used computer parts, but I've never seen a single landfill of used mobile phones or phone parts.'' The Chinese themselves ''retire'' between 200 million and 300 million phones every year, he says. These phones are sold in places like India, Mongolia, Vietnam and Thailand. And from Thailand, they are sold to buyers in Laos, Cambodia, Bangladesh and Myanmar. In other words, the pachinko machine is global, and there are millions, or even billions, of phones still clattering down its channels.
 In 2001, Basel Action Network filmed a documentary in Guiyu, China, a town overrun by shipments of old computers from recyclers in the United States and elsewhere. Guiyu's residents, including children, make their living sorting, dismantling and burning computer parts or bathing them in nitric and hydrochloric acids to recover precious metals. This not only mobilizes a device's hazardous constituents; it also creates new ones. The health consequences are immense; respiratory problems and elevated blood-lead levels in children are reportedly rampant in Guiyu and, around the time of BAN's visit, the nearby river contained up to 2,400 times the World Health Organization's acceptable threshold for lead.
 In 2005, BAN found 500 shipping containers of electronics arriving in Lagos each month. Useless computers were being tossed into burning piles behind a marketplace. And the phones -- no matter how many ramshackle resurrections they experience -- will at some point presumably meet the same fate, Puckett says. ''It sounds like a cellphone's just a little thing -- if you burn it it's not such a big deal,'' he explains. ''But we're talking about mass volumes going to countries that have no infrastructure or ability to deal with it.''
 Moreover, manufacturers now sell ''ultra-low-cost handsets'' -- new, no-frills phones specifically for consumers in the developing world. Some cost less than $20. These phones, says Badii Kechiche, a market analyst with Pyramid Research, are what really fuels the spread of phone usage across Africa -- not the comparatively skimpy supply of our used ones. As a consequence, used cellphones -- just rare enough to stay out of the planet's globalized digital trash heaps so far -- may come to be more like regular junk. ''If ultra-low-cost handsets are coming in,'' Kechiche says, ''and they're much cheaper or cheaper than refurbished handsets, what's the point of getting a refurbished handset?'' The people we rely on to take our garbage are not only losing their need for it. They're becoming firsthand generators of that same garbage.
 In a study published last year, 34 recent-model cellphones were put through a standard E.P.A. test, simulating conditions inside a landfill. All of them leached hazardous amounts of lead -- on average, more than 17 times the federal threshold for what constitutes hazardous waste. Under a stricter state of California test, they also leached four other metals above hazardous levels.
 The E.P.A. says modern American landfills are designed to keep toxics stewing inside from leaking out, so they don't contaminate surrounding soil or drinking water. But landfills do fail, says Oladele A. Ogunseitan, an environmental-health scientist at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of last year's study. More important, he notes, such landfills don't exist in the developing world. In many places, garbage is tossed into informal dumps or bodies of water or burned in the open air -- all dangerous ways of liberating and spreading toxics.
 The electronics industry is greening significantly, though. E-waste take-back programs are starting to spread around the developing world. A landmark law, the RoHS directive, enacted by the European Union, requires all electronics manufacturers to drastically lower concentrations of hazardous substances, including lead, in their products. Nokia and Sony Ericsson are among those voluntarily phasing out other dangerous substances not covered by RoHS.
 Still, according to Ogunseitan, there will always be risks, or at least unknowns, accompanying the improper disposal of such products. The compositions of consumer electronics evolve through long sequences of trial and error. ''In a phone that you can hold in the palm of your hand, you now have more than 200 chemical compounds,'' he says, citing the results of an analysis of one new cellphone. ''To try to separate them out and study what health effects may be associated with burning it or sinking it in water -- that's a lifetime of work for a toxicologist.''
 The laws governing the export of e-waste present their own difficulties. An international treaty restricting the movement of hazardous waste to the developing world, a 170-nation agreement called the Basel Convention, is ambiguous when it comes to electronics. Namely, when is an item repairable -- and thus freely exportable as a reusable product -- and when is it just hazardous waste? Nothing requires exporters to even test the products they ship. Consequently, exporting products for ''reuse'' is often used as a loophole to dump them. In any case, the United States has not ratified the Basel Convention.
 Electronics recycling ''has always been the used-car lot of the recycling world,'' Seth Heine laments. With no clear standards to follow, he enforces his own. He claims to thoroughly assess the condition of all his phones. He's also quick to send working phones with limited potential for reuse straight to Umicore rather than sell them for far more money to less scrupulous buyers in the secondhand market. Heine figures this means he is leaving $150,000 on the table each year, easily. (Several environmental groups I contacted, including BAN, singled out Heine for his integrity and seriousness about the environment.)
 Mike Newman told me that ReCellular supports establishing standards for exporting phones. But he also questions their effectiveness. A company could say it doesn't sell irreparable or untested devices to the developing world, but, ''How does any company really know where their phones end up?'' he asks. ''Once you sell them, they're not your phones anymore.'' Newman claims that ReCellular tests all of its recycled phones anyway. But on the day we spoke, there were lots made up of hundreds and thousands of phones (even up to 15,000) listed for sale on ReCellular's Web site and labeled Bulk Beyond Economical Repair and Bulk Used/Untested. Newman would later clarify: these phones were not from recycling programs. They were returned under carrier warranty programs; ReCellular acquires and resells tens of thousands of these devices too every month and doesn't bother testing them. 
 Given this state of affairs, you can't help wondering if throwing your old phone in the trash, and into the high-tech sarcophagus of an American landfill, could end up doing less damage to the environment than recycling it. But that ignores yet another crucial part of the equation. As Heine explains, even though what he sells will probably be thrown out eventually, if a phone gets three or four more lives, ''it's absolutely better for the environment than having to make three or four more phones -- phones that wouldn't be recycled, either.''
 Reusing phones conserves natural resources, which reduces the environmental damage that comes with mining them. That damage isn't necessarily obvious. When I called Allen Hershkowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council who specializes in solid-waste issues, he was less interested in discussing the toxicity of old electronics than the costs of mining a particular metal, tantalum, to build the capacitors for new products. Tantalum comes from an ore called coltan. Control of coltan deposits was a factor in perpetuating Congo's civil war in the late 1990s, and the people mining it there now, Hershkowitz says, rely on ''critically endangered'' gorillas for food. Tantalum is one of the metals Umicore can't recover from e-waste.
 Much of the world's gold and copper, meanwhile, is mined in open pits, which means it is leached out with cyanide or sulfuric acid. Using data from the United States Geological Survey and mining companies' own reports, Earthworks estimates that mining the gold needed for the circuit board of a single mobile phone generates 220 pounds of waste. The environmental nonprofit calls this ''an extremely conservative'' estimate.
 What's more, the world's supply of these metals is finite. So even as the E.P.A. plays down the risks of throwing e-waste into landfills, it also urges us not to. Tim Townsend, an environmental engineer at the University of Florida who has studied the toxicity of mobile phones for the E.P.A., sums up the absurdity of just tossing this stuff away: ''If we know these metals are, overall, bad for us, it doesn't make sense to keepdigging them up from the earth's crust and bringing them into the biosphere while -- at the same time -- we're taking the ones we've already got and burying them.''
 As with most environmental issues, then, no option for getting rid of a phone is free of trade-offs, and nothing is as simple as we'd wish. But the truth is, few of America's phones are turned in for ''recycling'' in the first place. (It's unclear how few. The figure of less than 1 percent, put forward in a groundbreaking report on phone recycling by the nonprofit Inform five years ago, is still repeated. ReCellular estimates that it's more like 10 percent now.) While a phone's small size may give even normally conscientious consumers a dispensation to slip it into the trash, there seems to be a more typical solution, what ABI Research estimates nearly half of Americans do: stick the thing in a desk drawer and leave it there.
 Every recycler I spoke with talked about ''the drawer.'' It turns out to be the real purgatory for phones. Using predictions from Inform, the United States Geological Survey estimates that in 2005 there were already more than half a billion old phones sitting in American drawers. That added up to more than $300 million worth of gold, palladium, silver, copper and platinum. Heine says he still receives phones in prepaid envelopes addressed to the Kentucky tobacco barn where he started Collective Good in 2000. It tells him that people get motivated, take the envelope, then stick that in a drawer for a long time. 
 ''As soon as [a phone] makes its way into the drawer, it's hard to get people to dig it back out,'' ReCellular's Newman told me. I asked him how hard. ''I have employees,'' he said, ''who have them in their desk drawers.''
 3. Cellphones in Heaven
 Given the intimate place of cellphones in our lives, why do we get rid of them so quickly?
 Sometimes we don't have a choice. We switch to a new carrier and must buy a phone adapted to its particular network. (Late last year, Verizon announced it would eliminate this requirement.) Or we trade up for new features: first a camera, then an MP3 player, then a Web browser. Apple's iPhone promised to put an end to this chase by combining everything in a single, graceful device. But the industry knows the iPhone is just a momentary milestone in its race to replace laptop computers entirely -- and that we will follow, one revolutionary but not-quite-perfect device at a time.
 Regardless, recyclers say that from their vantage point it's obvious that most phones are retired because of psychological, not technological, obsolescence. ''There's some fashion driving all of this and, by its nature, fashion is not eternal,'' says Mark Donovan of M:Metrics, which tracks the wireless industry. Phones were initially an afterthought, given out free so that customers had something to talk into after buying the real product, the service contract. But carriers learned, as Donovan puts it, that ''if you deliver something cool, and if it's a bit of a status symbol, people will pony up and pay cash for it.'' He adds: ''People want them to become more than an awkward gadget. People want it to be an expression of their personalities.''
 Right now, there are roughly 470 models of phone for sale in the United States. About 16 new ones come out every month. Many are only slightly altered versions of existing phones, suggesting how easily we get bored -- how we'll crave something that slides, say, instead of flips open. (There are currently 46 styles of Motorola Razr; Motorola has, in fact, projected which colors and finishes we'll find most attractive through the year 2009.) And we have the perfect incentive to get whatever we want every two years when our contracts are up and the discounts for new phones roll around. When I asked Iain Gillott, an analyst with iGR, what makes a person get a new phone, he told me, ''They're cruising through the Sunday paper, and they see a fabulous phone for 50 bucks and they say, 'Well, I haven't had a new one in 18 months.' ''
 Gillott estimates 50 to 60 percent of phones are replaced ''because people get tired of the design.'' Otherwise, consumers want a new feature -- even, it seems, if there's no real need for it; according to M:Metrics, 82 percent of those with Internet-enabled phones do not go online. Steven Herbst, a psychology researcher at Motorola, told me: ''All that pressure to have the latest -- something that people will be impressed by -- is compounded by the fact that all of a sudden somebody is doing something with their mobile phone that you can't do.'' In other words, it's because we've made phones such deep and indispensable extensions of ourselves that we dump them so quickly. Who can bear seeing himself as even slightly outdated or incapable?
 ''Somewhere during the last 100 years, we learned to find refuge outside the species, in the silent embrace of manufactured objects,'' Jonathan Chapman, a young product designer and theorist at the University of Brighton, writes in his book ''Emotionally Durable Design.'' But designers and consumers have snared themselves in an unsustainable trap, Chapman told me, since our affection for many high-tech objects is tied exclusively to their newness.
 ''The mobile phone occupies a kind of glossy, scratch-free world,'' he says. Whereas a pair of jeans gains character over time, a phone does no such thing. ''As soon you purchase it, you can only watch it migrating further away from what it is you want -- a glossy, scratch-free object.'' You might leave the plastic film over the display for a few days, just so you can take it off later and ''give yourself a second honeymoon with the phone,'' he says. But ultimately everything that first attracted you to it only deteriorates. You start looking at it differently. ''It's made of some kind of sparkle-finished polymer and it's got some decent curves on it, but so what? The intimacy comes more from the fact that, within that hand-held piece of plastic, exists your whole world'' -- your friends' phone numbers, your digital pictures, your music -- and that stuff can be easily transferred to a new one. So you ''fall out of love'' with the phone, Chapman says.
 Even the most idealistic visions of how e-waste should be recycled and reused take for granted that consumers and businesses will never reconsider why we are buying and discarding so many of those products, so quickly, in the first place. If the rush of castoffs isn't likely to stop, we need to clear a proper path for it, considering all the inevitable compromises and costs along the way and delivering those products to as consequenceless a place as possible. 
 There is no heaven for cellphones. Wherever they go, it seems that something, somewhere, to some extent always ends up being damaged or depleted. The only heaven I came across was what Chapman described. It is an image in our heads -- not of a place where we can send a used phone but one where we imagine each device when it's brand-new, right before we first get our hands on it. That illusion of perfection, no matter how many times we see it spoiled, will always lure us into buying the next new phone and sending the last one careering on its way.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
IN the 1970s, when Jim Rogers was working with George Soros on some little-known hedge funds, he took to riding his motorcycle around the region looking for the perfect place to live, perhaps a house facing the water or a park. 
 After six years of searching, he decided on Riverside Drive and bicycled the street jotting down the numbers of the houses. At the time, the city real estate market had collapsed. He looked up the owners and sent them self-addressed stamped envelopes asking if they wanted to sell. 
 One day, he remembered, he got a call from representatives of the Jesuit order that owned the house at 352 Riverside Drive, which had been used as a residence for young priests. It was for sale. Its site on West 108th Street put it far beyond the boundary that most real estate brokers then set. Yet it had extraordinary features: a bowed limestone facade, an original Tiffany skylight, a working dumbwaiter, and original mahogany and oak detail that had been preserved by the house's two owners since the turn of the 20th century.
 In 1977, Mr. Rogers, a contrarian investor, struck a deal with the church. He paid the lofty sum of $107,300, and the sellers even provided a $62,300 mortgage, as mortgages were hard to come by then. For the next three decades, the house was his base of operations for a series of adventures.
 He retired at age 37, after the huge success of the Quantum Fund, which he had founded with Mr. Soros. He set a record for round-the-world travel by motorcycle and became a visiting professor at Columbia University and a columnist and television commentator. A few years ago, he began focusing on his view that the center of the economic world has shifted from New York and London to Asia, and decided to move his family there.
 Last month, the Riverside Drive house, which had languished on the market for most of the last two years, sold, according to property records, for $15.75 million, a record for a town house on the Upper West Side, and even more remarkable for not occurring in the more fashionable areas around Central Park West or in the 70s and 80s.
 Richard Pretsfelder, a partner at Leslie J. Garfield, which listed the property, said there had been several bidders for the house, which had sold for $750,000 above the asking price. Clare Brown, a broker at the firm, had the listing. Previously, the highest-priced Upper West Side town house in city records was sold for $15.5 million in October 2006 by Abigail Disney, of the Disney entertainment family. 
 The buyer of the Riverside Drive house was Helen LaKelly Hunt, a daughter of H. L. Hunt, the oil tycoon. Ms. Hunt is a founder of the Sister Fund, dedicated to the ''social, political, economic and spiritual empowerment of women and girls,'' and conducts workshops for couples, with her husband, Harville Hendrix, a clinical pastoral counselor. ''Our whole family is happy to be back in New York City,'' Ms Hunt said in an e-mail message, while traveling in the Middle East, ''and we're very committed to the city's well-being.''
 Although town house prices have been soaring in recent years, there has been a large gap between prime Upper East Side blocks and the West Side. 
 ''As we look at these $40 million and $50 million and $60 million sales on the East Side,'' said Dexter Guerrieri, a founder of Vandenberg, a brokerage specializing in town houses, ''the West Side is a good bargain, relatively speaking.''
 The mansion next door to Mr. Rogers's has been on the market off and on for several years. It was recently listed again, for $30 million.

HEADLINE: A Fed Signal Can't Dispel the Gloom

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
It was another dismal week for the stock market, despite a short-lived rally on Thursday after Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, signaled that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates further. 
 But on Friday the market fell again, ensuring another week of losses. Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, said Friday that the economy slowed ''rather materially'' at the end of last year, according to Bloomberg News. And poor earnings reports on Friday by Tiffany, the jeweler, and by American Express, the credit card company, suggested that affluent consumers were cutting back on spending, contributing to the mounting gloom over the state of the economy.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 193.88 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 12,606.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.61 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 1,401.02. The Nasdaq composite index fell 64.71 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 2,439.94. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.78 percent from 3.87 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Tough Guys for Tough Times

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
YOU don't need to follow Mike Huckabee, or even politics, to appreciate that Chuck Norris is everywhere these days. 
 On television spots for the former Arkansas governor, Mr. Norris, the star of such shoot-'em-up fare as ''Missing in Action'' and ''Walker, Texas Ranger,'' is there. (''My plan to secure the border?'' Mr. Huckabee says in deadpan. ''Two words: Chuck Norris.'') On T-shirts, ''Saturday Night Live'' skits, Mountain Dew ads, and Web sites like the satirical thetruthaboutchuck.com, Mr. Norris -- or at least his image -- is there. 
 Now, suddenly, he is not alone, as several other action stars who peaked in prominence in the '80s are rejoining him on the pop culture landscape. 
 Sylvester Stallone, at 61, is starring in the first Rambo film since 1988, called simply ''Rambo,'' which opens on Jan. 25. Hulk Hogan, 54, who was doing face plants in wrestling bouts back when Frankie Goes to Hollywood was still riding the charts, re-emerged this month as the face of NBC's unlikely new hit, ''American Gladiators.'' Mr. T, the mohawk-sporting muscleman who squared off against Mr. Stallone in ''Rocky III'' back in 1982, when Leonid I. Brezhnev was still the Soviet leader (and when there was still a Soviet Union), is back as a television pitchman for the popular World of Warcraft video game. 
 Even the Terminator is back -- in Fox's new series ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' -- although the original star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is too busy with other engagements in California to participate.
 The leading action symbols of the Reagan era -- with all their excess, jingoism and good vs. evil bombast -- have returned, as outsize and obvious as they were in the decade of stonewash. Yet as stars of prime-time hits and feature films (not to mention Republican mascots), these actors are still as ripped and imposing as they were 20 years ago, and they continue to carry an undeniable authority with fans old and new. 
 Indeed, at a time when the country is faced with a new tangle of problems, the return of the '80s action hero suggests that some Americans, particularly men, are looking to revel in the vestigial pleasures of older times and seemingly simpler ways. (Witness the popularity of the best-selling ''Dangerous Book for Boys,'' a celebration of the traditional rugged joys of boyhood.) 
 It helps that these figures need no introduction. ''Stallone and Rambo are huge, iconic images already,'' said Tim Palen, who works at Lionsgate, the ''Rambo'' studio, as a co-president for theatrical marketing. ''It's really kind of holy territory, especially when it comes to young males, and males in general.''
 WHEN marketing executives were deciding on a strategy to sell the new ''Rambo'' film, they shunned splashy posters in favor of a minimalist image of a black spray-painted stencil outline of Rambo's head on a white background.
 ''We called it Che Guevara crossed with Jesus Christ by way of Andy Warhol,'' Mr. Palen said. ''In a way, he's all of those.''
 At an age when mere mortals find their biceps reduced to cookie dough, these human action figures have retained not only their muscle tone but, more important, their value as brands. Mark Koops, an executive producer of ''American Gladiators,'' attributes its success in part to Mr. Hogan's enduring status as a symbol of both high-testosterone swagger and integrity in the eyes of fans -- certifiable dudes, undoubtedly -- of all ages. 
 ''Since the summer, when we first sold the show, we put together a target list of who we thought could capture what the show was,'' Mr. Koops said. The list had just one name: Mr. Hogan. ''He has such a huge following -- kids from 6 to 60.'' When Mr. Hogan and Mr. Koops attended a recent San Diego Chargers football game, Mr. Koops recalled, ''all the N.F.L. players came running up to him, even when they were supposed to be warming up.''
 Without a doubt, nostalgia on the part of Generation X is a strong factor in the continuing appeal of these actors. The same guys who grew up watching ''First Blood'' and ''The Delta Force'' on VHS are now old enough to hold positions of creative power at advertising firms and film studios, Mr. Palen said. ''I'm in my 40s,'' he explained, ''and growing up a young guy in Kansas, Rambo was huge.''
 But in a digital age, old icons never die, he said -- they just end up on DVDs in the family S.U.V. ''To kids under 18, they never did have that experience,'' Mr. Palen added, ''but with DVDs they did, and they've experienced it over and over and over again.''
 It is hardly unusual for pop eminences to be recycled by tastemaking connoisseurs. Usually it starts with young creative directors or screenwriters, who seize on a relic from the frothy pop culture of their youth and reanimate him for one more campy go-round on the carousel. Tom Jones, Burt Reynolds, William Shatner: this is your second life. 
 Usually, it is ... you know, a joke. 
 But Mr. Koops, speaking on Tuesday, New Hampshire primary day, said the appetite for these action figures represents more than a joke. Rather, it speaks to a sincere desire among some men -- likely not Hillary Clinton supporters -- to return to what he called ''a comfort zone'' symbolized by heroic characters of yore.
 ''Everyone is talking about change'' in the political sphere, he said, but many guys in fact ''want to go back to the way things were, the things they knew.'' 
 This is a moment in American history bedeviled by a sinking economy, the possibility of environmental catastrophe and violent conflicts in the Middle East and beyond. So it's not surprising to see men who were raised on cartoonish images of the fictional John Rambo taking out more Soviet soldiers in two hours than the Afghan mujahedeen did in a decade show an appetite for characters who tend to fix even big problems with room-clearing brawls, monosyllabic wisecracks and large-caliber firearms. 
 Anxious Americans, after all, are suddenly very unsure of their position in the world, which leaves some open to any ''fantasy having to do with a sense of traditional masculinity,'' said Judith Halberstam, a professor of English and gender studies at the University of Southern California. She said that these living G.I. Joes communicate a ''not-so-deep code of American exceptionalism,'' as well as the American instinct to cut through obfuscation with plain talk and ''to not bother with politics, just go in with force and fix things.'' 
 Tracy Lovatt, the head of strategy for BBDO New York, the advertising agency that produced the Mountain Dew campaign with Mr. Norris, said that the myriad troubles facing the country have created an appetite for the heroes who seemed omnipotent during the '80s, a time when the country appeared to have dug itself out of a quagmire.
 ''We have weak, uncertain political leadership right now,'' she said. ''Everything seems to be up for grabs; we don't believe in institutions. This country needs stability, and in an archetypal, hyperbolic way, that's what these figures represent.''
 Indeed, heroic caricatures seem comparatively less cartoonish at a time when nonfiction heroes like Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds have been tarnished by accusations of fraud, said David Zinczenko, editor in chief of Men's Health.
 ''The sports field is littered with false heroes and antiheroes and fallen heroes right now,'' Mr. Zinczenko said by e-mail. Mr. Norris represents a perfect antidote because he remains, unlike the athletes, forever two-dimensional. ''We've never known anything about the guy, except for what we see on big and little screens,'' he said. ''He's square-jawed, muscular, action-oriented -- everything we want in a guy who can get things done.''
 However unfashionable these macho caricatures may have seemed even five years ago, their cartoonish image of macho rectitude actually may be enhanced by their dogged efforts to protect an all-American image. 
 Ian Spector, who founded the satirical thetruthaboutchuck.com in 2005, is finding this out the hard way. In December Mr. Norris sued Gotham Books, the publisher of Mr. Spector's companion book to his Web site -- ''The Truth About Chuck Norris: 400 Facts About the World's Greatest Human'' -- asserting that the book misappropriated his name and image and associated him with unsavory and illegal behavior. (The suit is continuing.)
 ''He takes himself very seriously,'' Mr. Spector, 19, a cognitive neuroscience major at Brown, said of his muse and adversary. ''Maybe because he takes himself so seriously, it makes it all the more ridiculous.'' 
 So, then, like Mr. Shatner, is Mr. Norris really just a joke?
 ''I don't want to say yes,'' Mr. Spector said warily, ''because I don't want to have him see me calling him a joke.''

HEADLINE: Unfinished Debate on Iraq

DATELINE: Iraq will be a central challenge 

 BODY:
perhaps the central challenge -- for whoever succeeds President Bush and has to repair the profound damage he has wrought with a war that should never have been fought and has been managed so ineptly. The candidates must talk more to the American people about when troops will be withdrawn and how it will be done, as well as how they will manage relations with Iraq and the region.
 Yet the war has receded as a major topic on the campaign trail, much to the relief of the Republican candidates, who never stray far from the party line but know that Americans overwhelmingly want the troops home.
 One year after Mr. Bush announced that he would try to salvage his misadventure by rushing in 30,000 more troops, casualties are down. Yet 2007 was the most violent year in Iraq since the 2003 invasion. Mr. Bush has nothing to show in the way of political progress, which is even more important for ending the war. 
 As a result, the war continues to be a significant political disadvantage for Republicans, not to mention a constant drain in lives lost and resources squandered. Meanwhile, violence in Afghanistan has surged and Al Qaeda has strengthened along the Afghan-Pakistan border. That is the real front line of the war on terror -- no matter how often the Republicans say it is in Iraq.
 Except for Representative Ron Paul -- who wants all troops withdrawn immediately but is hardly going to be the nominee -- the Republican candidates are slavishly wedded to Mr. Bush's policy of war without end. All oppose a pullout timetable. Even Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who accused Mr. Bush of pursuing a foreign policy with an ''arrogant bunker mentality,'' has promised not to withdraw troops any faster than recommended by Gen. David Petraeus, the military commander in Iraq who created the current ''surge'' strategy and has been cautious about force reductions. 
 Senator John McCain conducted a long and lonely crusade to persuade Mr. Bush to beef up forces in Iraq, and sees the downturn in violence as vindication. From the start, if the United States was ever going to be successful in Iraq, it needed far more troops than Mr. Bush sent in 2003. We are encouraged that many of the candidates promise to avoid repeating such a huge mistake.
 Even Mr. McCain acknowledges uncertainty about whether the security gains produced by the troop surge can be sustained. He said months ago he had no Plan B if the escalation failed, and there is no sign he has one now. Mr. Bush's troop buildup was sold as a way to buy Iraqi politicians breathing room to finally address the tensions driving sectarian violence, including an equitable division of oil wealth and strategies to bring more Baathists and Sunnis into the Shiite-led government. Those goals have not been met, and the administration has virtually abandoned them.
 It remains unclear what the Republicans will consider sufficient success to warrant bringing the troops home. Beyond tough-sounding talk about refusing to surrender, no Republican has ever defined victory in Iraq or given the slightest idea of how to achieve it.
 The Democratic candidates all want to cut American losses in Iraq and end the war, although the issue is no longer as defining for their campaigns as it once was, because casualties are down, the administration has made a minimal, grudging effort to reduce force levels, and the economy is teetering on a recession. Their message has been compromised by the repeated failure of their party, despite a majority in Congress, to pass legislation demanding that Mr. Bush alter his Iraq policy. 
 The Democratic candidates have spent a fair amount of time debating how much support each gave to the war at the outset. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, like most other members of Congress, voted for the war resolution. Mr. Edwards has forcefully repudiated his vote, while Mrs. Clinton has offered unsatisfying explanations for hers. Senator Barack Obama, who was not in office at the time, rhetorically opposed the invasion. He deserves credit for that, but the focus now must be on ending the war.
 Mr. Edwards has staked out a position that would produce a speedier and more complete withdrawal -- within 10 months after taking office -- than his two rivals. That would include American troops who are training the Iraqi Army and police, leaving only about 5,000 to protect the American Embassy and relief workers. 
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are more realistic. They would start withdrawing troops quickly but have left open precisely how long it would take. Mr. Obama said he would give the Pentagon 16 months to withdraw, but would adjust his timetable based on conditions in Iraq. Mrs. Clinton has not assigned a specific schedule. Both candidates are willing to keep American trainers and counterterrorism units in Iraq as combat troops are brought home and have argued that any withdrawal must be done responsibly, a sentiment we firmly share.
 Many important issues have not been fully examined. What is to become of the thousands of Iraqis who helped America and its coalition partners as translators, drivers and fixers and will face retribution? What will be the nature and content of a long-term agreement on future Iraqi-American relations? Will Congress have a say in it? Will the United States retain bases in Iraq or elsewhere in the region? How will a new president seek to enlist key regional countries in stabilizing Iraq? How will a new president improve on Mr. Bush's failure to facilitate political conciliation? Should the United Nations be involved, as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama suggest?
 The Iraq war has laid bare the serious inability of American civilian agencies to quickly and coherently meet the country's postconflict needs, from reviving energy infrastructure to organizing federal and local governments. In Foreign Affairs magazine, Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and Republican, proposed integrated regional commands for civilian agencies. That's an idea deserving consideration.
 Another crucial question is the issue of pre-emptive war -- or in the case of Iraq, preventive war. The United States must be prepared to use military force to pre-empt another attack on American soil. In Iraq, Mr. Bush went much further, invading a country that he imagined might someday pose a threat to the United States -- not pre-empting an imminent threat but preventing the possibility of a threat. To justify his actions, he persuaded Americans that Saddam Hussein had chemical, biological and, especially, nuclear weapons programs -- a claim that proved to be specious.
 No serious candidate in 2008 can renounce the potential use of force to defend national security or in retaliation for an attack on the United States. But no voter should cast a ballot for a candidate who will not forswear such wars of choice. We hope American voters have learned the lesson of 2000, when Mr. Bush escaped serious questioning on foreign affairs during the campaign. He then turned sensible policies on their head and bumbled his way into a disastrous war.

HEADLINE: The Moral Instinct

BYLINE: By STEVEN PINKER. 
Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and the author of ''The Language Instinct'' and ''The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature.''

 BODY:
Which of the following people would you say is the most admirable: Mother Teresa, Bill Gates or Norman Borlaug? And which do you think is the least admirable? For most people, it's an easy question. Mother Teresa, famous for ministering to the poor in Calcutta, has been beatified by the Vatican, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and ranked in an American poll as the most admired person of the 20th century. Bill Gates, infamous for giving us the Microsoft dancing paper clip and the blue screen of death, has been decapitated in effigy in ''I Hate Gates'' Web sites and hit with a pie in the face. As for Norman Borlaug . . . who the heck is Norman Borlaug?
 Yet a deeper look might lead you to rethink your answers. Borlaug, father of the ''Green Revolution'' that used agricultural science to reduce world hunger, has been credited with saving a billion lives, more than anyone else in history. Gates, in deciding what to do with his fortune, crunched the numbers and determined that he could alleviate the most misery by fighting everyday scourges in the developing world like malaria, diarrhea and parasites. Mother Teresa, for her part, extolled the virtue of suffering and ran her well-financed missions accordingly: their sick patrons were offered plenty of prayer but harsh conditions, few analgesics and dangerously primitive medical care. 
 It's not hard to see why the moral reputations of this trio should be so out of line with the good they have done. Mother Teresa was the very embodiment of saintliness: white-clad, sad-eyed, ascetic and often photographed with the wretched of the earth. Gates is a nerd's nerd and the world's richest man, as likely to enter heaven as the proverbial camel squeezing through the needle's eye. And Borlaug, now 93, is an agronomist who has spent his life in labs and nonprofits, seldom walking onto the media stage, and hence into our consciousness, at all. 
 I doubt these examples will persuade anyone to favor Bill Gates over Mother Teresa for sainthood. But they show that our heads can be turned by an aura of sanctity, distracting us from a more objective reckoning of the actions that make people suffer or flourish. It seems we may all be vulnerable to moral illusions the ethical equivalent of the bending lines that trick the eye on cereal boxes and in psychology textbooks. Illusions are a favorite tool of perception scientists for exposing the workings of the five senses, and of philosophers for shaking people out of the naive belief that our minds give us a transparent window onto the world (since if our eyes can be fooled by an illusion, why should we trust them at other times?). Today, a new field is using illusions to unmask a sixth sense, the moral sense. Moral intuitions are being drawn out of people in the lab, on Web sites and in brain scanners, and are being explained with tools from game theory, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. 
 ''Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and more steadily we reflect on them,'' wrote Immanuel Kant, ''the starry heavens above and the moral law within.'' These days, the moral law within is being viewed with increasing awe, if not always admiration. The human moral sense turns out to be an organ of considerable complexity, with quirks that reflect its evolutionary history and its neurobiological foundations. 
 These quirks are bound to have implications for the human predicament. Morality is not just any old topic in psychology but close to our conception of the meaning of life. Moral goodness is what gives each of us the sense that we are worthy human beings. We seek it in our friends and mates, nurture it in our children, advance it in our politics and justify it with our religions. A disrespect for morality is blamed for everyday sins and history's worst atrocities. To carry this weight, the concept of morality would have to be bigger than any of us and outside all of us. 
 So dissecting moral intuitions is no small matter. If morality is a mere trick of the brain, some may fear, our very grounds for being moral could be eroded. Yet as we shall see, the science of the moral sense can instead be seen as a way to strengthen those grounds, by clarifying what morality is and how it should steer our actions. 
 The Moralization Switch
 The starting point for appreciating that there is a distinctive part of our psychology for morality is seeing how moral judgments differ from other kinds of opinions we have on how people ought to behave. Moralization is a psychological state that can be turned on and off like a switch, and when it is on, a distinctive mind-set commandeers our thinking. This is the mind-set that makes us deem actions immoral (''killing is wrong''), rather than merely disagreeable (''I hate brussels sprouts''), unfashionable (''bell-bottoms are out'') or imprudent (''don't scratch mosquito bites''). 
 The first hallmark of moralization is that the rules it invokes are felt to be universal. Prohibitions of rape and murder, for example, are felt not to be matters of local custom but to be universally and objectively warranted. One can easily say, ''I don't like brussels sprouts, but I don't care if you eat them,'' but no one would say, ''I don't like killing, but I don't care if you murder someone.''
 The other hallmark is that people feel that those who commit immoral acts deserve to be punished. Not only is it allowable to inflict pain on a person who has broken a moral rule; it is wrong not to, to ''let them get away with it.'' People are thus untroubled in inviting divine retribution or the power of the state to harm other people they deem immoral. Bertrand Russell wrote, ''The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists -- that is why they invented hell.''
 We all know what it feels like when the moralization switch flips inside us -- the righteous glow, the burning dudgeon, the drive to recruit others to the cause. The psychologist Paul Rozin has studied the toggle switch by comparing two kinds of people who engage in the same behavior but with different switch settings. Health vegetarians avoid meat for practical reasons, like lowering cholesterol and avoiding toxins. Moral vegetarians avoid meat for ethical reasons: to avoid complicity in the suffering of animals. By investigating their feelings about meat-eating, Rozin showed that the moral motive sets off a cascade of opinions. Moral vegetarians are more likely to treat meat as a contaminant -- they refuse, for example, to eat a bowl of soup into which a drop of beef broth has fallen. They are more likely to think that other people ought to be vegetarians, and are more likely to imbue their dietary habits with other virtues, like believing that meat avoidance makes people less aggressive and bestial. 
 Much of our recent social history, including the culture wars between liberals and conservatives, consists of the moralization or amoralization of particular kinds of behavior. Even when people agree that an outcome is desirable, they may disagree on whether it should be treated as a matter of preference and prudence or as a matter of sin and virtue. Rozin notes, for example, that smoking has lately been moralized. Until recently, it was understood that some people didn't enjoy smoking or avoided it because it was hazardous to their health. But with the discovery of the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, smoking is now treated as immoral. Smokers are ostracized; images of people smoking are censored; and entities touched by smoke are felt to be contaminated (so hotels have not only nonsmoking rooms but nonsmoking floors). The desire for retribution has been visited on tobacco companies, who have been slapped with staggering ''punitive damages.'' 
 At the same time, many behaviors have been amoralized, switched from moral failings to lifestyle choices. They include divorce, illegitimacy, being a working mother, marijuana use and homosexuality. Many afflictions have been reassigned from payback for bad choices to unlucky misfortunes. There used to be people called ''bums'' and ''tramps''; today they are ''homeless.'' Drug addiction is a ''disease''; syphilis was rebranded from the price of wanton behavior to a ''sexually transmitted disease'' and more recently a ''sexually transmitted infection.'' 
 This wave of amoralization has led the cultural right to lament that morality itself is under assault, as we see in the group that anointed itself the Moral Majority. In fact there seems to be a Law of Conservation of Moralization, so that as old behaviors are taken out of the moralized column, new ones are added to it. Dozens of things that past generations treated as practical matters are now ethical battlegrounds, including disposable diapers, I.Q. tests, poultry farms, Barbie dolls and research on breast cancer. Food alone has become a minefield, with critics sermonizing about the size of sodas, the chemistry of fat, the freedom of chickens, the price of coffee beans, the species of fish and now the distance the food has traveled from farm to plate.
 Many of these moralizations, like the assault on smoking, may be understood as practical tactics to reduce some recently identified harm. But whether an activity flips our mental switches to the ''moral'' setting isn't just a matter of how much harm it does. We don't show contempt to the man who fails to change the batteries in his smoke alarms or takes his family on a driving vacation, both of which multiply the risk they will die in an accident. Driving a gas-guzzling Hummer is reprehensible, but driving a gas-guzzling old Volvo is not; eating a Big Mac is unconscionable, but not imported cheese or creme brulee. The reason for these double standards is obvious: people tend to align their moralization with their own lifestyles.
 Reasoning and Rationalizing
 It's not just the content of our moral judgments that is often questionable, but the way we arrive at them. We like to think that when we have a conviction, there are good reasons that drove us to adopt it. That is why an older approach to moral psychology, led by Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg, tried to document the lines of reasoning that guided people to moral conclusions. But consider these situations, originally devised by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt:
 Julie is traveling in France on summer vacation from college with her brother Mark. One night they decide that it would be interesting and fun if they tried making love. Julie was already taking birth-control pills, but Mark uses a condom, too, just to be safe. They both enjoy the sex but decide not to do it again. They keep the night as a special secret, which makes them feel closer to each other. What do you think about that -- was it O.K. for them to make love?
 A woman is cleaning out her closet and she finds her old American flag. She doesn't want the flag anymore, so she cuts it up into pieces and uses the rags to clean her bathroom.
 A family's dog is killed by a car in front of their house. They heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog's body and cook it and eat it for dinner.
 Most people immediately declare that these acts are wrong and then grope to justify why they are wrong. It's not so easy. In the case of Julie and Mark, people raise the possibility of children with birth defects, but they are reminded that the couple were diligent about contraception. They suggest that the siblings will be emotionally hurt, but the story makes it clear that they weren't. They submit that the act would offend the community, but then recall that it was kept a secret. Eventually many people admit, ''I don't know, I can't explain it, I just know it's wrong.'' People don't generally engage in moral reasoning, Haidt argues, but moral rationalization: they begin with the conclusion, coughed up by an unconscious emotion, and then work backward to a plausible justification. 
 The gap between people's convictions and their justifications is also on display in the favorite new sandbox for moral psychologists, a thought experiment devised by the philosophers Philippa Foot and Judith Jarvis Thomson called the Trolley Problem. On your morning walk, you see a trolley car hurtling down the track, the conductor slumped over the controls. In the path of the trolley are five men working on the track, oblivious to the danger. You are standing at a fork in the track and can pull a lever that will divert the trolley onto a spur, saving the five men. Unfortunately, the trolley would then run over a single worker who is laboring on the spur. Is it permissible to throw the switch, killing one man to save five? Almost everyone says ''yes.'' 
 Consider now a different scene. You are on a bridge overlooking the tracks and have spotted the runaway trolley bearing down on the five workers. Now the only way to stop the trolley is to throw a heavy object in its path. And the only heavy object within reach is a fat man standing next to you. Should you throw the man off the bridge? Both dilemmas present you with the option of sacrificing one life to save five, and so, by the utilitarian standard of what would result in the greatest good for the greatest number, the two dilemmas are morally equivalent. But most people don't see it that way: though they would pull the switch in the first dilemma, they would not heave the fat man in the second. When pressed for a reason, they can't come up with anything coherent, though moral philosophers haven't had an easy time coming up with a relevant difference, either. 
 When psychologists say ''most people'' they usually mean ''most of the two dozen sophomores who filled out a questionnaire for beer money.'' But in this case it means most of the 200,000 people from a hundred countries who shared their intuitions on a Web-based experiment conducted by the psychologists Fiery Cushman and Liane Young and the biologist Marc Hauser. A difference between the acceptability of switch-pulling and man-heaving, and an inability to justify the choice, was found in respondents from Europe, Asia and North and South America; among men and women, blacks and whites, teenagers and octogenarians, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Christians, Jews and atheists; people with elementary-school educations and people with Ph.D.'s. 
 Joshua Greene, a philosopher and cognitive neuroscientist, suggests that evolution equipped people with a revulsion to manhandling an innocent person. This instinct, he suggests, tends to overwhelm any utilitarian calculus that would tot up the lives saved and lost. The impulse against roughing up a fellow human would explain other examples in which people abjure killing one to save many, like euthanizing a hospital patient to harvest his organs and save five dying patients in need of transplants, or throwing someone out of a crowded lifeboat to keep it afloat. 
 By itself this would be no more than a plausible story, but Greene teamed up with the cognitive neuroscientist Jonathan Cohen and several Princeton colleagues to peer into people's brains using functional M.R.I. They sought to find signs of a conflict between brain areas associated with emotion (the ones that recoil from harming someone) and areas dedicated to rational analysis (the ones that calculate lives lost and saved). 
 When people pondered the dilemmas that required killing someone with their bare hands, several networks in their brains lighted up. One, which included the medial (inward-facing) parts of the frontal lobes, has been implicated in emotions about other people. A second, the dorsolateral (upper and outer-facing) surface of the frontal lobes, has been implicated in ongoing mental computation (including nonmoral reasoning, like deciding whether to get somewhere by plane or train). And a third region, the anterior cingulate cortex (an evolutionarily ancient strip lying at the base of the inner surface of each cerebral hemisphere), registers a conflict between an urge coming from one part of the brain and an advisory coming from another. 
 But when the people were pondering a hands-off dilemma, like switching the trolley onto the spur with the single worker, the brain reacted differently: only the area involved in rational calculation stood out. Other studies have shown that neurological patients who have blunted emotions because of damage to the frontal lobes become utilitarians: they think it makes perfect sense to throw the fat man off the bridge. Together, the findings corroborate Greene's theory that our nonutilitarian intuitions come from the victory of an emotional impulse over a cost-benefit analysis. 
 A Universal Morality? 
 The findings of trolleyology -- complex, instinctive and worldwide moral intuitions -- led Hauser and John Mikhail (a legal scholar) to revive an analogy from the philosopher John Rawls between the moral sense and language. According to Noam Chomsky, we are born with a ''universal grammar'' that forces us to analyze speech in terms of its grammatical structure, with no conscious awareness of the rules in play. By analogy, we are born with a universal moral grammar that forces us to analyze human action in terms of its moral structure, with just as little awareness. 
 The idea that the moral sense is an innate part of human nature is not far-fetched. A list of human universals collected by the anthropologist Donald E. Brown includes many moral concepts and emotions, including a distinction between right and wrong; empathy; fairness; admiration of generosity; rights and obligations; proscription of murder, rape and other forms of violence; redress of wrongs; sanctions for wrongs against the community; shame; and taboos. 
 The stirrings of morality emerge early in childhood. Toddlers spontaneously offer toys and help to others and try to comfort people they see in distress. And according to the psychologists Elliot Turiel and Judith Smetana, preschoolers have an inkling of the difference between societal conventions and moral principles. Four-year-olds say that it is not O.K. to wear pajamas to school (a convention) and also not O.K. to hit a little girl for no reason (a moral principle). But when asked whether these actions would be O.K. if the teacher allowed them, most of the children said that wearing pajamas would now be fine but that hitting a little girl would still not be.
 Though no one has identified genes for morality, there is circumstantial evidence they exist. The character traits called ''conscientiousness'' and ''agreeableness'' are far more correlated in identical twins separated at birth (who share their genes but not their environment) than in adoptive siblings raised together (who share their environment but not their genes). People given diagnoses of ''antisocial personality disorder'' or ''psychopathy'' show signs of morality blindness from the time they are children. They bully younger children, torture animals, habitually lie and seem incapable of empathy or remorse, often despite normal family backgrounds. Some of these children grow up into the monsters who bilk elderly people out of their savings, rape a succession of women or shoot convenience-store clerks lying on the floor during a robbery. 
 Though psychopathy probably comes from a genetic predisposition, a milder version can be caused by damage to frontal regions of the brain (including the areas that inhibit intact people from throwing the hypothetical fat man off the bridge). The neuroscientists Hanna and Antonio Damasio and their colleagues found that some children who sustain severe injuries to their frontal lobes can grow up into callous and irresponsible adults, despite normal intelligence. They lie, steal, ignore punishment, endanger their own children and can't think through even the simplest moral dilemmas, like what two people should do if they disagreed on which TV channel to watch or whether a man ought to steal a drug to save his dying wife. 
 The moral sense, then, may be rooted in the design of the normal human brain. Yet for all the awe that may fill our minds when we reflect on an innate moral law within, the idea is at best incomplete. Consider this moral dilemma: A runaway trolley is about to kill a schoolteacher. You can divert the trolley onto a sidetrack, but the trolley would trip a switch sending a signal to a class of 6-year-olds, giving them permission to name a teddy bear Muhammad. Is it permissible to pull the lever? 
 This is no joke. Last month a British woman teaching in a private school in Sudan allowed her class to name a teddy bear after the most popular boy in the class, who bore the name of the founder of Islam. She was jailed for blasphemy and threatened with a public flogging, while a mob outside the prison demanded her death. To the protesters, the woman's life clearly had less value than maximizing the dignity of their religion, and their judgment on whether it is right to divert the hypothetical trolley would have differed from ours. Whatever grammar guides people's moral judgments can't be all that universal. Anyone who stayed awake through Anthropology 101 can offer many other examples. 
 Of course, languages vary, too. In Chomsky's theory, languages conform to an abstract blueprint, like having phrases built out of verbs and objects, while the details vary, like whether the verb or the object comes first. Could we be wired with an abstract spec sheet that embraces all the strange ideas that people in different cultures moralize? 
 The Varieties of Moral Experience
 When anthropologists like Richard Shweder and Alan Fiske survey moral concerns across the globe, they find that a few themes keep popping up from amid the diversity. People everywhere, at least in some circumstances and with certain other folks in mind, think it's bad to harm others and good to help them. They have a sense of fairness: that one should reciprocate favors, reward benefactors and punish cheaters. They value loyalty to a group, sharing and solidarity among its members and conformity to its norms. They believe that it is right to defer to legitimate authorities and to respect people with high status. And they exalt purity, cleanliness and sanctity while loathing defilement, contamination and carnality.
 The exact number of themes depends on whether you're a lumper or a splitter, but Haidt counts five -- harm, fairness, community (or group loyalty), authority and purity -- and suggests that they are the primary colors of our moral sense. Not only do they keep reappearing in cross-cultural surveys, but each one tugs on the moral intuitions of people in our own culture. Haidt asks us to consider how much money someone would have to pay us to do hypothetical acts like the following: 
 Stick a pin into your palm.
 Stick a pin into the palm of a child you don't know. (Harm.)
 Accept a wide-screen TV from a friend who received it at no charge because of a computer error. 
 Accept a wide-screen TV from a friend who received it from a thief who had stolen it from a wealthy family. (Fairness.)
 Say something bad about your nation (which you don't believe) on a talk-radio show in your nation.
 Say something bad about your nation (which you don't believe) on a talk-radio show in a foreign nation. (Community.) 
 Slap a friend in the face, with his permission, as part of a comedy skit.
 Slap your minister in the face, with his permission, as part of a comedy skit. (Authority.)
 Attend a performance-art piece in which the actors act like idiots for 30 minutes, including flubbing simple problems and falling down on stage. 
 Attend a performance-art piece in which the actors act like animals for 30 minutes, including crawling around naked and urinating on stage. (Purity.)
 In each pair, the second action feels far more repugnant. Most of the moral illusions we have visited come from an unwarranted intrusion of one of the moral spheres into our judgments. A violation of community led people to frown on using an old flag to clean a bathroom. Violations of purity repelled the people who judged the morality of consensual incest and prevented the moral vegetarians and nonsmokers from tolerating the slightest trace of a vile contaminant. At the other end of the scale, displays of extreme purity lead people to venerate religious leaders who dress in white and affect an aura of chastity and asceticism. 
 The Genealogy of Morals
 The five spheres are good candidates for a periodic table of the moral sense not only because they are ubiquitous but also because they appear to have deep evolutionary roots. The impulse to avoid harm, which gives trolley ponderers the willies when they consider throwing a man off a bridge, can also be found in rhesus monkeys, who go hungry rather than pull a chain that delivers food to them and a shock to another monkey. Respect for authority is clearly related to the pecking orders of dominance and appeasement that are widespread in the animal kingdom. The purity-defilement contrast taps the emotion of disgust that is triggered by potential disease vectors like bodily effluvia, decaying flesh and unconventional forms of meat, and by risky sexual practices like incest. 
 The other two moralized spheres match up with the classic examples of how altruism can evolve that were worked out by sociobiologists in the 1960s and 1970s and made famous by Richard Dawkins in his book ''The Selfish Gene.'' Fairness is very close to what scientists call reciprocal altruism, where a willingness to be nice to others can evolve as long as the favor helps the recipient more than it costs the giver and the recipient returns the favor when fortunes reverse. The analysis makes it sound as if reciprocal altruism comes out of a robotlike calculation, but in fact Robert Trivers, the biologist who devised the theory, argued that it is implemented in the brain as a suite of moral emotions. Sympathy prompts a person to offer the first favor, particularly to someone in need for whom it would go the furthest. Anger protects a person against cheaters who accept a favor without reciprocating, by impelling him to punish the ingrate or sever the relationship. Gratitude impels a beneficiary to reward those who helped him in the past. Guilt prompts a cheater in danger of being found out to repair the relationship by redressing the misdeed and advertising that he will behave better in the future (consistent with Mencken's definition of conscience as ''the inner voice which warns us that someone might be looking''). Many experiments on who helps whom, who likes whom, who punishes whom and who feels guilty about what have confirmed these predictions.
 Community, the very different emotion that prompts people to share and sacrifice without an expectation of payback, may be rooted in nepotistic altruism, the empathy and solidarity we feel toward our relatives (and which evolved because any gene that pushed an organism to aid a relative would have helped copies of itself sitting inside that relative). In humans, of course, communal feelings can be lavished on nonrelatives as well. Sometimes it pays people (in an evolutionary sense) to love their companions because their interests are yoked, like spouses with common children, in-laws with common relatives, friends with common tastes or allies with common enemies. And sometimes it doesn't pay them at all, but their kinship-detectors have been tricked into treating their groupmates as if they were relatives by tactics like kinship metaphors (blood brothers, fraternities, the fatherland), origin myths, communal meals and other bonding rituals. 
 Juggling the Spheres
 All this brings us to a theory of how the moral sense can be universal and variable at the same time. The five moral spheres are universal, a legacy of evolution. But how they are ranked in importance, and which is brought in to moralize which area of social life -- sex, government, commerce, religion, diet and so on -- depends on the culture. Many of the flabbergasting practices in faraway places become more intelligible when you recognize that the same moralizing impulse that Western elites channel toward violations of harm and fairness (our moral obsessions) is channeled elsewhere to violations in the other spheres. Think of the Japanese fear of nonconformity (community), the holy ablutions and dietary restrictions of Hindus and Orthodox Jews (purity), the outrage at insulting the Prophet among Muslims (authority). In the West, we believe that in business and government, fairness should trump community and try to root out nepotism and cronyism. In other parts of the world this is incomprehensible -- what heartless creep would favor a perfect stranger over his own brother? 
 The ranking and placement of moral spheres also divides the cultures of liberals and conservatives in the United States. Many bones of contention, like homosexuality, atheism and one-parent families from the right, or racial imbalances, sweatshops and executive pay from the left, reflect different weightings of the spheres. In a large Web survey, Haidt found that liberals put a lopsided moral weight on harm and fairness while playing down group loyalty, authority and purity. Conservatives instead place a moderately high weight on all five. It's not surprising that each side thinks it is driven by lofty ethical values and that the other side is base and unprincipled. 
 Reassigning an activity to a different sphere, or taking it out of the moral spheres altogether, isn't easy. People think that a behavior belongs in its sphere as a matter of sacred necessity and that the very act of questioning an assignment is a moral outrage. The psychologist Philip Tetlock has shown that the mentality of taboo -- a conviction that some thoughts are sinful to think -- is not just a superstition of Polynesians but a mind-set that can easily be triggered in college-educated Americans. Just ask them to think about applying the sphere of reciprocity to relationships customarily governed by community or authority. When Tetlock asked subjects for their opinions on whether adoption agencies should place children with the couples willing to pay the most, whether people should have the right to sell their organs and whether they should be able to buy their way out of jury duty, the subjects not only disagreed but felt personally insulted and were outraged that anyone would raise the question. 
 The institutions of modernity often question and experiment with the way activities are assigned to moral spheres. Market economies tend to put everything up for sale. Science amoralizes the world by seeking to understand phenomena rather than pass judgment on them. Secular philosophy is in the business of scrutinizing all beliefs, including those entrenched by authority and tradition. It's not surprising that these institutions are often seen to be morally corrosive. 
 Is Nothing Sacred? 
 And ''morally corrosive'' is exactly the term that some critics would apply to the new science of the moral sense. The attempt to dissect our moral intuitions can look like an attempt to debunk them. Evolutionary psychologists seem to want to unmask our noblest motives as ultimately self-interested -- to show that our love for children, compassion for the unfortunate and sense of justice are just tactics in a Darwinian struggle to perpetuate our genes. The explanation of how different cultures appeal to different spheres could lead to a spineless relativism, in which we would never have grounds to criticize the practice of another culture, no matter how barbaric, because ''we have our kind of morality and they have theirs.'' And the whole enterprise seems to be dragging us to an amoral nihilism, in which morality itself would be demoted from a transcendent principle to a figment of our neural circuitry. 
 In reality, none of these fears are warranted, and it's important to see why not. The first misunderstanding involves the logic of evolutionary explanations. Evolutionary biologists sometimes anthropomorphize DNA for the same reason that science teachers find it useful to have their students imagine the world from the viewpoint of a molecule or a beam of light. One shortcut to understanding the theory of selection without working through the math is to imagine that the genes are little agents that try to make copies of themselves. 
 Unfortunately, the meme of the selfish gene escaped from popular biology books and mutated into the idea that organisms (including people) are ruthlessly self-serving. And this doesn't follow. Genes are not a reservoir of our dark unconscious wishes. ''Selfish'' genes are perfectly compatible with selfless organisms, because a gene's metaphorical goal of selfishly replicating itself can be implemented by wiring up the brain of the organism to do unselfish things, like being nice to relatives or doing good deeds for needy strangers. When a mother stays up all night comforting a sick child, the genes that endowed her with that tenderness were ''selfish'' in a metaphorical sense, but by no stretch of the imagination is she being selfish.
 Nor does reciprocal altruism -- the evolutionary rationale behind fairness -- imply that people do good deeds in the cynical expectation of repayment down the line. We all know of unrequited good deeds, like tipping a waitress in a city you will never visit again and falling on a grenade to save platoonmates. These bursts of goodness are not as anomalous to a biologist as they might appear.
 In his classic 1971 article, Trivers, the biologist, showed how natural selection could push in the direction of true selflessness. The emergence of tit-for-tat reciprocity, which lets organisms trade favors without being cheated, is just a first step. A favor-giver not only has to avoid blatant cheaters (those who would accept a favor but not return it) but also prefer generous reciprocators (those who return the biggest favor they can afford) over stingy ones (those who return the smallest favor they can get away with). Since it's good to be chosen as a recipient of favors, a competition arises to be the most generous partner around. More accurately, a competition arises to appear to be the most generous partner around, since the favor-giver can't literally read minds or see into the future. A reputation for fairness and generosity becomes an asset. 
 Now this just sets up a competition for potential beneficiaries to inflate their reputations without making the sacrifices to back them up. But it also pressures the favor-giver to develop ever-more-sensitive radar to distinguish the genuinely generous partners from the hypocrites. This arms race will eventually reach a logical conclusion. The most effective way to seem generous and fair, under harsh scrutiny, is to be generous and fair. In the long run, then, reputation can be secured only by commitment. At least some agents evolve to be genuinely high-minded and self-sacrificing -- they are moral not because of what it brings them but because that's the kind of people they are. 
 Of course, a theory that predicted that everyone always sacrificed themselves for another's good would be as preposterous as a theory that predicted that no one ever did. Alongside the niches for saints there are niches for more grudging reciprocators, who attract fewer and poorer partners but don't make the sacrifices necessary for a sterling reputation. And both may coexist with outright cheaters, who exploit the unwary in one-shot encounters. An ecosystem of niches, each with a distinct strategy, can evolve when the payoff of each strategy depends on how many players are playing the other strategies. The human social environment does have its share of generous, grudging and crooked characters, and the genetic variation in personality seems to bear the fingerprints of this evolutionary process.
 Is Morality a Figment? 
 So a biological understanding of the moral sense does not entail that people are calculating maximizers of their genes or self-interest. But where does it leave the concept of morality itself? 
 Here is the worry. The scientific outlook has taught us that some parts of our subjective experience are products of our biological makeup and have no objective counterpart in the world. The qualitative difference between red and green, the tastiness of fruit and foulness of carrion, the scariness of heights and prettiness of flowers are design features of our common nervous system, and if our species had evolved in a different ecosystem or if we were missing a few genes, our reactions could go the other way. Now, if the distinction between right and wrong is also a product of brain wiring, why should we believe it is any more real than the distinction between red and green? And if it is just a collective hallucination, how could we argue that evils like genocide and slavery are wrong for everyone, rather than just distasteful to us? 
 Putting God in charge of morality is one way to solve the problem, of course, but Plato made short work of it 2,400 years ago. Does God have a good reason for designating certain acts as moral and others as immoral? If not -- if his dictates are divine whims -- why should we take them seriously? Suppose that God commanded us to torture a child. Would that make it all right, or would some other standard give us reasons to resist? And if, on the other hand, God was forced by moral reasons to issue some dictates and not others -- if a command to torture a child was never an option -- then why not appeal to those reasons directly? 
 This throws us back to wondering where those reasons could come from, if they are more than just figments of our brains. They certainly aren't in the physical world like wavelength or mass. The only other option is that moral truths exist in some abstract Platonic realm, there for us to discover, perhaps in the same way that mathematical truths (according to most mathematicians) are there for us to discover. On this analogy, we are born with a rudimentary concept of number, but as soon as we build on it with formal mathematical reasoning, the nature of mathematical reality forces us to discover some truths and not others. (No one who understands the concept of two, the concept of four and the concept of addition can come to any conclusion but that 2 + 2 = 4.) Perhaps we are born with a rudimentary moral sense, and as soon as we build on it with moral reasoning, the nature of moral reality forces us to some conclusions but not others. 
 Moral realism, as this idea is called, is too rich for many philosophers' blood. Yet a diluted version of the idea -- if not a list of cosmically inscribed Thou-Shalts, then at least a few If-Thens -- is not crazy. Two features of reality point any rational, self-preserving social agent in a moral direction. And they could provide a benchmark for determining when the judgments of our moral sense are aligned with morality itself. 
 One is the prevalence of nonzero-sum games. In many arenas of life, two parties are objectively better off if they both act in a nonselfish way than if each of them acts selfishly. You and I are both better off if we share our surpluses, rescue each other's children in danger and refrain from shooting at each other, compared with hoarding our surpluses while they rot, letting the other's child drown while we file our nails or feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys. Granted, I might be a bit better off if I acted selfishly at your expense and you played the sucker, but the same is true for you with me, so if each of us tried for these advantages, we'd both end up worse off. Any neutral observer, and you and I if we could talk it over rationally, would have to conclude that the state we should aim foris the one in which we both are unselfish. These spreadsheet projections are not quirks of brain wiring, nor are they dictated by a supernatural power; they are in the nature of things.
 The other external support for morality is a feature of rationality itself: that it cannot depend on the egocentric vantage point of the reasoner. If I appeal to you to do anything that affects me -- to get off my foot, or tell me the time or not run me over with your car -- then I can't do it in a way that privileges my interests over yours (say, retaining my right to run you over with my car) if I want you to take me seriously. Unless I am Galactic Overlord, I have to state my case in a way that would force me to treat you in kind. I can't act as if my interests are special just because I'm me and you're not, any more than I can persuade you that the spot I am standing on is a special place in the universe just because I happen to be standing on it.
 Not coincidentally, the core of this idea -- the interchangeability of perspectives -- keeps reappearing in history's best-thought-through moral philosophies, including the Golden Rule (itself discovered many times); Spinoza's Viewpoint of Eternity; the Social Contract of Hobbes, Rousseau and Locke; Kant's Categorical Imperative; and Rawls's Veil of Ignorance. It also underlies Peter Singer's theory of the Expanding Circle -- the optimistic proposal that our moral sense, though shaped by evolution to overvalue self, kin and clan, can propel us on a path of moral progress, as our reasoning forces us to generalize it to larger and larger circles of sentient beings.
 Doing Better by Knowing Ourselves
 Morality, then, is still something larger than our inherited moral sense, and the new science of the moral sense does not make moral reasoning and conviction obsolete. At the same time, its implications for our moral universe are profound. 
 At the very least, the science tells us that even when our adversaries' agenda is most baffling, they may not be amoral psychopaths but in the throes of a moral mind-set that appears to them to be every bit as mandatory and universal as ours does to us. Of course, some adversaries really are psychopaths, and others are so poisoned by a punitive moralization that they are beyond the pale of reason. (The actor Will Smith had many historians on his side when he recently speculated to the press that Hitler thought he was acting morally.) But in any conflict in which a meeting of the minds is not completely hopeless, a recognition that the other guy is acting from moral rather than venal reasons can be a first patch of common ground. One side can acknowledge the other's concern for community or stability or fairness or dignity, even while arguing that some other value should trump it in that instance. With affirmative action, for example, the opponents can be seen as arguing from a sense of fairness, not racism, and the defenders can be seen as acting from a concern with community, not bureaucratic power. Liberals can ratify conservatives' concern with families while noting that gay marriage is perfectly consistent with that concern. 
 The science of the moral sense also alerts us to ways in which our psychological makeup can get in the way of our arriving at the most defensible moral conclusions. The moral sense, we are learning, is as vulnerable to illusions as the other senses. It is apt to confuse morality per se with purity, status and conformity. It tends to reframe practical problems as moral crusades and thus see their solution in punitive aggression. It imposes taboos that make certain ideas indiscussible. And it has the nasty habit of always putting the self on the side of the angels. 
 Though wise people have long reflected on how we can be blinded by our own sanctimony, our public discourse still fails to discount it appropriately. In the worst cases, the thoughtlessness of our brute intuitions can be celebrated as a virtue. In his influential essay ''The Wisdom of Repugnance,'' Leon Kass, former chair of the President's Council on Bioethics, argued that we should disregard reason when it comes to cloning and other biomedical technologies and go with our gut: ''We are repelled by the prospect of cloning human beings . . . because we intuit and feel, immediately and without argument, the violation of things that we rightfully hold dear. . . . In this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done . . . repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder.''
 There are, of course, good reasons to regulate human cloning, but the shudder test is not one of them. People have shuddered at all kinds of morally irrelevant violations of purity in their culture: touching an untouchable, drinking from the same water fountain as a Negro, allowing Jewish blood to mix with Aryan blood, tolerating sodomy between consenting men. And if our ancestors' repugnance had carried the day, we never would have had autopsies, vaccinations, blood transfusions, artificial insemination, organ transplants and in vitro fertilization, all of which were denounced as immoral when they were new. 
 There are many other issues for which we are too quick to hit the moralization button and look for villains rather than bug fixes. What should we do when a hospital patient is killed by a nurse who administers the wrong drug in a patient's intravenous line? Should we make it easier to sue the hospital for damages? Or should we redesign the IV fittings so that it's physically impossible to connect the wrong bottle to the line? 
 And nowhere is moralization more of a hazard than in our greatest global challenge. The threat of human-induced climate change has become the occasion for a moralistic revival meeting. In many discussions, the cause of climate change is overindulgence (too many S.U.V.'s) and defilement (sullying the atmosphere), and the solution is temperance (conservation) and expiation (buying carbon offset coupons). Yet the experts agree that these numbers don't add up: even if every last American became conscientious about his or her carbon emissions, the effects on climate change would be trifling, if for no other reason than that two billion Indians and Chinese are unlikely to copy our born-again abstemiousness. Though voluntary conservation may be one wedge in an effective carbon-reduction pie, the other wedges will have to be morally boring, like a carbon tax and new energy technologies, or even taboo, like nuclear power and deliberate manipulation of the ocean and atmosphere. Our habit of moralizing problems, merging them with intuitions of purity and contamination, and resting content when we feel the right feelings, can get in the way of doing the right thing. 
 Far from debunking morality, then, the science of the moral sense can advance it, by allowing us to see through the illusions that evolution and culture have saddled us with and to focus on goals we can share and defend. As Anton Chekhov wrote, ''Man will become better when you show him what he is like.''

HEADLINE: OP-EXTRA: SELECTIONS FROM OPINION ONLINE

 BODY:
Outposts For Obama, Nevada offers a chance to show he's not just the candidate of Dartmouth students and people worried about what the dollar will do to Bordeaux futures. But after showing he could do well in monochromatic northern states, he could use the boost from a state that is 24 percent Hispanic and 8 percent African-American. 
 For the newly human Hillary Clinton, she may have to emote with a hard-working stripper or two: Yes, men can be such jerks! So single-minded! Even without the union endorsement, she has demographics in her favor: women are 58 percent of the culinary workers union.
 If it's true that every American city has become more like Vegas -- with our pleasure-themed convention center ghettos and casinos rising in new ''enterprise zones'' -- then this model may not be such a bad thing. Every month, 5,000 new residents arrive in Nevada -- the state grew by 25 percent over the last six years -- largely because being a fry cook or food server is not a dead-end job. They call it the Las Vegas Dream, and the slogan is plastered all over union shops around town.

 ''Next Stop: Worker's Paradise''
 Reader Comments:
 Nice article. One bone to pick, though: It's not that Las Vegas is recession-proof so much as that it's outsource-proof. Today even doctor consults could be outsourced to, say, India, but so far no one has figured how to get people several thousand miles away to do the laundry, carry up the luggage and deal the cards.

 Campaign Stops The Clinton campaign has blamed everybody but the pope for Hillary's troubles, but it certainly is true that she was taken by surprise in Iowa, and then deprived of enough time to reorganize before New Hampshire. Mitt Romney could make the same argument, I guess, although he did have enough time to remake himself into the ''Washington is Broken'' candidate. (Mitt also now has a 12-point list of promises similar to Rudy Giuliani's, a rare example of a candidate stealing from someone whose polls are falling faster than his own.) 
 -- Gail Collins, ''Showtime Again'' 
 The Wild Side This year is the 150th anniversary of one of the most important events in the history of biology. In 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace wrote to Charles Darwin from the Moluccan Islands, in what is now Indonesia. The letter contained a manuscript in which Wallace outlined the idea of evolution by natural selection.
 To celebrate this event and what it led to, I decided to visit Wallace's portrait in London's National Portrait Gallery. ... I looked around and felt a moment of awe. There's Darwin as an old man, looking luminous; the painter has done a good job on his eyes; they seem to have profound depth. Charles Lyell, whose ''Principles of Geology'' influenced both Darwin and Wallace, is sitting thoughtfully. The ambitious and ruthless Richard Owen, coiner of the word ''dinosaur'' and founder of the Natural History Museum, is there, a pickled nautilus in a jar beside him, the brown-and-white shell of the unfortunate animal in his hand. Here's Owen's enemy, Thomas Henry Huxley, one of the great early proponents of evolution by natural selection, holding a skull. ... 
 A white marble bust, complete with prodigious whiskers (this was an age of big facial hair), stares at us. It's Herbert Spencer, autodidact, social philosopher and, incidentally, originator of that horrible misleading phrase, ''survival of the fittest.'' ... There's a photograph of Darwin's cousin, Francis Galton ... there are some engineers, physicists and chemists. But no Wallace.
 -- Olivia Judson,
 ''Wallace Should Hang''
 Reader Comments:
 How ironic reading this, so long after Wallace's life, and yet today a proselytizer came to my door, asking me to believe that Adam and Eve were the first humans, a mere 6,000 years ago.
 -- Posted by Dave Anderson
 Thoughtful plaudits from Judson for Wallace, who indeed deserves more credit than history has accorded him. But what about nutty old Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744-1829)? Although recognized by Darwin and others as a genius, even a theoretical mentor ... he was virtually ignored in his own time and died in poverty and obscurity.
 -- Posted by Scott Wheeler
 Think Again Do the humanities ennoble? And for that matter, is it the business of the humanities, or of any other area of academic study, to save us? The answer in both cases, I think, is no. The premise of secular humanism (or of just old-fashioned humanism) is that the examples of action and thought portrayed in the enduring works of literature, philosophy and history can create in readers the desire to emulate them. ...
 It's a pretty idea, but there is no evidence to support it and a lot of evidence against it. If it were true, the most generous, patient, good-hearted and honest people on earth would be the members of literature and philosophy departments, who spend every waking hour with great books and great thoughts, and as someone who's been there (for 45 years) I can tell you it just isn't so. 
 Teachers and students of literature and philosophy don't learn how to be good and wise; they learn how to analyze literary effects and to distinguish between different accounts of the foundations of knowledge. ...Teachers of literature and philosophy are competent in a subject, not in a ministry. It is not the business of the humanities to save us, no more than it is their business to bring revenue to a state or a university.
 -- Stanley Fish,
 ''Will the Humanities Save Us?''
 Reader Comments:
 Pretty easy to say when you're one of the people who never once had to ask this particular question in order to earn a living teaching humanities. I'm reading this after 2:30 a.m. because I just picked up four sections of temp-work civilization courses late, late last week. They start tomorrow afternoon. In another city. But, hey, thanks for high-fiving my task: after a dozen hours of trying to shovel Cicero et al. into four syllabi for approximately $8 an hour with no benefits, or, in other words, half of what I earned in construction two decades ago, before I got my Ph.D., I needed a good laugh. And it would be self-centered to wish for more than that.

HEADLINE: Road Show To Sell Toll Raises

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
 LET the hard sell begin.
 Over the next several weeks, Gov. Jon S. Corzine will crisscross the state in a campaign-style swing through all 21 counties, trying to convince New Jerseyans that his plan to drastically raise highway tolls is the only way to keep the state from financial ruin. He has enlisted a former political foe to help make his case and is expected to use his own money to pay for an advertising campaign promoting the plan.
 By most accounts -- including his own -- getting the public onboard is going to be no small feat in a state that already has one of the nation's highest tax burdens. Mr. Corzine is proposing to increase tolls by 50 percent every four years starting in 2010 and ending in 2022, as well as additional increases for inflation. 
 The plan would also include relinquishing state control of the toll roads to a new nonprofit corporation so the state can reap up to $38 billion from a bond sale meant to halve the state's $32 billion debt and repair its transportation infrastructure.
 When Rutgers University pollsters asked registered voters in August whether they supported the idea of leasing the toll roads to a nonprofit corporation, 61 percent said no. Republicans in the Legislature are trying to build on that pessimism and have criticized the plan as a scheme that uses one credit card to pay off another.
 The looming question for the Corzine administration has therefore become how it can win over a skeptical public. 
 ''It will take time for people to fully get their minds around and understand,'' Mr. Corzine said Thursday at a news conference, two days after he announced his plan during his State of the State address. ''I don't think anyone will think this is going to be easy.''
 Realizing that they are already at somewhat of a disadvantage, Mr. Corzine and his administration have quickly gone on the offensive -- a move that political analysts said could help tip public opinion in the governor's direction.
 ''It all depends on how it's framed and who gets out there first,'' said Tim Vercellotti, the director of polling at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers. ''If the governor succeeds in framing this as something that's responsible, and as something that is actually going to make progress in solving the state's budget problems as opposed to something that's going to put off another day of reckoning, he can be successful.''
 Mr. Corzine already appears to have a few advantages. First, despite all the criticism from Republicans that his plan would overburden New Jersey drivers and strip the state of the authority to run its toll roads, the governor's opponents have not offered an alternative fix to the state's finances.
 Democrats often point this out. ''I don't see anybody coming up with a viable alternative plan,'' said Richard J. Codey, the Senate president. 
 But Mr. Codey said he recognized that some New Jerseyans might prefer no financial reorganization plan at all to what Mr. Corzine has proposed. ''To the guy and gal on the street, he's raising tolls dramatically,'' Mr. Codey said. ''Are they going to be able to accept that in the next two months? No.''
 Making a strong, convincing case can be done, but it will not happen right away, Mr. Codey said. ''Over time, you can sell it,'' he said.
 Mr. Corzine has sold complex restructuring of state government before. Just last week, the Legislature approved his plan to revamp the state's formula of financing public schools, costing an estimated $532.8 million the first year.
 It is also to Mr. Corzine's advantage that he enjoys considerable credibility in the public's eyes on matters of economics and finance because of his background on Wall Street, where he was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. And his administration is hoping that as he travels the state holding town meetings over the next several weeks, he can use that credibility to change minds.
 This is an advantage that even Mr. Corzine's critics have conceded. Recently on New Jersey 101.5 FM (WKXW), the radio station that views itself as the vox populi of the state, Jim Gearhart, the host of a morning show who has criticized the governor's plan, said he found it difficult to oppose Mr. Corzine on financial issues.
 While Mr. Gearhart took a break during his show, a news report on the governor's plan described it as ''highly unpopular.'' 
 The road show approach to promote a plan that is facing public resistance has worked for Mr. Corzine before. Shortly after he took office in 2006 and proposed raising the state's sales tax by one cent, he held a series of town hall meetings in which he explained the critical state of New Jersey's finances. Ultimately, the Legislature approved his plan.
 These meetings are where Mr. Corzine -- who is not always the most polished or confident speaker in large settings but has shown a knack for connecting with voters in more intimate gatherings -- has the opportunity to shine.
 ''He was able to sell an increase in the sales tax,'' Mr. Vercellotti said. ''And if he can paint a dire enough picture, he can make some progress.'' 
 The governor's aides have said that getting the public to understand that the state's finances are in urgent need of repair will be critical in shaping public opinion. That is the approach Mr. Corzine took in 2006 with the sales tax. 
 ''What we want to be sure people focus on is that we need to have a real open and honest discussion about how we're going to address the state's fiscal problems,'' said Bradley I. Abelow, the governor's chief of staff and the former state treasurer. ''I don't think it's a matter of convincing, I think it's a matter of our continuing to talk about this.''
 But for now, there is little sign that public skepticism about the plan is fading. Last week on 101.5 FM, an indignant caller who objected to raising tolls asked why Mr. Corzine, a multimillionaire, could not pay to fix the state's financial problems himself.

HEADLINE: McCain and Romney Tangle Over Job Losses in Michigan

BYLINE: BY ELISABETH BUMILLER and JOHN M. BRODER; Elisabeth Bumiller reported from Warren, Mich., and John M. Broder from Livonia.

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain and former Governor Mitt Romney battled Saturday over how to rejuvenate Michigan's rusting economy as the two remained in a tight race in the final 72 hours heading into the state's Republican primary.
 Mr. McCain, who is leading in a number of statewide polls, continued to jab at Mr. Romney for peddling what Mr. McCain characterized as false economic hopes. Mr. Romney called Mr. McCain defeatist. 
 ''I'm not pessimistic, I'm optimistic,'' Mr. McCain countered at a crowded town hall meeting held in a banquet and dinner theater space in Warren. ''The best and most productive workers in the world reside in the state of Michigan, my friends, and they can compete with anybody.'' 
 Turning to the state's ailing auto industry, Mr. McCain said that ''Detroit once saved the world, Michigan once saved the world in World War II, they can do it again.''
 Mr. McCain's crowds were generally larger than those of Mr. Romney, a Michigan native and the son of George Romney, a former Michigan governor. Mitt Romney emigrated to Massachusetts after high school but he played up his local roots in several campaign stops here on Saturday.
 ''For me, Michigan is personal,'' Mr. Romney said at a brief airport appearance in Traverse City, in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. ''It's personal because this is where I was born and raised. My mom and dad are buried here.''
 Mr. McCain was loudly heckled at an appearance in Livonia when he said that the nation's 10 million illegal immigrants had to be treated humanely and not deported en masse. The catcalls eventually died down.
 But the contentious issue of the day between the two candidates was how to help those workers who have been laid off by the automotive giants in Detroit or who have seen their jobs go overseas. 
 Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts whose father was president of American Motors in the 1950s and '60s, insisted that the auto industry can be revived and blamed Congress and Mr. McCain for ignoring Michigan's problems.
 ''The question is, where is Washington?'' Mr. Romney said, speaking to a gaggle of reporters across from a General Motors transmission plant near Ypsilanti, where 200 layoffs were announced this week. ''Where does it stop? Is there a point at which someone says 'enough'? Or are we going to allow the entire domestic automotive manufacturing industry to disappear?''
 Mr. Romney criticized the energy bill signed into law last month by President Bush that requires cars and trucks sold in the United States to achieve a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Substantial majorities in both parties in both houses of Congress approved the measure. Mr. McCain voted for it.
 Mr. Romney said he opposed the new mileage standard, describing it as an anvil tossed to Detroit by a government that did not understand the auto industry or care about its workers. ''As president, I will not rest as Detroit gets to see layoff after layoff after layoff,'' he said.
 Mr. Romney proposed increased government spending for research on advanced fuels and vehicles, aid to automakers to deal with the costs of health care and pensions for retirees, and tax cuts for most taxpayers to help them buy new cars.
 Valinda Turner, 52, said at Mr. Romney's Traverse City appearance that she was still shopping around for a candidate. 
 ''I was behind Huckabee, but I'm not sure,'' said Ms. Turner, a real estate agent from Boyne Falls, Mich. She said she was glad that Mr. Romney was talking about solving the problems of the auto industry, but that even after he spoke she was not persuaded.
 ''I want to know how he's going to get it done,'' she said. ''I didn't hear it.''
 In Warren, Mr. McCain said he would be ''ashamed'' to tell voters that the lost jobs would return to Michigan, but he vowed to take care of displaced workers through a promised job retraining program that would be offered through community colleges. ''We are a Judeo-Christian values nation,'' Mr. McCain told the group at the town hall in Warren. ''We cannot leave people behind.''
 Mr. McCain toured the state in his campaign bus, the ''Straight Talk Express,'' and at first appeared to be in a bad mood when he talked to reporters for nearly an hour from his seat in the back. But his spirits lifted visibly later in the day when he learned that he had received the endorsement of The State, South Carolina's largest newspaper, for the primary there on Jan. 19.
 The newspaper said that the two strongest candidates were Mr. Huckabee and Mr. McCain, but that Mr. Huckabee's ''utter lack of knowledge of foreign affairs is unsettling.'' The newspaper praised Mr. McCain for experience, courage and independence, and said ''he is a slave to no ideology or faction.''
 One of Mr. McCain's guests on the bus on Saturday was Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard who is supporting Mr. McCain. The senator turned to Ms. Fiorina at the town hall meeting in Warren to help him answer a question about why the sub-prime mortgage crisis seemed to catch the country by surprise.
 Ms. Fiorina took the microphone and said that ''many, many people'' did not see the mortgage crisis coming ''because we forgot about a fundamental principle of American capitalism,'' transparency. She also said banks had taken many of the transactions off their balance sheets.
 ''She's a lot smarter than I am,'' Mr. McCain said.

HEADLINE: Rights vs. Rights: An Improbable Collision Course

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 BARRING some seismic scandal, unforeseen late entry (''Al Who?''), or unlikely surge by John Edwards, it is wholly inevitable that the race for the Democratic nomination will end next August in an epochal first. 
 Either Senator Barack Obama will be the first African-American or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton will be the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major American political party. One of them will take the stage at Denver's Pepsi Center, specked with confetti and soaked in history as a culminating figure of one of the great ideological movements of the last century -- civil rights or women's rights. 
 To this point, both Mr. Obama and (to a lesser degree) Mrs. Clinton have been diligent in trying not to identify too closely with either movement. Mr. Obama rarely mentions his race explicitly, leaving the heavy rhetoric of his groundbreaking potential to his wife, Michelle (who in a speech in November spoke of lifting ''that veil of impossibility that keeps us down and keeps our children down''). Mrs. Clinton has made more direct appeals to mothers and daughters and ''making history,'' but has for the most part predicated her candidacy on the masculine virtues of toughness, resolve and her extensive experience in the (male-dominated) realm of politics and government. 
 Still, whether the candidate wants the mantle or not, whoever wins the nomination will be bestowed (or bludgeoned) with the hopes and legacy of a movement. The victory will be a benchmark moment for the American promise of equality, and the Democrats will add to their partisan quiver a feel-great story that could buoy them in the fall. ''Americans are looking for a way to break barriers,'' Karl Rove said last week in an interview with National Public Radio (not that Mr. Rove, President Bush's chief political maharishi, is at risk of helping either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton do this). ''They would love to elect a woman president; they would love to elect an African-American president.'' 
 But feel-great story or not, they can't pick both. Someone will lose. Such is football, Yahtzee and elections. And either Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton -- and the movements they represent -- will be consigned, for the time being, to a status of ''almost.''
 Breakthrough politics can be a zero-sum game, with distinct groups striving for a finite piece of the change pie. It brings to mind that the civil rights movement and the women's movement have a long, complicated history dating back to abolitionism and the origins of modern feminism. While they have been philosophical allies, sharing goals and ideals, there have also been periodic collisions that could bespeak an inevitable friction as Barack v. Hillary moves forward and -- potentially -- in directions far less seemly than they have to date. 
 ''The movements have been so deeply linked, and usually in harmony,'' said Sara Evans, author of ''Personal Politics: The Roots of Women's Liberation in the Civil Rights Movement and the New Left'' and a historian at the University of Minnesota. ''But there will always be points of tension, too,'' Ms. Evans said, especially when the broad ideals that blacks and women have typically shared -- in their fight for the vote, non-discrimination and economic equality -- give way to the nitty-gritty of reaching consensus, setting policy, passing legislation and, in the case of elections, making choices.
 One bitter case from the 19th century involved a split between the abolitionist Frederick Douglass and the women's rights' pioneer Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Stanton was herself a fervent abolitionist, and a close ally of Douglass, who later confined herself to the cause of women's equality. These ideals would eventually clash, resulting in increasingly divisive rhetoric that reached a harsh climax after Stanton condemned the 15th amendment -- which gave black men the right to vote but left out women of all races -- as something that would establish ''an aristocracy of sex on this continent.'' She also alluded to the ''lower orders'' like Irish, blacks, Germans, Chinese. 
 During a heated meeting in New York City's Steinway Hall in 1869, Stanton wondered, ''Shall American statesmen ... so amend their constitutions as to make their wives and mothers the political inferiors of unlettered and unwashed ditch-diggers, bootblacks, butchers and barbers, fresh from the slave plantations of the South?'' At which point, Douglass rose, paid tribute to Stanton's years of work on civil rights for all, and replied, ''When women, because they are women, are hunted down through the cities of New York and New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses and hung from lampposts; when their children are torn from their arms and their brains dashed out upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult and rage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their homes burnt down... then they will have an urgency to obtain the ballot equal to our own.''
 Blacks won the right to vote with the 15th Amendment in 1870; women won theirs with the 19th Amendment, in 1920, a half-century later. Each of their causes would stutter-step along at sometimes different paces, but usually in some loose if not formal concert. 
 Some of the women's rights giants of the 20th century took public positions, or made public gestures, in the service of civil rights. Eleanor Roosevelt, while first lady, memorably resigned her membership in the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1939 after that organization refused to allow the black contralto Marian Anderson the right to perform at Constitution Hall. (Franklin Roosevelt got Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickes to allow a concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, drawing a crowd estimated at over 75,000.) The civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s were ''the starting point for what many people have called 'the rights revolution,' '' said James T. Patterson, professor emeritus of history at Brown University and author of ''Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy,'' among other books. Some activists would grumble that women were under-represented in the leadership rungs. ''They complained that their role was to cook dinner and serve as sex partners,'' Mr. Patterson said. (In one notably bad joke, the black activist Stokely Carmichael was asked what position women held in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, to which he replied, ''Prone.'') 
 Women seemed to hit their stride in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Were they benefitting disproportionately from affirmative action, black men wondered? Later in the 70s and early 80s, blue-collar white women blamed affirmative action for their own economic hardship and job insecurity. And, experts say, there has always been some measure of discord between economically disadvantaged black feminists, who often emphasize pocketbook issues, and more affluent white feminists, with a greater focus on charged political issues like abortion rights. 
 In recent decades, the more public instances of blacks and women at loggerheads have involved a striving for milestones and power at the top, as opposed to minimal enfranchisement at the bottom. The case of the Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, accused of sexual harassment by a former employee, Anita Hill, offered a riveting public dispute that cut to the core of racial and gender identities in late 20th-century America. But the vast majority of blacks -- men, and especially women -- were aligned against the nomination of the conservative Mr. Thomas to begin with, and he eventually won confirmation by a narrow margin, largely along party lines.
 Indeed, the causes of black progress and women's progress, and any cross-tensions between them, have largely existed within the Democratic Party. Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984, faced pressure to consider blacks and women as his running mate. He made a drawn-out show of his deliberations, considering black candidates (like the mayors of Philadelphia and Los Angeles), before settling on Representative Geraldine Ferraro. 
 It's not clear how seriously Mr. Mondale considered the mayors, or whether he would have picked Ms. Ferraro if he had had a better chance of defeating Ronald Reagan (who went on to bulldoze him in November, taking 49 states). But a notion had clearly taken hold that it would be only a matter of time before a woman or a minority candidate would seriously challenge for the presidency.
 Who would figure that both would happen the same year? 
 ''We're on the verge of a stunning first,'' Mr. Patterson said. 
 Yet the core challenge of both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton is the degree to which each can transcend the first-ness of their candidacies. ''The question is, How do you become a universal figure when you represent movements that have claimed the right of equality for you in your difference?'' said Joan Scott, a professor of social science at the Institute for Advanced Study.
 In fundamental ways, both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are kindred products of campus and community politics in their respective eras. Until recently, the tone of the Clinton-Obama race has been relatively civil and respectful, and -- with a few exceptions -- largely free of racial or gender-based rhetoric or offense. Mrs. Clinton vied aggressively for support among blacks, following on the great good will engendered by Bill Clinton during his campaigns and presidency. And Mr. Obama enjoyed significant support among women, helped in part by the strong and visible role that Michelle Obama had played in his campaign. 
 ''Many of us just hope to high heaven that this continues,'' Ms. Scott said of the campaign's civil tone and relative color- and gender-blindness.
 Alas, the campaign has taken a nastier turn in recent days, and the development has coincided, not surprisingly, with the start of voting, the advent of winners and losers, the harsh divvying of the electoral pie. 
 Women rallied to Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire -- 57 percent -- after what many perceived as an unfair piling on by Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards in a debate on Saturday. (Mr. Obama was tagged as being dismissive and patronizing after he told Mrs. Clinton she was ''likable enough.'') In post-election surveys, many women said they were both heartened by Mrs. Clinton's choked-up response to a voter's question on Monday, and incensed by the ridicule she endured in its aftermath.
 Likewise, many blacks took offense to a remark Mrs. Clinton made in an interview with Fox News that struck some as dismissive of the contributions of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (She had pointed out that it took the leadership of a president, Lyndon Johnson, to bring about ''Dr. King's dream.'') 
 To many, the comments echoed a building tone of disrespect that Mrs. Clinton had been expressing toward Mr. Obama -- pooh-poohing his commitment to change as merely ''hoping for it,'' implying that her fellow United States senator was all talk. Bill Clinton took things even further, ranting against the media for not challenging the ''fairy tale'' that he said Mr. Obama's rise was predicated on. (He was referring specifically to the perception that Mr. Obama was totally pure in his opposition to the Iraq war.)
 This infuriated prominent blacks like the Democratic operative and commentator Donna Brazile and Representative James E Clyburn of the critical primary state South Carolina, both of whom have been close to the Clintons and have remained neutral in the race. For Mr. Clinton ''to go after Obama, using 'fairy tale,' calling him a 'kid,' as he did last week, it's an insult,'' Ms. Brazile said on CNN. ''And I tell you, as an African- American, I find his words and his tone to be very depressing.''
 Even more striking were remarks from Mr. Clyburn, the House majority whip and veteran of the civil rights movement, who also happens to be the leading black official in Congress. In a sense, Mr. Clyburn's neutrality to this point in the Democratic race has marked a kind of sensible center in a potentially divisive campaign. 
 But that center appeared in some jeopardy on Thursday after Mr. Clyburn said he was re-thinking his position after the remarks by the Clintons, which he said distorted the history of civil rights.
 ''We have to be very, very careful about how we speak about that era in American politics,'' Mr. Clyburn told Carl Hulse, a reporter for The New York Times. ''It is one thing to run a campaign and be respectful of everyone's motives and actions, and it is something else to denigrate those. That bothered me a great deal.'' 
 But so goes the bumpy road to history.

HEADLINE: Two Giants Try to Learn to Share Asia

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and SOMINI SENGUPTA. 
Jim Yardley reported from Beijing, and Somini Sengupta from New Delhi.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India will arrive in Beijing on Sunday for a three-day visit to China, with each country eager to increase bilateral trade, promote mutual friendship and offer reassurances that Asia is big enough to accommodate the ambitions of both rising powers.
 Mr. Singh is visiting China for the first time as prime minister, when his government also has drawn closer to Japan and the United States. But Indian officials insist that India is not a proxy for American interests and is not plotting to form alliances to counter China's rise. India also wants Chinese cooperation on nuclear issues and managing the unrest in Pakistan. 
 ''I have made it clear to the Chinese leadership that India is not part of any so-called contain China effort,'' Mr. Singh said last week, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
 China sees the trip as the latest proof of its maturing relationship with India after decades of hostility and mistrust rooted in a brief border war in 1962. Neither side is expecting significant progress on lingering disputes, especially over their contested Himalayan border. But Chinese leaders consider warmer relations critical for avoiding the kind of regional instability that could threaten economic growth.
 ''The most important thing for the two countries is to create a favorable environment, a peaceful environment for development in the long term,'' said Sun Shihai, a South Asia specialist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ''So both sides are trying to make their policies more pragmatic toward each other.''
 China and India are the world's fastest-growing major economies, though China is easily the more dominant. Its annual trade with India remains only fraction of its trade with Europe, Japan and the United States. But China-India trade is growing rapidly. When President Hu Jintao of China visited India in 2006, the countries pledged to double trade to $40 billion by 2010 -- a goal they nearly reached last year and are likely to surpass this year. 
 Both sides are expected to continue the trade push this week. Mr. Singh is bringing a large business delegation and is keen to correct a trade imbalance tipping in China's favor.
 Mr. Singh will spend his entire trip in Beijing and is scheduled to address China's leading government research institute. He will be honored at a private dinner given by Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and will meet with Mr. Hu. 
 ''China attaches great importance to Prime Minister Singh's visit and hopes to deepen the traditional friendship between the two countries,'' said Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. 
 In New Delhi, senior Indian officials lowered expectations for any breakthroughs. They said the agenda was loaded with items based on old grievances and new challenges. 
 The border dispute includes competing land claims over the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. But a senior Indian official said Mr. Singh expected little progress because China is never inclined to use high-level visits to negotiate details. Officials in New Delhi offered a measured response to reports that China was rapidly building infrastructure near the disputed border.
 ''As of now, we are comfortable with our relations with China,'' Shiv Shankar Menon, the Indian foreign secretary, said Friday. ''We are both successful in maintaining peace and tranquillity along the border.''
 Water is a growing bilateral concern, and the countries have established a joint committee to study the flow of rivers that originate in Tibet and flow into the Indian hills and plains. On issues of energy security, terrorism and climate change, the Indians see a confluence of interests, if not identical objectives.
 Pakistan, India's old rival and China's equally old ally, is also on the agenda because both sides are concerned about political turmoil across that country. 
 ''Both of us want this entire area to be peaceful and stable so we can get on with our lives, whether it's China's periphery or our periphery,'' a senior Indian official who was not authorized to speak on matters of strategic delicacy said last week,
 One of India's biggest concerns is whether China will, even reluctantly, support India's bid to buy nuclear technology. The Bush administration has opened that door, but the request is subject to approval by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The Indian official said he did not expect China to actively block India's ambitions. ''I'm not saying they're happy with it, not at all,'' the official said. ''They won't be the ones to stand up.''
 Meanwhile, China is expected to push India to further open itself to Chinese investment and business interests. China's telecommunications giant, Huawei, has hit snags in India, while China has complained about Indian laws devised to protect domestic industries from competition. 
 Economic competition is inevitable as India is rapidly expanding its manufacturing base -- China's strength -- while China is trying to move its economy toward the service and high-tech industries at the center of India's economic expansion. China's rising military capacity has alarmed Washington, which entered into a strategic dialogue with Japan and Australia in 2002. Proposals that India join that group of Pacific Rim democracies instantly attracted concern in Beijing.
 Last week, Mr. Singh told reporters in New Delhi that those proposals ''never got going.'' Last year, India and China had joint military exercises for the first time. Michael J. Green, former director of Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said the United States was not discouraging warmer relations between India and China, but noted that tensions remained. He said China was quietly trying to oppose the United States-India nuclear deal and objected to including India on the United Nations Security Council. ''Beneath the surface, the Indians are very strategically wary of China,'' said Mr. Green, who teaches at Georgetown University.
 China and India are increasingly playing roles in what have been each other's backyards. New Delhi has been courting Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Singapore, just as China's role is growing in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
 Han Hua, an associate professor of international studies at Peking University in Beijing, said those underlying tensions were why China and India wanted to establish a broader spirit of cooperation to carry the relationship beyond specific grievances. She said the countries want to defy an old Chinese proverb, which holds that two tigers cannot share the same mountain.
 ''The two countries want to show the world that they can get along,'' she said.

 Iraq Passes a Benchmark
 The Iraqi Parliament passed a bill, expected to be approved into law, that would allow some former officials from Saddam Hussein's party to apply for government positions, in the first of the so-called political benchmark measures to pass after months of American pressure. President Bush said that in order to consolidate progress in the country in the past year, he was prepared to slow or even halt further American troop reductions in Iraqr, setting the stage renewed political debate over the war. 1

 President Nicolas Sarkozy of France has revived a practice that allows government officials to hold more than one elected office, as a way to expand his government's influence. 3 
 Poverty Persists in China
 China has moved more people out of poverty than any other country in recent decades, but the persistence of destitution in places like southern Henan Province, a mere province away from the new wealth of the booming coast, fits with the findings of a recent World Bank study that suggests that there are still 300 million poor in China -- three times as many as the bank previously estimated. 4

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, left, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today for a three-day visit to China, with each country eager to increase bilateral trade, promote friendship and offer reassurances that Asia is big enough to accommodate both rising powers. 10 
 Blocks for Afghan Police
 Many of the problems frustrating Afghanistan's efforts to secure its dangerous eastern and southern provinces were evident in the bizarre tour of duty of Shair Mohammad, a police officer who spent 18 months in an isolated swath of steppe without a rank, money for food or enough clothing and gear to operate in cold weather. 8

HEADLINE: No Lack of Curiosity, or Civility, at Corzine's First Forum on Toll Proposal

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: LIVINGSTON, N.J. 

 BODY:
One person blurted out that Gov. Jon S. Corzine should raise the gas tax. Another yelled that New Jersey's biggest yoke was its overabundance of elected officials.
 But surprisingly, those were the exceptions rather than the rule on Saturday, when Mr. Corzine convened his first town hall meeting on his plan to drastically increase tolls in order to pay off billions of dollars in debt and maintain the state's bridges and highways.
 More than 900 people showed up for the meeting at Livingston High School, prompting organizers to use another room for overflow. And while many people expressed qualms, the atmosphere was generally deferential throughout the two-hour meeting. 
 ''I'm surprised there was less anger,'' said David Shulman, a semi-retired economist from Berkeley Heights who believes that the plan asks too much of toll-road drivers. ''People were more polite and tame. But he did a good job, and there's no question he's a professional.''
 If Mr. Corzine could bottle the reaction in Livingston and replicate it 20 times over the next two months, then he would have reason to feel cautiously upbeat that residents will at least listen seriously to his ideas, and perhaps even support them.
 Then again, Mr. Corzine was not exactly in hostile territory, since Livingston, which leans Democratic, is an affluent and educated community in Essex County. Perhaps more interesting, based on the hometowns of those who managed to ask questions, and the observations of longtime residents, was that most people were from out of town, coming from places like Sparta, in the northwest corner of the state, and Freehold, in its midsection.
 One-third of the 21 people who asked questions, in fact, used the occasion to ask Mr. Corzine about subjects other than the toll roads, with the new school financing formula being the most common.
 Mr. Corzine began the meeting with a 46-minute PowerPoint presentation, detailing the state's financial problems and offering unpalatable options to fix those problems, like increasing the income tax by 20 percent or the sales tax by 30 percent.
 A third idea, to increase the gas tax 45 to 50 cents a gallon, prompted one person to say, ''That you should do!''
 That brought Mr. Corzine to the fourth option -- his plan. Tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City Expressway would be increased by a maximum of 50 percent four times in 12 years -- in 2010, 2014, 2018 and 2022 -- and also would be adjusted for inflation. A portion of a fourth highway, Route 440, would become a toll road. Toll increases would continue to be indexed for inflation until 2085.
 A nonprofit corporation set up by the state to replace the New Jersey Turnpike Authority would issue bonds secured by future toll revenues that would generate up to $38 billion. Those billions, in turn, would halve the state's debt of $32 billion and inject money into the Transportation Trust Fund, which is nearly depleted, for road and bridge repairs and other projects. 
 Mr. Corzine noted that there would be discounts to frequent users of the toll roads, and that more than half of the New Jersey Turnpike's revenues came from out-of-state drivers. But he acknowledged that truckers and other commercial users of the toll roads would probably eventually pass along some of the added costs to consumers.
 ''Everyone is going to end up paying some of the toll hikes,'' he said.
 Some people asked Mr. Corzine whether he would consider scaling back his plan, and mixing in modest tax increases. But Mr. Corzine -- who pushed through a penny increase in the sales tax in 2006 to plug a budget deficit -- said that few legislators would have the stomach for more.
 After the meeting, Peter Humphreys, a securities lawyer who is the founder of a new citizens' watchdog group, Save Our Assets NJ, said that he felt that Mr. Corzine was ''trying to scare people a little bit,'' and that questions on the fine print of the proposal remained unanswered.
 ''I thought he did very well, but I don't think he's answered the concerns we have,'' said Mr. Humphreys, who lives in nearby Millburn.

HEADLINE: Haven't We Heard This Voice Before?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
SHE had me at ''Well, that hurts my feelings.''
 One cliche about Hillary Clinton is true. For whatever reason -- and it's no crime -- the spontaneous, outgoing person who impresses those who meet her offstage often evaporates when she steps into the public spotlight. But in the crucial debate before the New Hampshire primary, the private Clinton popped out for the first time in the 2008 campaign. She parried a male inquisitor's questioning of her likability by being, of all things, likable.
 Not only did Mrs. Clinton betray some (but not too many) hurt feelings with genuine humor, she upped the ante by flattering Barack Obama as ''very likable.'' Which prompted the Illinois senator to match Mrs. Clinton's most human moment to date with the most inhuman of his own. To use family-newspaper language, he behaved like a jerk -- or, to be more precise, like Rick Lazio, the now-forgotten adversary who cleared Mrs. Clinton's path to the Senate by boorishly waving a paper in her face during a 2000 debate. 
 Mr. Obama's grudging ''You're likable enough, Hillary'' made him look like ''an ex-husband that was turning over the alimony check,'' in the formulation of Paul Begala, a Clinton backer. The moment stood in stark contrast to Mr. Obama's behavior in the corresponding debate just before the Iowa caucuses. There he raised his head high to defend Joe Biden's honor when Mr. Biden was questioned about his tic of spouting racial malapropisms.
 Whatever the precise impact of the incessant video replays of Mr. Obama's condescension or of Mrs. Clinton's later quasi tears, Tuesday's vote speaks for itself. In her 2.6 percentage-point, 7,500-vote victory, Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Obama among women voters by 12 percentage points only five days after he carried them by 5 points in Iowa. As we reopen the gender wars, let's not forget that it's 2008, not 1968. There are actually some men who are offended by sexist male behavior too. Or by the female misogyny exemplified by the South Carolina woman who asked John McCain in November, ''How do we beat the bitch?''
 And so an exciting and healthy mano-a-mano battle for the Democratic presidential nomination is finally on. (The biggest losers in New Hampshire's primary, no one need be reminded, were pollsters and the press.) But if Mrs. Clinton prompted many to give her candidacy a fresh look in the New Hampshire stretch, her victory speech was, to skeptics like myself, a step back. When she talked about how ''the process'' prompted her to find her ''own voice,'' I had to ask the same question Clinton fans ask of Mr. Obama: where's the beef? Though her campaign gave Madeleine Albright and Wesley Clark the hook and replaced them with a backdrop of youthful eye candy on Tuesday night, Mrs. Clinton soon retreated into the same old pro forma Clinton talking points, nominally updated from the 1990s.
 Voice is not merely a matter of presenting a softer persona, speaking eloquently, looking authentic on television, cracking jokes or shedding tears -- worthwhile attributes for any candidate, including Mr. Obama. Voice is also about content, and in this election, content may yet be king. Though gender, race, age and likability are all factors, the fundamentals of what the public is looking for in the presidential marketplace remains more stable than our economy week after week.
 As Mrs. Clinton would say, let's have a reality check. The exit poll of those who voted on Tuesday -- not to be confused with the pre-primary polls that misfired -- showed that Democrats are still looking for change (54 percent) over experience (19 percent) and that they overwhelmingly associate Mr. Obama with the former and Mrs. Clinton with the latter. By change, they don't mean merely a tuneup. As the Wall Street Journal-NBC News survey of both Democrats and Republicans found last month, the percentage of voters who favor ''small adjustments'' in America (24) or ''moderate corrections'' (29) is swamped by the 46 percent who seek ''major reforms'' and a ''brand-new'' approach. 
 In Tuesday's exit polling, half of Republican voters said even they'd had enough of President Bush. That's why ''change'' the word, if not the deed, keeps proliferating in both parties like kudzu. In last weekend's twin ABC debates, Mr. Obama's 14 invocations of ''change'' or ''changes'' were surpassed by Mrs. Clinton's 25 and nearly matched by Mitt Romney's 10. 
 The question for the two top Democrats, whose specific positions on most issues vary only by increments, is who can best convince the country that they can deliver that change. Mr. Obama's powerful speeches alone can't accomplish that, and neither can Mrs. Clinton's born-again vow to make her emotions and campaign appearances more accessible to voters and the press. 
 In the nightmare scenario for their party, they could both fail or take each other out or self-destruct, inducing the public to settle for a Republican who can somehow persuade voters that he's the change agent by default. It behooves Democrats to notice that Mr. McCain's brand as a straight-talking rebel is so strong that even those voters in the New Hampshire G.O.P. primary who don't like Mr. Bush or the Iraq war gave him most of their votes despite his outspoken support of both.
 However unpredictable the race as a whole may be, the vision thing still seems central to the Democrats' change sweepstakes. Whether you regard it as inspirational or pablum, Mr. Obama's vision has been consistent since the 2004 convention speech that introduced him to the country well before his presidential candidacy: a hopeful reconciliation of red and blue Americans joined in a united effort to address and heal the domestic and international cancers that have metastasized during the bitter partisanship of the Bush-Rove years.
 Mrs. Clinton's vision, so far anyway, is exactly the reverse of her opponent's big picture: a long itemized shopping list of government programs (few of which any Democratic candidate would disagree with) that are nakedly targeted to appeal to every Election Day constituency. This presentation of the liberal catechism reached its apotheosis in a Clinton campaign ad in December. Mrs. Clinton was shown doling out Christmas presents labeled ''Universal Health Care'' and ''Alternative Energy'' before delivering the punch line, ''Where did I put universal pre-K?'' (At least she stopped short of regifting us with Al Gore's old ''Social Security lockbox.'')
 Every politician employs pollsters, but Mrs. Clinton, tellingly, has one, Mark Penn, as her top campaign strategist. As Sally Bedell Smith reminds us in her book about the Clintons, ''For Love of Politics,'' it was Mr. Penn who helped shape the 1996 Bill Clinton campaign in which ''soccer moms'' were identified and wooed with such Cracker Jack prizes as school uniforms and V-chips to monitor TV violence. For Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign four years later, it was also Mr. Penn's market testing that, in Ms. Smith's telling, ''crafted anodyne, bite-sized messages for Hillary.'' The overall message uniting the small-bore promises, such as it was, remains unchanged today: competence, experience, wonky proficiency. 
 But we're no longer in 2000, the lull before the 9/11 storm, let alone 1996. Nonetheless, Mr. Penn, who remains the chief executive of the corporate P.R. giant Burson-Marsteller even as he works for the Clinton campaign, still peddles the 1.0 edition of his philosophy. In his business tome ''Microtrends'' published in September, he glories in ''the niching of America,'' observing that ''there is no one America anymore'' but ''hundreds of Americas.'' He postulates that ''Americans overwhelmingly favor small, reasonable ideas over big, grandiose schemes.'' 
 As a theory for marketing Burson-Marsteller corporate clients like Microsoft and AT&T -- or for selling a third Clinton term -- Mr. Penn's vision may make sense. What Mr. Obama is betting on instead is a hunger, however dreamy, for one America, not hundreds of niches, aspiring to the big, grandiose scheme of finding a common good. The defining question of his campaign is not just whether he can make this vision real but whether he has the ability as a leader to give it intellectual heft and to carry it out. We'll find out soon enough. Either way, the national yearning for a more perfect union is unmistakable. Such is the decisive backlash against these divisive years in which anyone who fails to agree with the White House has been portrayed as un-American, if not with the terrorists.
 In Mrs. Clinton's down-to-earth micropolitics, polls often seem to play the leadership role. That leaves her indecisive when one potential market is pitched against another. Witness her equivocation over Iraq, driver's licenses for illegal immigrants and even Cubs vs. Yankees. Add to this habitual triangulation the ugly campaigning of the men around her -- Mr. Penn's sleazy invocation of ''cocaine'' on MSNBC, Bill Clinton's ''fairy tale'' rant falsifying Mr. Obama's record on Iraq -- and you don't have change. You have the acrimonious 1990s that the Republicans are dying to refight, because that's the only real tactic they have.
 It would be good for both her campaign and the presidential race in general if Mrs. Clinton does find her own voice. We'll know she has done so when it doesn't sound so uncannily like Bill Clinton and Mark Penn.

HEADLINE: Last Year's Role Model

BYLINE: By LORRIE MOORE. 
Lorrie Moore, the author of ''Birds of America,'' is a contributor to the forthcoming ''30 Ways of Looking at Hillary: Reflections by Women Writers.''

DATELINE: Madison, Wis. 

 BODY:
 WHEN most of us first laid eyes on Hillary Clinton, it was during ''60 Minutes,'' and she was sitting by her man saying she was not one of those women who would stand by him. Not long after that, she told us she didn't make cookies. At that remark I thought I heard the cheering of nonbaking working women everywhere, but apparently I was wrong, and quickly we the people were favored with Mrs. Clinton's own contrite cookie recipe, which I have not yet had time to try. 
 A decade-and-a-half later, however, working women were back watching Mrs. Clinton in a New Hampshire diner: they saw her eyes well up in what looked like self-pity but what was to those women recognizably the teary, unbidden mist of exhaustion. Sympathy burst forth, even from Barack Obama (he, too, was tired). 
 Still, though we are in the midst of an awful presidency, we should not be taken in by the rosy haze that gets cast over the Clinton White House; they were not years of great accomplishment. Baghdad was strafed and embargoed; Waco was gassed and burned; in all these events, children (Mrs. Clinton's key policy focus) were appallingly killed. 
 While polar ice caps began to melt, Al Gore was left to do who-knows-what, only to regale us later in cineplexes with the consequences of those melting caps, rendering us panicked in our powerlessness. Nafta was signed and the World Trade Organization was created, national health care went nowhere, and by the second term's close, the administration's hope of getting things done had been hijacked by Kenneth Starr and the party dress he had confiscated from someone named Monica Lewinsky. 
 So here comes another Clinton. 
 Does her being a woman make her a special case? Does gender confer meaning on her candidacy? In my opinion, it is a little late in the day to become sentimental about a woman running for president. The political moment for feminine role models, arguably, has passed us by. The children who are suffering in this country, who are having trouble in school, and for whom the murder and suicide rates and economic dropout rates are high, are boys -- especially boys of color, for whom the whole educational system, starting in kindergarten, often feels a form of exile, a system designed by and for white girls. 
 In the progressive Midwestern city where I live, the high school dropout rate for these alienated and written-off boys is alarmingly high. Some are even middle-class, but many are just hanging on, their families torn apart by harsh economics and a merciless criminal justice system. Why does it seem to be the Republicans who are more vocal about reforming our drug laws? Why has no one in the Democratic Party campaigned to have felons who have served their time made full citizens again? Their continued disenfranchisement is a foolhardy strike against these men and their families. 
 Perfect historical timing has always been something of a magic trick -- finite and swift. The train moves out of the station. The time to capture the imagination of middle-class white girls, the group Hillary Clinton represents, was long ago. Such girls have now managed on their own (given that in this economy only the rich are doing well). They have their teachers and many other professionals to admire, as well as a fierce 67-year-old babe as speaker of the House, several governors and a Supreme Court justice. The landscape is not bare. 
 Boys are faring worse -- and the time for symbols and leaders they can connect with beneficially should be now and should be theirs. Hillary Clinton's gender does not rescue society from that -- instead she serves as a kind of nostalgia for a time when it might have. Only her policies are what matter now, and here -- despite some squabbling and bad advice that has caused her to ''go negative'' -- the Democrats largely agree. But inspiration is essential for living, and Mr. Obama holds the greater fascination for our children. 
 Mr. Obama came of age as a black man in America. He does not need (as he has done) to invoke his grandfather's life in colonial Kenya to prove or authenticate his understanding of race. His sturdiness is equal to Mrs. Clinton's, his plans as precise and humane. But unlike her, he is original and of the moment. He embodies, at the deepest levels, the bringing together of separate worlds. The sexes have always lived together, but the races have not. His candidacy is minted profoundly in that expropriated word ''change.'' 
 Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's scripted air of expectation might make one welcome any zeitgeisty parvenu. Her ''35 years of experience'' puzzle in their math. Like Rudolph Giuliani, who wants to keep voters safe from terrorism though his own mayoral bunker was beneath the World Trade Center, Mrs. Clinton wants kudos for the disaster of her failed national health plan. She counts heavily her eight years in the White House. Well, then, she's already been there! Good for her. Next?

HEADLINE: Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee as Old Guard Balks

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Much of the national leadership of the Christian conservative movement has turned a cold shoulder to the Republican presidential campaign of Mike Huckabee, wary of his populist approach to economic issues and his criticism of the Bush administration's foreign policy. But that has only fired up Brett and Alex Harris.
 The Harris brothers, 19-year-old evangelical authors and speakers who grew up steeped in the conservative Christian movement, are the creators of Huck's Army, an online network that has connected 12,000 Huckabee campaign volunteers, including several hundred in Michigan, which votes Tuesday, and South Carolina, which votes Saturday.
 They say they like Mr. Huckabee for the same reason many of their elders do not: ''He reaches outside the normal Republican box,'' Brett Harris said in an interview from his home near Portland, Ore. 
 The brothers fell for Mr. Huckabee last August when they saw him draw applause on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' for explaining that he believed in a Christian obligation to care for prenatal ''life'' and also education, health care, jobs and other aspects of ''life.'' ''It is a new kind of evangelical conservative position,'' Brett Harris said. Alex Harris added, ''And we are not going to have to be embarrassed about him.''
 Mr. Huckabee, who was a Southern Baptist minister before serving as governor of Arkansas, is the only candidate in the presidential race who identifies himself as an evangelical. But instead of uniting conservative Christians, his candidacy is threatening to drive a wedge into the movement, potentially dividing its best-known national leaders from part of their base and upending assumptions that have held the right wing together for the last 30 years.
 His singular style -- Christian traditionalism and the common-man populism of William Jennings Bryan, leavened by an affinity for bass guitar and late-night comedy shows -- has energized many young and working-class evangelicals. Their support helped his shoestring campaign come from nowhere to win the Iowa Republican caucus and join the front-runners in Michigan, South Carolina and national polls. 
 And Mr. Huckabee has done it without the backing of, and even over the opposition of, the movement's most visible leaders, many of whom have either criticized him or endorsed other candidates. 
 ''Some of them have been openly hostile to him, and others merely lukewarm in their hostility,'' said John Green, a scholar with the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
 If Mr. Huckabee can continue to galvanize evangelicals around his novel message while attracting other Republicans and perhaps independents, he will do more than advance his own campaign. He will also challenge the establishment of the Christian conservative political movement. 
 ''To the extent that Governor Huckabee succeeds in advancing this new agenda that combines cultural conservatism with an economic and foreign affairs populism,'' Mr. Green said, ''it could undermine the existing Christian conservative political leaders and their organizations.'' 
 After Iowa, many evangelical political leaders hailed Mr. Huckabee's victory as a resurgence. ''Not bad for a supposed bunch of demoralized, depressed, disillusioned and disengaged Reaganites,'' James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family said in a statement. 
 But Dr. Dobson and most of his allies stopped short of commending Mr. Huckabee in particular, and Tony Perkins, president of the Dobson-affiliated Family Research Council, almost seemed to explain away the victory. 
 ''What happened in Iowa was a strong reaction from social conservatives to the idea that the Republican establishment was pushing Rudy Giuliani, who is anathema'' because of his support for abortion rights, Mr. Perkins said. ''What we saw in Iowa was a shootout between the core evangelical base and the G.O.P. establishment, and unfortunately I think Mitt Romney got caught in the cross-fire.''
 While Dr. Dobson and Mr. Perkins remain on the sidelines, many in the old guard are actively backing Mr. Huckabee's rivals: Pat Robertson is for Mr. Giuliani, Gary Bauer for Fred D. Thompson, and Paul Weyrich, a founder of the movement, for Mr. Romney. The few national conservative Christian political advocates who have rallied to Mr. Huckabee say they are dismayed by the reluctance of their best-known leaders to do the same. 
 ''Some of my Christian friends, just like some of my not-so-Christian friends, have become a little too Washingtonian,'' said Rick Scarborough, an aspiring successor to the previous generation of conservative Christian leaders. He recently argued that his allies were wrong to balk at Mr. Huckabee's turn toward environmentalism and ''social justice.'' 
 ''Can you imagine Jesus ignoring the plight of the disenfranchised and downtrodden while going after the abortionist?'' Mr. Scarborough wrote on the conservative Web site WorldNetDaily.com.
 But the lack of enthusiasm at the top of the movement has not deterred hundreds of grass-roots activists in Michigan and South Carolina who, like the Harrises, are trying to make up for the Huckabee campaign's lack of organization and resources. 
 In Michigan, the Huckabee campaign had spent no money, hired no staff and had no office until last Wednesday, six days before the primary. But Gary Glenn, a conservative Christian advocate based in Midland, Mich., has been leading an informal effort to turn out evangelical voters. Some pollsters expect them to make up as much as 40 percent of the state's primary voters this year. 
 Last week, Mr. Glenn lined up 50 local pastors to attend a closed-door breakfast with Mr. Huckabee in Grand Rapids. And he has compiled an e-mail list of more than 600 volunteers -- many in Internet groups that Huck's Army is connecting -- who have been using church directories to make phone calls, courting local pastors and leafleting church parking lots . 
 ''Recruit volunteers to stand this Sunday on public sidewalks across the street from the parking lots of the biggest evangelical churches you can find,'' Mr. Glenn urged in a recent e-mail message.
 Mr. Glenn said Mr. Huckabee's populist side had also provided him with some unusual allies: the International Association of Machinists has endorsed him. Its state membership is estimated to be one-third Republican. Because of a scheduling dispute, there is no competition in the Democratic primary in Michigan this year, and voters can cast their ballot in either party's contest. 
 Huckabee volunteers are also working hard to court Catholics in Michigan, said Jeffrey Quesnelle, a 20-year-old conservative Catholic who is now the Michigan coordinator for Huck's Army. (The Harris brothers have signed up state coordinators in 45 states.) Among other things, Mr. Quesnelle said, volunteers have been distributing copies of articles from the Web site Catholic Online, a hub for dedicated church members, praising Mr. Huckabee's opposition to abortion rights and his empathy for the poor as consistent with the social teachings of the church. 
 Mr. Huckabee's candidacy could signal ''the fall of the old 'religious right' and the emergence of a true populist movement which crosses the old, tired lines and labels,'' a Catholic Online column recently said. 
 In South Carolina, a make-or-break state for Mr. Huckabee and one where evangelicals are expected to make up more than a third of the Republican primary voters, the Huckabee campaign had only a state manager and two paid staff members until about two weeks ago. 
 But more than 500 people, many of them young evangelicals, have signed up for online Huckabee meet-up groups, said Christian Hine, 30, the state coordinator of the Huck's Army effort. Unaided by the campaign, volunteers have borrowed church directories and bought their own phone lists to try to identify likely Huckabee voters, Mr. Hine said, and even paid to print their own Huckabee signs when the campaign ran out.
 In November, volunteers associated with Huck's Army raised about $1,550 to hire a plane towing a ''Huckabee for President -- HucksArmy.com'' banner to circle over the South Carolina-Clemson football game, one of the biggest sporting events in the state. (Among other endeavors, members of the group also pitched in about $500 to buy pizza, balloons and doughnuts for Huckabee volunteers before the Iowa caucus.)
 ''Huckabee is a change for the conservative Christian movement, and a welcome one,'' said Jennifer Stec, a 34-year-old homemaker in Lexington, S.C., who built a network of about 400 Huckabee volunteers. She started with her church Sunday school class, she said, and later printed her own Huckabee business cards and passed them out at the supermarket. 
 Alice Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. Huckabee, said the campaign ''would love to have the support of the generals'' of the Christian conservative movement, ''but we are more than happy to have the support of the troops, and that seems to be what is happening here.'' Ms. Stewart said the Harris brothers were especially ''instrumental,'' pointing out that they helped enlist the actor Chuck Norris, who now accompanies Mr. Huckabee on the trail. 
 Since Mr. Huckabee's success in Iowa, however, his campaign has faced a barrage of attacks on his conservative credentials. Rush Limbaugh has accused him of ''class warfare.'' The Wall Street Journal editorial page has called him ''religious left.'' And his Republican rivals have escalated their criticism. In a debate on Thursday, Mr. Thompson called Mr. Huckabee a ''Christian leader'' who would support ''liberal economic policies'' and ''liberal foreign policies.'' 
 Mr. Huckabee insists that he is conservative on those issues, saying that he has pledged not to raise taxes and that he lowered many in Arkansas. His advisers say his populism will attract enough disaffected middle-class Republicans to make up for any hawkish or antitax votes he loses. 
 But some Christian conservatives say that no matter the energy at their grass roots, the animosity of their secular allies may well doom his campaign.
 Richard Land, the top public policy official of the Southern Baptist Convention, argued that just as small-government and foreign-policy conservatives could not win a primary without evangelicals, ''I don't think evangelicals can win without most of the rest of those coalitions.''

HEADLINE: A Tale of Teaching in China

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''1977 Exam Opened Escape Route Into China's Elite'' (news article, Jan. 6): 
I taught modern American and British literature to some of those gifted students in Wuhan, China, from 1979 to 1981. I can attest to their talents and determination, and I am not surprised that they now have positions of influence throughout the nation. 
 Many of those students were taught by worker-peasant-soldiers turned teachers, young people assigned to academic posts during the Cultural Revolution for political, not academic, reasons. 
 And although many of those young teachers were smart and savvy, they generally did not have the intellectual capacities of the class of '77 students. This caused tension and jealousy, and I would assume that those tensions still manifest themselves in generational strife behind the scenes of political and economic power.
 Furthermore, by 1978, examinations for college entrance were no longer open to everyone. It was back to normal. Aspirants had to get permission from the leaders of their work units to apply, which meant that students of the elite invariably got the first shot. 
 Many of those students of '78 and onward were capable, but the democratic door to opportunity was closed. I wonder what the impact of that continues to be on China and its growing divisions among the rural, the urban, the elite and the majority.

HEADLINE: Letters: The Globalization Train

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Unlike Alan Blinder in ''Stop the World (And Avoid Reality)'' (Economic View, Jan. 6), I have no problem with America's loss of faith in globalization. 
Sure, unemployment is currently at historically low levels, but flipping burgers at a fast-food restaurant is small compensation for a former steel worker whose job migrated to China. And funding a welfare program to cushion the economic pain is simply gratuitous paternalism. Under globalization, the rich have become much richer -- much as they did in the 1920s. It's time to make a change before another Depression engulfs America and the world.

HEADLINE: Pity the Professionals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Alex Williams's ''Falling-Down Professions'' (Sunday Styles, Jan. 6) was entertaining but missed a point regarding the creative nature of medicine.
I am a general internist. My sister is a consultant. We probably spend equal amounts of our day engaged in creative thought. Doctors are problem-solvers in much the same way consultants have to be: examining an issue (cluster of symptoms), diagnosing the problem (illness) and designing a plan to help rectify the situation (treat or perhaps cure disease). 
 I don't suffer from a lack of creativity in my day; I suffer from being overburdened by silly and uncompensated paperwork, much like the doctor quoted in the article who had to fill out requisition forms for new tires for his patient's wheelchair. 
 If consultants had to start writing several letters a day to companies in order to justify their suggestions (on their own time, for free), and then be told their letters weren't good enough and they needed to rewrite them, consulting, too, would lose some of its luster. DAWN HARRIS, M.D.
 Brookline, Mass.
 To the Editor:
 The demand for competent, highly trained physicians is rapidly outgrowing the supply across all specialties. That means that the hedge fund traders who chose finance over a career in medicine will soon have a difficult time finding excellent doctors to care for their families. 
 That means doctors could be packaged as securities that would be traded on a commodities exchange. As the doctors' value increases, the traders can at least make more money, even though they can't find an obstetrician to deliver their children.
 ANTHONY PROVENZANO, M.D.
 Bronxville, N.Y.
 To the Editor:
 When I chose to become a lawyer, I knew long hours and hard work would yield uncertain results. Social status was not on the menu; lawyers I know who have it inherited it from their families, not from their profession.
 To confirm this, all I have to do is read the hate mail that ensues every time my firm represents an indigent defendant. The fierce hostility toward the concept of ''innocent until proved guilty'' and toward the law profession in general and defense attorneys in particular can be overwhelming.
 Anyone who thinks a law career will be the path to social status would do well to readjust that thinking. PRICE QUENIN
 New Orleans
 To the Editor:
 I read ''The Falling-Down Professions'' with resigned bemusement. As a practicing primary care physician for 25 years, with a son in law school who has secured a job in New York that guarantees him at least $200,000, I don't think the comparison between professions is accurate. 
 To illustrate: a well-dressed patient recently stood at my front desk holding a cup of Starbucks coffee that must have cost $6, while explaining to my receptionist that he did not have $5 for his co-pay. I told him to hand over his coffee and I would consider the matter settled. I can't imagine that in a few years my son will be asking his client to hand over his Rolex. DAVID BLEEKER, M.D.
 Hackensack, N.J.
 To the Editor: 
 While ''The Falling-Down Professions'' cataloged a number of the reasons that doctors are increasingly frustrated, it missed perhaps the key economic issue: debt. 
 Medical training lasts a minimum of 7 years, and for surgeons and medical subspecialists it may be 10 or more years. Barring wealthy parents, a student entering college today might expect to accrue a half-million dollars in loans and interest before entering practice. Imagine being 30 years old, with no assets, no pension, a beat-up car and no savings -- and several thousand dollars of monthly interest payments. It doesn't take a business degree to figure out why medical training could be a bad deal. 
 NATHAN K. COBB, M.D.
 Boston
 To the Editor:
 ''The Falling-Down Professions'' decries the loss of status and job satisfaction among lawyers and doctors, but elevates those in the consulting and investment banking industries.
 As someone who interned in the consulting field as an undergraduate but is now in medical school, I recall my consulting experience as lucrative but full of long days spent in cubicles and doing work that provided little more for me than money. (As for investment banking, everyone I know who has done it gets burned out within a few years and has to quit.) 
 Up to my teeth in books and working long hours, I can tell you that I have little doubt about the choice I made.

HEADLINE: It's the Economy, Stup ... Jan. 6 - 12

 BODY:
THE NEWS President Bush acknowledged that the nation faced ''economic challenges'' because of rising oil prices, the home mortgage crisis and a weakening job market.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Bush's remarks to business leaders were a marked shift from his usual upbeat economic assessments. While the president argued that the economy's fundamentals remained strong, he acknowledged that ''many Americans are anxious'' and that ''jobs are growing at a slower pace.'' Both the White House and Congressional Democrats are evaluating whether tax cuts may be needed to stimulate the economy. ''We cannot take growth for granted,'' Mr. Bush said. 
THE NEWS The economy was the issue that mattered most to New Hampshire primary voters, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Thirty-eight percent of Democrats and 31 percent of Republicans cited the economy as the most important issue facing the country, ahead of the war in Iraq. Among those Democrats, 44 percent voted for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton; 41 percent of those Republicans sided with Senator John McCain. The concern in both parties was broad and deep. Ninety-seven percent of Democrats and 80 percent of Republicans said they were very worried or somewhat worried about the economy.
 THE NEWS Goldman Sachs, the global investment bank, predicted a recession this year and said the Federal Reserve would respond by cutting interest rates.
 BEHIND THE NEWS In a note to investors, the bank's economists said they had been concerned for months that problems in the housing and credit markets would lead to an ''outright'' recession. ''The latest data suggest that recession has now arrived, or will very shortly,'' they said. The forecast echoed one from Merrill Lynch last week that said that the new jobless numbers ''strongly suggested'' a recession had arrived. Goldman's economists said the recession should be mild, not exceeding three economic quarters.
 THE NEWS The chairman of the Federal Reserve sent a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank would lower interest rates again this month as it attempts to stave off a recession.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The downturns in the credit and housing markets pose substantial risks to the nation's economic health, Ben S. Bernanke warned in a speech, and he predicted that consumer spending and overall economic growth would slow. But Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was prepared ''to take substantive additional action as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks.'' His remarks lifted expectations of another rate cut this month. 
 THE NEWS Stock markets plummeted on Friday as losses from subprime home loans struck two major financial companies, reigniting fears of tightened credit.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Investors have worried that ailing banks will pull back on issuing loans to businesses and consumers, slowing the nation's economic engine in the process. Those concerns were reinforced with news that Merrill Lynch was expected to take a $15 billion write-down on soured mortgage-backed securities, and that American Express would set aside millions to cover bad loans. The Dow Jones industrials fell 1.9 percent, capping a 5 percent swoon since the start of the year.

HEADLINE: Three Seafaring Queens Spend a Day in New York

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; C. J. Hughes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Deborah D'Ambrosi can recite with ease the weight of each of the Queens -- Elizabeth 2, Mary 2 and Victoria, which are among the world's most luxurious ocean liners. And she came all the way from her landlocked hometown, Olney, Ill., on Sunday just to see ''the three girls,'' as she called them. 
 She watched as the liners sailed side by side through New York Harbor and past the Statue of Liberty, under a cascade of fireworks. 
 ''It might be freezing tonight, but I get lots of warmth from this historic experience,'' Ms. D'Ambrosi, 48, said as she stood in Battery Park City, a camera dangling from her wrist.
 In the annals of maritime history, the Queens' sailing was momentous. It was the first time in the 168-year history of the Cunard Line, the owner of the liners, that it had three ships named after British queens in the same port at the same time. The company arranged the ships' schedules so that they departed from New York City ports simultaneously.
 The Queens' meeting, witnessed by thousands on shore and on board, will also be their last, company officials said.
 ''They are not programmed to meet in any other port,'' Cunard's president, Carol Marlow, said during an afternoon news conference at Pier 88 in Manhattan, with the docked Queen Victoria visible in background. ''This is a spine-tingling time.''
 The Queen Elizabeth 2, Cunard's longest-serving ship, left Manhattan for its 26th and final around-the-world journey -- a farewell tour that will usher in its retirement in November, when the liner will become a floating hotel in Dubai. The Queen Victoria, which came into service last month, embarked on its maiden world cruise. And the Queen Mary 2, the largest trans-Atlantic liner ever built, weighing about 151,400 gross tons, sailed to the Caribbean from the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.
 For 40 years, the Queen Elizabeth 2 ruled the trans-Atlantic, ferrying up to 1,778 passengers at a time between England and the United States. The Queen Mary 2, which carries up to 2,600 passengers, began traveling the same route in 2004, but in reverse: When the Queen Elizabeth 2 left its home port in Southampton, England, for Manhattan, the Queen Mary 2 would leave the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook for Southampton, said Peter Knego, co-editor of a Web site, maritimematters.com, devoted to the history of passenger ships.
 ''They would only meet in the Atlantic and were never in port together,'' Mr. Knego said. ''To have the two of them here, plus a third Queen, is truly momentous.''
 It took Cunard two years to prepare for the occasion. The company had to plan each of the ship's itineraries to make sure the vessels would converge in New York on the same day and to reserve space in the terminals to allow them to dock and depart at the same time.
 The plans had to be approved by several agencies, including the New York Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Coast Guard and the city's Economic Development Corporation. In addition, 4,000 workers had to be on hand to help thousands of passengers disembark and then usher new ones aboard, said Brian O'Connor, Cunard's director of public relations. 
 The ships passed by the Statue of Liberty just after 8 p.m., with the Queen Mary 2 leading the way and the Queen Victoria second. Freezing rain was falling, but several hundred people remained at Battery Park to watch the ships and a 14-minute fireworks display.
 There was one unexpected element: the rough weather over the Atlantic, which threatened to delay the arrival of the Queen Victoria and throw the day's schedule into disarray. The Queen Victoria, which can carry 2,014 passengers, and the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's fastest passenger ship, left Southampton together on Jan. 6 and for the first part of their journey plowed through choppy seas and waves that swelled to 40 feet, passengers said.
 ''On the second day, we were quite bad, very seasick,'' said Laura Browning, 51, of Manchester, England, who sailed to New York with her husband, Steve, aboard the Queen Victoria. 
 Brigid LeRiche, 52, who is from Bath, England, and was also on the Queen Victoria, said, ''The crew distributed some tablets to those of us who felt sick.
 ''We call them 'joy riders' in the U.K.,'' Mrs. LeRiche said of the tablets. ''They make you feel really good, especially with some Bacardi and Coke.''
 The weather eventually calmed, and the Queen Elizabeth 2 and the Queen Victoria entered the harbor at 5:30 a.m., joining the Queen Mary 2, which had arrived from the Caribbean.
 The Queen Victoria has a two-deck library that contains more than 60,000 books and a theater with private boxes. There are no rock-climbing walls or pools with waves in any of the ships; life on board is about sipping a glass of Champagne on the deck and twirling to the sound of a live orchestra in the ballroom. 
 Sunday night, the Queen Victoria left New York carrying 3,000 bottles of Champagne and more than 2,000 lobsters, ''all of which,'' Ms. Marlow said, ''are expected to be consumed before the end of the month.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Monday about the simultaneous departure of three luxury ocean liners -- the Queen Mary 2, the Queen Elizabeth 2 and the Queen Victoria -- from New York Harbor misstated the context of a quotation from Peter Knego, co-editor of a Web site devoted to the history of passenger ships. When Mr. Knego said, ''They would only meet in the Atlantic and were never in port together,'' he was referring to the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth -- not their successors. (The Queen Mary 2 and the Queen Elizabeth 2 were both in port in New York in 2004.)

HEADLINE: Ford and Chrysler Unveil Their Redesigned Pickups

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Cowboys and live cattle took over downtown on Sunday as Ford Motor and Chrysler heralded new versions of their all-important pickup trucks at the 2008 North American International Auto Show.
 Chrysler literally stopped traffic with a cattle drive of 120 Texas longhorns that escorted the next-generation Dodge Ram pickup through the streets to the convention site. The steer were the talk of the auto show, and people lined up outside the Cobo Center and stood four rows deep at windows inside to watch the longhorns saunter down the street.
 Ford brought country-western star Toby Keith to the unveiling of its F-150, which was the top-selling vehicle in the United States last year despite a 13 percent drop in sales. Ford particularly needs a hit with the latest F-150, which has held the top-selling position in the United States for 26 consecutive years. 
 Over all, sales of big pickups fell 6 percent last year amid higher gasoline prices and a slowdown in housing starts. The number of consumers who bought pickups solely for personal use has declined substantially, leaving a core mostly buyers in construction, farming and other industries.
 ''It's a terrible time to be launching a new pickup in the current market conditions,'' said Rebecca Lindland, director of United States automotive research at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. ''But these trucks are hugely important to Ford and Chrysler, and where they make a lot of their money.''
 Ms. Lindland said that her firm projected a 10 percent decline in the pickup market this year, to 2 million units from 2.2 million last year. She estimated that automakers earn $5,000 to $10,000 on each pickup sold.
 The automakers are hoping that economic conditions will improve by the time they introduce the pickups this fall. Both Ford and Chrysler promised that their new trucks would offer better fuel economy, more utility and more creature comforts.
 ''We know if we want to stand out from the rest of the herd we have to listen to our customers and give them what they want,'' said James E. Press, Chrysler's vice chairman and top product strategist.
 For Chrysler, which was acquired last August by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, the Dodge Ram is the top-selling vehicle, accounting for about 17 percent of total United States sales. Last year, Ram sales dipped 2 percent despite heavy incentives and sales promotions; Chrysler has packed the new Ram with improvements like heated seats and extra storage compartments.
 For Ford, the stakes in the pickup market are particularly high. Last year, Toyota passed Ford as No. 2 in overall United States vehicle sales, edging closer to the leader, General Motors. While Ford executives played down the significance of falling behind Toyota, there is no minimizing the importance of the pickup to Ford. 
 The revamping of the F-150 is Ford's first total redesign of its flagship vehicle since 2004; Ford's F-Series accounted for 26 percent of its domestic vehicle sales in 2007. 
 ''The Ford F-150 is an American icon,'' said Mark Fields, president of Ford's North American unit. ''Ford is the truck leader, and F-150 customers expect and demand the best truck on the market.''
 The automaker has made the vehicle roomier on the inside and added a striking three-bar grille. Ford also cut the weight of the chassis, partly to improve fuel economy by 1 percent. 
 Over all, Ford is offering the F-150 in 35 configurations, including one with 10-way leather chairs, brushed aluminum trim and embroidered logos.
 The trucks face staunch competition from G.M.'s Silverado and Sierra models, as well as models from Toyota and Nissan.

HEADLINE: Wallets Thick and Thin Seem to Be Closing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and LOUIS UCHITELLE; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Strong evidence is emerging that consumer spending, a bulwark against recession over the last year even as energy prices surged and the housing market sputtered, has begun to slow sharply at every level of the American economy, from the working class to the wealthy.
 The abrupt pullback raises the possibility that the country may be experiencing a rare decline in personal consumption, not just a slower rate of growth. Such a decline would be the first since 1991, and it would almost certainly push the entire economy into a recession in the middle of an election year.
 There are mounting anecdotal signs that beginning in December Americans cut back significantly on personal consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy.
 A raft of consumer companies -- high-end stores like Nordstrom and Tiffany, and middle-of-the-road ones like Target and J. C. Penney -- reported a pronounced slowdown in growth last month, and in several cases an outright drop in business. 
 American Express said that starting in early December the growth in the rate of spending by its 52 million cardholders, a generally affluent group of consumers, fell 3 percentage points, from 13 percent to 10 percent, the first slowdown since the 2001 recession. 
 And consumer confidence, an important barometer of economic health, has plunged. Andrew Kohut, president of the Pew Research Center, says consumer satisfaction with the economy has reached a 15-year low, according to the firm's polling.
 Even wealthier consumers, who were seen as invulnerable to rising gasoline prices and falling home values, are feeling the squeeze. 
 ''People are clearly concerned that we are headed into a recession,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, the chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, the upscale department store whose runaway growth throughout much of the year slowed markedly in December.
 Gia Trumpler, 37, a travel consultant who lives in Manhattan, shops at luxury chains like Saks. But she is trimming costs where she can by bringing lunch to work from home, rather than eating out. ''Everything just feels more expensive to me now,'' she said, including the cost of heating her apartment this winter. 
 There are plenty of recession naysayers. Average hourly wages and salaries have not fallen, and some economists argue that unless -- or until -- that happens, consumer spending will hold up despite widespread economic unease. According to these economists, what happened in December was a temporary blip. 
 ''Incomes have managed to hold up,'' said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economic forecasting firm, who added that the data to date did not support the view that a recession was inevitable.
 Even in tough economic times Americans rarely reduce their consumption, preferring instead to slow the growth in their spending. Since 1980, they have cut spending in only five quarters -- a total of 15 months -- most of them in the depths of a recession. The 2001 recession passed without a cutback in consumer spending.
 Only once before, in 1980, did consumer spending fall during a presidential election year, helping Ronald Reagan in his campaign against Jimmy Carter, the Democratic incumbent.
 Official statistics do not yet show that consumer spending has dropped, but they do suggest that in late 2007, it slowed in areas like automobiles, furniture, building materials and health care, said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. 
 Fresh evidence of a pullback is pouring in from many quarters as Americans confront the triple threats of higher energy costs, falling home prices and a volatile stock market. 
 Perhaps the strongest barometer over the last 30 days is the performance of the country's big chain stores. December turned out to be a blood bath for retailers at every rung on the economic ladder, with sales for the month growing at the slowest rate in seven years. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial yardstick in retailing, plunged by 11 percent at Kohl's and 7.9 percent at Macy's, compared with last year. 
 Chains that cater to the middle and upper classes, which have benefited from years of trading up -- when customers splurge on select expensive products -- struggled as well. Coach, the leather goods maker, said sales of its popular handbags had become sluggish, prompting the company to issue rare coupons to drum up business. 
 ''This is the real deal -- consumers are slowing down across the spectrum,'' said David Schick, a retail analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. 
 But it is the trouble at the highest reaches of retailing that has economists most worried about a recession. Over the last year, even as low-wage and middle-income consumers have cut back, the wealthy have spent freely, keeping high-end chains insulated from the economic turbulence.
 That started to change in December, as shoppers held off on buying $300 designer shoes and $500 dresses. For example, store sales fell 4 percent at Nordstrom, the high-end department store.
 And Tiffany, the upscale jeweler, said the number of purchases at its stores dropped last month. In an interview, its chief executive, Michael J. Kowalski, said that even if the wealthy remain so at least on paper, their economic anxiety is taking a toll. 
 ''It's a reaction to the general economic uncertainty everyone is feeling,'' he said. ''There are housing price declines and financial market instability. There is a lot of caution out there, and it's reflected in jewelry sales.''
 At the same time, the number of overdue payments on American Express cards is surging, the company said -- and this among well-heeled cardholders who charge up to $12,000 a year, on average, on each card. American Express has called some cardholders in the last few weeks to ask if they will have trouble paying their bills. 
 ''We are seeing a correlation with housing prices,'' said Michael O'Neill, a spokesman for American Express. ''The falloff in spending is everywhere in the country, but it is greatest in those areas like south Florida and California, where home prices have fallen the most.''
 The big exception is gasoline. American Express and the Consumer Federation of America say that consumers are buying just as many gallons as ever, but paying more for them, and that has forced cutbacks in other purchases. Gasoline prices usually drop after the summer driving season, but this year they shot up, from $2.85 a gallon on average in September to $3.07 in December and $3.15 in the first week of January.
 A similar trend is evident in the cost of natural gas, electricity and home heating oil. ''We built these big houses in the suburbs, which need a lot of energy to stay warm and a car to go shopping,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation. ''And we can't change that quickly.''
 The impact of rising gasoline prices ''is just profound on middle- and lower-income families,'' said Mr. Kohut of the Pew center. ''Our surveys are showing one of the lowest levels of satisfaction with national conditions in any recent presidential election year. You have to go back to 1992 to get a lower number of people saying the national economy is excellent or good.''
 The nation was recovering from recession that year. Consumer spending had contracted in two separate quarters in 1991, and while economic growth was gradually accelerating as Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush sought the presidency, the Clinton camp famously posted a sign in its campaign war room proclaiming, ''It's the economy, stupid.'' 
 There are some bright spots now in consumer spending. Sales of sports gear and electronic gadgets -- particularly G.P.S. navigation devices and flat-panel television sets -- have risen over the last three months. To Stephen Baker, vice president for industry analysis at the research firm NPD Group, that suggests there is still enough purchasing power for people to buy what they really want.
 ''We probably would not have seen strong sales for electronics products that people really want if the overriding issue was economic,'' Mr. Baker said.
 But not everyone is splurging. Jinal Shah, 22, a college senior in New York, said she wanted to buy the popular Nintendo Wii video game system as a gift for herself this holiday season, but had second thoughts because of the $250 price tag. She ended up not purchasing it.
 ''You have to make choices,'' she said. ''I get the Wii, or I go out more. I am just much more aware of the tradeoff now.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan Election May Ease Tensions With China

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
The landslide victory for the opposition Kuomintang in Taiwan's parliamentary elections could sharply reduce the political influence of President Chen Shui-bian, who has antagonized China and frustrated the United States with his efforts to forge a strong national identity for Taiwan. 
 The Kuomintang, or Nationalist Party, had been widely expected to perform strongly, but the scale of its success on Saturday -- in which it won almost three-quarters of the seats in Parliament -- delivered a blow to the Democratic Progressive Party's prospects of retaining power in the March 22 presidential election. 
 The Kuomintang, which once waged a fierce civil war against the Communists on the mainland, now advocates maintaining the status quo between China and Taiwan without ruling out eventual reunification. In the meantime, it supports closer economic and cultural ties with its neighbor -- a stance that political analysts here said was likely to reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait should the party win in March.
 Analysts attributed Mr. Chen's drubbing to a mix of foreign policy and domestic factors. Some said it was a clear repudiation of his confrontational policy of shifting Taiwan toward independence from China. 
 In one example of that strategy, Mr. Chen planned to hold a referendum during the presidential election asking voters to support a bid to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan rather than its formal name, the Republic of China. 
 China regards the island as part of its territory and has refused to rule out the use of force if Taiwan declares formal independence or indefinitely delays steps toward reunification. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has described the referendum as a ''provocative policy.''
 The Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, has signaled that he will be less confrontational toward China than Mr. Chen. Analysts said that while the referendum would probably go forward, Mr. Hsieh was likely to play down the issue. 
 Analysts also said some Taiwanese feared that Mr. Chen's approach was preventing the island's businesses from profiting fully from the mainland's economic boom. Voters apparently decided that the strategy had garnered few economic benefits for Taiwan and may have isolated it further politically.
 Voters were also disillusioned with Mr. Chen's economic management and the parliamentary gridlock that has prevailed throughout his presidency, analysts said. The Democratic Progressive Party has been unable to get much of its legislation, including important defense spending, through the opposition-dominated Parliament. 
 Corruption scandals linked to Mr. Chen's relatives had also hurt the party's image, analysts said.
 ''They need to adjust their strategy,'' Yen Chen-shen, an international relations expert at National Chengchi University in Taipei, said of Mr. Chen's party. ''They need to find something to get their voters excited.'' 
 Analysts here said China had avoided attempts to influence the parliamentary election with overt threats or intimidation, since saber rattling before past elections appeared to have increased support for the Democratic Progressive Party. 
 They predicted that Beijing would continue a hands-off policy throughout the presidential campaign. 
 ''Before the presidential election, China will keep quiet,'' said Keng Shu, a political scientist at National Chengchi University. ''This time, China has been rewarded for keeping its mouth shut.'' 
 China has yet to react publicly to the election outcome. But the ruling Communist Party has clearly signaled that it favors a return to power of the Kuomintang, which ruled the island for more than five decades until Mr. Chen's presidential victory in 2000. 
 In recent years, Beijing has invited senior officials from the Kuomintang to visit the mainland and has privately assured visiting Taiwanese scholars and business leaders that ties would improve if the Democratic Progressive Party were defeated. 
 Ma Ying-jeou, the popular and charismatic Kuomintang presidential candidate, has argued that avoiding confrontation with Beijing while expanding economic ties, including direct air and shipping links, between the two sides will reduce tension over time. 
 Mr. Chen, who is in the last months of his second and final term, resigned as party chairman on Saturday to take responsibility for the loss.

HEADLINE: When the Hospital Is the Ailing One

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Safety-Net Hospital Falls Into Financial Crisis'' (front page, Jan. 8): 
 The story of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and its inability to sustain itself through providing extensive charity care underlies arguments in favor of a single-payer health care system.
 Such a system would ensure that all hospitals -- public and private -- would be reimbursed for their services because it would eliminate the uninsured. 
 While there is resistance to universal health care perpetuated by insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and Republican politicians, the fact is that such a system would be the most equitable -- economically, socially, politically and ethically.
 Stephen Hemrick Boston, Jan. 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article about Grady Memorial Hospital cut an accurate picture of how north Georgia is about to eliminate public assistance health care by moving it to the nonprofit sector. 
 Many readers will perceive that this tragedy will be solved by transferring it from public to nonprofit hands, and this reasoning has dominated the local news. 
 Make no mistake, however; this is a mean-spirited process to eliminate taxpayer-financed health care that is linked to regional attitudes about illegal immigrants, never mind the age-old attitudes toward the destitute and poor, whether black or white. 
 Atlanta has grown and attracted a diverse population, but concepts of the greater good and civil responsibility remain provincial. Race, ethnicity and the perception of ''something for nothing'' trump the debate where compassion and the actual need to have a regional public health care facility are so obvious.
 A multicounty regional board with tax authority should have set Grady on the proper course long ago, demanding sales or property tax funds in proportion to usage. Instead, we have an unfortunate situation in a city that has resources but neither the will nor the empathy to accept social responsibility for the people on whose shoulders it sits. 
 This is really a consistent pattern of an Atlanta and north Georgia fiasco, whether traffic, water, development, urban planning or, now, health care delivery. 
 Edward S. Mocarski Jr. Atlanta, Jan. 8, 2008 The writer is a professor at Emory University School of Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 Your article about Grady Memorial Hospital captures many of the forces aligned against the success of public hospitals. After running two of our country's largest government health systems, I have found that several forces merit special attention and public policy actions.
 Public health care systems must separate policy from operations. Operating a health care system is difficult for experienced executives reporting to a knowledgeable board of directors. It may be impossible if a political process interferes with operational details. 
 Operations should be insulated from politics by an independent board with expertise relevant to health care. Political processes are needed to determine whose care and what services are covered by government funds and to assure that high-quality services are delivered. 
 Public hospitals are important teaching institutions, but they have disproportionately fewer patients on Medicare and more patients who are uninsured or on Medicaid than private hospitals. Resident training support should not be tied to Medicare or should be adjusted for public safety-net hospitals. An exception for pediatric residencies is already law.
 Both public and private hospitals would benefit from a fundamental reform of health care, especially if that reform were focused on how care is organized and delivered as much or more than on how it is financed.
 Thomas L. Garthwaite Newtown Square, Pa., Jan. 11, 2008 The writer, a former under secretary for health for the Department of Veterans Affairs and former director of health for the County of Los Angeles, is executive vice president and chief medical officer of Catholic Health East.
 To the Editor:
 Grady Memorial Hospital is struggling (as are many other hospitals throughout the United States), and what perplexes me is how much wealth is in our country that could be tapped into from philanthropist and fund-raising.
 And it boggles my mind that if just a meager percentage of the money that is spent on the many venues of entertainment, advertising, sports and so on went toward fund-raising for these hospitals, they might be able to at least have equipment that functions -- like X-ray machines -- that could save a life and prevent these hospitals from fighting lawsuits that continue to suck up our health care system, and that we all greatly need in our neighborhoods. 
 Our medical staffs are working with increased patient loads and doing their absolute best, but it is time for the folks out there to start supporting the network around them that is beginning to fall apart. 
 Our values are and continue to be directed, or misdirected, in the wrong areas, and we have to begin to care about human life again. 
 It is time for change -- but change begins with ourselves first.
 Donna Spiegel Nyack, N.Y., Jan. 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Grady Memorial Hospital story is a stark reminder of public hospitals' precarious financial footing.
 Grady and other essential safety-net hospitals may be pushed over the brink by pending federal regulations that would slash financing to public hospitals by $5 billion over five years. 
 New York City's public hospital system, the largest in the country, provides health care to 1.3 million New Yorkers every year, and nearly 400,000 are uninsured. 
 Like other public hospitals, New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation provides critical yet unprofitable services such as trauma centers, neonatal intensive care units, burn beds and disaster response capabilities. 
 Public hospitals provide access to everyone; eliminating their financing would only exacerbate America's health care crisis. Congress has four months to stop these devastating cuts from taking effect on May 25, when a moratorium on them imposed by Congress expires. If it does not act, the result will be catastrophic for millions of Americans.

HEADLINE: Patriots Get a Big Break. Or Do They?

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

 BODY:
New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick was watching just like everyone else Sunday when the game of the year went up in smoke, when the team regarded as the Patriots' biggest roadblock to another Super Bowl title was eliminated. 
 As a bonus for him, on the San Diego sideline in Indianapolis was a most welcome sight for any coach about to face the San Diego Chargers: LaDainian Tomlinson standing there, his knee injured enough to keep him out of the second half of the Chargers' 28-24 victory over the Colts in an American Football Conference divisional playoff game. 
 With the defending Super Bowl champion Colts, whose rivalry with the Patriots has colored more than a few postseason games this decade, out of the playoffs, the Patriots will play host to the Chargers next Sunday in the A.F.C. championship game. It figures to be a much less heated game than if the Colts had advanced. 
 The Patriots found their run defense Saturday night in their divisional game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, holding Fred Taylor and Maurice Jones-Drew to 66 yards combined. 
 Now the team that least needs a break could receive a gift, a conference championship game against Tomlinson, the N.F.L.'s premier running back, who may be at less than full strength, and against quarterback Philip Rivers, whose knee was banged up enough that he did not play in the Chargers' final two drives Sunday. There is a chance neither will play. 
 ''Going out on the road and winning in Indianapolis shows what kind of mental toughness they have,'' Belichick said Sunday in a conference call. ''We know we're going to have to play our best game of the year. We'll prepare for everybody. As we saw today, any number of players could be in the game.''
 The Chargers and the Patriots have their own checkered history. They played in the divisional round in San Diego last season, and it was the Patriots' victory that ushered Marty Schottenheimer into unemployment. But that game was also notable for the sour reaction of several Chargers, including Tomlinson, to the Patriots' celebration on the field. Tomlinson said the Patriots showed no class and indicated he thought they took their cues from their coach. 
 After the Patriots' spying scandal early this season, Tomlinson said that they lived by the credo, ''If you're not cheating, you're not trying.'' 
 Poking Superman in the chest is never a good idea, and the Patriots quieted Tomlinson in the second week of the season, only days after Belichick and the Patriots were sanctioned for the videotaping incident. The question then was whether the Patriots would be distracted. They have been answering ever since, constructing a 17-0 record as they try to become the second N.F.L. team to complete a perfect season with a Super Bowl title. 
 The Patriots, playing emotionally in support of Belichick, crushed the Chargers that night, 38-14, but plenty has changed since then. The Chargers' defense has found itself -- just ask the Colts -- and San Diego has run off eight consecutive victories to get to the conference championship round. 
 ''We'll start all over on our preparations with them, almost like it's a new team,'' Belichick said. ''That was such a long time ago. I think the most important thing for us to focus on is what the Chargers have done in the last couple of months.''
 What they did against the Colts may draw particular attention. The Chargers were able to pass for 312 yards, with Rivers and Billy Volek under center. Toward the end of the season, the Patriots' secondary had some trouble stopping the best passing games -- the Giants' Eli Manning had the game of his life in the regular-season finale -- and the Patriots struggled to stop David Garrard on Saturday night, allowing him to complete 22 of 33 passes for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns. Garrard's lone mistake, which was turned into an interception by safety Rodney Harrison, secured the victory for the Patriots. 
 The Patriots were in the A.F.C. championship game last year, too, which for most franchises would mean a very good season. For the Patriots, though, the loss to the Colts was the impetus for a furious remake of the receiving corps that has lifted the Patriots' offense into the stratosphere. Now it is the Chargers, mocked in the first half of the season and stunning in the second, who will have to grapple with what the Colts wrought with a shot at the Super Bowl on the line. 
 ''The thing about it now is none of it matters,'' Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said Saturday night. ''For 17 games, it all comes down to this. We were here last year. I hope we perform better.''

HEADLINE: When Gadget Parts Break or Get Lost

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THE proliferation of iPods, cellphones and other devices in the hands of smaller children is sure to have profound social significance in the long term, but in the short term it means something else: broken gadgets and lost parts.
 Fortunately, technology is also improving on that front. Advances in business-to-business Internet transactions in the spare parts industry in recent years have helped make it easier for consumers to find replacement lids, chargers and remote controls, and for repair technicians to find obscure parts on a moment's notice. 
 ''We're trying to take the repair industry, which revolves around very high-tech products, and build an infrastructure that's as sophisticated as the products,'' said Randy Whitehead, president of National Service Alliance, a network of independent consumer electronics repair specialists based in Salt Lake City.
 This industry, Mr. Whitehead and other executives said, has struggled to keep pace with brisk changes in recent decades. Local repair services died off as products grew more reliable and their component parts so expensive that it made little sense to stock them.
 Big companies like Best Buy, Sears and others filled the void, sometimes relying on home-based, independent technicians for help. But the universe of component parts exploded in the meantime, and independent technicians were not equipped to find spare parts efficiently and coordinate the arrival of those parts with a service call.
 A pair of innovations has helped change that. First, companies like National Service Alliance, ServicePower, ServiceBench and others built Internet-based services to help coordinate repair calls among independent repair technicians, making it easier for manufacturers and retailers to find technicians.
 Second, there is Partsearch Technologies, a Manhattan-based company, started in 2001, that has compiled an online catalog of more than eight million spare parts for electronics, appliances and other items. It offers repair technicians and consumers a single place to find obscure parts and commonly lost items like batteries.
 Mr. Whitehead, of National Service Alliance, said that in years past, his company typically sent service technicians who made two or three trips to a customer's house to repair an item -- the first trip to diagnose the problem, followed by a repair visit after the technician had located the proper part. 
 In recent months, Mr. Whitehead's company introduced phone-based diagnostic services and synchronized its systems with those of Partsearch, so National Service Alliance can coordinate a repair visit with the arrival of parts.
 The new system, Mr. Whitehead said, enabled National Service Alliance's technicians to make single-visit repairs 70 percent of the time, double the previous rate. Labor costs associated with finding replacement parts, he added, have dropped by at least 25 percent.
 Partsearch represents a classic Internet niche success story. A privately held company, it generated more than $60 million in 2007 sales. 
 Partsearch does not actually keep spare parts in a warehouse. Rather, it collects inventory information from suppliers and manufacturers in various industries, like Ingram Micro or Whirlpool, and collects a commission or a transaction fee when they sell a part to a service company. 
 Partsearch also operates a Web site for consumers, Partstore.com, which sells the same merchandise, and it builds online part-searching services for Circuit City and other companies.
 The items listed in Partsearch's inventory cover about 90 percent of the available products in consumer electronics, computers, kitchen appliances and other household categories, according to Glenn Laumeister, the company's chief executive. 
 The items most frequently broken or lost, he said, include laptop batteries, projection television lamps, refrigerator water filters and dryer timer knobs (so you're not alone).
 Mr. Laumeister said his company is in the midst of a seasonal surge, as consumers break, lose or wear out their holiday gift gadgets. Also helping sales recently, he said, are environmentally aware customers looking to keep their older electronics items out of the dump. A precarious economy, of course, helps. ''When the economy slows down, people fix their old stuff,'' he said.
 Alan Wolf, a senior editor at Twice magazine, a trade publication covering the consumer electronics industry, said Partsearch has ''taken an enormous amount of time and money out of the repair process.''
 ''As technology gets more complex and consumers need more help with devices, there'll be more and more demand for repair services,'' Mr. Wolf added. ''That's especially true as the age of the average user gets lower and lower.''
 Rick Souder, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Crutchfield, the consumer electronics retailer, agreed that the Web -- and Partsearch, in particular -- has made it easier for consumers to find spare parts. 
 Indeed, the company includes a link to Partstore.com on the Crutchfield site even though Crutchfield sells some of the same items.
 Although technology has improved the operations of repair technicians, and made replacement parts widely available to consumers, other holes in the repair process persist, he said. 
 ''I find I still need a tour guide when I try something on my own,'' Mr. Souder said. ''And if you want to take a piece of equipment down to the local repair guy, he either doesn't exist anymore or he's more difficult to find.''

HEADLINE: Less Hype, but at Least These Restrooms Are Free

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ; Kate Hammer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Reinventing the chamber pot for the 21st century was no small matter.
 It took weight sensors, motion detectors, disinfectant jets, robotic arms and stingy paper dispensers, as well as red, blue, yellow, black and green push buttons to create what city officials called the latest in ''street furniture.'' 
 On Thursday, the city unveiled New York's first coin-operated public toilet designed to be the high-tech equal of any of its counterparts in Paris, Singapore or other world-class cities. For New Yorkers and tourists alike, it was a small step toward addressing a chronic shortage of public restrooms in the city. 
 But what of the rest of New York's public facilities, stalwarts all but steps behind in evolution? 
 What can be found there? Last week, two reporters, a man and a woman, visited six public toilets and, for comparison, two private ones, at a museum and a hotel. 
 Here now an unlikely Baedeker of the unspotless city.
 For decades, city parks, like Madison Square Park, where the high-tech toilet was introduced, have been a kind of public laboratory for restrooms, with mixed results.
 Quite possibly the most successful of the experiments are the restrooms in Bryant Park, near the New York Public Library.
 Located in a small carved stone building, the restrooms have a large bouquet of sunflowers, Casablanca lilies and eucalyptus in a stone vase near the entrance. They smell beautiful.
 The bathroom stalls in the women's room are unusually wide, about eight inches wider than the usual economy-class stalls found in most public restrooms. A sign above a red button reads, ''Push RED button for a new, clean toilet seat cover.'' A push, and the cover appears.
 In Central Park, near the Delacorte Theater, where Shakespeare in the Park plays, is a small stone building that resembles a gingerbread house.
 Fairly well lighted and relatively clean, both the men's and women's rooms have a disconcerting feature: an open door that lets in cold drafts.
 In Riverside Park is a slasher-film cliche of a forbidding New York facility. The men's room, near the 79th Street Boat Basin, appears to be padlocked closed, but isn't. It creaks, Frankenstein-style, when opened, and the tile floors produce echoes. Something off can be smelled. A cockroach has died in the metal mesh at the bottom of one urinal.
 Transportation hubs are also expected places for public restrooms and provide an even more mixed bag.
 Grand Central Terminal, given its enormous traffic (lines form frequently), has restrooms that are surprisingly clean, well run and adequately stocked with soap and paper. On one visit, patrons in a men's room included a disheveled man using a car floor mat as a raincoat. 
 Pennsylvania Station's bathrooms are located in various companies' waiting areas. The women's room at New Jersey Transit was clean and every stall was working. Violins played over a loudspeaker.
 But the scratched bathroom mirror was infuriating. It darkened and distorted the beholder, specifically the hips. A janitor in a blue jumpsuit was sympathetic.
 ''I clean and I clean, and the scratches stay,'' she said. ''You complain, write a letter, so they get a better one.''
 The bathrooms in the main ticketing area at the Port Authority Bus Terminal are hard to find (there are no signs and the floor maps are difficult to decipher). There is debris on the floor. Signs warn that plainclothes police officers patrol the restrooms.
 One sign details prohibited behavior, including smoking and drinking. It also warns that no one should ''bathe, shave, launder, or change clothes.''
 For comparison to public facilities, the restrooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art were also visited. With chutzpah, you can avoid paying the museum's suggested $20 adult admission.
 The main restrooms in the Egyptian Wing are just past ''Egypt Under Roman Rule 30 B.C. -- 400 A.D.'' and are clean and well lighted, if busy. A bathroom attendant visited twice in the space of 10 minutes.
 The bathroom at the St. Regis Hotel in Midtown is just past the candle-lighted library and down the stairs. The lighting fixtures are crystal and the faucets polished brass. A red flowering plant smells sweet. No one else is there.
 That is not the case at Madison Square Park, where the coin-operated restroom with the robotic arm is under intense scrutiny.
 Andrea Ramsey, 24, a teacher from Liverpool, N.Y., reported some quibbles. Besides the slow door, the paper dispenser refused to spit out more than a little bit of paper, holding her hands as wide as a cereal box for demonstration. And the floor was wet, part of the sanitizing function, which employs jets of disinfectants over the sink, toilet bowl and floor that often do not dry in time for the next patron. 
 ''It's basically a carwash inside,'' said Ms. Ramsey's fiance, John Homen, 29, a movie-theater manager.
 So how does this compare with other public restrooms she has patronized? Ms. Ramsey took a deep breath and said, ''Oh, way better! It's so clean!''

HEADLINE: Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Fibromyalgia is a real disease. Or so says Pfizer in a new television advertising campaign for Lyrica, the first medicine approved to treat the pain condition, whose very existence is questioned by some doctors.
 For patient advocacy groups and doctors who specialize in fibromyalgia, the Lyrica approval is a milestone. They say they hope Lyrica and two other drugs that may be approved this year will legitimize fibromyalgia, just as Prozac brought depression into the mainstream. 
 But other doctors -- including the one who wrote the 1990 paper that defined fibromyalgia but who has since changed his mind -- say that the disease does not exist and that Lyrica and the other drugs will be taken by millions of people who do not need them.
 As diagnosed, fibromyalgia primarily affects middle-aged women and is characterized by chronic, widespread pain of unknown origin. Many of its sufferers are afflicted by other similarly nebulous conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome. 
 Because fibromyalgia patients typically do not respond to conventional painkillers like aspirin, drug makers are focusing on medicines like Lyrica that affect the brain and the perception of pain.
 Advocacy groups and doctors who treat fibromyalgia estimate that 2 to 4 percent of adult Americans, as many as 10 million people, suffer from the disorder.
 Those figures are sharply disputed by those doctors who do not consider fibromyalgia a medically recognizable illness and who say that diagnosing the condition actually worsens suffering by causing patients to obsess over aches that other people simply tolerate. Further, they warn that Lyrica's side effects, which include severe weight gain, dizziness and edema, are very real, even if fibromyalgia is not.
 Despite the controversy, the American College of Rheumatology, the Food and Drug Administration and insurers recognize fibromyalgia as a diagnosable disease. And drug companies are aggressively pursuing fibromyalgia treatments, seeing the potential for a major new market.
 Hoping to follow Pfizer's lead, two other big drug companies, Eli Lilly and Forest Laboratories, have asked the F.D.A. to let them market drugs for fibromyalgia. Approval for both is likely later this year, analysts say.
 Worldwide sales of Lyrica, which is also used to treat diabetic nerve pain and seizures and which received F.D.A. approval in June for fibromyalgia, reached $1.8 billion in 2007, up 50 percent from 2006. Analysts predict sales will rise an additional 30 percent this year, helped by consumer advertising.
 In November, Pfizer began a television ad campaign for Lyrica that features a middle-aged woman who appears to be reading from her diary. ''Today I struggled with my fibromyalgia; I had pain all over,'' she says, before turning to the camera and adding, ''Fibromyalgia is a real, widespread pain condition.''
 Doctors who specialize in treating fibromyalgia say that the disorder is undertreated and that its sufferers have been stigmatized as chronic complainers. The new drugs will encourage doctors to treat fibromyalgia patients, said Dr. Dan Clauw, a professor of medicine at the University of Michigan who has consulted with Pfizer, Lilly and Forest.
 ''What's going to happen with fibromyalgia is going to be the exact thing that happened to depression with Prozac,'' Dr. Clauw said. ''These are legitimate problems that need treatments.''
 Dr. Clauw said that brain scans of people who have fibromyalgia reveal differences in the way they process pain, although the doctors acknowledge that they cannot determine who will report having fibromyalgia by looking at a scan.
 Lynne Matallana, president of the National Fibromyalgia Association, a patients' advocacy group that receives some of its financing from drug companies, said the new drugs would help people accept the existence of fibromyalgia. ''The day that the F.D.A. approved a drug and we had a public service announcement, my pain became real to people,'' Ms. Matallana said.
 Ms. Matallana said she had suffered from fibromyalgia since 1993. At one point, the pain kept her bedridden for two years, she said. Today she still has pain, but a mix of drug and nondrug treatments -- as well as support from her family and her desire to run the National Fibromyalgia Association -- has enabled her to improve her health, she said. She declined to say whether she takes Lyrica.
 ''I just got to a point where I felt, I have pain but I'm going to have to figure out how to live with it,'' she said. ''I absolutely still have fibromyalgia.''
 But doctors who are skeptical of fibromyalgia say vague complaints of chronic pain do not add up to a disease. No biological tests exist to diagnose fibromyalgia, and the condition cannot be linked to any environmental or biological causes.
 The diagnosis of fibromyalgia itself worsens the condition by encouraging people to think of themselves as sick and catalog their pain, said Dr. Nortin Hadler, a rheumatologist and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina who has written extensively about fibromyalgia.
 ''These people live under a cloud,'' he said. ''And the more they seem to be around the medical establishment, the sicker they get.''
 Dr. Frederick Wolfe, the director of the National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases and the lead author of the 1990 paper that first defined the diagnostic guidelines for fibromyalgia, says he has become cynical and discouraged about the diagnosis. He now considers the condition a physical response to stress, depression, and economic and social anxiety. 
 ''Some of us in those days thought that we had actually identified a disease, which this clearly is not,'' Dr. Wolfe said. ''To make people ill, to give them an illness, was the wrong thing.''
 In general, fibromyalgia patients complain not just of chronic pain but of many other symptoms, Dr. Wolfe said. A survey of 2,500 fibromyalgia patients published in 2007 by the National Fibromyalgia Association indicated that 63 percent reported suffering from back pain, 40 percent from chronic fatigue syndrome, and 30 percent from ringing in the ears, among other conditions. Many also reported that fibromyalgia interfered with their daily lives, with activities like walking or climbing stairs.
 Most people ''manage to get through life with some vicissitudes, but we adapt,'' said Dr. George Ehrlich, a rheumatologist and an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ''People with fibromyalgia do not adapt.''
 Both sides agree that people who are identified as having fibromyalgia do not get much relief from traditional pain medicines, whether anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen -- sold as Advil, among other brands -- or prescription opiates like Vicodin. So drug companies have sought other ways to reduce pain.
 Pfizer's Lyrica, known generically as pregabalin, binds to receptors in the brain and spinal cord and seems to reduce activity in the central nervous system.
 Exactly why and how Lyrica reduces pain is unclear. In clinical trials, patients taking the drug reported that their pain -- whether from fibromyalgia, shingles or diabetic nerve damage -- fell on average about 2 points on a 10-point scale, compared with 1 point for patients taking a placebo. About 30 percent of patients said their pain fell by at least half, compared with 15 percent taking placebos.
 The F.D.A. reviewers who initially examined Pfizer's application for Lyrica in 2004 for diabetic nerve pain found those results unimpressive, especially in comparison to Lyrica's side effects. The reviewers recommended against approving the drug, citing itsside effects.
 In many patients, Lyrica causes weight gain and edema, or swelling, as well as dizziness and sleepiness. In 12-week trials, 9 percent of patients saw their weight rise more than 7 percent, and the weight gain appeared to continue over time. The potential for weight gain is a special concern because many fibromyalgia patients are already overweight: the average fibromyalgia patient in the 2007 survey reported weighing 180 pounds and standing 5 feet 4 inches.
 But senior F.D.A. officials overruled the initial reviewers, noting that severe pain can be incapacitating. ''While pregabalin does present a number of concerns related to its potential for toxicity, the overall risk-to-benefit ratio supports the approval of this product,'' Dr. Bob Rappaport, the director of the F.D.A. division reviewing the drug, wrote in June 2004.
 Pfizer began selling Lyrica in the United States in 2005. The next year the company asked for F.D.A. approval to market the drug as a fibromyalgia treatment. The F.D.A. granted that request in June 2007.
 Pfizer has steadily ramped up consumer advertising of Lyrica. During the first nine months of 2007, it spent $46 million on ads, compared with $33 million in 2006, according to TNS Media Intelligence.
 Dr. Steve Romano, a psychiatrist and a Pfizer vice president who oversees Lyrica, says the company expects that Lyrica will be prescribed for fibromyalgia both by specialists like neurologists and by primary care doctors. As doctors see that the drug helps control pain, they will be more willing to use it, he said.
 ''When you help physicians to recognize the condition and you give them treatments that are well tolerated, you overcome their reluctance,'' he said.
 Both the Lilly and Forest drugs being proposed for fibromyalgia were originally developed as antidepressants, and both work by increasing levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, brain transmitters that affect mood. The Lilly drug, Cymbalta, is already available in the United States, while the Forest drug, milnacipran, is sold in many countries, though not the United States.
 Dr. Amy Chappell, a medical fellow at Lilly, said that even though Cymbalta is an antidepressant, its effects on fibromyalgia pain are independent of its antidepressant effects. In clinical trials, she said, even fibromyalgia patients who are not depressed report relief from their pain on Cymbalta. 
 The overall efficacy of Cymbalta and milnacipran is similar to that of Lyrica. Analysts and the companies expect that the drugs will probably be used together.
 ''There's definitely room for several drugs,'' Dr. Chappell said.
 But physicians who are opposed to the fibromyalgia diagnosis say the new drugs will probably do little for patients. Over time, fibromyalgia patients tend to cycle among many different painkillers, sleep medicines and antidepressants, using each for a while until its benefit fades, Dr. Wolfe said.
 ''The fundamental problem is that the improvement that you see, which is not really great in clinical trials, is not maintained,'' Dr. Wolfe said.
 Still, Dr. Wolfe expects the drugs will be widely used. The companies, he said, are ''going to make a fortune.''

HEADLINE: Responding to Recession

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman

 BODY:
Suddenly, the economic consensus seems to be that the implosion of the housing market will indeed push the U.S. economy into a recession, and that it's quite possible that we're already in one. As a result, over the next few weeks we'll be hearing a lot about plans for economic stimulus. 
 Since this is an election year, the debate over how to stimulate the economy is inevitably tied up with politics. And here's a modest suggestion for political reporters. Instead of trying to divine the candidates' characters by scrutinizing their tone of voice and facial expressions, why not pay attention to what they say about economic policy? 
 In fact, recent statements by the candidates and their surrogates about the economy are quite revealing.
 Take, for example, John McCain's admission that economics isn't his thing. ''The issue of economics is not something I've understood as well as I should,'' he says. ''I've got Greenspan's book.'' 
 His self-deprecating humor is attractive, as always. But shouldn't we worry about a candidate who's so out of touch that he regards Mr. Bubble, the man who refused to regulate subprime lending and assured us that there was at most some ''froth'' in the housing market, as a source of sage advice?
 Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani wants us to go for broke, literally: his answer to the economy's short-run problems is a huge permanent tax cut, which he claims would pay for itself. It wouldn't.
 About Mike Huckabee -- well, what can you say about a candidate who talks populist while proposing to raise taxes on the middle class and cut them for the rich?
 And then there's the curious case of Mitt Romney. I'm told that he actually does know a fair bit about economics, and he has some big-name Republican economists supporting his campaign. Fears of recession might have offered him a chance to distinguish himself from the G.O.P. field, by offering an economic proposal that actually responded to the gathering economic storm.
 I mean, even the Bush administration seems to be coming around to the view that lobbying for long-term tax cuts isn't enough, that the economy needs some immediate help. ''Time is of the essence,'' declared Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, last week. 
 But Mr. Romney, who really needs to take chances at this point, apparently can't break the habit of telling Republicans only what he thinks they want to hear. He's still offering nothing but standard-issue G.O.P. pablum about low taxes and a pro-business environment.
 On the Democratic side, John Edwards, although never the front-runner, has been driving his party's policy agenda. He's done it again on economic stimulus: last month, before the economic consensus turned as negative as it now has, he proposed a stimulus package including aid to unemployed workers, aid to cash-strapped state and local governments, public investment in alternative energy, and other measures. 
 Last week Hillary Clinton offered a broadly similar but somewhat larger proposal. (It also includes aid to families having trouble paying heating bills, which seems like a clever way to put cash in the hands of people likely to spend it.) The Edwards and Clinton proposals both contain provisions for bigger stimulus if the economy worsens.
 And you have to say that Mrs. Clinton seems comfortable with and knowledgeable about economic policy. I'm sure the Hillary-haters will find some reason that's a bad thing, but there's something to be said for presidents who know what they're talking about.
 The Obama campaign's initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I'm sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama's top economic adviser claimed that the long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from ''morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending.'' Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure -- doesn't that sound familiar?
 Anyway, on Sunday Mr. Obama came out with a real stimulus plan. As was the case with his health care plan, which fell short of universal coverage, his stimulus proposal is similar to those of the other Democratic candidates, but tilted to the right. 
 For example, the Obama plan appears to contain none of the alternative energy initiatives that are in both the Edwards and Clinton proposals, and emphasizes across-the-board tax cuts over both aid to the hardest-hit families and help for state and local governments. I know that Mr. Obama's supporters hate to hear this, but he really is less progressive than his rivals on matters of domestic policy.
 In short, the stimulus debate offers a pretty good portrait of the men and woman who would be president. And I haven't said a word about their hairstyles.

HEADLINE: In Many Venues, Economy Will Take Center Stage

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Political wisdom this week runs smack into economic reality. It is not yet clear which force will prove more powerful.
 For presidential contenders, the collision occurs in the next contests, in Michigan, Nevada and South Carolina, states unlike Iowa and New Hampshire in that they all have above-average unemployment as the nation's economy teeters near recession. For incumbents in Congress and the White House, the collision takes place in talks over a potential economic stimulus package, with each party deciding if the price of inaction exceeds that of bipartisan compromise. 
 G.O.P. in Michigan 
 The Republican presidential candidates have spent much of the campaign praising the economic performance of their party's leader, President Bush, and reassuring conservatives of their budget-cutting bona fides. Yet Michigan, where they face a primary on Tuesday, has the nation's highest jobless rate and is near the top in mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures. ''The economy dwarfs everything,'' said Ed Sarpolus, a pollster based in Lansing. 
 While tax cuts represent the conventional Republican approach, extending Mr. Bush's cuts won't help soon since they are already on the books through 2010. Additional broad-based income tax relief isn't easy, since more than a third of taxpayers are off income tax rolls already. Cutting the payroll tax is politically dicey because it finances Social Security benefits.
 ''To get a short-term boost to the economy, you have to do something that reduces the tax burden of tens of millions of people, not just a few corporations or a few investors,'' said Jeff Bell, a Republican consultant and supply-sider. ''The Republican Party feels handcuffed because Social Security is controversial.''
 Pressure to remove the handcuffs won't ease soon. California, the biggest state to hold a primary on Feb. 5, is also struggling economically. Meanwhile, a new New York Times/CBS News poll found that majorities of three general election targets -- independents, suburbanites and rural voters -- rated conditions of the national economy negatively. 
 Democrats in Nevada
 On the Democratic side, after years spent slamming Mr. Bush for excessive tax cuts and making ''fiscal responsibility'' the cornerstone of their claim to economic credibility, the candidates are having a difficult time embracing the conventional Democratic policy tool, stimulus through government spending.
 But primary pressures are overcoming that constraint. Before Christmas, John Edwards, running on a populist platform, proposed spending $25 billion on energy, job training and unemployment programs. Last week, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton upped the ante with a $70 billion package, nearly half aimed at the housing crisis.
 Senator Barack Obama, who has been strongest so far among independents and affluent Democrats, countered Sunday with a plan to accelerate his previously announced plan for a $500 credit against each worker's payroll tax liability. To ensure its stimulative effect, he would abandon for now the imperative of offsetting tax increases.
 The caucuses on Saturday in Nevada, where union members represent a crucial voting bloc, will test whether Mr. Obama's credit proposal draws some of the blue-collar voters -- those with incomes below $50,000 -- that Mrs. Clinton has so far attracted. 
 And in Washington
 Mr. Bush is likely to be reluctant to allow a recession in his final year, harming his legacy and his party's chances of holding onto the White House. So he is considering sending a stimulus package to Congress. 
 Democratic leaders, who have seen even lower approval ratings than Mr. Bush, have good reasons to negotiate with him as they try to hold their Congressional majorities in November. 
 But recent performance suggests each side will have difficulty clearing its ideological hurdles -- the Democratic opposition to Mr. Bush's tax policies and Mr. Bush's resistance to Democratic spending priorities. At the same time, Mr. Bush would undercut Republican Congressional candidates by striking a deal with Democratic leaders, and Democratic leaders would constrain their eventual presidential nominee.

HEADLINE: The Candidates Discover the Economy

 BODY:
The presidential candidates are only beginning to recognize what many voters have already figured out through painful, personal experience: the economy is in trouble and unlikely to improve without some sensible government response. 
 The Republicans have been particularly slow to grasp the depth of the problem and the anxiety and pessimism Americans are feeling. Campaigning over the weekend in Michigan -- one of the hardest-pressed states and also the site of a G.O.P.-only primary this week -- they doled out sympathy, but called mainly for their party's all-purpose fix: more tax cuts. 
 Sympathy is apt for a state with the nation's highest unemployment rate, and a targeted and short-term tax rebate may well be necessary. But as stimulus measures go, tax cuts are not nearly as effective as bolstered federal spending on unemployment compensation, food stamps and direct financial aid to states. None of the Republican candidates have yet to think that creatively. And they have barely mentioned the foreclosure crisis at the root of many of today's economic problems. 
 The Democratic front-runners have been slow off the mark, but they're catching on. Last week, Hillary Clinton called for a robust short-term stimulus package, including more federal spending for jobless benefits, home heating aid and grants to states to help prevent foreclosures. John Edwards has been pushing a similar plan for weeks. Barack Obama announced a rescue plan Sunday that relies more heavily on targeted tax cuts to get the economy moving, and less on direct spending. 
 The proposals from Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards are closer to what's needed and the type of stimulus that Congressional leaders and the White House should begin to discuss as soon as President Bush returns from his Middle East trip. Even such welcome steps would need to be designed and managed carefully to ensure that they don't permanently add to the deficit. Spending to manage a crisis need not be paid for immediately. Lawmakers and all of the candidates will still need to explain how stimulus measures would be paid for later on, when the economy has recovered. 
 There is already pending legislation that could help blunt some of the pain. The House has passed an excellent bill to modernize the nation's unemployment compensation system -- expanding the number and types of workers who qualify -- but the Senate has yet to move. Congress should also pass a measure that would allow bankrupt homeowners to modify their mortgages under bankruptcy court protection. That would help more homeowners keep the roof over their heads, as well as be an incentive to lenders to work more diligently to modify loans before they wind up in bankruptcy court.
 The candidates -- especially those who still have day jobs on Capitol Hill -- should press for swift approval of those two important measures, and be ready to press the case for a targeted and temporary stimulus package if conditions worsen. The voters are watching and waiting.

HEADLINE: Bush Urges Unity Against Iran as It Agrees to Cooperate With Nuclear Agency

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington, and Nazila Fathi from Tehran.

DATELINE: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates 

 BODY:
President Bush on Sunday urged wary Persian Gulf allies to rally against Iran ''before it is too late,'' even as the International Atomic Energy Agency announced that the country had agreed, yet again, to answer outstanding questions about its nuclear programs within four weeks. 
 In an address to government and business leaders in an opulent hotel here, Mr. Bush focused not only on what the United States believes are Iran's nuclear ambitions but also its suspected support for Islamic militants in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He called Iran's government ''the world's leading sponsor of terrorism'' and accused it of imposing repression and economic hardship at home. 
 ''Iran's actions threaten the security of nations everywhere,'' he said. ''So the United States is strengthening our longstanding security commitments with our friends in the gulf and rallying friends around the world to confront this danger before it is too late.''
 The announcement about Iran's pledge of cooperation on its nuclear program, however, could undercut efforts to build international support against Tehran. It came after a visit to Iran this weekend by Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring agency, who met with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
 Iran agreed to carry out its pledges, made last year, to resolve suspicions about its nuclear programs, though the state news agency said it expected the United Nations Security Council to drop its sanctions in return. The announcement essentially delayed for another month what had been an end-of-the-year deadline to disclose all of its nuclear work, including any covert or undeclared military research. 
 Over the past year and a half the Iranians have repeatedly made declarations that they would answer outstanding questions within a week, but each of those deadlines has passed with only partial answers offered. 
 With Mr. Bush in the middle of a trip to the region intended to build a united Arab front against Iran, the White House acknowledged that the announcement represented progress, but expressed skepticism about Iran's willingness to provide complete information. It also said Iran was still obliged to suspend its enrichment of uranium, as required by the Security Council.
 ''Answering questions about their past nuclear activities is a step,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman. ''But they still need to suspend their enrichment and reprocessing activity. Another declaration is no substitute for complying with the U.N. sanctions.''
 Administration officials say many Arab states are wary of Iran's growing power and influence in the region, especially among Shiite minorities in predominately Sunni nations like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. 
 In recent months, however, the gulf states have shown signs of reaching out diplomatically to Iran. Saudi Arabia gave permission to Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and the Gulf Cooperation Council also extended him an invitation to a summit meeting last month. 
 Mr. Bush began his Middle East trip in Israel, focused on brokering an Israeli-Palestinian peace, but Iran has loomed large in his travels, particularly after a confrontation in the Strait of Hormuz a week ago between three American warships and five Iranian speedboats. 
 The Pentagon has appeared to back away from part of its initial account of that encounter. In Bahrain, where Mr. Bush began his day on Sunday, the commanders of the two American ships involved said that a threatening radio message may not have come from the Iranian boats.
 The commanders said they took the radio warning seriously nevertheless, because it was broadcast as the Iranian speedboats were maneuvering in what they viewed as a provocative manner around the American ships. Because the warning, that the American ships would explode, was broadcast over an open maritime radio channel, it could have come from another ship in the area or from somewhere on shore.
 In a news conference at the headquarters of the Fifth Fleet, the officers also said they had determined that boxes dropped into the water by the Iranians were not dangerous, as feared at the time, and were probably a ruse to study the reaction of the Navy warships. ''Whether it was coincidental or not, it occurred at exactly the same time that these boats were around us,'' Cmdr. Jeffery James of the Hopper, a destroyer, said of the radioed threat, ''and they were placing objects in the water so the threat appeared to be building.'' 
 For the second time in two months, Mr. Bush found himself making a case about Iran's threat in the face of developments that seemed to undercut it. In December, an American intelligence report concluded that Iran had suspended a nuclear weapons program in 2003, a finding that has delayed a new round of United Nations sanctions.
 In his meetings, in Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Bush and his aides have tried to press leaders to do more to help the United States to isolate Iran's leaders. Privately, Mr. Bush has urged Persian Gulf leaders to restrict Iran's access to banks and other financial institutions, one administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to discuss internal deliberations. 
 In addition to sanctions already imposed by the United Nations Security Council over Iran's failure to comply with demands involving its nuclear programs, the administration has lobbied for countries to enforce American sanctions against four state-owned banks in Iran and the Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards. Ayatollah Khamenei appeared to be referring to the administration's efforts on Sunday when he declared, ''Americans mistakenly think they can bring the Iranian nation to its knees with pressure,'' according to the news agency ISNA.
 Mr. Bush used his speech here on Sunday to call for greater political freedom in the region. 
 ''You cannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison,'' he said at the Emirates Palace, a large hotel on the Persian Gulf, built at a cost of $3 billion. 
 ''You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government,'' he continued. ''And you cannot stand up a modern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms.''
 Except for Iran, though, Mr. Bush did not single out any country, including his host, the United Arab Emirates, whose record on human rights ''remained problematic,'' according to the State Department's most recent human rights report.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about President Bush's visit to the Middle East, during which he heard Arab states' concerns about Iranian influence in the region, referred incorrectly to the composition of Bahrain's population. The majority of the people there are Shiite Muslims, not Sunni.

HEADLINE: Remarkable Fluidity in G.O.P.; Democrats Ponder Electability

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Marina Stefan contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republican voters have sharply altered their views of the party's presidential candidates following the early contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, with Senator John McCain, once widely written off, now viewed more favorably than any of his major competitors, according to the latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 The findings underscored the extraordinary volatility in the Republican race and suggested that the party was continuing to search for a nominee to rally around. Nearly three-quarters of Republican primary voters said it was still too early for them to make up their minds ''for sure,'' meaning that they could shift their allegiances yet again if one or more of Mr. McCain's rivals breaks through in the two Republican primaries this week, in Michigan and South Carolina.
 On the Democratic side, Senator Barack Obama's victory in Iowa has improved his standing within the party on a critical measure: his electability. The percentage of Democrats who say he would be the strongest candidate against the Republicans has more than doubled in a month, to 35 percent from 14 percent in December. 
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who won her party's primary in New Hampshire, still has an edge on electability, a substantial advantage on experience -- the central selling point of her campaign -- and leads among Democrats nationally. But Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are now viewed by Democrats as almost equally qualified on a variety of measures, including the ability to serve as commander in chief. 
 Americans' priorities are also in flux early into the primary season. The survey found voters to be in their darkest mood about the economy in 18 years, by some measures; 62 percent said they believed that the economy was getting worse, the highest percentage since the run-up to the recession in 1990. Seventy-five percent said they believed that the country had ''seriously gotten off on the wrong track,'' also similar to levels in the early 1990s, when such discontent fueled the presidential candidacy of Bill Clinton. 
 Worries about the economy now dominate the voters' agenda, even more so than the war in Iraq, which framed the early part of this campaign. While change has emerged as an abstract rallying cry in the campaign debate, what the voters mean when they talk about change is clear -- new approaches to the economy and the war, according to the poll. Issues that have loomed large in the Republican debate -- notably immigration, taxes and moral values -- pale by comparison.
 The poll's findings are based on a national telephone survey conducted Jan. 9-12 with 1,061 registered voters; it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 The survey was begun one day after the primary in New Hampshire, where Mr. McCain won, and amounted to a snapshot of a Republican contest that remains remarkably fluid after almost a year of campaigning. While national polls are of limited value in predicting the outcome of primaries in particular states, they capture broad shifts in opinion, in this case a sharp movement for Mr. McCain after a big victory and a wave of media attention. Thirty-three percent of Republican primary voters in the poll named Mr. McCain, of Arizona, as their choice, up from 7 percent a month ago. 
 Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, whose favorability ratings jumped after he won in Iowa, was the choice of 18 percent of Republican primary voters. Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who is focusing his campaign on later contests, had the most precipitous fall; he was the choice of 10 percent of Republican voters, down from 22 percent last month. Support for other candidates was in single digits.
 The poll also had worrisome signs for Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who finished second in both Iowa and New Hampshire and is in a tough three-way battle in Michigan against Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee. Not only did support for him among Republican voters plummet over the past month, but he was also viewed much less favorably than a month ago.
 Mr. McCain, a longtime maverick in his own party, was named by Republican primary voters in the survey as the candidate most likely to win his party's nomination. Thirty-nine percent of these primary voters saw Mr. McCain as the likely nominee. Only 11 percent saw Mr. Giuliani prevailing. 
 Mr. McCain's image ratings also have soared. More than half of the Republican primary voters (57 percent) -- including more than half of the conservatives -- viewed him favorably in the new poll, compared with 37 percent in December. 
 ''I don't always agree with him on all the issues,'' Jeff Little, a 34-year-old actuary and Republican from Apple Valley, Minn., said in an interview after he participated in the poll. ''But I feel he, more than most politicians, tells you what he thinks.'' 
 Patrick Herron, a 61-year-old retired social studies teacher from Syracuse, described Mr. McCain as ''more of a moderate.''
 ''He's willing to cross the aisles and work with the Democratic Party,'' said Mr. Herron, another poll participant.
 The poll showed a more stable Democratic race. Among Democratic primary voters nationally, Mrs. Clinton, of New York, remains the favorite of 42 percent, compared with 27 percent backing Mr. Obama, of Illinois -- essentially unchanged since December. John Edwards of North Carolina remains in third place at 11 percent.
 But there were auspicious signs for Mr. Obama as the contest moves to the South, where blacks account for a large share of the Democratic primary electorate.
 About half of black Democratic primary voters -- 49 percent -- said they planned to vote for Mr. Obama, while 34 percent said they backed Mrs. Clinton. Among white Democratic primary voters, 42 percent said they were supporting Mrs. Clinton, while 24 percent said they backed Mr. Obama. On the question of whether the country was ready for a black president, black voters were more skeptical than whites; 47 percent of blacks said the country was prepared to send a black person to the White House, while 56 percent of whites said they felt that way. A majority of whites and blacks, and men and women, considered the country ready for a woman president.
 The survey showed that Democratic voters see Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton as evenly matched on several leadership qualities, despite the efforts of both camps to draw distinctions. Virtually the same percentages of Democrats said Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama could unify the country and bring about ''real change.'' Both were given high marks as potential commanders in chief. 
 But Mrs. Clinton retains a strong edge on her readiness to be president. Nearly 8 in 10 Democratic primary voters said she had prepared herself well enough for the job and for all the issues that she might face. Only 40 percent said Mr. Obama had, and 53 percent said he needed a few more years to prepare.
 Many Democrats said Mrs. Clinton was not getting equal treatment from the news media. 
 Fifty-one percent of Democratic primary voters said the news media had been harder on Mrs. Clinton than on other candidates; 12 percent said the news media had been harder on Mr. Obama. Women were particularly likely to feel that she had been unfairly treated, while men were evenly divided. 
 Still, there are signs of resistance to another Clinton administration. Thirty-eight percent said they thought it was bad for two families -- the Bushes and the Clintons -- to hold the presidency for so long. 
 Over all, Democrats appeared to be more intense than Republicans as the election year begins. Fifty-eight percent of the Democrats said they were more enthusiastic than usual about voting this year, compared with 32 percent of the Republicans.

HEADLINE: Romney Embraces His Michigan Roots

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: SOUTHFIELD, Mich. 

 BODY:
Wherever Mitt Romney goes in Michigan, he tells the story of the gift his sons gave him for his 60th birthday last year: a 1962 Rambler.
 Mr. Romney's father, George, was the president of American Motors, which owned the Rambler line, until 1962, when he was elected governor of Michigan.
 The birthday Rambler had no seat belts, the defroster did not work, it handled like a farm implement and it had to be pushed home, Mr. Romney says to knowing laughs from his Michigan audiences, well aware of the Rambler brand's less-than-sterling reputation for quality. 
 His father was a car guy, Mr. Romney reminds crowds here, adding that he grew up going to the Detroit auto show, and that he knew what it took to create and save manufacturing jobs. 
 But the lessons those audiences draw may be different from what Mr. Romney intends. American Motors killed the tarnished Rambler brand in 1969 before it, too, succumbed in a merger with Chrysler in 1987.
 Is Mitt Romney's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination about to go the way of the Rambler?
 Although Mr. Romney insists the campaign will continue even if he does not win Michigan's primary on Tuesday, this state clearly holds the best hope for salvaging a candidacy that so far has failed to catch fire. Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and a successful venture capitalist, finished second in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, and is competitive here, according to a number of recent polls.
 But his standing nationally is plummeting against his chief rivals, Senator John McCain of Arizona, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas.
 Mr. Romney is supported by 8 percent of Republican primary voters in the latest New York Times/CBS News national poll, half the number of a month ago.
 And fewer Republican voters now express a positive opinion of him. Twenty-three percent say they have a favorable view of Mr. Romney, while 27 percent view him unfavorably (the rest had no opinion). Last month, 36 percent expressed a positive opinion of him, while 16 percent viewed him negatively. 
 Mr. Romney's name recognition and favorability ratings are higher in Michigan than nationally, according to local polls. But he is still locked in a close contest with Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee and it would be difficult for him to recover from a defeat here. 
 It is perhaps in recognition of the stakes that Mr. Romney is campaigning here with a vigor and sense of purpose seldom seen before. His crowds have been growing in size and intensity in recent days, and he seems to be feeding off them. 
 From Traverse City in the northern lake region to St. Joseph and Battle Creek along the southern border, Mr. Romney is hitting hard on his Michigan roots and his family ties here. At the Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, a Detroit suburb, on Sunday, he started with a well-worn story about how his father, campaigning for governor in 1962, confused two Michigan towns, Mount Clemens and Mount Pleasant.
 He then went into a litany of things he remembered and loved about Michigan, where he spent the first 18 years of his life before relocating to Massachusetts for college and a business career.
 ''Here in Michigan, the skies are cloudy all day, the trees are all the right height, people talk without an accent and most of the cars on the road are American made -- as they ought to be,'' he said. The crowd likes that line.
 Delving further into local lore and language, he noted that, in Michigan, ''<0>'pop' refers to a drink, not a relative, and Vernors of course is the best ginger ale in the world.''
 In Michigan, his campaign style is less robotic than it has been elsewhere. Gone are the PowerPoint presentations and the 12-point to-do list, replaced by an embrace of his family ties and his empathy for hard-up autoworkers and homeowners. He never fails to mention that his father and his mother, Lenore, who ran for the Senate in 1970, are buried here.
 On Saturday, he stopped at the Marshall, Mich., home of Elizabeth Sachs, an unemployed 51-year-old mother of two sons who is trying to sell her home to move to Florida to find work. 
 Mr. Romney, whose campaign is built around his business prowess and not his human touch, hugged Ms. Sachs and promised to help her and thousands like her who have lost their jobs to outsourcing and downsizing.
 ''Don't listen to anybody who says those jobs aren't coming back,'' he said as he sat with her at her kitchen table. ''I'm not willing to accept that.''
 Mr. Romney's wife, Ann, whom he met in high school when they were growing up in the affluent Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills, has accompanied him on the trail in recent days to add a family gloss and further evidence of his Michigan ties.
 Mr. Romney tells his crowds that shortly before announcing his candidacy a year ago (in Dearborn, Mich.) he said to her: ''Ann, in your wildest dreams, did you ever see me running for president of the United States? And she said, 'Mitt, you weren't in my wildest dreams.'<0>''

HEADLINE: G.M. Buys Stake in Maker of Ethanol From Waste

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
General Motors, eager to ensure a supply of fuel for the big fleet of flex-fuel ethanol-capable vehicles it is building, has joined the rush into alternative energy and invested in a company that intends to produce ethanol from crop wastes, wood chips, scrap plastic, rubber and even municipal garbage.
 Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, announced the investment on Sunday in a speech at the opening of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The company purchased an equity stake in Coskata, a start-up company in Warrenville, Ill., that plans to make ethanol without using corn. G.M. would not say how much it paid or how big a stake it took in the company. 
 Coskata plans to build a pilot-scale plant this year in Warrenville, William Roe, the president and chief executive of Coskata, said in a briefing with reporters last week. It has demonstrated all the phases of its technology but has not linked them together in an operating plant, he acknowledged.
 Putting money into the fuel business is new for car companies, said Jeffrey Leetsma, the president of the Automotive Hall of Fame, in Dearborn, Mich., and a car historian. ''I think this could be new ground,'' he said.
 Henry Ford, he said, established rubber plantations in Brazil to try to break the Dutch cartel, but in the modern era the car companies have generally not invested in fuel. 
 ''I don't really see the logic of it,'' said Christopher Flavin, president of the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington environmental group. ''It's not particularly an industry they know well, or have expertise in.'' Companies like G.M., he said, could be more effective by concentrating on the fuel efficiency of their products.. 
 But Lee Schipper, a visiting scholar at the transportation center of the University of California, Berkeley, said that a new method to make ethanol ''presents them with a way of wiggling the industry out of fuel economy standards.'' California is seeking a standard based on how much carbon is added to the atmosphere, he said, and ethanol made from waste materials could result in substantially less carbon per mile. 
 ''If I were that company and I really believed in the process, why wait for someone else to invest?'' he said.
 Coskata is one of many companies, and far from the leader, in an emerging world of start-up firms that are making alternative fuels with a mix-and-match approach to existing technologies. In Coskata's case it is a combination of gasification and bacterial action. 
 The first step is cooking the raw feedstock into synthesis gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. That gas is cooled and fed to bacteria that consume it and excrete ethanol.
 Coskata is not the only company pursuing the gas-to-bacteria-to-fuel route, but claims its process gives more ethanol per ton of raw material -- 100 gallons -- and uses less water, less than one gallon for each gallon of ethanol. 
 If it can be done economically, the Coskata process has three large advantages over corn-based ethanol, according to General Motors. First, it uses a cheaper feedstock that would not compete with food production. Second, the feedstock is available all over the country, a crucial point since ethanol cannot be shipped from the corn belt to areas of high gasoline demand in existing pipelines. 
 In addition, the process appears to require less electricity and natural gas, meaning that making it would not release as much carbon. The product would qualify for a federal tax exemption for ethanol. 
 Mr. Roe said that ''at full production, Coskata ethanol should be 50 cents to $1 cheaper than gasoline at the pump,'' and that the total production cost would be under $1 a gallon when the fuel begins flowing in 2010 or 2011. Mary Beth Stanek, G.M.'s director for energy and environment, said the process showed ''near-term readiness'' and that no scientific work was involved to commercialize it. 
 ''It's literally just physical building,'' she said. Her company intends to help get the fuel into pumps around the country, she said. Many of G.M.'s vehicles are already capable of running on a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, but that fuel has not become widely available. Most ethanol is used in a blend with 90 percent gasoline.
 Coskata is financed in part by Vinod Khosla, the computer entrepreneur turned venture capitalist, but is only one of the companies he is backing to produce ethanol without corn.

HEADLINE: When the Hospital Is the Ailing One

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''A Safety-Net Hospital Falls Into Financial Crisis'' (front page, Jan. 8):
The story of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and its inability to sustain itself through providing extensive charity care underlies arguments in favor of a single-payer health care system.
 Such a system would ensure that all hospitals -- public and private -- would be reimbursed for their services because it would eliminate the uninsured. 
 While there is resistance to universal health care perpetuated by insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and Republican politicians, the fact is that such a system would be the most equitable -- economically, socially, politically and ethically.
 Stephen Hemrick Boston, Jan. 8, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article about Grady Memorial Hospital cut an accurate picture of how north Georgia is about to eliminate public assistance health care by moving it to the nonprofit sector. 
 Many readers will perceive that this tragedy will be solved by transferring it from public to nonprofit hands, and this reasoning has dominated the local news. 
 Make no mistake, however; this is a mean-spirited process to eliminate taxpayer-financed health care that is linked to regional attitudes about illegal immigrants, never mind the age-old attitudes toward the destitute and poor, whether black or white. 
 Atlanta has grown and attracted a diverse population, but concepts of the greater good and civil responsibility remain provincial. Race, ethnicity and the perception of ''something for nothing'' trump the debate where compassion and the actual need to have a regional public health care facility are so obvious.
 A multicounty regional board with tax authority should have set Grady on the proper course long ago, demanding sales or property tax funds in proportion to usage. Instead, we have an unfortunate situation in a city that has resources but neither the will nor the empathy to accept social responsibility for the people on whose shoulders it sits. 
 This is really a consistent pattern of an Atlanta and north Georgia fiasco, whether traffic, water, development, urban planning or, now, health care delivery. 
 Edward S. Mocarski Jr. Atlanta, Jan. 8, 2008 The writer is a professor at Emory University School of Medicine.
 To the Editor:
 Your article about Grady Memorial Hospital captures many of the forces aligned against the success of public hospitals. After running two of our country's largest government health systems, I have found that several forces merit special attention and public policy actions.
 Public health care systems must separate policy from operations. Operating a health care system is difficult for experienced executives reporting to a knowledgeable board of directors. It may be impossible if a political process interferes with operational details. 
 Operations should be insulated from politics by an independent board with expertise relevant to health care. Political processes are needed to determine whose care and what services are covered by government funds and to assure that high-quality services are delivered. 
 Public hospitals are important teaching institutions, but they have disproportionately fewer patients on Medicare and more patients who are uninsured or on Medicaid than private hospitals. Resident training support should not be tied to Medicare or should be adjusted for public safety-net hospitals. An exception for pediatric residencies is already law.
 Both public and private hospitals would benefit from a fundamental reform of health care, especially if that reform were focused on how care is organized and delivered as much or more than on how it is financed.
 Thomas L. Garthwaite Newtown Square, Pa., Jan. 11, 2008 The writer, a former under secretary for health for the Department of Veterans Affairs and former director of health for the County of Los Angeles, is executive vice president and chief medical officer of Catholic Health East.
 To the Editor:
 Grady Memorial Hospital is struggling (as are many other hospitals throughout the United States), and what perplexes me is how much wealth is in our country that could be tapped into from philanthropist and fund-raising.
 And it boggles my mind that if just a meager percentage of the money that is spent on the many venues of entertainment, advertising, sports and so on went toward fund-raising for these hospitals, they might be able to at least have equipment that functions -- like X-ray machines -- that could save a life and prevent these hospitals from fighting lawsuits that continue to suck up our health care system, and that we all greatly need in our neighborhoods. 
 Our medical staffs are working with increased patient loads and doing their absolute best, but it is time for the folks out there to start supporting the network around them that is beginning to fall apart. 
 Our values are and continue to be directed, or misdirected, in the wrong areas, and we have to begin to care about human life again. 
 It is time for change -- but change begins with ourselves first.
 Donna Spiegel Nyack, N.Y., Jan. 9, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Grady Memorial Hospital story is a stark reminder of public hospitals' precarious financial footing.
 Grady and other essential safety-net hospitals may be pushed over the brink by pending federal regulations that would slash financing to public hospitals by $5 billion over five years. 
 New York City's public hospital system, the largest in the country, provides health care to 1.3 million New Yorkers every year, and nearly 400,000 are uninsured. 
 Like other public hospitals, New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation provides critical yet unprofitable services such as trauma centers, neonatal intensive care units, burn beds and disaster response capabilities. 
 Public hospitals provide access to everyone; eliminating their financing would only exacerbate America's health care crisis. Congress has four months to stop these devastating cuts from taking effect on May 25, when a moratorium on them imposed by Congress expires. If it does not act, the result will be catastrophic for millions of Americans.
 Alan D. Aviles New York, Jan. 9, 2008 The writer is president of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.

Author(s):
Sarah Kavanagh, The New York Times Learning Network
Andrea Brothman, the Bank Street College of Education in New York
Suggested Time Allowance:
One hour
Objectives:
Students will:
1. Reflect on historical explorers and discuss reasons why people attempt heroic and challenging endeavors.
2. Consider Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's successful summit of Mount Everest by reading and discussing "A Mountaineer Who Defined the Notion of Heroic Explorer."
3. Conduct research to design a board game that teaches about the history and nature of exploration, heroism, pioneering and discovery.
4. Create the board game that they designed in class.
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
-paper
-student journals
-classroom board
-computers with Internet access (optional)
-copies of the article "A Mountaineer Who Defined the Notion of Heroic Explorer," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20080114monday.html (one per student)
-resources for researching historical explorations
Activities / Procedures:
Note to Teacher: Depending on your curriculum and how much time you wish to devote to the history of exploration, this lesson could take anywhere between a day and a week to complete. It can be easily altered to suit the needs of your curriculum.
1. Warm-Up/Do Now: Upon entering class, provide each student with the following lists of explorers and feats of exploration, and give them three minutes, working individually, to match each explorer with the place that they explored:
Explorers:
a. Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong
b. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay
c. Ferdinand Magellan
d. Roald Amundsen
e. Charles Lindbergh
f. Matthew Webb
g. Yuri Gagarin
h. Vasco da Gama
Feats:
i. First in space
ii. First to reach the South Pole
iii. First to reach the summit of Mount Everest
iv. First to circumnavigate the Earth
v. First to fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean
vi. First to sail directly from Europe to India around the southern tip of Africa
vii. First to walk on the moon
viii. First to swim across the English Channel
Once all students have had a chance to match the explorers with their feats of exploration, provide students with the correct answers (a-vii, b-iii, c-iv, d-ii, e-v, f-viii, g-i, h-vi). Ask students why they think these people attempted these risky endeavors. What benefits emerged from their accomplishments? Would your students put their lives on the line to do any of these things? Why or why not?
2. As a class, read and discuss the article "A Mountaineer Who Defined the Notion of Heroic Explorer" (), focusing on the following questions:
a. What did Sir Edmund Hillary accomplish in 1953?
b. Who achieved this accomplishment with him?
c. Given that "in their success, no new knowledge was added to humanity's store [and] nobody's life was transformed," do you think the trek was worth it? Why or why not?
d. How has climbing Mount Everest changed over time?
e. What does it mean that "Expeditions have been undertaken just to remove the accumulated detritus on the slopes"?
f. Do you think that there is "something almost nostalgic in our celebration of a 'heroic explorer'"? Why or why not?
g. How did Hillary and Norgay's expedition mark the end of Britain's imperial exploration and expansion?
h. How have explorers and claims to territory been linked with cruelty and bribery?
i. What do you think the author of the article means by "the postmodern pioneer"?
j. How has exploration changed over time?
k. What is the "hybrid explorer" that Hillary was trying to shape?
l. What do you think makes somebody a hero? A pioneer?
m. Do you think that "because it's there" is a good reason to attempt a challenge? Is it important to conquer the unconquered in the first place?
n. Do you think that extreme sports are just thrill rides, or are they pushing human experience to new planes?
3. Inform your students that they will be creating board games about the nature of exploration throughout history. If you wish, you can present this activity as a competition to see which groups can create the most compelling games, most likely to be played in coming years by younger students. Split the class into small groups of three to four students each. Provide each group with a research worksheet with the following directions and questions:
Object:
Work within your group to design a board game that:
-Teaches players about the history of human attempts at major challenges.
-Prompts players to think about the nature of exploration, heroism, pioneering and discovery.
Feats:
Incorporate in your game some or all of the following feats of exploration (this list may be altered to reflect explorations covered in the course curriculum):
-Walk on the moon
-Reach the summit of Mount Everest
-Circumnavigate the earth
-Reach the South Pole
-Fly non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean
-Swim across the English Channel
-Travel into space
-Fly non-stop across the Pacific Ocean
-Reach the North Pole
-Travel the width of North America over land
-Sail from Europe around the Southern tip of Africa
Tasks
Find the answers to the following questions/tasks using all available classroom resources, including textbooks and the Internet:
-Describe some attempts to achieve these goals. Include names of important people, dates and the circumstances surrounding the attempt.
-Describe the first successful attempts at each goal.
-What are the dangers of attempting these feats of exploration?
-What steps must one take to successfully complete these challenges today?
-How has attempting these challenges changed over time?
Tips
Here are some examples of ways that your game can incorporate these required aspects; feel free to use ideas from these examples or come up with your own ideas:
-- Make your game have a "choose your own adventure" aspect in which players are asked to answer multiple choice questions about why they would attempt one or more chosen feats of exploration (a. because it's there, b. to claim glory for my country, c. to claim glory for myself, d. to raise money for an important cause, etc.). Depending on how they answer, they progress to a different part of the game. This would force players to grapple with important questions about the nature of exploration and heroism.
-- Make players move through a timeline of the history of your chosen feats of exploration and take advice from historical figures along the way. This would provide players with information about the history of exploration.
-- Provide players with research materials about moments in the history of exploration and then have them play a game in which opposing teams guess which aspects of history are being drawn or acted out (similar to Pictionary or charades). This would force players to try to remember facts, events and people associated with your topic because they would be asked to recall this information later in the game.
Planning
Include the following bits of information, as well as an overview of the game, on a handout to be provided for players:
-What aspects of history will your game illustrate to players? (Remember, your game should touch on as many important facts, people and events as possible).
-How will players be asked to tackle questions about the nature of heroism, exploration, pioneering or discovery within your game?
-Will your game have game pieces? If so, what will they be (historical figures, contemporary explorers, materials needed in order to attempt your chosen feat of exploration, etc.)?
-What is the game objective (to achieve the feat of exploration, to answer the most trivia questions correctly, etc.)? Think about the objectives of games you are familiar with. How might you be able to modify these objectives to suit your needs?
-How many players minimum and maximum can play?
-How does play proceed?
-How does the game end?
Once groups have completed their game-planning worksheets, have them make a list of game parts (board, cards, directions and rules, game pieces, trivia questions, etc.). Have groups decide which group members will be responsible for creating each part of the game.
In the remaining class time, bring the class together and ask them what they think are the most interesting aspects of the history of exploration. Why do they think people choose to attempt risky challenges? Are all people who make these attempts remembered? Which people have made their mark on exploration history? Why have they been remembered while others have not? Do modern-day explorers do what they do in order to make their mark in history? How has the nature of exploration changed over time?
4. Wrap-Up/Homework: Individually, students create their assigned part of the game. Provide class time another day for groups to assemble their games and troubleshoot them. When time allows, have groups play each others' games and, if desired, evaluate them on design, historical accuracy, how informative it is, the ease of play and whether they find it engaging and fun. The class can then decide as a group which games should be played by classes in following years.
Further Questions for Discussion:
-What is your definition of a hero?
-What would it take for you to attempt a life-threatening adventure?
-How does Sir Edmund Hillary's summit of Mount Everest relate to the United Kingdom's legacy of imperialism?
-Do you think Tenzing Norgay deserves the same acclaim that Sir Edmund Hillary has received? Why or why not?
Evaluation/Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on their initial journal entries, their participation in class and small group discussion, their teamwork in completing research and a game design, and their part in completing a board game that meets all the requirements.
Vocabulary:
descent, notion, predecessors, nonchalant, ascent, expedition, Sherpa, summit, accumulated, detritus, harrowing, plunging, crevasses, dwindling, subtle, pretense, pomposity, ecstatic, ornate, coronation, imperial, anomaly, venal, deferential, assertion
Extension Activities:
1. Research the life and accomplishments of one of the guides of a famous explorer or explorers, like Tenzing Norgay, Sacagawea or Melchor Arteaga. Create a poster that illustrates how this person earned a place in exploration history.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Geography -- Create a geographical profile of Nepal, including the population, the gross domestic product, the size, the biggest export, the predominant religion, the official language, etc. What role does Mount Everest play in the country's economy and culture?
Mathematics -- Research how tall Mount Everest is and how far someone can safely climb in one day. Figure out how long it would take the average person to safely climb Mount Everest from bottom to top. Figure out how many pounds of supplies climbers need to take with them and figure this load into your equations.
Science -- Create a poster that explains how the Himalayan Mountains were created. How long ago were they formed? Are they changing today? How?
Teaching with The Times -- Read The Times for articles about pioneering individuals in sports, business, politics, arts and so on. Choose one of these contemporary pioneers and create a profile of his or her life and achievements. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

HEADLINE: For the Laptop Toters, A Roomier Flight to Europe

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
BRITISH AIRWAYS announced its plans last week to join the new boutique premium-class airline game across the Atlantic. But it isn't bringing a lot of money to the table.
 In an interview, Dale Moss, a 30-year British Air veteran who is the managing director of the new subsidiary, OpenSkies, discussed the strategy behind a bid for the high-end market at a time the American economy seems to be in for some turbulence.
 First, the basics. As reported here previously, OpenSkies will start small, with a single Boeing 757 from British Airways' fleet. 
 Starting in June, OpenSkies will fly the 757 (with another to be added late this year and four more by the end of 2009, when new routes are planned) configured with 82 seats. Business class will have 24 flat-bed seats; behind that will be 28 ''premium economy'' seats with 52 inches of legroom; and -- in a move that some competitors say they find confounding -- there will be 30 coach seats in five rows.
 The initial route has not been set yet, partly because of uncertainty about whether Newark will have to be the fallback if a landing slot cannot be freed at Kennedy International Airport. Nor has British Air yet announced whether the European city will be Paris or Brussels, but it will be one of the two, and the other will be added later.
 The bet, which would have good odds in a growing economy, is that business travel between Europe and the United States is growing and that premium or mostly premium niche carriers can take a chunk of that market with lower fares and attractive products.
 MaxJet, one of two carriers that started up on the high-competition New York-to-London route two years ago, went out of business on Dec. 24, after what competitors said was an overexpansion of its routes.
 The other start-ups flying between New York/Newark and London -- Eos and Silverjet -- say they are in good shape and are developing loyal corporate travel bases. So does l'Avion, a start-up airline that began flying between Paris and Newark early last year.
 One marketing key, said Mr. Moss, is attracting business from the rapidly growing ranks of smaller companies and the self-employed in both Europe and the United States.
 ''We're really gearing ourselves for the medium-size corporations, smaller companies and entrepreneurs,'' Mr. Moss said. ''I really believe that's our customer base, those companies and entrepreneurs who can't get the really great deals'' that big-volume corporations can negotiate with the major airlines.
 ''It's amazing how many small businesses there are,'' he said. ''We have a little temporary office in Blue Bell, Pa., in a campus filed with hundreds of offices -- all filled with businesses of two to 10 people.''
 Another bet is that the core customers for these airlines have been traveling more frequently to and from Europe, at least for now, and that the extra cost for a premium seat will continue to be seen as justifiable. 
 ''If you're a road warrior doing 20 or 25 trans-Atlantics a year, let me tell you, you can't do that from a coach seat without beating your body up,'' Mr. Moss said. ''Road warriors today go from airplane to meeting, and go right back on an airplane. They take their laptops with them. They try to sleep. It's hard to do that in a 3-by-3 configuration. What we want to try to do is provide them a sense of a little more room, not luxury, but a little more product.'' 
 Mr. Moss said that he could not discuss pricing yet, but he said that OpenSkies -- whose later routes will include Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid -- would be ''extraordinarily competitive.''
 Other people involved with the development of the airline told me that the decision to put in a token economy section was hotly debated, with the traditionalists insisting on including coach seats, if only to lure budget-minded customers who could be persuaded to upgrade next time.
 ''This is a predominantly premium airline,'' Mr. Moss said when asked about the coach seats. ''And if we get a customer base that's that strong, let me tell you it would be the easiest thing in the world to take those 30 seats out and fill it with what is appropriate.''

HEADLINE: Mentally Ill and Homeless, Worker Fights to Regain Her Life

BYLINE: By ALEXIS REHRMANN

 BODY:
With her understated makeup, pressed pantsuit and soft-spoken manner, it is easy to imagine Allison Brito at her job, behind a jewelry counter at Macy's. 
 It is harder to imagine Ms. Brito, 43, leaving work each night and returning to a bed at a shelter in East New York, Brooklyn, where she has been living since July, when she arrived at Transitional Living Community. The program has 40 beds in the shelter for chronically homeless or mentally ill women. 
 Ms. Brito has been grappling with mental illness for a decade, but the homelessness is new. 
 ''I didn't know that there's such a life as in a shelter,'' she said. ''Anything can happen at any given time: a lot of outbursts, a lot of fighting, a lot of arguing. A lot of days you would just see the E.M.S. coming to take someone down, and it's scary.''
 Ten years ago, Ms. Brito worked as an office manager. She lived with her husband and their two boys in Brooklyn and was training to become a minister at her church.
 Fasting, as part of her religious training, sent her to the hospital for the first time. 
 Ms. Brito stopped eating, stopped sleeping and lost her sense of reason. She does not blame her church, but says the initial fasting seemed to cause the onset of her illness. She explained how it seemed at the time: ''I have no sense of what to do next. I just stay in a still mode and practically do nothing.''
 Emergency medical workers have had to pick her up at least six times since then, she said. 
 In April 2007, Ms. Brito was hospitalized again, for what she hopes is the last time. She received a new diagnosis of major depression, and was given new medication that is working, she said. 
 If her mental health stabilizes, Ms. Brito may be able to recover some of the life that she has lost. 
 She was divorced in 2003. At first, she had custody of her children, but after she was briefly hospitalized at the end of 2004, her ex-husband took custody. She began paying $750 a month in child support, moving into ever-smaller apartments to afford the payments on her $19.50 hourly wage. 
 She had kept her office manager position for about 15 years, until the hospitalization in April, when she was let go, she said.
 Without her job, she lost her apartment and could not afford to retrieve her things from storage. When she was discharged, she came to Transitional Living Community. 
 Ms. Brito was hired at Macy's for part-time seasonal work over the holidays, although her manager is keeping her on in the new year. She works part time, at $7.50 an hour, and for now earns about $280 a month, including some unemployment benefits, and pays $25 a month in child support.
 ''When I'm at work, I focus on work, and it's easy that way,'' she said. But she wishes she could take that feeling back to the shelter with her. ''It's hard when I walk through the door, because I need to do the coat check and the bag check and sign in like everybody else. Come in and take my meds, just like everybody else.'' 
 She sleeps in a dormitory with nine other women. Lights are out after 11, and she hangs her suit back in her locker quietly. 
 The center is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and $150 from the fund was used to buy professional clothing for Ms. Brito: two pantsuits, two skirts and two jackets. Ms. Brito is eager to find full-time work. 
 ''Work is important to me,'' she said.
 Mostly, she hopes that a full-time job, along with rental assistance, which Transitional Living Community is helping her apply for, might make a two-bedroom apartment possible. That would give her the chance to have her younger son back before he becomes an adult. Her older son turned 18 in December, and the younger is 14. 
 He asks, ''Mommy, when are we getting our own apartment?' Ms. Brito said. ''When he says 'our,' it makes me feel bad because he's so hopeful, and he keeps my faith up a lot.'' 
 After everything she has lost, remembering her son's hope brings tears to Ms. Brito's eyes.

HEADLINE: Commodities' Relentless Surge

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
The price of copper has tripled in five years. Zinc has doubled. Wheat and soybeans rose 70 percent in 2007. Futures prices of crude oil, gold, silver, lead, uranium, cattle, cocoa and corn are all at or near records.
 A global boom in the cost of commodities, the staple ingredients of a modern economy, is entering its sixth year with no end in sight. Commodities have always been subject to boom-and-bust cycles, but many economists see a fundamental shift driving the markets these days.
 As development rolls across once-destitute countries at a breakneck pace, lifting billions out of poverty, demand for food, metals and fuel is red-hot, and suppliers are struggling to meet it. Prices are spiraling, and Americans find themselves in what amounts to a bidding war with overseas buyers for products as diverse as milk and gasoline.
 ''It is absolutely a fundamental change in the global economic structure,'' said Bart Melek, global commodities strategist for BMO Capital Markets, an investment firm based in Toronto. ''Global commodities ranging from oil to base metals to grains are moving higher as billions of people in China and around the world get wealthier and are consuming more as they produce products for us, and increasingly for themselves.'' 
 Now, with the United States economy slowing, the question is what happens next. One possibility is that a recession in this country, should it occur, would suppress demand enough that commodity prices would fall substantially for the first time in several years. But many economists argue that demand overseas would keep prices high even with a recession in the United States. That would compound the economic pain for Americans, forcing them to continue paying a premium at the meat counter and the gas pump even as their paychecks suffered.
 These economists say it will be hard to stop the ascent in commodity prices because it is connected more than at any other time in recent years to events beyond the United States, particularly the industrialization of China, and to a lesser extent of India, and in booming oil economies like Saudi Arabia and Russia.
 ''The world is coming alive and the lights are coming on across Asia,'' said James Glassman, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''What we are dealing with is a tremendous demand for resources.''
 Meeting that demand is becoming more difficult. Oil is no longer easy to find, and the cost of producing it is escalating. Droughts and in places excessive rain have produced sporadic grain shortages; some scientists link such extremes in weather to global warming and the rising use of fossil fuel.
 The biggest single factor increasing commodity prices is China's rush to construct factories, other buildings and roads to satisfy a growing, increasingly middle-class urban population with a taste for cars and other consumer goods.
 China today has 7,000 steel factories, double the number in 2002. Every new factory needs electricity, which means that power plants must be built. More diesel-powered trains are required to get the coal to the power plants, and more trucks and expanded ports are needed to move the steel to market.
 China's industrial revolution caused an increase in crude oil consumption to 7.5 million barrels a day last year from 5.5 million barrels in 2003, according to the International Energy Agency, representing 31 percent of the total rise in global demand. Over the same period, China was responsible for 64 percent of the increased global demand for copper, 70 percent of that for aluminum and 82 percent for zinc.
 The Chinese economy grew well over 10 percent last year, compared with an American growth rate of perhaps 2.5 percent. China has grown briskly since 1982, when Communist leaders began to revamp the economy. India's economy is growing almost as fast, in large part from a surge in domestic consumption. 
 The International Energy Agency projects that China and India combined may increase their oil consumption to 23.1 million barrels in 2030 from 9.3 million a day in 2005. The demand for oil is also growing in big developing countries like Russia and Mexico, where car ownership is rapidly rising.
 That global demand lifts both metals and food prices. Vast construction projects to dig up oil sands in Canada and drill for conventional oil across the Middle East and Africa are under way, driving up the price of steel. 
 As fuel costs go up, countries like the United States and Brazil look for alternatives like biofuels. The ethanol boom in the Midwest has driven up the price of corn. Since corn is a vital feed product for animals, the prices of meat and milk have followed. The prices of other grains are going up as their acreage is supplanted by corn.
 ''You are trying to feed people, cattle and cars, so you have this global fight between food and energy,'' said Michael Lewis, global head of commodities research at Deutsche Bank. He noted that the United States was responsible for 60 percent of the increase in the global demand for corn last year, which he said resulted primarily from the rapid expansion of ethanol production.
 The rise in commodity prices is accompanying a broadening of the middle class in many countries, but recent protests in Mexico after a steep climb in tortilla prices showed that not everyone stands to gain. The world's poor spend a large percentage of their income on food, so higher grain prices tend to hit them hard.
 Consumers in the United States have less to spend at the mall when they pay $3 a gallon for gasoline. The national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline has climbed to $3.07 from $2.24 a year ago, according to AAA, the automobile club, while a gallon of diesel fuel has climbed to $3.43 a gallon from $2.61.
 Price shock has also accompanied trips to the supermarket. According to preliminary estimates by the Department of Agriculture for 2007, beef and veal prices rose 4.5 percent, poultry 5.2 percent, dairy products 7.4 percent and eggs 28 percent. The department is projecting increases for many food items this year, although it says that they may ease for those that rose the most in 2007. Experts, though, say that similar sustained food inflation has not been seen in the United States since 1990. 
 Economists and some others say the continuing boom in commodities prices may slow this year, if for no other reason than the 2007 pace for many crucial commodities -- up 57 percent for crude oil and more than 70 percent for wheat and soybeans -- was so stunning. Since the 2001 recession, the Commodity Research Bureau's broad price index has risen by 100 percent.
 ''I would temper wild-eyed bulls who think China can grow at 10 percent plus without a strong United States,'' said Adam Robinson, an energy analyst at Lehman Brothers. He said that China, which was an importer of steel and aluminum as recently as 2002, is now an important exporter of both to the United States and Europe and that some of the new steel factories could fail if there was a global recession.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Robinson said commodities prices would probably remain steady in 2008 and possibly slide in 2009. The prices of many, if not most, major commodities -- including nickel, copper, sugar, silver, cocoa and coffee -- have continued their climb so far this year.
 ''Demand will be very difficult to slow down unless you take a very bearish view on the long-term global economy,'' Mr. Robinson added.

HEADLINE: Waterfalls For New York Citys Waterfront

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Four man-made waterfalls, 90 to 120 feet high, will punctuate New York's waterfront for three months starting in mid-July. The creation of the Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson, the project is a collaboration between the city and the Public Art Fund, the nonprofit organization that presents art around the city. The waterfalls (above, in a rendering) have been designed to be environmentally friendly and will be in New York Harbor at Pier 35 in Lower Manhattan, at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge and between Piers 4 and 5 in Brooklyn and at Governors Island. Money for the project, estimated to cost about $15 million, comes entirely from private funds, and the Economic Development Corporation estimates that the waterfalls will bring more than $50 million to the city's economy. ''Throughout history we have always taken water for granted,'' said Mr. Eliasson in a telephone interview from his Berlin studio. ''Now people can engage in the physical nature of something as epic as a waterfall.''

HEADLINE: Strong Sales Overseas Buoy I.B.M.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
A slowing American economy is not hurting I.B.M. yet.
 But the strength of the technology giant's quarterly profit -- up 24 percent -- may not be as reliable an indicator of broader trends in the American economy as in the past. I.B.M.'s business lies increasingly outside the United States, and the company no longer sells products like personal computers to consumers. 
 The news Monday morning that earnings were far higher than analysts predicted pushed shares of International Business Machines sharply higher, rising $5.26, or 5.4 percent, to $102.93. The I.B.M. announcement also lifted the broader market on the belief that corporate spending on technology is holding up far better than people had thought. 
 The strong fourth-quarter performance by I.B.M., analysts say, is mainly a sign that some leading global corporations may be able to sidestep the impact of a sputtering United States economy because they depend on the American market far less today than in the past.
 The largest American corporations get more than half of their revenues from overseas markets. That is true of many large technology companies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard. I.B.M., a longtime multinational, is a leader in the current globalization trend to tap overseas markets and talent. Today, two-thirds of I.B.M.'s sales and its workers are outside the United States.
 ''I.B.M. has the most aggressive internationalization strategy of any of the major information technology companies,'' said Frank Gens, chief analyst of IDC, a research firm. But he also noted: ''I.B.M. isn't a bellwether of the U.S. economy.''
 In the United States, technology spending will increase in 2008 by only 3 or 4 percent, a slowdown from a 6.5 percent rise last year, IDC estimates. Corporate investment in computer hardware, software and services is expected to taper off in response to a weaker economy. And the financial sector, a big spender on technology, will likely be soft because of losses from the housing credit squeeze. 
 In a statement, I.B.M.'s chief executive, Samuel J. Palmisano, said the company's results were driven by ''the broad scope of I.B.M.'s global business -- led by strong operational performance in Asia, Europe and emerging countries.'' There was no mention of the American market. 
 In recent years, I.B.M. has greatly expanded its business and employment in fast-growing markets like India, China, Brazil and Russia. The company, for example, has 75,000 workers in India and 13,000 in China. 
 Last month, I.B.M. announced it would invest an additional $1.6 billion this year to pursue opportunities in the next tier of emerging markets, including Ukraine, Vietnam, Ecuador, Venezuela, Poland and the Czech Republic. 
 The globalization trend, some analysts say, may be moderating the spending cutbacks at large American companies. In the recession six years ago, corporations typically made deep cuts in their technology budgets across their companies' operations. 
 Gary Beach, publisher emeritus of CIO Magazine, said that based on surveys done by his magazine and conversations he has had with corporate managers, things will be different in this downswing.
 ''The cuts will be much more selective this time,'' Mr. Beach said. ''Companies are not going to cut back on the technology investments they need to remain competitive because now they compete globally.'' 
 I.B.M. released its financial results three days ahead of scheduled. Over the last few days, I.B.M. executives recognized that the fourth-quarter results coming in from its worldwide operations would be well above Wall Street's consensus estimates. 
 ''Given the economic climate, where there has been a lot of speculation about market conditions and the performance of technology companies, we wanted to get this information to investors quickly,'' an I.B.M. spokesman, Edward Barbini, said. 
 The conference call with analysts, when I.B.M. executives will explain the company's performance in detail, will wait until Thursday afternoon. 
 In its preliminary announcement, I.B.M. said its quarterly profit had increased 24 percent, to $2.80 a share, while revenue rose 10 percent, to $28.9 billion. The company's profit was 20 cents a share above the consensus of analysts, as compiled by Thomson Financial. I.B.M.'s revenue was more than $1 billion higher than the consensus.
 Currency gains lifted I.B.M.'s results, accounting for more than half of its rise in revenue. Yet with so much of I.B.M.'s business abroad, analysts try to model the currency impact into their financial forecasts.
 Despite few details, industry analysts said I.B.M. apparently gained as well from software and services deals that had been delayed in the third quarter but closed in the fourth quarter. They noted the performance also underlined the solid execution of I.B.M. globalization strategy.
 ''It's very surprising,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. ''And the open question is whether the environment for technology was better than most people thought.''

HEADLINE: Amid Doubts, Europe May Ban Some Biofuels

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
In a sign of growing concern about the impact of supposedly ''green'' policies, European Union officials will propose a ban on imports of certain biofuels, according to a draft law to be unveiled next week.
 If approved by European governments, the law would prohibit the importation of fuels derived from crops grown on certain kinds of land -- including forests, wetlands or grasslands -- into the 27-nation bloc. 
 The draft law would also require that biofuels used in Europe deliver ''a minimum level of greenhouse gas savings.'' That level is still under discussion. 
 Currently, most of the crops for biofuels used in Europe consist of rapeseed (commonly known as canola in the United States) grown in parts of Europe, according to Matt Drinkwater, a biofuels analyst at New Energy Finance in London. Europe also imports some palm oil from Southeast Asia, soy from Latin America, ethanol from Brazil, and produces some ethanol domestically using wheat and sugar beets, he said. 
 The ban would primarily affect palm oil and possibly the Latin American imports.
 Amid rising prices for gasoline and diesel and worries about climate change, countries around the world have started using more fuels produced from crops or agricultural wastes.
 The amount of ethanol used in the United States represents about 5 percent of total gasoline consumption, according to Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association in Washington. Ethanol produced from sugar cane is widely used in Brazil. In Europe and to a lesser extent in the United States, vegetable oils have been converted into a type of diesel by a simple chemical procedure.
 But a flurry of studies has discredited some of the claims made by biofuel producers that the fuels help reduce greenhouse gases by reducing fossil fuel use and growing carbon-dioxide-consuming plants. Growing the crops and turning them into fuel can result in considerable environmental harm. 
 Not only is native vegetation, including tropical rain forests, being chopped down in places to plant the crops, but fossil fuels, like diesel for tractors, are often used to farm the crops. They also demand nitrogen fertilizer made largely with natural gas and consume huge amounts of water. 
 Already, the draining and deforesting of peatlands in Southeast Asia -- mainly to make way for palm plantations -- accounts for up to 8 percent of global annual carbon dioxide emissions, said Adrian Bebb of Friends of the Earth, an environmental group. 
 In Indonesia, he said, more than 18 million hectares of forest, or 44 million acres, have already been cleared for palm oil developments. Environmental groups say the developments are endangering wildlife like the orangutan and the Sumatran tiger, and putting pressure on indigenous peoples who depend on the forests.
 Western scientists are increasingly pointing out the need to distinguish between types of biofuels. On Monday, for instance, the Royal Society, a national science academy in Britain, said requirements to use a certain percentage of biofuels were not sufficient. Instead, the society said, there should be specific goals for emissions reductions.
 ''Indiscriminately increasing the amount of biofuels we are using may not automatically lead to the best reductions in emissions,'' said John Pickett, head of biological chemistry at Rothamsted Research, a research center in Britain, who helped write the report for the Royal Society. ''The greenhouse gas savings of each depends on how crops are grown and converted and how the fuel is used.''
 Last week, scientists at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Washington also warned that biofuel production can result in environmental destruction, pollution and damage to human health.
 ''Different biofuels vary enormously in how eco-friendly they are,'' said William Laurance, a staff scientist at the institute. ''We need to be smart and promote the right biofuels.'' 
 Experts say certain types of fuels, particularly those made from agricultural wastes, still hold potential to improve the environment, but they add that governments will have to set and enforce standards for how the fuels are produced. With its new proposal, Europe appears to be moving ahead of the rest of the world in that task.
 The draft law probably would have the greatest impact on palm oil growers in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, according to Mr. Drinkwater. 
 ''Some developments in Southeast Asia will almost certainly be blocked by these provisions,'' he said, adding that the rules would make it much harder to plant on recently deforested land or to export fuels whose production process cause significant amounts of greenhouse gases to be released.
 But farmers growing corn for ethanol could also be affected, because the European rules contain provisions on preserving grasslands, said Mr. Drinkwater.
 The text, which could change before European commissioners meet on Jan. 23 to adopt a final version, also emphasizes that areas like rain forests and lands with high levels of biodiversity should not be converted to growing biofuels. 
 The European Union does not want to completely abandon biofuels because they could still contribute to reducing Europe's dependence on fossil fuels. 
 In part, that is because biofuels -- a blanket term covering fuels grown from crops to manufacture substitutes for diesel and gasoline -- are seen as Europe's main weapon in lowering emissions from transportation. And transportation has the fastest growing levels of greenhouse gases among all sectors of Europe's economy.
 On Monday, in answer to a reporter's question, an organization representing major growers of crops for biofuels in Malaysia said the E.U. should be cautious before imposing new rules. It said that farmers in the region were adopting more sustainable practices, and warned that restrictions on imports could cause trade tensions. 
 ''The Malaysian government is very concerned about the E.U. scheme for sustainability of biofuels,'' said Zainuddin Hassan, the manager in Europe for the Malaysian Palm Oil Council in Brussels. The measures ''should not be a trade barrier to the palm oil industry and it should comply with the W.T.O. rules as well,'' he said, referring to the World Trade Organization. 
 Verifying that only environmentally sound biofuels are being imported into Europe would be left to individual countries. But the draft law calls for penalties for violating the rules, like exclusion from tax breaks, to be enforced across the region.
 The draft law also says that biofuels should be tracked from origin to use ''so that biofuels fulfilling the sustainability criteria can be identified and rewarded with a premium in the market.''
 The measures are part of a plan for Europe to implement a binding target of making 10 percent of the transport fuels consumed by 2020 from renewable sources -- most of which are expected to be biofuels. 
 Ferran Tarradellas Espuny, spokesman for Europe's energy commissioner, Andris Piebalgs, said that European countries that used more than 10 percent of biofuels in their transport fuel mix could use their progress to help them to reach other European environmental targets. Those include a goal of a 20-percent share of renewable sources in overall energy consumption by 2020.
 Europe already has a suggested target of making biofuels 5.75 percent of fuels used for transport by 2010. But that target is not going to met, according to the draft law. Biofuels were just 1 percent of transport fuel in 2005 and, if present trends continue, would account for 4.2 percent by 2010.

HEADLINE: Big Brain Theory: Have Cosmologists Lost Theirs?

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
It could be the weirdest and most embarrassing prediction in the history of cosmology, if not science. 
 If true, it would mean that you yourself reading this article are more likely to be some momentary fluctuation in a field of matter and energy out in space than a person with a real past born through billions of years of evolution in an orderly star-spangled cosmos. Your memories and the world you think you see around you are illusions. 
 This bizarre picture is the outcome of a recent series of calculations that take some of the bedrock theories and discoveries of modern cosmology to the limit. Nobody in the field believes that this is the way things really work, however. And so there in the last couple of years there has been a growing stream of debate and dueling papers, replete with references to such esoteric subjects as reincarnation, multiple universes and even the death of spacetime, as cosmologists try to square the predictions of their cherished theories with their convictions that we and the universe are real. The basic problem is that across the eons of time, the standard theories suggest, the universe can recur over and over again in an endless cycle of big bangs, but it's hard for nature to make a whole universe. It's much easier to make fragments of one, like planets, yourself maybe in a spacesuit or even -- in the most absurd and troubling example -- a naked brain floating in space. Nature tends to do what is easiest, from the standpoint of energy and probability. And so these fragments -- in particular the brains -- would appear far more frequently than real full-fledged universes, or than us. Or they might be us.
 Alan Guth, a cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who agrees this overabundance is absurd, pointed out that some calculations result in an infinite number of free-floating brains for every normal brain, making it ''infinitely unlikely for us to be normal brains.'' Welcome to what physicists call the Boltzmann brain problem, named after the 19th-century Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who suggested the mechanism by which such fluctuations could happen in a gas or in the universe. Cosmologists also refer to them as ''freaky observers,'' in contrast to regular or ''ordered'' observers of the cosmos like ourselves. Cosmologists are desperate to eliminate these freaks from their theories, but so far they can't even agree on how or even on whether they are making any progress.
 If you are inclined to skepticism this debate might seem like further evidence that cosmologists, who gave us dark matter, dark energy and speak with apparent aplomb about gazillions of parallel universes, have finally lost their minds. But the cosmologists say the brain problem serves as a valuable reality check as they contemplate the far, far future and zillions of bubble universes popping off from one another in an ever-increasing rush through eternity. What, for example is a ''typical'' observer in such a setup? If some atoms in another universe stick together briefly to look, talk and think exactly like you, is it really you?
 ''It is part of a much bigger set of questions about how to think about probabilities in an infinite universe in which everything that can occur, does occur, infinitely many times,'' said Leonard Susskind of Stanford, a co-author of a paper in 2002 that helped set off the debate. Or as Andrei Linde, another Stanford theorist given to colorful language, loosely characterized the possibility of a replica of your own brain forming out in space sometime, ''How do you compute the probability to be reincarnated to the probability of being born?''
 The Boltzmann brain problem arises from a string of logical conclusions that all spring from another deep and old question, namely why time seems to go in only one direction. Why can't you unscramble an egg? The fundamental laws governing the atoms bouncing off one another in the egg look the same whether time goes forward or backward. In this universe, at least, the future and the past are different and you can't remember who is going to win the Super Bowl next week. 
 ''When you break an egg and scramble it you are doing cosmology,'' said Sean Carroll, a cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology.
 Boltzmann ascribed this so-called arrow of time to the tendency of any collection of particles to spread out into the most random and useless configuration, in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics (sometimes paraphrased as ''things get worse''), which says that entropy, which is a measure of disorder or wasted energy, can never decrease in a closed system like the universe.
 If the universe was running down and entropy was increasing now, that was because the universe must have been highly ordered in the past.
 In Boltzmann's time the universe was presumed to have been around forever, in which case it would long ago have stabilized at a lukewarm temperature and died a ''heat death.'' It would already have maximum entropy, and so with no way to become more disorderly there would be no arrow of time. No life would be possible but that would be all right because life would be excruciatingly boring. Boltzmann said that entropy was all about odds, however, and if we waited long enough the random bumping of atoms would occasionally produce the cosmic equivalent of an egg unscrambling. A rare fluctuation would decrease the entropy in some place and start the arrow of time pointing and history flowing again. That is not what happened. Astronomers now know the universe has not lasted forever. It was born in the Big Bang, which somehow set the arrow of time, 14 billion years ago. The linchpin of the Big Bang is thought to be an explosive moment known as inflation, during which space became suffused with energy that had an antigravitational effect and ballooned violently outward, ironing the kinks and irregularities out of what is now the observable universe and endowing primordial chaos with order.
 Inflation is a veritable cosmological fertility principle. Fluctuations in the field driving inflation also would have seeded the universe with the lumps that eventually grew to be galaxies, stars and people. According to the more extended version, called eternal inflation, an endless array of bubble or ''pocket'' universes are branching off from one another at a dizzying and exponentially increasing rate. They could have different properties and perhaps even different laws of physics, so the story goes.
 A different, but perhaps related, form of antigravity, glibly dubbed dark energy, seems to be running the universe now, and that is the culprit responsible for the Boltzmann brains. 
 The expansion of the universe seems to be accelerating, making galaxies fly away from one another faster and faster. If the leading dark-energy suspect, a universal repulsion Einstein called the cosmological constant, is true, this runaway process will last forever, and distant galaxies will eventually be moving apart so quickly that they cannot communicate with one another. Being in such a space would be like being surrounded by a black hole.
 Rather than simply going to black like ''The Sopranos'' conclusion, however, the cosmic horizon would glow, emitting a feeble spray of elementary particles and radiation, with a temperature of a fraction of a billionth of a degree, courtesy of quantum uncertainty. That radiation bath will be subject to random fluctuations just like Boltzmann's eternal universe, however, and every once in a very long, long time, one of those fluctuations would be big enough to recreate the Big Bang. In the fullness of time this process could lead to the endless series of recurring universes. Our present universe could be part of that chain.
 In such a recurrent setup, however, Dr. Susskind of Stanford, Lisa Dyson, now of the University of California, Berkeley, and Matthew Kleban, now at New York University, pointed out in 2002 that Boltzmann's idea might work too well, filling the megaverse with more Boltzmann brains than universes or real people. 
 In the same way the odds of a real word showing up when you shake a box of Scrabble letters are greater than a whole sentence or paragraph forming, these ''regular'' universes would be vastly outnumbered by weird ones, including flawed variations on our own all the way down to naked brains, a result foreshadowed by Martin Rees, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge, in his 1997 book, ''Before the Beginning.''
 The conclusions of Dr. Dyson and her colleagues were quickly challenged by Andreas Albrecht and Lorenzo Sorbo of the University of California, Davis, who used an alternate approach. They found that the Big Bang was actually more likely than Boltzmann's brain.
 ''In the end, inflation saves us from Boltzmann's brain,'' Dr. Albrecht said, while admitting that the calculations were contentious. Indeed, the ''invasion of Boltzmann brains,'' as Dr. Linde once referred, was just beginning. 
 In an interview Dr. Linde described these brains as a form of reincarnation. Over the course of eternity, he said, anything is possible. After some Big Bang in the far future, he said, ''it's possible that you yourself will re-emerge. Eventually you will appear with your table and your computer.'' 
 But it's more likely, he went on, that you will be reincarnated as an isolated brain, without the baggage of stars and galaxies. In terms of probability, he said, ''It's cheaper.''
 You might wonder what's wrong with a few brains -- or even a preponderance of them -- floating around in space. For one thing, as observers these brains would see a freaky chaotic universe, unlike our own, which seems to persist in its promise and disappointment. 
 Another is that one of the central orthodoxies of cosmology is that humans don't occupy a special place in the cosmos, that we and our experiences are typical of cosmic beings. If the odds of us being real instead of Boltzmann brains are one in a million, say, waking up every day would be like walking out on the street and finding everyone in the city standing on their heads. You would expect there to be some reason why you were the only one left right side up.
 Some cosmologists, James Hartle and Mark Srednicki, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, have questioned that assumption. ''For example,'' Dr. Hartle wrote in an e-mail message, ''on Earth humans are not typical animals; insects are far more numerous. No one is surprised by this.''
 In an e-mail response to Dr. Hartle's view, Don Page of the University of Alberta, who has been a prominent voice in the Boltzmann debate, argued that what counted cosmologically was not sheer numbers, but consciousness, which we have in abundance over the insects. ''I would say that we have no strong evidence against the working hypothesis that we are typical and that our observations are typical,'' he explained, ''which is very fruitful in science for helping us believe that our observations are not just flukes but do tell us something about the universe.''
 Dr. Dyson and her colleagues suggested that the solution to the Boltzmann paradox was in denying the presumption that the universe would accelerate eternally. In other words, they said, that the cosmological constant was perhaps not really constant. If the cosmological constant eventually faded away, the universe would revert to normal expansion and what was left would eventually fade to black. With no more acceleration there would be no horizon with its snap, crackle and pop, and thus no material for fluctuations and Boltzmann brains.
 String theory calculations have suggested that dark energy is indeed metastable and will decay, Dr. Susskind pointed out. ''The success of ordinary cosmology,'' Dr. Susskind said, ''speaks against the idea that the universe was created in a random fluctuation.''
 But nobody knows whether dark energy -- if it dies -- will die soon enough to save the universe from a surplus of Boltzmann brains. In 2006, Dr. Page calculated that the dark energy would have to decay in about 20 billion years in order to prevent it from being overrun by Boltzmann brains.
 The decay, if and when it comes, would rejigger the laws of physics and so would be fatal and total, spreading at almost the speed of light and destroying all matter without warning. There would be no time for pain, Dr. Page wrote: ''And no grieving survivors will be left behind. So in this way it would be the most humanely possible execution.'' But the object of his work, he said, was not to predict the end of the universe but to draw attention to the fact that the Boltzmann brain problem remains. 
 People have their own favorite measures of probability in the multiverse, said Raphael Buosso of the University of California, Berkeley. ''So Boltzmann brains are just one example of how measures can predict nonsense; anytime your measure predicts that something we see has extremely small probability, you can throw it out,'' he wrote in an e-mail message.
 Another contentious issue is whether the cosmologists in their calculations could consider only the observable universe, which is all we can ever see or be influenced by, or whether they should take into account the vast and ever-growing assemblage of other bubbles forever out of our view predicted by eternal inflation. In the latter case, as Alex Vilenkin of Tufts University pointed out, ''The numbers of regular and freak observers are both infinite.'' Which kind predominate depends on how you do the counting, he said..
 In eternal inflation, the number of new bubbles being hatched at any given moment is always growing, Dr. Linde said, explaining one such counting scheme he likes. So the evolution of people in new bubbles far outstrips the creation of Boltzmann brains in old ones. The main way life emerges, he said, is not by reincarnation but by the creation of new parts of the universe. ''So maybe we don't need to care too much'' about the Boltzmann brains,'' he said.
 ''If you are reincarnated, why do you care about where you are reincarnated?'' he asked. ''It sounds crazy because here we are touching issues we are not supposed to be touching in ordinary science. Can we be reincarnated?''
 ''People are not prepared for this discussion,'' Dr. Linde said.

HEADLINE: Sears Warns Of Another Steep Drop In Profit

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Evidence of an abrupt slowdown in consumer spending mounted Monday as Sears Holdings, the owner of Sears and Kmart, warned that its profit would most likely plunge as much as 57 percent for the three months ending in early February.
 At the same time, an analyst downgraded the stock of two luxury goods brands, Coach and Ralph Lauren, warning that wealthy shoppers are tightening their purse strings. 
 The new signs of a pullback by consumers, who have propped up the economy throughout the last year despite rising energy costs and a slumping housing market, fueled anxieties that the nation is headed toward a recession. 
 Sears said that a drop in sales at Kmart and Sears would result in fourth-quarter earnings of $350 million to $470 million, or $2.59 to $3.48 a share. During the same period last year, the company reported profit of $820 million, or $5.33 a share.
 It would be the second consecutive quarter of steep declines for Sears, whose earnings dropped 99 percent in the third quarter. Several analysts downgraded the stock, recommending investors sell their shares, which have fallen by 50 percent since April.
 Sears blamed a tough economy, which has crimped sales of clothing and appliances, Sears's two big businesses. ''Sears is in the eye of the storm,'' said Adrianne Shapira, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who called its profit drop ''pretty ugly.''
 Dozens of retailers are confronting slower sales because of the weakening economy, but few if any of those stores have warned of a profit decline for the crucial fourth quarter, which is raising questions about Sears's strategy for the two ailing chains, analysts said.
 Those analysts, who are growing impatient with Sears Holdings' poor performance, once again pointed to the retailer's strategy of cutting costs and holding back on investing in stores, which they say has left its stores looking careworn and its customers feeling alienated. 
 At the same time, neither Sears nor Kmart is viewed as highly competitive on price; price-cutting has helped chains like Wal-Mart thrive even in the midst of economic unease. 
 ''When even the best retailers such as Target and J. C. Penney stumble, Sears is likely to take a pratfall,'' Carol Levenson, director of research at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm, wrote in a research note. ''The goal of making the merged Kmart and Sears into a retailing success has become increasingly less achievable.''
 Sears Holdings, of Hoffman Estates, Ill., said that sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.5 percent during the holiday season -- by 2.8 percent at Sears and 4.2 percent at Kmart. Sears's fourth quarter ends Feb. 2, when the company will report earnings. 
 ''We experienced lower sales across most categories,'' the company said in a statement, ''with notable declines in the Sears apparel and tools categories.''
 The company resorted to steep markdowns to sell merchandise, which ate into its profit. Its strongest business was electronics, which is not highly profitable. 
 Bill Dreher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said Sears's failure to invest in the kind of sophisticated computer systems in use at rivals like J. C. Penney and Kohl's has resulted in poor inventory control and an inability to respond to fast-changing conditions. This, Mr. Dreher said, most likely accounts for part of the profit decline.
 ''That we don't have these systems in place at Sears is shocking,'' he said. Mr. Dreher downgraded shares of Sears to sell from buy. Ms. Shapira, the Goldman Sachs analyst, downgraded the stock to sell from neutral.
 In unveiling its results, Sears cited ''increased competition and the negative impact of unfavorable economic conditions, such as a weak housing market and consumer credit concerns.''
 Ms. Shapira also downgraded shares of Coach and Ralph Lauren to neutral from buy Monday, contending that spending by well-heeled consumers was ''showing signs of fatigue.''
 The downgrades came just days after Tiffany & Company reported disappointing sales during the holiday season. Tiffany said the number of purchases at its domestic stores fell in November and December. 
 Tiffany said United States sales rose 4 percent, but without the help of foreign shoppers, who are taking advantage of the weak dollar, the company said sales would have remained unchanged from last year.

HEADLINE: Quality Is Major Concern Of Toyota's Visiting Chief

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
In his first visit to the Detroit auto show since becoming Toyota's president in 2005, Katsuaki Watanabe used this very public forum to convey a passionate plea to his employees on Monday to take personal responsibility for the quality of Toyota cars and trucks.
 ''Each individual must carry the responsibility'' for ensuring quality, from design to manufacturing and selling cars and trucks, Mr. Watanabe said. 
 Speaking through an interpreter, Mr. Watanabe said the dictate was ''something that's really shameful for us to share with you.''
 The discussions surprised journalists here, who expect executives to keep to scripts that extol the virtues of their newest models and concept cars. 
 But a series of recalls in the United States and Japan over the last two years have tarnished the automaker's reputation for quality, and distressed Mr. Watanabe, who ran the company's research and development and purchasing operations before his promotion to president. 
 Toyota recalled 2.1 million vehicles in 2006. It halved its recalls in 2007. But last October, Toyota recalled 470,000 vehicles in Japan, its fifth recall there during 2007. That same month, Consumer Reports magazine said it stopped automatically giving a ''recommended'' rating to the company's cars and trucks. 
 Mr. Watanabe bowed low at a July 2006 news conference to apologize for the recalls. He also instituted a ''back-to-basics'' campaign intended to prod employees to examine their own actions, not rely on the company's widely studied quality control processes. 
 ''I told them to reaffirm once again whether they did the proper job,'' Mr. Watanabe said. 
 Speaking in a fervent tone, often gesturing with his hands, Mr. Watanabe refused to blame Toyota's parts suppliers for the quality problems, which have largely occurred in vehicles that are more than 10 years old.
 ''I do not regard the problem as something that suppliers are responsible for,'' Mr. Watanabe said. ''We must work together so that we are fully aware of where suppliers are.'' 
 To help reduce recalls, Mr. Watanabe named a senior executive for quality control and established a Customer First Activities Program Committee to examine processes. 
 Toyota also has begun keeping track of quality problems on its older vehicles for a longer period than it did in the past, he said. 
 Mr. Watanabe attributed some of the company's problems to its growth spurt over the last few years. In 2007, Toyota passed Ford to rank as the second-biggest car company in the United States, and it is now vying with General Motors for the title of world's biggest car company.
 ''When Toyota was a small company, we could expressly communicate'' any quality improvements that were required, he said. ''But now that Toyota is so big, we've realized that we have not adequately communicated.''
 Toyota executives were more upbeat when talking about new vehicles, including the Venza, a midsize automobile they described as a crossover sedan.
 Most of the industry's crossover vehicles are sport utility vehicles built on the underpinnings of cars, which gives them a smoother ride and better fuel economy than S.U.V.'s built on a truck chassis.
 But the Venza, which will be built in Georgetown, Ky., is meant for drivers who are no longer interested in driving S.U.V.'s, or conventional crossovers, yet like a higher sitting position and the ability to transport cargo, like athletic gear or gardening supplies.
 The Venza, which resembled a smaller version of the Toyota Highlander or the Lexus RX, will replace the Camry Solara, a coupe version of the Camry sedan. It will reach the market later this year as a 2009 model. Venza will be introduced with a V-6 engine rated at 268 horsepower, 20-inch wheels and a six-speed automatic transmission. Toyota also plans to introduce a version with a four-cylinder engine and 19-inch wheels. The company did not give fuel economy estimates or disclose Venza's price.
 After the news conference for what is officially called the North American International Auto Show, Mr. Watanabe toured the floor of the hall, where he encountered a former colleague: James E. Press, formerly a Toyota director and president of the company's North American operations. Mr. Press left Toyota in September to become co-president at Chrysler.
 Exchanging a warm greeting with Mr. Watanabe in front of photographers, Mr. Press told him, ''We have to get caught up.''

HEADLINE: Waiting in Style

BYLINE: By JAMES GILDEN

 BODY:
The airport lounge is no longer just a bunch of sofas in a quiet place.
 At a time when most airline passengers are lucky to get a bag of peanuts, airline lounges are becoming more luxurious and spacious. The changes come as airlines realize that keeping premium passengers happy is critical to their bottom lines. 
 ''People who sit in the pointy end of the plane are the ones who are driving the margin,'' said Henry Harteveldt, principal travel analyst with Forrester Research, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass. 
 This year more airlines will be pooling resources to build joint lounges, giving some fliers more access to better perks and privileges at the largest international airports and at a cost savings to airlines. 
 The Star Alliance network, which includes United Airlines, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines among its members, operates shared lounges in Zurich and in Nagoya, Japan. Two more are on their way in 2008 at Charles de Gaulle International Airport, near Paris, and at Heathrow Airport, near London.
 At Los Angeles International Airport, the three airline alliances -- Star Alliance, Oneworld (which includes American Airlines, British Airways and Qantas Airways) and SkyTeam (which includes Delta, Northwest, KLM, Air France and Alitalia) -- developed shared lounges at the Tom Bradley International Terminal in the last year. A space that once held 16 small lounges run by separate airlines now has four large ones: one for each alliance and another for passengers of unallied airlines. SkyTeam's lounge is the only one not yet open. 
 ''The concept of alliance lounges in the Bradley terminal was driven by the airport authority to create enough lounge space for everybody,'' said Steve Clark, senior vice president for customer services in the Americas at British Airways, a Oneworld member. 
 Though Oneworld member airlines have developed joint lounges involving individual airlines in some cities, Los Angeles airport is the first true Oneworld lounge developed from scratch. It is shared by British Airways, Qantas, Cathay Pacific, LAN Airlines and Japan Airlines and is open to first- and business-class passengers and high-status frequent-flier alliance members who are flying economy class on any of the alliance's carriers. Star Alliance and SkyTeam offer similar access to elite frequent fliers for passengers in economy.
 At 14,638 square feet, the joint lounge is more than four times bigger than the previous lounges at the Bradley terminal. Passengers enter directly into the lounge off the elevator through a lobby paved with sand-colored tiles. Across the lobby, a large video display with dancing clouds and other outdoor scenes greets passengers. 
 ''Travelers are increasingly sophisticated'' in their design sensibility, Mr. Harteveldt said. ''The lounge is the last respite of civilization before you get on the plane.'' 
 On a recent evening, Brian Crawford-Greene of Michigan was passing through Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Australia for a four-month visit. He relaxed between flights in the Oneworld lounge at the Bradley terminal.
 ''The last time I came through on Qantas, they had a tiny little lounge,'' said Mr. Crawford-Greene. ''It was bloody awful.''
 He had been awake and traveling since 3 a.m. Refreshed from a shower, a Scotch in one hand and a book in the other, he thought it was a ''great lounge'' though noting that ''a few more plugs would be nice.''
 Providing customers with showers is one of the tangible benefits that can come from sharing lounges with alliance partners. On a busy day, as many as 500 passengers will use the nine showers in the Oneworld lounge, according to Margita Sherer, Qantas duty manager at Los Angeles International Airport.
 ''In most markets, you have to maximize your seating capacity,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We don't have space to put showers in.''
 British Airways is currently testing a new lounge in Brussels and Philadelphia that will replace the light and airy feel of its ''terraces'' lounges with a dark wood, country club atmosphere it has called ''galleries.''
 Still, British Airways is on board with the shared lounge concept where conditions dictate.
 ''Joint facilities work in locations where if you don't do something like that you'll be severely limited,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We prefer to have our own branded concepts.''
 SkyTeam is looking at opportunities for shared lounges at its member airlines' hubs around the world, said Giorgio Callegari, vice president for alliances and business development at Alitalia and a member of the SkyTeam steering committee. In addition to Los Angeles airport, it has a shared lounge in Narita, Japan. It is also developing one for London Heathrow, scheduled to open later this year.
 ''Heathrow will be a key pillar to our approach'' to shared lounges, Mr. Callegari said. 
 SkyTeam is considering opening shared lounges in Madrid, Barcelona and Moscow, airports where some members have large operations. 
 ''Lounges are a key component of the customer experience, in particular for the most valued customers, the high yield and most frequent flying,'' Mr. Callegari said. ''Most of the airlines would regard having their own lounge in key locations as an essential part of their competitive strategy.''
 Given the revenue potential of the elite customer, single-airline lounges will continue to expand and add features, industry experts say.
 ''Airlines realize wisely that lounges are also a critical part of the brand experience,'' Mr. Harteveldt said.

HEADLINE: Baltimore Finds Subprime Crisis Snags Women

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

DATELINE: BALTIMORE 

 BODY:
At Vixxen Hair Salon, the main topic of conversation has always been money. But since last August, Anjanette Booker, the owner, has noticed a new focus. ''Now it's money and foreclosures,'' Miss Booker said. 
 The Vixxen salon, along with the nearby salon Hair Vysions, is one of the informal social centers for the Belair-Edison neighborhood, a community of brick row houses that have in recent years been bought largely by single black women with children. 
 For each of the last four years, more than half of the foreclosures in this neighborhood have been homes owned primarily by women, according to an analysis of public records by the Reinvestment Fund, a nonprofit community development organization.
 The foreclosures threaten the neighborhood's fragile stability. And they highlight a broader dimension of the housing meltdown: subprime mortgages, which are driving the foreclosure rate, have gone disproportionately to women. 
 Single women have been among the fastest-growing groups of homeowners in recent years, and in Baltimore they accounted for 40 percent of home sales in 2006, twice the national average, according to the National Association of Realtors. Nearly half of these mortgages were subprime, National Community Reinvestment Coalition found. 
 ''When I bought my house, it was the American Dream,'' said Kue McIntyre, 33, a single mother of three who is scrambling to avoid losing her row house, on which she defaulted after losing her job. ''Now I need to save it for my boys. If it was just me, O.K., I'd have to give up my first home. But it's different when you have it for the kids. When they turn 18, I want this to be theirs.'' 
 Subprime mortgages are high-cost loans, at least three points above the prime rate, made to borrowers with low income or credit scores. The loans make up just 13 percent of existing home loans but account for 55 percent of foreclosure starts, the Mortgage Bankers Association says. 
 Though women and men have roughly the same credit scores, the Consumer Federation of America found that women were 32 percent more likely to receive subprime loans than men. The disparity existed within every income and ethnic group. Blacks and Latinos are also more likely to get subprime loans than comparable white borrowers. 
 In another study, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that women received 37 percent of high-cost home loans in 2005, compared with just 28 percent of prime loans. Preliminary research by the organization suggests that this gap may have tightened as subprime loans crested in 2006.
 The findings support earlier research by the Consumers Union, which attributed some of the disparity to instability in women's credit status because of divorce or family medical emergency. Women also have less wealth than men, which increases the likelihood that they will get subprime loans. 
 Increased homeownership has been the principal means for women to close this wealth gap. But the disproportion of subprime loans, advocates said, makes it harder for women at all income levels to build wealth by paying off their mortgages. 
 ''The striking thing is that the disparity between men and women actually goes up as income rises,'' said Allen J. Fishbein, director of credit and housing policy for the Consumer Federation of America. Among high earners -- defined as people earning twice the median income -- black women are as much as five times more likely to receive subprime mortgages than white men. 
 Though no statistics exist to compare foreclosure rates among men and women, Mr. Fishbein said it was logical to conclude that higher rates of subprime mortgages among women translated to higher rates of foreclosure. The Center for Responsible Lending has estimated that one in five recent subprime home loans will end in foreclosure. 
 In Belair-Edison, these trends converge at Vixxen Hair Salon, where on a recent afternoon the chairs were empty, as they have often been since summer, when many adjustable-rate mortgages in the neighborhood reset -- and many women began cutting back on beauty care to pay for them. 
 ''Just our conversations, our demeanor, have changed,'' said Miss Booker, who, like most of her customers, is a single woman trying to save her home from foreclosure. ''Now when we have the TV on, and something comes on about interest rates, we'll be screaming at the TV.''
 Four years ago, Miss Booker bought a brick row house for $130,000, taking a subprime mortgage because she had a low credit score. Her initial payments were $841 a month. 
 ''He said the rate was adjustable but in six months you can refinance,'' she said. ''But I never did. I didn't ask why I didn't get a fixed rate from the beginning.'' 
 After two years, her mortgage payments shot up to $1,769. She has borrowed money from her former husband and two friends, but says it is hard to ask for money ''because most people are going through what you're going through.''
 From her house she said she could see five homes with ''For Sale'' signs out front, signs that went up around the time many mortgages reset. ''It looks like a ghost town,'' she said of the streets around her house.
 The Belair-Edison neighborhood, which borders some of Baltimore's poorer areas, has been periodically held up as a success story in a city trying to recover from the loss of its manufacturing base and a third of its population. ''It's a buffer between rough Baltimore and the outer ring,'' said Mark Sissman, president of Healthy Neighborhoods Inc., a nonprofit group that makes home loans. ''If Belair-Edison stays stable, the city is advantaged. If it falls apart, it's a problem.'' 
 The neighborhood's 6,400 houses are mostly owner-occupied, and median house prices have nearly doubled since 2004, to $125,000. Partnerships between neighborhood associations and city agencies have brought millions of dollars for community improvement projects.
 But the neighborhood's stability is fragile. After a double homicide in September outside a Sunday church service, one community leader said the recent spikes in crime were a result of instability in the housing market, with outside investors scooping up foreclosed properties and renting them to transients. 
 In 2007 foreclosures were initiated on 181 houses in the neighborhood, or one in 35, according to research by the Community Law Center. This represents a slight drop from 211 initial filings in 2006, even as foreclosures rose elsewhere in the city and state. 
 Roy A. Miller, who provides homeownership counseling -- including foreclosure counseling -- for the nonprofit Belair-Edison Neighborhood Initiative, described his typical client as ''single, female, with two children, in her first house.'' 
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which buy loans from mortgage lenders, have estimated that 15 percent to 50 percent of the subprime loans they bought in 2005 went to borrowers whose credit scores indicated they were qualified for prime loans. 
 Lisa R. Evans, deputy director of St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center Inc., a nonprofit organization whose services include foreclosure counseling, said 2,100 families were counseled in the 2007 fiscal year, up from 700 the year before. Two-thirds of the families had a female head of household, Ms. Evans said, and about 90 percent had subprime mortgages. 
 ''Prime lenders don't advertise in communities like Belair-Edison, and they don't have offices there,'' Ms. Evans said. ''So people go to somebody that advertises on the radio or sent them a mailing. Subprime lenders were very good at this. They went after an untapped market.'' 
 This month, Baltimore's mayor and its City Council announced that they were suing Wells Fargo Bank, saying the bank had singled out minority neighborhoods for high-priced subprime loans; the bank denied the accusation. 
 These marketing efforts may not be intended specifically for women, Ms. Evans said, but in the target neighborhoods, ''that's who gets the houses, and that's who goes into default.''
 ''It's not that women go into default faster,'' she said.
 Mr. Fishbein said that even at high-income levels, mortgage brokers may assume that women are less confident to negotiate or shop around, and so offer them higher rates. A survey in 2006 by Prudential Financial found that two-thirds of women graded themselves at C or lower in their knowledge of financial services or products. 
 Ms. McIntyre, who bought her house for $125,000 in April 2006, is one of those women. When she bought the house, using two subprime loans -- adjustable loans that started at 8.35 percent and 13.25 percent -- the lender insisted that she use her savings to pay down a car loan, a common demand on subprime loans. After she lost her job, she had no reserve to pay her mortgage. 
 ''I feel they had me from the start,'' Ms. McIntyre said. ''I was eligible for money as a first-time home buyer and a state employee. Nobody told me about any of these.''
 Her house was offered at foreclosure auction in December, without a buyer. She is still living in it, hoping to work out a payment plan with her lender. 
 ''And if I can't keep my house, I need to save my money so I'll be ready to buy another house in two years,'' she said. ''But it's really hard to get out of this hole.''

HEADLINE: Heavy Orders for Airbus and Boeing Raise Backlog Questions

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The chief salesman for Airbus, John Leahy, ended one of the busiest years of his career with a quiet evening at home.
 After a 2007 travel schedule that took him to see airline customers in ''more countries than there are members of the United Nations,'' Mr. Leahy, 57, said he spent much of the last two weeks of the year sleeping. 
 The last three years have been exceptional for Airbus and its American rival, Boeing, in terms of new orders. In 2005 and 2006 the two companies combined added more than 4,000 contracts, equivalent to at least four years of production. 
 For 2007, they probably booked firm orders for more than 2,800 aircraft -- adding roughly three more years to their backlogs. At list prices, the combined total of deals signed since 2004 is $750 billion. 
 ''The whole re-equipment cycle has been compressed into a period of about three years as opposed to the more normal five to six years,'' said Doug McVitie, managing director of Arran Aerospace, a consulting firm in Dinan, France. ''It's been an exceptional climate for the industry,'' Mr. McVitie said, but warned: ''It's not sustainable.''
 Airbus is scheduled to disclose its final orders tally for 2007 on Wednesday, a figure that company executives say will be close to the record 1,413 planes that Boeing announced earlier. 
 But with Boeing and Airbus already scrambling to produce about 900 planes a year between them, analysts said the waiting lists -- the average lag is approaching five years -- are likely to start putting a brake on sales.
 On top of that, the risks of a slowing economy, rising oil prices and tightening credit could mean that the interest of airlines in -- and their ability to pay for -- new planes could drop off.
 ''In this kind of a market, it's not just about booking orders any more,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''You also have to be able to manage your order book. There's a good chance that some airlines won't be able to take delivery of all these aircraft.''
 An explosion in air travel in recent years, particularly in Asia and Europe, has helped drive the thirst for new airplanes. Single-aisle jets like the Airbus A320 and Boeing's 737, which can seat 110 to 180 passengers and have an average range of about 3,000 nautical miles, are especially popular because of their versatility and fuel efficiency. 
 These smaller planes make up close to half of the order backlog in unit terms and around a third in terms of value.
 ''The ambient level of global air traffic growth is around 7 percent,'' said Peter Morris, chief economist of Ascend, a London aviation consulting firm. ''In markets like Europe and Asia, it's largely been driven by the low-cost carriers and new entrants.'' 
 In countries like China and India, he noted, air traffic is increasing at rates in the high double-digits each year -- nearly double the pace of economic growth.
 Older, established airlines have also stepped up their buying after a lull that followed the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. 
 The industry returned to profit in 2007 for the first time in six years, with net earnings of about $5.6 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association. That freed up cash for several carriers, including US Airways and British Airways, to make substantial investments in more efficient wide-body aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 XWB, as well as the 555-seat A380. 
 A depreciating dollar has also increased the purchasing power of many carriers because they have found jets, which are priced in dollars, to be a relative bargain.
 ''Airlines are like lemmings,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I. ''The more that one airline orders, the more pressure that puts on those who haven't yet ordered because of the need to get in line for production slots.''
 The length and strength of the orders boom has far surpassed the expectations of the jet makers, which had originally expected orders in 2007 to ease back to the longer-term average of about 1,000 a year. Now Boeing and Airbus are finding themselves scrambling to ramp up their assembly lines.
 Airbus produces around 34 A320 family jets a month and aims to increase that figure to 40 -- an unprecedented rate for an aircraft program -- by next year, helped by the addition of a new single-aisle assembly line in Tianjin, China, which will make four planes a month by 2011. Production of the A380 superjumbo is scheduled to more than triple from 13 planes this year to 45 a year by the end of 2010.
 Boeing, meanwhile, is planning to make 480 to 490 planes in 2008, up from 441 last year, and 500 to 525 planes in 2009.
 Yet as the plane makers try to increase production, the interests of the airlines in buying jets could change with a slowing economy. All this comes as the air transport association in December slashed its forecast for 2008 industry profits by more than a third, to $5 billion from the $9.6 billion it had predicted in June, largely because of higher oil prices.
 On Jan. 7 shares of Airbus's parent company, European Aeronautic Defense and Space, dropped 7.5 percent after analysts at Deutsche Bank advised clients to sell the stock on concerns that demand would fall.
 That said, analysts and industry executives still see opportunities for new sales. Mr. Leahy said he still expected strong demand this year from countries like China and India, where air traffic is likely to keep pace with economic growth. Carriers in the Middle East and the Gulf regions are still building their fleets, he said.
 Others note that high oil prices might give airlines another reason to renew their fleet, which would benefit Airbus and Boeing. 
 ''You could argue that high fuel prices are one of the best things to happen to the aircraft manufacturing industry,'' Mr. Morris of Ascend said. Long-haul planes like the A380 and Boeing's 787 Dreamliner offer a fuel-cost savings of about 20 percent a seat. 
 ''When you look at the large sums of money spent on fuel, at least on long-haul, the arguments in favor of re-fleeting become pretty obvious,'' he said. ''The alternative -- raising ticket prices in a weakening environment for air travel -- is probably a losing proposition.''
 A wild card remains the United States, where most carriers sat out the buying spree while they shored up their balance sheets. Several carriers, most notably Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines, have dozens of planes that are more than 20 years old. But with the economic slowdown and access to financing becoming more difficult, some predict that American airlines could put off investments.
 ''The U.S. airlines have bigger fish to fry right now,'' Mr. Leahy said.
 But Mr. McVitie estimated that American airlines could order 500 to 750 planes in the next 18 months.
 ''This is probably the year they have to bite the bullet,'' he said. ''If collectively the U.S. industry has made a profit -- albeit negligible -- and we continue to see high prices for oil and a prolonged credit crunch, then I can't see the point in waiting. The older airplanes just make the economics that much worse.''

HEADLINE: A Hereditary Perk the Founding Fathers Failed to Anticipate

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK. 
Online: Documents and an archive of Adam Liptak's articles: nytimes.com/adamliptak.

DATELINE: Legacy preferences in college admissions 

 BODY:
-- the nepotistic advantages given to the children of alumni -- are indefensible, of course. 
 President Bush, who should know, has called for their abolition. John Edwards has written that they are ''something out of an aristocracy, not our democracy.''
 The usual justification for legacy preferences is candidly cynical: they generate contributions from alumni. That crass bargain seems a poor substitute for the usual considerations in admissions decisions, like merit and diversity. But private universities are certainly entitled to trade money for principle. 
 Public universities, which are part of state and city governments, may be another matter. Why in the world should the government be allowed to discriminate based on heredity?
 Legacy preferences are, ''quite literally, educational grandfather clauses,'' Akhil Reed Amar and Neal Kumar Katyal wrote in the U.C.L.A. Law Review in 1996, referring to laws used to disenfranchise black voters in the South after the Civil War. Grandfather clauses imposed voting requirements like literacy tests on new voters but exempted people whose ancestors had voted. Those people happened all to be white.
 Similarly, being eligible for a legacy preference at most universities ''is a near-perfect proxy for being white,'' said Michael A. Olivas, a law professor and authority on higher education at the University of Houston. 
 In 2002, for instance, Texas A&M University admitted 321 whites and 3 blacks who would not have gotten in otherwise because they were legacies, according to data the university provided to The Houston Chronicle in 2004. The university abolished the preferences not long after those numbers became public.
 In ''The Chosen,'' his study of admissions at Harvard, Yale and Princeton, Jerome Karabel, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrated that preferences for the children of alumni were a relatively recent phenomenon, a result of anti-Semitism and xenophobia in the first part of the last century. The preferences spread to public universities even more recently. 
 It could cost public universities real money to give up the preferences. Alumni give more than $8 billion annually to public and private colleges and universities.
 And they are not giving only out of nostalgia and altruism, as Jonathan Meer and Harvey S. Rosen, both economists, demonstrated in a recent National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. The paper analyzed alumni contributions at a selective research university it did not name.
 Some conclusions: People with children gave more. Giving increased as the children of alumni who applied to the university neared 18. Giving dropped off after the admissions decision, and the decline was far greater when the child was rejected.
 The conventional view is that legacy preferences are perfectly lawful. In his dissent from the Supreme Court decision upholding the affirmative action plan at the University of Michigan's law school in 2003, for instance, Justice Clarence Thomas said the Constitution's equal protection clause did not prohibit ''unseemly legacy preferences'' because they did not directly involve race. 
 ''So while legacy preferences can stand under the Constitution,'' Justice Thomas wrote, ''racial discrimination cannot.''
 He added a footnote tweaking some supporters of affirmative action. ''Were this court to have the courage to forbid the use of racial discrimination in admissions,'' Justice Thomas wrote, ''legacy preferences (and similar practices) might quickly become less popular -- a possibility not lost, I am certain, on the elites (both individual and institutional) supporting the law school in this case.''
 Only one decision has squarely addressed the constitutionality of legacy preferences. In 1976, a federal judge in Durham, N.C., ruled that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was free to favor the children of alumni. 
 The preferences did not violate the Constitution, the judge, Hiram H. Ward ruled, because there was a rational reason for them -- they generated ''monetary support for the university.'' Requiring the university to provide anything more than a rational reason was not necessary, Judge Ward said, because neither race nor fundamental rights were directly implicated.
 The bottom line, as Charles W. Collier put it in The Journal of Legal Education in 2005, is that the University of Michigan would be free to ''transform itself into the Michigan University for Alumni Children Only without running afoul of the law in any way.''
 But maybe there is another way to think about the issue. In a fascinating and provocative article published recently in the Washington University Law Review, Carlton F. W. Larson, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, argued that the Constitution prohibited legacy preferences at public universities through its nobility clauses.
 Its what? The Constitution, in separate clauses, bars the federal government and the states from granting titles of nobility. The clauses have not been the subject of much litigation, but they do embody a principle the Constitution's framers thought absolutely fundamental to the ideals of the American revolution.
 ''Legal distinctions, titles, powers and privileges,'' John Adams wrote in 1788, ''are not hereditary.'' 
 Public universities, Professor Larson said in an interview, ''have always been, much more than private universities, engines of upward mobility.'' As a matter of policy, principle and constitutional law, he said, they should not be handing out benefits ''based solely on ancestry.''
 That may all be true, but it still seems a bit of a leap to move from prohibiting the government from naming me a duke to barring public universities from giving the children of alumni an admissions advantage. 
 But Professor Larson said he was ''deadly serious'' that the nobility clauses prohibited legacy preferences at public universities. ''Maybe it's the mark of an insane person,'' he went on, ''that you're absolutely convinced you're right.''

HEADLINE: Praise and Questions for $400 Million Housing Plan

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

 BODY:
In what he called ''the biggest housing initiative in a generation,'' Gov. Eliot Spitzer said in his State of the State address on Wednesday that he would propose a $400 million affordable housing fund to help working-class New Yorkers, the poor and people with special needs.
 While some lawmakers lauded the proposal, others said they needed details about how the governor would pay for it, given an anticipated $4 billion deficit for the fiscal year that begins in April. 
 ''When the governor said no new taxes, how do you get to achieve these goals with the economy softening, with revenue softening?'' asked Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from Mount Hope and the chairman of the Senate's Housing Committee. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Bonacic added that he thought the governor's proposal was ''not a good thing'' but ''a wonderful thing.''
 ''Housing, generally they give lip service to it in the past, or it's not so high on the radar screen,'' Mr. Bonacic said.
 Education, health care and transportation typically gobble up the bulk of the state's annual funding. And the interest groups that support those issues have generally been able to trump the housing issue and the nonprofits that advocate on its behalf.
 The governor's proposed Housing Opportunity Fund, in addition to the state's regular funding, would more than triple the amount normally allocated for affordable housing, according to Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat and the chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee. 
 The new fund would also be used to develop housing for those with mental and physical disabilities, as well as those dealing with addictions, Mr. Spitzer said.
 ''This is an issue the state has abdicated over the years,'' he said after an appearance in Brooklyn on Sunday. ''Especially in New York City, it has resulted in the exodus of our middle class and our work force. Our teachers, our firefighters, our hospital workers have found it impossible to find housing that they can live in.''
 The bulk of the money to pay for the program would come from the state's Mortgage Insurance Fund and proceeds from the state's mortgage tax, according to Mr. Lopez.
 More will be known about the initiative next week after Mr. Spitzer presents his budget, but it appeared that the assistance would mainly be provided through state bonds for housing construction and rehabilitation. 
 Tom Dunham, a spokesman for Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican and the deputy majority leader of the Senate, said Mr. Skelos would reserve judgment on the proposal until he learned its details.
 The increase would be a divergence from the housing policy of Gov. George E. Pataki.
 During much of Mr. Pataki's tenure, nearly every developer building rental apartments who asked the state for tax-free bonds got them as long as they agreed to set aside 20 percent of the units for low- and moderate-income tenants for 20 years. The 80-20 program, as it was known, meant millions for developers. But critics said the program overly benefited developers of luxury projects that were out of reach for poorer residents.
 Funding for affordable housing had remained ''flat'' at about $180 million a year for about the past 15 years, Mr. Lopez said. 
 Advocacy groups that have long sought to have the state put muscle behind initiatives to lower housing costs for New Yorkers applauded Mr. Spitzer's proposal. 
 ''We think it's great that the governor is really looking at the crisis of affordable housing across the state, and he is making that link between housing and economic development,'' said Josh Lockwood, the executive director of Habitat for Humanity of New York City.

HEADLINE: To Sell Higher Tolls, Corzine Talks Bonds

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine wants you to believe that no politician in New Jersey can be trusted to safeguard the state's finances, except one: himself.
 His proposal to raise tolls sharply to steady the state's shaky finances deliberately cordons off a new highway corporation from political influence. To do this he wants to have an independent board oversee the corporation, which will issue up to $38 billion in bonds. And the governor -- Mr. Corzine as well as his successors -- will give up veto power over the highway corporation.
 ''The reason is very simple: bondholders,'' Mr. Corzine said on Saturday at a public hearing in Livingston, the first of 21 such appearances as he fans out across the state's 21 counties to sell his unorthodox plan. 
 ''People who buy bonds,'' he said during his PowerPoint presentation, ''don't trust governors and state legislators to stick to their word.''
 He should know. Mr. Corzine spent 25 years at Goldman Sachs as a successful bond trader, the last six as a co-chairman. The frank talk is based on New Jersey's history of backsliding on its fiscal responsibilities, which through the laissez-faire financial practices of several governors and Legislatures put the state $32 billion in debt to begin with. Without protection against future lapses, Mr. Corzine said, ''you won't be able to raise'' that kind of money.
 Mr. Corzine needs to prevent the state's future leaders from undoing his toll increases because the credit ratings of the bonds he wants to issue are based largely on the public corporation's ability to repay them. Any hint that the schedule of toll increases might be diluted could lead to a lower rating, forcing the corporation to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the greater risk.
 Either way, the bondholders who hold the credits need assurances that the increases will be locked in. 
 ''If the bonds require the creditor to believe that the toll rates have to go up X percent, then the bondholders have to really believe they are going up,'' said George Bilicic, who runs the global power, energy and infrastructure group at Lazard, an investment house.
 But even Mr. Corzine's best efforts at keeping the state honest do not come in a tamper-proof bottle. Under his proposal, which will ultimately require legislative approval, governors will appoint some members to the public interest corporation that will keep tabs on the agency, which will replace the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. Other members will be chosen by the investors. Still, as new appointments are made over time, the makeup of the watchdog is bound to swing depending on the governor's party and philosophy. 
 For that reason, rating agencies and investors would want to know how frequently these new members would be appointed because a large turnover could sway the makeup of the board.
 ''Just because one person appoints another person who appoints another doesn't guarantee independence,'' said Cherian George, who runs the infrastructure group at Fitch Ratings, a bond-rating agency. ''At the end of the day, public agencies are political in nature since they serve the public. Some political influence is not bad, but it's whether there is influence on the ability to repay the debt.''
 Mr. George added that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has ''a history of raising tolls only after a considerable amount of angst.''
 Mr. Corzine has tried to allay these fears by putting his full-state blitz into high gear, discussing his proposal with ratings agencies, local officials and other interest groups. Proposed toll increases would affect the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway and Atlantic City Expressway, and a portion of Route 440 would become a toll road. 
 To give the plan some Wall Street respectability, Mr. Corzine's chief of staff, Bradley I. Abelow, who worked for Mr. Corzine at Goldman Sachs, held two long briefings with reporters, unusual by New Jersey standards. He was accompanied by senior officials from UBS Securities, which collaborated with the administration on the plan.
 In these sessions, they have insisted that they do not want to repeat past mistakes. For nearly two decades, governors and legislators have debated whether to raise the gasoline tax, the third lowest in the country. But each time, they lacked the willpower to follow through, kicking the gas can down the road and leaving the Transportation Trust Fund on the brink of insolvency.
 Then there was the one-term governorship of Jim Florio, who in 1990 pushed through a $2.8 billion tax increase when faced with a mammoth budget deficit. Necessary or not, that tax increase angered New Jerseyans and propelled Republicans to electoral victories over the next decade. One of them, Christie Whitman, went on to defeat Mr. Florio in 1993, and promptly shaved income taxes by 30 percent to try to water down Mr. Florio's increase.
 With the ink barely dry on Mr. Corzine's proposal, State Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen on Monday proposed that motorists be allowed to apply for tax credits of up to $500 a year against the amount of the proposed toll increase. And Assemblyman Patrick J. Diegnan Jr. said he also would introduce a bill that would offer state income tax credits for the tolls if Mr. Corzine's increases are adopted. Either plan could end up costing the state millions of dollars.
 These attempts at using public money to assuage voters is a sign not only that the political battle lines are now forming, but also that legislators are likely to chip away at the fire walls Mr. Corzine is trying to build around his new highway corporation.
 Yet in an interesting twist, a couple of Republicans may be riding to Mr. Corzine's rescue. Former Representative Bob Franks, whom Mr. Corzine defeated in the United States Senate race in 2000, agreed last week to become the chairman of a campaign to promote Mr. Corzine's plan.
 And Douglas R. Forrester, who lost to Mr. Corzine in the 2005 race for governor, said: ''It seems to me that he is trying to create certain protections against bad financial behavior in the future. I give him credit for trying to tackle a huge problem, and this deserves a fair airing.''

HEADLINE: As Talk of Recession Grows, Republicans and Democrats Differ on Response

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting from Reno, Nev., and Michael Cooper from Florida.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For Democratic presidential contenders, the growing risk of a recession is an opportunity for action. For Republican contenders, accustomed to calling for less government intervention, it presents a dilemma.
 In the last several days, the leading Democratic rivals have rushed out proposals to spur the economy with one-time tax rebates, expanded unemployment benefits, money to prevent home foreclosures and assistance for state and local governments.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has proposed $70 billion in emergency spending programs, with an additional $40 billion in tax rebates if the economy worsens. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has a $75 billion plan based largely on immediate tax rebates of $250 to most workers to encourage consumer spending. 
 John Edwards put out a plan last month proposing more money for unemployment benefits, energy projects and a ''home rescue fund'' for people in danger of losing their houses.
 By contrast, the leading Republican candidates are much more skeptical about short-term government rescues. 
 Even as they campaign in Michigan, where the automobile industry is depressed and unemployment is high, most Republican candidates are sticking to their existing proposals for lower taxes and less regulation.
 The Republican presidential candidates have been more skeptical about short-term stimulus measures than President Bush has been. Mr. Bush signaled last week that he would propose a package of measures, probably dominated by tax cuts, in his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
 The debate among candidates about stimulus measures is largely academic, because economic conditions are almost sure to be entirely different by the time a new president takes office a little more than a year from now. 
 But the debate shows big differences, even between candidates in the same party, in how the rivals would approach economic problems. 
 Among the Republicans, Senator John McCain has a proposal to abolish the alternative minimum tax, a move that would save taxpayers $1 trillion over the next decade but would have little impact in the next year.
 Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, campaigning in Michigan, promised on Monday to push for a fivefold increase in spending on energy and automotive technologies. 
 But Mr. Romney has said little about any emergency measures to fend off a broader recession this year. Instead, he promised long-term measures to overhaul the tax code and said he would fight new regulations, including tougher fuel-economy requirements for cars and trucks that Congress recently passed and Mr. Bush signed into law.
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has not released a plan to deal specifically with the current slowdown. But Mr. Giuliani pointedly ridiculed the more activist approaches of Mrs. Clinton and other Democratic contenders.
 ''It's a typical central government approach, a nanny government approach,'' Mr. Giuliani told supporters at a rally on Monday in Naples, Fla.
 Mr. Giuliani, like most of his Republican rivals, would make all of Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent. He would also reduce the corporate tax rate, to 25 percent from 35 percent, and reduce the tax rate on capital gains.
 Mr. Giuliani's advisers acknowledged on Monday that those ideas were not tailored to the current evidence of a looming economic downturn. Making Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent would have no immediate effect on the economy, because the tax cuts are set to remain in force until the end of 2010. 
 Reducing corporate and capital gains taxes would do little immediately to benefit people who have lost their jobs, and many economists argue that tax cuts will have the most short-term stimulative impact if they are aimed at people most in need. 
 But David R. Malpass, an economic adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said the goal was to create the best conditions for investment.
 ''The mayor's view is that the best economic recovery package is something that's lasting,'' Mr. Malpass said. ''It's not giving cash back to people, but creating a better environment for growth.''
 Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain's top economic adviser, expressed a similar skepticism about government efforts to fine tune the economy. ''The track record of the government trying to time these things is not good,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. 
 The Democratic contenders are far more eager than Republicans to propose economic-rescue measures. Democrats are also willing to waive temporarily their insistence on fiscal discipline, a cornerstone of Mrs. Clinton's long-term approach. 
 Appearing Sunday on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, Mrs. Clinton bluntly declared that a stimulus package should be allowed to increase the federal deficit temporarily because it is intended to inject additional money into the economy.
 There are differences between some of the Democratic plans. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have proposed plans that could ultimately cost $110 billion. The Clinton plan relies heavily on government spending, and the Obama plan would rely more heavily on temporary tax breaks.
 Mr. Obama would provide an immediate tax rebate of $250 to workers and would pay an extra $250 to every person collecting Social Security benefits. If unemployment increases three months in a row, he would pay an extra $250 to workers and retirees.
 Mr. Obama's plan would also provide $10 billion to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, $10 billion to states that are hardest hit by the downturn and $10 billion to extend unemployment benefits to more people, including temporary workers and self-employed long-time unemployed workers.
 Austin Goolsbee, Mr. Obama's top economic adviser, said the payments represented the fastest way of getting money to people who are most likely to need it and to spend it quickly. 
 Mr. Edwards and Mrs. Clinton have proposed plans to channel more money to government programs. Mr. Edwards would put money into building ''clean energy'' public works. Mrs. Clinton would put $30 billion into an ''emergency housing crisis fund'' and $25 billion into helping low-income people pay heating bills.

HEADLINE: With '07 Vetoes to Confront, the House Returns to Work

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress opens its 2008 session Tuesday by returning to a crucial bill lingering from 2007, a major Pentagon policy measure that was rejected in a surprise move by President Bush late last year. 
 House members are scheduled to resume work on the $696 billion measure, which authorizes military programs and had been approved with broad bipartisan backing. 
 In announcing on Dec. 28 that he would not sign the bill, Mr. Bush said the administration had concluded that a provision could lead to legal claims by victims of Saddam Hussein's government against Iraqi assets banked in the United States.
 Senior legislative aides said Monday that Democrats were not inclined to mount a major fight over the veto, preferring to move quickly to the economic, health care and energy issues likely to dominate the months before the November elections for president, 435 members of the House and 35 senators. 
 Officials said the most likely approach would be to vote to send the Pentagon measure back to the Armed Services Committee, where the disputed provision could be quickly corrected, allowing the bill to be brought back for a final vote by the end of the week.
 ''We hope to fix it,'' an aide said. 
 Democrats want to make some response to the president's action, in which he used a so-called pocket veto that lets a measure expire without a signature, because Congress has a longstanding position of challenging the circumstances when a pocket veto can be used.
 Republicans have urged quick action on the measure, which allocates money for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and nearly every other military program. 
 But the military is in no danger of running out of money for combat since $70 billion in direct war spending was approved last month. The bill does include a raise for the military, and lawmakers plan to make the pay increase retroactive so members of the armed forces would not be penalized by the president's veto. 
 The House has a second veto to confront next week when it is scheduled to consider Mr. Bush's second rejection of an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Democrats failed in a previous effort to override the president on the issue and have already extended the program through this year to prevent eligible children from losing their coverage.
 In another fight spilling over from 2007, Congress will also have to decide whether to renew the administration's terrorist surveillance program. A temporary extension that Congress approved last summer over the objections of many Democrats expires in February.
 Leading Democrats and the White House continue to disagree over whether telecommunications companies that participated in the program at the administration's urging should be granted retroactive legal immunity from claims of violating privacy.
 Members of both parties say they expect the early part of this year's session to focus on debate over the shape of an economic stimulus package that both Democrats and the White House have said is likely, given increasing warning signs about a possible recession. The specifics of any plan remain unknown, and the Senate is not due back in session until next week. 
 Unlike last year, when Democrats took over full control of Congress for the first time in 12 years and had a clearly delineated agenda to begin the year, both parties are still assembling the specifics of their election-year programs and have a series of policy retreats scheduled to refine their themes.

HEADLINE: Pelosi Begins Discussions On Stimulus To Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Speaker Nancy Pelosi met on Monday with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to discuss potential action by Congress, the White House and the central bank to jump-start the economy and try to shorten the slowdown that many economists say has already begun to take hold. 
 But even as Ms. Pelosi renewed a call by Democratic leaders for cooperation with President Bush and Republicans in Congress, lawmakers in both parties said that efforts to develop a short-term stimulus plan could easily fall prey to partisan disputes like whether to extend Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, which expire after 2010. 
 The Democrats are insisting that Republicans not inject their desire to extend the tax cuts into negotiations of a short-term rescue package intended to dampen the impact of a recession. But in interviews, several Republican lawmakers said they could not imagine a debate not involving long-term tax policy.
 ''The planning for 2010 in a business sense is happening now,'' said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan. ''So it isn't too soon to talk about making permanent the Bush tax cuts.'' 
 Mr. Camp, who serves on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, added: ''I think that has to be part of the discussion. It can't simply be what gets us through the next quarter. It has to be what gets us through the next decade.'' 
 That sort of talk drew a furious reaction from Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who like other Democrats is calling for a temporary stimulus plan, directed at middle-class Americans. 
 ''There is nothing countercyclical about extending tax cuts,'' Mr. Frank said in a telephone interview from Massachusetts. ''That's simply trying to use the bad economy as a platform for their ideological goals.'' 
 Ms. Pelosi, after meeting Mr. Bernanke at the Capitol, said in a statement, ''We know that people are hurting, so I hope that we can work together, recognizing the independence of the Fed and coordinate monetary and fiscal policy that will soften the blow for hard-working families.'' 
 Repeating her call for cooperation, she said, ''We look forward to meeting with the president and Republican Congressional leaders to find a solution that is timely, targeted and temporary.'' 
 Adding to the risk of a political firefight is the temptation to use the economy in the presidential race and in fall Congressional elections, when the entire House and 33 Senate seats are at stake. Already Democrats are blaming Mr. Bush for the downturn, while Republicans say Democrats will just make things worse.
 On Saturday, a day after Democratic leaders urged Mr. Bush to cooperate on a stimulus plan, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York used the weekly Democratic radio address to criticize the president's economic policies.
 ''It is time to scrap the Bush playbook and replace it with measures that allow the economic fortunes in this country to grow together, not apart,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 The House minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, fired shots at the Democrats on Monday by invoking a recent Republican report accusing them of waging an ''undeclared war'' against American jobs.
 ''Democratic leaders should retreat from their tax-and-spend, mandate-and-regulate war on American jobs and work with Republicans to meet the economic challenges that lie ahead,'' Mr. Boehner said. 
 In a speech in Chicago, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the No. 4 Democrat, laid out a long-term plan he called ''A New Deal for the New Economy'' in which he called for universal health care, increased tax deductions for retirement savings, and government aid to give all Americans at least one year of education beyond high school. 
 Republicans said their plans included long-term tax cuts, not just short-term stimulus.
 ''I can't emphasize enough the importance of not looking at this in the short term,'' said Representative Wally Herger, Republican of California.
 And Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said that while a deal was possible on a stimulus plan, the economy needed reassurance on Mr. Bush's tax cuts. 
 ''The closer we get to the 2010 implosion of the tax code, the more uncertainty hangs over the economy, the more this becomes a dark cloud,'' Mr. Ryan said.

HEADLINE: In South Carolina, a Bid For Black Women's Votes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Juanita Ramsey, a retired administrative assistant, was standing by her front door in her largely black neighborhood here. As she pointed to the homes of her neighbors, she identified them by political preference: 
 ''Obama, Obama, Hillary, Hillary, Hillary,'' she said. ''And my aunt over there, she's for Hillary.''
 Ms. Ramsey, 59, is supporting Senator Barack Obama of Illinois. She likes him, she said, but she is also tired of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and her husband, Bill Clinton, the former president.
 ''Hillary and Bill, we've done that,'' Ms. Ramsey said. 
 The Democratic presidential primary here, on Jan. 26, will be the first test of the candidates' strength in a state where blacks are expected to cast more than half the Democratic votes. Significantly, perhaps a third of those voters will be black women, like Ms. Ramsey. 
 Both campaigns have been conducting intense drives for their votes, believing they will play a central role in deciding whether the Democrats ultimately nominate a white woman or a black man for president.
 Interviews with about 50 black women, here and in Loris, a rural town in the eastern part of South Carolina, suggest split views but some growing support for Mr. Obama. The interviews were conducted just as racial questions were intensifying in the news media about whether Mrs. Clinton and her husband had made insensitive comments and whether the Obama campaign had fanned the flames. 
 But many of the women said they were basing their views on other concerns. Some said they thought a man should be stronger than a woman. Many also panned the moment before the New Hampshire primary when Mrs. Clinton briefly teared up when she was asked about the rigors of the campaign.
 But as the checkered politics of Ms. Ramsey's neighborhood suggests, there is a reservoir of support for Mrs. Clinton. Several women who said the economy was the most important issue to them said they planned to vote for her, and most said they loved Mr. Clinton. (Only one woman mentioned former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, the third leading Democratic candidate, and that was because she had seen his television commercials.)
 In North Charleston, Marvetta Perry, 46, who owns a beauty salon, said her customers were so divided between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton that she would not publicly discuss her own choice for fear of alienating half her clientele. ''I have some who are voting for Obama and some who are voting for Clinton,'' she said. An Obama sign hangs in her entryway, and Clinton literature is on the table.
 Even as black women are choosing sides, many said they were still undecided. Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, said that while polls suggested Mr. Obama was winning the black vote, so many black women were undecided that they could influence the outcome.
 ''If Barack Obama captures the undecided black female vote, he will win the race,'' Mr. Huffmon said.
 Ms. Ramsey said the racial politics of the moment was troubling. She said the Clintons were engaged in ''character assassination'' and would make a lame attempt to deny it.
 ''The tighter the race, a slip of the tongue, they'll apologize, 'Oh, we didn't mean to say it,'<0>'' Ms. Ramsey said. ''One thing, they're saying Obama smoked the herb. Well, Clinton did, too.''
 Also working against Mrs. Clinton here is a conservative, religious streak among black women. Many cited their biblical beliefs in saying they would vote for a man over a woman. 
 ''A man is stronger,'' said Clara Vereen, 61, a hair stylist in Loris. She said she respected Mrs. Clinton but ''if a war come, a man should tell us what to do.''
 A glamorous picture of Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, beamed from the February cover of Ebony magazine, lying on a nearby table. ''He's educated,'' Ms. Vereen said. ''He's got what he's supposed to have. Why not give him a chance?''
 Dr. Huffmon said that black voters here were reassured about Mr. Obama after he won the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3.
 ''Iowa showed that whites will support a black man,'' Dr. Huffmon said. ''Some of the soft support for Hillary has been bleeding as African-Americans realized that Barack is viable even among whites.''
 For Mr. Obama, South Carolina is an important bridge connecting his proven support in white rural states and his potential support in big urban states that will vote on Feb. 5. For Mrs. Clinton, the state is somewhat less vital strategically, but it remains a test of her own appeal -- and that of her husband, the so-called first black president -- in the face of the possibility of an actual black president. 
 ''South Carolina, while very important to us, is not make or break for our campaign,'' said Jay Carson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton.
 Still, several women said Mrs. Clinton was the best choice for working women, for the disabled and the elderly.
 ''She's willing to help people,'' said Nyeshia Green, 19, a parking attendant in Charleston.
 Doretha McCallum Lee, 44, who does volunteer work and was having her hair done at Eclipse, in Loris, also said she liked Mrs. Clinton.
 ''I think she'll be good for the people,'' Ms. Lee said.
 Anesia Wilson, 34, who owns Eclipse and was spraying Ms. Lee's hair, is also with Mrs. Clinton. ''I don't think Obama is ready yet,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''He's not ready to be a leader.'' She also admitted to some concern for Mr. Obama's safety. ''Look what they did to Martin Luther King,'' she said.
 Ms. Vereen had been reluctant to vote for Mr. Obama because she feared that giving him a higher profile might endanger him. But that concern has ebbed. 
 ''I've been listening, and I even listened to him on 'Oprah' when he said, 'I ain't scared,'<0>'' Ms. Vereen said. ''I would love for him to be president, and I'm not scared, so scared. I'm really trying to focus on what's good, what he'll do good for us.''
 Those who said they were undecided rendered a fairly harsh judgment on Mrs. Clinton for the moment in New Hampshire when her eyes briefly went moist and her voice cracked.
 ''If Hillary is going to be president, she's got to toughen up,'' said Beverly Patrick, 49, the owner of Patrick's salon in Loris. She shook her head as she buzz-cut the silver dome of Mae Helen Johnson, 70, a home-health nurse. 
 ''You can't get up there and cry,'' Ms. Johnson said.
 Ms. Patrick said, ''You've got to hide that,'' adding, ''You've got to keep that in.''
 On the east side of Charleston, Marylee Aiken, 74, who has retired from the mailroom of a local paper company, said she was also turned off by the emotional moment.
 ''She had this breakdown, and if she's going to break down, you don't need this burden on you'' of being president, Ms. Aiken said. She added that she was surprised by Mrs. Clinton's quick pivot from tearing up to attacking Mr. Obama. ''I don't know what got her pepped up so quick,'' Ms. Aiken said. But she was skeptical about it.
 Outside a post office, Patricia Greene Edwards, 54, a schoolteacher, said she was sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton's emotional moment.
 And yet, Ms. Greene Edwards said, she has still not decided whom to support. She said she wished she could combine the best of Mr. Obama and the best of Mrs. Clinton into one package.

 For the last week reporters, pundits, bloggers and political operatives have turned all their forensic powers on Hillary Rodham Clinton's so-called crying moment -- the moment in a New Hampshire cafe when her eyes welled with tears in response to some innocuous personal questions from an audience member: ''How do you do it?,'' ''How do you keep upbeat and so wonderful?'' That moment is credited with helping Mrs. Clinton stage a remarkable comeback in the New Hampshire primary, with galvanizing the sympathy of female voters and with revealing the candidate's human side. 
 The 24/7 replaying of that moment on cable television also reminds us how relentlessly Mrs. Clinton has been dissected, deconstructed and decoded over the years: by now her marriage, her hair, her pantsuits, her voice and her laugh have been more minutely anatomized than her voting record on Iraq, her (mis-)handling of health care during her husband's administration or her stands on Iran, Social Security and immigration. This willful focus on the personal is underscored by ''Thirty Ways of Looking at Hillary,'' an intriguing but highly uneven anthology of reflections about Mrs. Clinton by a spectrum of well-known female writers.
 Few of these contributors address Mrs. Clinton's record as a senator (why did she vote last year to urge the Bush administration to label Iran's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization?), practical electoral matters (just how electable is she?) or questions about her managerial style (how would the controlling, poll-driven instincts of her campaign team inform her approach to running the White House?). Instead, like voters and commentators obsessed with the ''likability'' factor, these writers zero in on vague feelings about Hillary's karma, her self-presentation or her femininity.
 Some of them seem to have wanted to identify with Hillary -- or wanted her to embody their own ideals, career paths and views about feminism -- and when she's failed to ratify their own inclinations, they've turned on her with the fury of scorned sisterhood. Others point to a double standard in judging female candidates, even as they parse her every move and utterance, seeing in her a fun-house-mirror version of themselves.
 Katie Roiphe writes that Mrs. Clinton ''is trying too hard'' and ''the spectacle of all of this trying is uncomfortable, embarrassing,'' reminding other women of how hard women are trying to juggle disparate roles and ''how often it feels faked.'' Amy Wilentz writes that she has ''always wondered what it would be like to be'' Hillary Clinton. And Susanna Moore writes, absurdly, that she wishes Mrs. Clinton possessed ''a certain ... sensuousness'' -- as though this were a quality necessary for being commander in chief. 
 Other contributors have turned in even more solipsistic essays. Kathryn Harrison says the possibility of Hillary Clinton becoming president makes her think about her own grandmother, while Cristina Henriquez says the senator's change of names (from Hillary Rodham to Hillary Rodham Clinton to Hillary Clinton to plain old Hillary) reminds her of her own debate about whether to keep her maiden name.
 In one of the more thoughtful essays in this volume, Jane Kramer writes: ''I continue to subject Hillary Rodham Clinton to the kind of scrutiny I would never think to apply to men. I look at the men running for president and ask myself if their politics are mine, or close enough to mine to be appealing. My interest in Barack Obama runs mainly to: Can you do the job? Are you brave enough for it? Do you have the vision for it? Can you take the heat? My question for Hillary Rodham Clinton is: Why do you want the job? What kind of woman does that make you?''
 Whereas polls suggest that Mrs. Clinton has done well with working-class women who see her protecting their economic interests, her peers -- liberal-minded, upper-middle-class professional women -- have been a much tougher sell. Antiwar liberals deplore her penchant for triangulation: in 2006, Nora Ephron declared herself a ''Hillary resister,'' writing that the senator ''will do anything to win,'' and won't take ''a position unless it's completely safe.'' And many hard-line feminists can't forgive her for staying married to Bill Clinton in the wake of Monica-gate (as though this were anybody's business but the Clintons' own), writing with the sort of vehemence more usually associated with Limbaugh-like members of the ''vast right-wing conspiracy.'' 
 This antipathy toward Mrs. Clinton is very much in evidence in this book. The novelist Lionel Shriver, for one, asserts that ''accident, luck, and good or bad taste in men, depending on your perspective'' have combined to make Mrs. Clinton ''the first truly viable female candidate for the U.S. presidency''; she is reluctant to give Hillary any credit (or blame) for her work as a lawyer and senator. The story of Hillary Clinton, Ms. Shriver declares, ''is antifeminist: former first lady is elected on her husband's coattails'' -- never mind that her own argument -- that if Hillary becomes president she will simply be ''a titular head of state'' with her husband secretly running things from behind the scenes -- seems remarkably antifeminist in itself. 
 In stark contrast, Ms. Roiphe writes that Hillary is ''in many ways the feminist dream incarnate, the opportunity made flesh, the words we whisper to little girls: 'You can be president. You can do anything you want.'<0>'' In fact, taken together, these essays attest to the infinite subjectivity of people's views, the pure relativism of perception. Susan Cheever describes Hillary as an ''enchanting'' woman who resembles Jo March from ''Little Women,'' while Dahlia Lithwick declares that Hillary comes off as ''a scold,'' projecting a ''mother-knows-best quality that is experienced less as comforting than as a rebuke.''
 Other writers strain to find a new approach to Mrs. Clinton. The food writer Mimi Sheraton assesses Hillary's taste for Boca Burgers (a brand of soy-protein patties), olive burgers (hamburgers topped with chopped pimento-stuffed green olives) and Dove bars, coming to the earth-shattering conclusion that the former first lady, ''like so many of us, is torn between renunciation and appetite with a weakness for the hot and spicy and the cool and sweet.'' And Susan Orlean asks whether Hillary is a ''cat person or dog person'' only to conclude that ''animal-wise, she remains a cipher.''
 One of the more illuminating essays to look at Mrs. Clinton through a single narrow lens is Susan Lehman's chapter on Hillary as a ''product of corporate legal culture,'' shaped by a decade and a half at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark. Mrs. Clinton's self-consciousness and ''lawyerly inclination to avoid risk and run everything past the pollsters,'' Ms. Lehman argues, are qualities that corporate attorneys are trained to cultivate, just as ''the ability to argue all sides of an argument'' is ''a hallmark of the lawyerly'' mind. ''Neither Hillary Clinton nor the average corporate law partner is likely to make anyone's blood jump or their heart sing,'' Ms. Lehman concludes. ''When you are in trouble, however -- real trouble -- it may be that the person you want to see isn't the guy who wows you with his wit and charisma but someone who has really done her homework, pored over all the boring details and then gone back over them again, just for fun.''
 In the end, this volume of reflections corroborates Mrs. Clinton's own long-ago observation that she is ''a Rorschach test'' for voters. It also suggests that like three other famous blondes (Marilyn, Madonna and Princess Di), she's in danger of being turned into one of those indeterminate semiotic texts academics love to deconstruct, made to signify everything from the aging of boomer dreams to the future of feminism, even as her every gesture and inflection is sifted, measured and weighed, and her actual resume and record are increasingly shoved to the side.

HEADLINE: In Obama's Pursuit of Latinos, Race Plays Role

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Ana Facio Contreras contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Jeff Zeleny from Reno, Nev.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has eaten beef tacos in East Los Angeles and sat on the living room couch of a working-class family in a largely Hispanic neighborhood here for 30 televised minutes. At a rally of the culinary workers' union in the shadows of the Strip here one night, Senator Barack Obama pumped his fist and chanted with the crowd, ''Si, se puede; si, se puede; si, se puede!'' or, ''Yes, we can!'' 
 As the Democratic candidates have moved from courting the overwhelmingly white voters of Iowa and New Hampshire to an expanse of 25 contests facing them in the next few weeks, they confront an electorate that is increasingly Hispanic, in Nevada, California and New York. 
 Although the two candidates aggressively court those voters, who could be vital for Democrats this year and for years to come, the challenge is especially complex for Mr. Obama. It arises as Mrs. Clinton sought to tamp down reaction from Obama supporters to remarks she had made about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
 Mr. Obama confronts a history of often uneasy and competitive relations between blacks and Hispanics, particularly as they have jockeyed for influence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.
 ''Many Latinos are not ready for a person of color,'' Natasha Carrillo, 20, of East Los Angeles, said. ''I don't think many Latinos will vote for Obama. There's always been tension in the black and Latino communities. There's still that strong ethnic division. I helped organize citizenship drives, and those who I've talked to support Clinton.'' 
 Javier Perez, 30, a former marine, said older Hispanics like his grandmother tended to resist more the notion of supporting an African-American, a trend that he said was changing with younger Hispanics.
 ''She just became a citizen five years ago,'' Mr. Perez said. ''Unfortunately, that will play a role in her vote. I do think race will play a part in her decision.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton's circle of advisers includes New Yorkers steeped in that history. On her first trip after her victory in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton flew here, where she was escorted on a tour by prominent Hispanic leaders, including Henry G. Cisneros, a former secretary of housing and urban development, on the ''Juntos con Hillary, Una Vida Mejor'' tour or ''Together With Hillary, a Better Life.'' 
 From here, she flew to a Mexican-American enclave, the East Los Angeles neighborhood, to eat at King Taco, ordered in Spanish by Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa, who has emerged as an important supporter.
 In Chicago, Mr. Obama was successful in rallying Hispanics to his side and bridging differences with black voters. His success in repeating that is critical. 
 In 2004, Hispanics accounted for 16 percent of the vote in the California primary; 11 percent in New York, 17 percent in Arizona and 9 percent in Florida. Should he win the presidential nomination, his success at overcoming the history between the two groups will be critical as the Democrats approach an election in which they are looking to lock up the Hispanic vote for decades to come.
 As he campaigned in northern Nevada, Mr. Obama acknowledged the challenges he faced. 
 ''I think it's important for us to get my record known before the Latino community,'' he told reporters. ''My history is excellent with Latino supporters back in Illinois, because they knew my record.
 ''Nationally, people don't know that record quite as well. So it's very important for me to communicate that, to advertise on Spanish-speaking television, to make clear my commitments.''
 Relations between blacks and Latinos vary from place to place and have evolved over the years. Mr. Villaraigosa lost his first effort to become mayor, in 2001, to a white, James Hahn, who won 80 percent of the black vote. In a rematch in 2005, Mr. Villaraigosa was elected with 50 percent of the black vote.
 Mr. Villaraigosa said he did not think that Mrs. Clinton's strength among Hispanics was a product of tensions between the two groups.
 ''From my vantage point,'' he said Monday, ''the strength that Hillary Clinton enjoys among Latinos has everything to do with her track record and her longstanding relationship with that community. I think there are tensions among all groups.'' 
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who just dropped his own campaign to become the first Latino president, said that the rivalry between the two groups had eased and that Mr. Obama could transcend many of the differences as he approached Feb. 5, ''what I call the Hispanic primary day.''
 He said he might endorse a candidate before Feb. 5, an endorsement that would clearly influence some Hispanics. 
 If attitudes are shifting, they are moving slowly as so many racial assumptions are challenged. 
 The Rev. Al Sharpton of New York, who has been on the front line of many of the black-Latino battles in New York politics, said the tension would be a problem for Mr. Obama across the country and in New York, which also votes on Feb. 5. He said Mr. Obama would be at a disadvantage because of his choice to be a ''race-neutral candidate.''
 ''It's going to be a challenge that he has got to deal with,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''There's a natural history, and we've made some progress. But he has not been part of those efforts to make progress.''
 In California, Mr. Obama has won backing from Latino lawmakers, some of whom had supwinning rank-and-file voters will be hard, said the State Senate majority leader, Gloria Romero, Democrat of East Los Angeles.
 ''Do we have a long way to go?'' she asked. ''Absolutely. I think there are some tensions on questions of immigration and jobs. But I believe that we have moved forward in a way that the community will embrace an African-American president.''
 She said the solution to overcoming the tensions was discussing economic problems of middle- and lower-class blacks and Hispanics like the mortgage crisis, an issue that first Mrs. Clinton and now Mr. Obama have been raising more frequency. 
 ''I don't think eating tacos,'' is effective, she said with a flick at Mrs. Clinton. ''We need to address what unites us. The key is not to raise the wedge issue.'' 
 Mr. Obama, some party officials and scholars suggested, may face additional difficulty if Hispanic women respond to Mrs. Clinton's increasingly strong appeal for support based on sex. A rally here Saturday was packed with Hispanic women who shrieked at seeing Mrs. Clinton.
 ''The Hispanic community is very family oriented, and we respect our mothers,'' said Ruben Kihuen, an influential Democratic assemblyman from Las Vegas who supported Mrs. Clinton. ''A lot of middle-aged women see her as a mother, a head of the household, and they can identify with this. Especially when they see her daughter, Chelsea, with her.''
 The tensions between Hispanics and African-Americans have increased proportionately with the influx of new Hispanics in areas like the Southwest, experts on the relationships said.
 Mexican-Americans and other groups have increasingly migrated to traditionally black neighborhoods, the experts said.
 ''There have been enormous misunderstandings and conflicts over local resources and political representations between the two groups which simmer right below the surface and sometimes erupt,'' said Albert M. Camarillo, founding director of the Center for the Comparative Study of Race and Ethnicity at Stanford.
 Hispanic voters, Mr. Camarillo said, ''might not go into the direction of the Obama camp.''

HEADLINE: Iraq Defense Minister Sees Need For U.S. Security Help Until 2018

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: FORT MONROE, Va. 

 BODY:
The Iraqi defense minister said Monday that his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012, nor be able on its own to defend Iraq's borders from external threat until at least 2018.
 Those comments from the minister, Abdul Qadir, were among the most specific public projections of a timeline for the American commitment in Iraq by officials in either Washington or Baghdad. And they suggested a longer commitment than either government had previously indicated. 
 Pentagon officials expressed no surprise at Mr. Qadir's projections, which were even less optimistic than those he made last year. 
 President Bush has never given a date for a military withdrawal from Iraq but has repeatedly said that American forces would stand down as Iraqi forces stand up. Given Mr. Qadir's assessment of Iraq's military capabilities on Monday, such a withdrawal appeared to be quite distant, and further away than any American officials have previously stated in public.
 Mr. Qadir's comments are likely to become a factor in political debate over the war. All of the Democratic presidential candidates have promised a swift American withdrawal, while the leading Republican candidates have generally supported President Bush's plan. Now that rough dates have been attached to his formula, they will certainly come under scrutiny from both sides.
 Senior Pentagon and military officials said Mr. Qadir had been consistent throughout his weeklong visit in pressing that timeline, and also in laying out requests for purchasing new weapons through Washington's program of foreign military sales. 
 ''According to our calculations and our timelines, we think that from the first quarter of 2009 until 2012 we will be able to take full control of the internal affairs of the country,'' Mr. Qadir said in an interview on Monday, conducted in Arabic through an interpreter.
 ''In regard to the borders, regarding protection from any external threats, our calculation appears that we are not going to be able to answer to any external threats until 2018 to 2020,'' he added. 
 He offered no specifics on a timeline for reducing the number of American troops in Iraq.
 His statements were slightly less optimistic than what he told an independent United States commission examining the progress of Iraqi security forces last year, according to the September report of the commission, led by a former NATO commander, Gen. James L. Jones of the Marines, who is retired. Then Mr. Qadir said he expected that Iraq would be able to fully defend its borders by 2018.
 Mr. Qadir was in the United States to discuss the two nations' long-term military relationship, starting with how to build the new Iraqi armed forces from the ground up over the next decade and beyond, with American assistance.
 The United States and Iraq announced in November that they would negotiate formal agreements on that relationship, including the legal status of American military forces remaining in Iraq and an array of measures for cooperation in the diplomatic and economic arenas.
 Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest, but both countries have begun sketching their goals, and Mr. Qadir's visit certainly is part of measures by the Iraqi government to lay the foundation for those talks, which are to be completed by July. 
 ''This trip is indicative of where we are in our military relationship with Iraq,'' said Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary. ''We are transitioning from crisis mode, from dealing with day-to-day battlefield decisions, to a long-term strategic relationship.''
 Mr. Morrell said the goal was to end a period in which Iraq has been a military dependent and build a relationship with Iraq as ''a more traditional military partner.''
 Meanwhile, Mr. Qadir sketched out a shopping list that included ground vehicles and helicopters, as well as tanks, artillery and armored personnel carriers.
 Those, he said, are needed as Iraq moves toward taking full responsibility for internal security. In the years after that, as his nation assumes full control over its defense against foreign threats, Iraq will need additional aircraft, both warplanes and reconnaissance vehicles, he said.
 Pentagon officials said that Mr. Qadir's visit, which includes the usual agenda of meetings at the Pentagon, White House and on Capitol Hill, was expanded to include his first talks with commanders of American headquarters that are responsible for long-term military planning, training, personnel development and doctrine.
 Mr. Qadir, a career armor officer who commanded Iraqi troops who fought alongside Marine Corps forces during the battle for Falluja in 2004, spent part of Monday here, at the headquarters of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, where he questioned senior officers on how the ground force trains its leaders, from sergeants through senior officers.
 Even in wartime, ''it is a requirement for somebody to think about the future,'' said Gen. William S. Wallace, the Army's training and doctrine commander. While Army training cannot ignore ''the urgency of the next assignment,'' General Wallace told his visitor, the complexity of modern warfare proved the importance of the Army's program of pulling its leadership out of the fight on a routine schedule to take courses on tactics, operations and strategy, as well as logistics.
 At a meeting with senior officers at the nearby Joint Forces Command, Mr. Qadir was told of the American military's latest efforts at synchronizing the efforts of its ground, air and naval forces for combat, and to use computer exercises to train headquarters units for deployment.
 ''We are keenly aware that you are not engaged in an exercise in your country,'' said Gen. James N. Mattis of the Marine Corps, the Joint Forces commander.
 General Mattis acknowledged how different the dialogue with Mr. Qadir was on Monday from when the two served together in Falluja. Iraq is still at war, General Mattis said, but Mr. Qadir is carrying out the traditional functions of any regular defense minister.
 It is a positive development that ''it is just the norm to have an Iraqi come and visit us,'' General Mattis said.

HEADLINE: Michigan at Center Stage in G.O.P. Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Lansing, Mich.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
With the plight of the ailing automobile industry at the top of the agenda, the leading Republican presidential candidates set off Monday on a final flurry of campaigning before a Michigan primary that could shake up anew a remarkably fluid field.
 Recent polls have indicated that former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Senator John McCain of Arizona are engaged in an extremely close race in Tuesday's primary, with former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas running third. 
 Mr. Romney, who has the most riding on Tuesday's result after successive setbacks in Iowa and New Hampshire, delivered a speech Monday at the Detroit Economic Club in which he took Washington lawmakers to task for what he described as excessive regulating of the auto industry and lack of interest in Michigan's economic woes.
 Though he left the state decades ago, in the last week Mr. Romney has repeatedly played up his personal ties to it, often sounding more like a candidate for statewide office. His father, George W. Romney, was chairman of American Motors before becoming a three-term governor of Michigan, and the candidate has pledged to make the state a special focus if elected.
 On Monday, he vowed that in the first 100 days of a Romney presidency, he would bring together representatives of the auto industry, unions, Congress and the state to come up with a plan to ''rebuild America's automotive leadership.'' He also said he would increase fivefold, to $20 billion, federal support for research and development in energy, materials science, fuel technology and automotive technology.
 ''There are some people who don't think there's a future for the domestic automobile industry,'' Mr. Romney said. ''They think the industry and its jobs are gone forever. They are wrong.''
 Mr. Romney was alluding, as he has regularly, to Mr. McCain's comment of last week that many of the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs the state has shed will not be coming back. The senator has defended the remark as an honest assessment, and many economic analysts and even industry executives have voiced agreement with it.
 Earlier in the day, appearing before more than 1,000 people at Kalamazoo Christian High School, Mr. McCain said he would focus on retraining programs to help the many who have lost their jobs in the state.
 ''We're not going to leave these people behind,'' he said, according to The Associated Press.
 Mr. McCain's campaign argued Monday that Mr. Romney had taken a very different tone toward the auto industry while campaigning for governor of Massachusetts, proposing a realigning of tax incentives to favor fuel-efficient vehicles, which Mr. McCain and his surrogates asserted would have resulted in a higher tax on the industry's long-popular sport utility vehicles.
 Mr. Romney, Mr. McCain and Mr. Huckabee all toured the North American International Auto Show in Detroit on Monday evening. Mr. Romney and Mr. Huckabee were barely 25 yards apart at one point, standing on opposite sides of a hybrid S.U.V., but did not acknowledge each other.
 Addressing about 150 workers at a metal fabricating plant in Lansing earlier in the day, Mr. Huckabee emphasized energy independence, revitalization of the nation's manufacturing base and his call to replace the federal income tax with a national sales tax.
 Borrowing President Harry S. Truman's calling card, he described his platform as ''a new kind of Fair Deal'' for Americans.
 Political analysts say the Michigan Republican primary will hinge on how many Democrats and independents end up voting in it. The Democratic primary is essentially uncontested because the national party has said it will not count any convention delegates from Michigan, a result of the state's moving the primary up earlier than party rules allow. Michigan permits primary voters to cross party lines, so Republican ballots are expected to be requested by many Democrats and independents, a factor that analysts say should benefit Mr. McCain.Advisers to Mr. Romney, meanwhile, buoyed by some surveys that have shown him in the lead in Michigan, are now cautiously thinking ahead to the South Carolina primary and the Nevada caucuses, both on Saturday.
 Mr. Romney pulled his televisions advertisements from South Carolina last week, raising questions about how seriously he would compete there. Evangelicals, many suspicious of his Mormon faith, play a dominant role in the state's Republican primary.
 But Mr. Romney's advisers now say he will follow news organizations' attention to South Carolina in hopes of exceeding expectations there.

HEADLINE: Bush and the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Bush, in a Shift, Admits Economy Faces Challenges'' (front page, Jan. 8): 
 It's refreshing to hear President Bush finally admit that there are problems with the economy. Now we must pray that he doesn't prescribe his usual antidote: lowering taxes for the rich and making the problem worse. 
 Above all else, the economy is plagued by pessimism and fear that things will get worse, largely because of the president's previous actions -- creating and sustaining an off-the-books war in Iraq and alienating every supplier of oil to the United States. 
 It doesn't take an economist to know that when this administration ends, there will be an unpleasant day of reckoning for the huge deficit the president and his soldiers in Congress have created. 
 For once, we should hope that the president follows his Republican tendencies and keeps his hands off the economy, lest he makes the condition even worse.

GANG LEADER FOR A DAY 
 A Rogue Sociologist Takes to the Streets 
 By Sudhir Venkatesh 
 302 pages. The Penguin Press. $25.95. 
 On a hot summer day in 1989, Sudhir Venkatesh, a callow sociology student with a ponytail and tie-dyed T-shirt, walked into one of Chicago's toughest housing projects, clipboard in hand, ready to ask residents about their lives. Sample question: ''How does it feel to be black and poor?'' Suggested answers: ''very bad, somewhat bad, neither bad nor good, somewhat good, very good.'' Actual answers: unprintable.
 Mr. Venkatesh got rid of the clipboard and the questionnaire, but not his fascination with life in the Chicago housing projects. He stuck around, befriended a gang leader and for the next decade lived a curious insider-outsider life at the notorious Robert Taylor Homes on the city's South Side, an eye-opening experience he documents in the high-octane ''Gang Leader for a Day.'' 
 In a bit of bravado Mr. Venkatesh, who now teaches at Columbia, styles himself a ''rogue sociologist.'' Dissatisfied with opinion surveys and statistical analysis as ways to describe the life of the poor, he reverted to the methods of his predecessors at the University of Chicago, who took an ethnographic approach to the study of hobos, hustlers and politicians. Much like a journalist, he observed, asked questions and drew conclusions as he accumulated raw data.
 He also learned to hide what he was doing from his academic advisers. Mr. Venkatesh, reared in the comfortable suburbs of Southern California by Indian parents, crossed the line from observer to participant on more than one occasion as he penetrated deeper into the life of the Black Kings and its local captain, the ruthless, charismatic J. T. 
 When a rival gang sweeps by, guns blazing, he dodges bullets and helps drag a gang lieutenant to safety. When local squatters mete out street justice to a crackhead who has beaten a woman in the projects, he gets a boot in.
 One glorious day J. T. lets Mr. Venkatesh get a taste of power and the problems that come with it. He allows him to make the daily rounds of the platoons under his command -- six-man crews that deal in crack cocaine -- and try to sort out the petty squabbles and mistakes endemic in a criminal enterprise comprising 250 underpaid, uneducated and violent soldiers. 
 All this is much better than toting a clipboard. ''It was pretty thrilling to have a gang boss calling me up to go hang out with him,'' writes Mr. Venkatesh, who ridicules his own naivete but just as often fails to rise above it. 
 Without question, Mr. Venkatesh is dazzled by J. T. and seduced by the gang life. He maintains enough distance, however, to appraise the information he is given and to build up, through careful observation, a detailed picture of life at the project. He writes what might be called tabloid sociology, but it rests on a solid foundation of data, like records of the gang's finances turned over to him by T-Bone, its treasurer.
 J. T. and his fellow officers like to describe the Black Kings as a social-service organization. ''You need to understand that the Black Kings are not a gang; we are a community organization, responding to people's needs,'' one high-ranking member tells Mr. Venkatesh. This may even be sincere.
 The Black Kings, which Mr. Venkatesh observed throughout the 1990s, operated a hugely profitable drug ring, often selling crack in building lobbies, and extorted protection money from every project resident engaged in economic activity, no matter how trivial: prostitutes, street-corner car mechanics, squatters, home beauticians and even old women selling candy from their apartments to earn an extra $20 a week. 
 Mr. Venkatesh fails to gauge the feelings of project residents about the Black Kings, probably because he is perceived as part of them and therefore someone to steer clear of. Most residents avoid him, he writes, or limit their conversation to ''a quick hello or a bland comment about the weather.'' This is a glaring omission. 
 On the other hand, Mr. Venkatesh, through sheer persistence, does unravel a complex, intertwined system of political and economic relationships that makes the housing project run in the near-total absence of city services. The police and ambulance crews, in particular, regard Robert Taylor as a no-go area. In their stead local warlords like J. T. and quasi-political figures like the fearsome Ms. Bailey, a building president who manipulates her connections to the Chicago Housing Authority, hold sway. They exact tribute and dispense favors. They mediate disputes. Ms. Bailey, both ally and rival to J. T., acts as a go-between with city agencies and the police. 
 No one gets rich. Mr. Venkatesh is shocked to discover that foot soldiers in the drug operation barely make minimum wage. J. T. himself, when the author first meets him, earns perhaps $30,000 a year, although, thanks to a series of promotions, he ends up making five times that amount by the late 1990s. 
 J. T. looms as a towering, problematic figure. Violent, paranoid and manipulative, he offers a fascinating study in leadership, and Mr. Venkatesh makes the most of his opportunity, trying desperately to maintain some saving skepticism. Smitten, he never quite gets over his initial attraction, even when J. T. double-crosses him, ingeniously, by encouraging him to carry out a detailed study of the housing project's economy, whose results he uses to tighten his hold on the residents. 
 Overnight Mr. Venkatesh becomes a pariah. A sympathetic prostitute tells him not to worry too much about angry tenants hunting him down, though, since a good beating can often clear the air. ''Just don't take the stairs when you leave, 'cause if you get caught there, they may never find your body,'' she adds. 
 Although riveting, Mr. Venkatesh's venture into rogue sociology counts as something of a period piece. The City of Chicago began demolishing the Robert Taylor Homes soon after he completed his research, dispersing the Black Kings and depriving J. T. of a big future in crime as the city's crack economy shrank. His management skills did not transfer to the dry cleaning business, his next stop. 
 Mr. Venkatesh, in a sentimental afterword, bids him a fond farewell. Good riddance is more like it.

HEADLINE: Consumers Holding Back on Spending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Consumers cut back on their spending at the nation's retailers in December, wrapping up the weakest sales year since 2002, according to a gloomy report that fanned fears of a recession.
 The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the 0.4 percent drop in retail sales in December, which followed a brisk 1 percent gain in November, was the worst showing since June, when sales declined by 0.8 percent. The November number was revised down from a previously reported 1.2 percent
 ''Consumers held tight to their wallets in December, raising questions about whether household spending will be enough to keep us out of a recession,'' said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
 The downturn came amid a deteriorating job market, expensive energy bills and a persistent housing slump that has weakened home values and propelled foreclosures to record highs.
 In another report on Tuesday, the Labor Department said that the producer price index, a measure of prices received by farms, factories and refineries, dropped 0.1 percent in December, but was up 6.3 percent for 2007, the biggest annual gain in 26 years, mostly reflecting higher energy costs. But core prices, which omit food and energy costs, edged up 0.2 percent.
 Excluding sales of automobiles, which can swing widely from month to month, sales at all other retailers also fell by 0.4 percent in December, the biggest decline since August.
 The report was much weaker than many economists were expecting. They were forecasting overall sales to be flat last month and for sales -- excluding autos -- to drop by 0.1 percent.
 Energy prices fell 1.9 percent in December as gasoline costs declined 4.8 percent. But for the year, gasoline prices were up 37.1 percent. 
 The big worry is that consumers will keep on reducing spending, plunging the economy into a recession. To bolster the economy, the Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pledged last week to lower interest rates. Many economists predict the Fed will slash its key rate, now at 4.25 percent, by a bold half-percentage point later this month. 
 Many analysts predict that coming reports will show the economy grew at a feeble pace of 1.5 percent or less in the final three months of last year and will be weak in the first three months of this year as consumers tighten their belts.
 The Congressional Budget Office, in a report Tuesday, said ''the risk of recession is elevated'' and noted that some economists ''believe that the probability of a recession has now risen to 50 percent or greater.''
 For all of 2007, retail sales rose 4.2 percent. That was down from a 5.9 percent increase in 2006 and was the smallest rise since 2002, when sales went up by 2.4 percent as the economy was recovering from the 2001 recession.
 The weakness in the retail sales report was fairly widespread, underscoring the stresses on consumers.
 Sales at building and garden supply stores, for example, fell 2.9 percent in December, the most since February 2003. Purchases of electronics dropped 1.9 percent last month, the most in nearly two years.
 Clothing sales declined 2 percent, the most since September 2005. Sales of sporting goods, music and books also fell 2 percent. Car sales and department store sales each dipped 0.4 percent. Gasoline station sales dropped 1.7 percent.
 Sales at furniture stores rose 0.6 percent. Sales at food stores and health and beauty stores rose 0.7 percent.

HEADLINE: Blue-Collar Jobs Disappear, Taking Families' Way of Life Along

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: JACKSON, Ohio 

 BODY:
After 30 years at a factory making truck parts, Jeffrey Evans was earning $14.55 an hour in what he called ''one of the better-paying jobs in the area.'' 
 Wearing a Harley-Davidson cap, a bittersweet reminder of crushed dreams, he recently described how astonished and betrayed he felt when the plant was shut down in August after a labor dispute. Despite sporadic construction work, Mr. Evans has seen his income reduced by half. 
 So he was astonished yet again to find himself, at age 49, selling off his cherished Harley and most of his apartment furniture and moving in with his mother.
 Middle-aged men moving in with parents, wives taking two jobs, veteran workers taking overnight shifts at half their former pay, families moving West -- these are signs of the turmoil and stresses emerging in the little towns and backwoods mobile homes of southeast Ohio, where dozens of factories and several coal mines have closed over the last decade, and small businesses are giving way to big-box retailers and fast-food outlets. 
 Here, where the northern swells of the Appalachians lap the southern fringe of the Rust Belt, thousands of people who long had tough but sustainable lives are being wrenched into the working poor. 
 The region presents an acute example of trends affecting many parts of Ohio, Michigan and other pockets of the Midwest. 
 Slammed by the continued decline in the automobile and steel businesses, Ohio never recovered from the recession of 2001-2, and blue-collar families who had made it partway up the economic ladder find themselves slipping back, with chaotic effects on families and dreams. 
 Throughout the state, the percentage of families living below the poverty line -- just over $20,000 for a family of four last year -- rose slightly from 14 percent in 2005 to 16 percent in 2007, one study found. But equally striking is the rise in younger working families struggling above that line. The numbers are more dismal in the southeastern Appalachian part of the state, where 32 percent of families lived below the poverty line in 2007, according to the study, and 56 percent lived with incomes less than $40,000 for a family of four.
 ''These younger workers should be the backbone of the economy,'' said Shiloh Turner, study director for the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati, which conducted the surveys. But in parts of Ohio, Ms. Turner said, half or more ''are barely making ends meet.'' 
 One consequence is an upending of the traditional pattern, in which middle-aged children take in an elderly parent. As $15-an-hour factory jobs are replaced by $7- or $8-an-hour retail jobs, more men in their 30s and 40s are moving in with their parents or grandparents, said Cheryl Thiessen, the director of Jackson/Vinton Community Action, which runs medical, fuel and other aid programs in Jackson and Vinton Counties. 
 Other unemployed or low-wage workers, some with families, find themselves staying with one relative after another, Ms. Thiessen said, serially wearing out their welcome. 
 ''A lot of major employers have left, and the town is drying up,'' Ms. Thiessen said of Jackson. ''We're starting to lose small shops, too -- Hallmark, the jewelry and shoe stores, the movie theater and most of the grocery stores.''
 Shari Joos, 45, a married mother of four boys in nearby Wellston, said, ''If you don't work at Wal-Mart, the only job you can get around here is in fast food.''
 Between her husband's factory job and her intermittent work, they made $30,000 a year in the best of times, Mrs. Joos said. Since last fall, when her husband was laid off by the Merillat cabinet factory, which downsized to one shift a day from three, keeping anywhere near that income required Mrs. Joos to take a second job. She works at a school cafeteria each weekday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m and then drives to Wal-Mart, where she relaxes in her car before starting her 2-to-10 p.m. shift at the deli counter. 
 Her 20-year-old son went to college for two years, earning an associate degree in information science, but cannot find any jobs nearby. He still works at McDonald's and lives at home as he ponders whether to move to a distant city, as most local college graduates must. Her 22-year-old son works at Burger King and lives with his grandparents -- ''that was his way of moving out,'' Mrs. Joos said.
 In late December her husband landed a new job, driving a fork lift at a Wal-Mart distribution center, a shift that ends at 2:30 a.m. It pays a little less than he used to make and is an hour's drive away, so gasoline soaks up a painful share of his wages.
 ''We never see each other,'' Mrs. Joos, 45, said on a recent morning as she packed a roast beef and cheese sandwich for her evening meal. ''We never even think of taking a vacation.'' 
 Luckily they had paid off their mobile home and an addition they built. 
 As experienced men in this corner of Ohio have found themselves working for lower wages, others feel they must move.
 ''I'm ain't going to work for no $8 an hour!'' said Lindsey Webb, 52, who, like Mr. Evans, was one of hundreds laid off when Meridian Automotive Systems closed its local plant. On a recent night, Mr. Webb was helping out in a trailer in front of the old factory, a vigil by the United Steelworkers Union to remind the company of its obligations to former workers. 
 Mr. Webb, who worked at the plant for 33 years, made more than $16 an hour doing machine maintenance. Now he is thinking of moving to Arizona, taking along his elderly father, whom he helps care for. 
 Darrel McKenzie, 44, was also a maintenance man at Meridian and grossed more than $60,000 a year. Now he has restarted at the bottom as a union pipe-fitting apprentice and expects to make $20,000 this year. His family just ''does less,'' Mr. McKenzie said.
 Mr. Evans said that moving back into the home where he grew up, after decades of independence, was a stinging reminder that ''I lost everything I worked for all my life.''
 His mother, Shirley Sheline, 73, had worked 28 years at the same auto parts plant, and shares his dismay. ''Can you believe it, a grown man forced to move back with his mother,'' she said.
 Seeing his desperation last year, she added a room to her house with a separate door. 
 ''I don't know what I'd have done without my mom,'' Mr. Evans said. ''At least I can help her, or if I get back on my feet, she can rent it out.''
 By contrast, selling his Harley, which he would have paid off this year, was pure torture. He had owned a Harley since he was 20, and weekend cruising with pals was his favorite recreation.
 ''The buyer said he wanted to take it away in the back of a trailer,'' Mr. Evans recalled, ''and I said, 'That won't happen.'<0>''
 ''Instead I drove it to his house, threw him the keys, came home and got drunk.''

HEADLINE: Worry in Michigan as Forests Change Hands

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: MARQUETTE, Mich. 

 BODY:
Last summer, as land and housing values crumbled in much of Michigan, Northern Michigan Land Brokers and a group of investors completed a $7.3 million deal to buy 7,300 acres of forest and undeveloped land -- 80 parcels in all -- along several rivers in the Upper Peninsula. 
 The sale of such a sizable expanse of forest and the modest price per acre were part of an enormous, and for some, worrisome transformation in timberland ownership and use throughout the Upper Peninsula, a territory twice as large as New Jersey, with 312,000 residents, more than 400 wolves and roughly as many counties (15) as stoplights. 
 Since 2005, more than a million acres of timberland have changed hands, most of it bought by just two owners. The investment firm GMO, based in Boston, purchased 440,000 acres from International Paper, and a Seattle real estate investment trust, the Plum Creek Timber Company, spent $345 million to buy 650,000 acres, the largest sale of timberland ever in the Midwest. Another big owner is the Forestland Group, which entered the Upper Peninsula in 2003 and now owns 550,000 acres.
 The big land sales, and hundreds of smaller transactions, have caused many people in the Upper Peninsula to be concerned about changes in their ability to hunt and fish, and thousands of workers in forest product industries worry for their jobs. Others recognize the opportunity to expand the nearly $1 billion annual recreation economy in a region that is steadily losing jobs and nearly 1,000 residents annually. 
 Forest industry analysts, among them Steven Chercover of D. A. Davidson & Company, a brokerage firm in Portland, Ore., say that trends in the timber industry, land markets and tax policy are promoting the conversion of timberland to development. 
 Growing numbers of wealthy professionals and baby boomers from Milwaukee, Chicago, Detroit, Grand Rapids and Traverse City are seeking land for second homes or for relocation, according to an analysis of census and land records by Eric Anderson, a senior Marquette County planner. In addition, buyers are eager to capitalize on the attractive land prices and the near certainty that they will continue climbing steadily. 
 ''People are looking for and finding their slice of heaven,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''They are willing to come a long way to get it.'' 
 Since Northern Michigan Land Brokers and investors bought the expanse of riverfront from We Energies, a Wisconsin utility, in June, the broker has sold 22 parcels, including a 200-acre block, at roughly $2,000 an acre -- twice as much an acre as the company paid -- according to Robert Sullivan, the firm's principal owner. 
 ''There's been no downturn in land values in this market,'' he said in an interview in his downtown office here, while trucks loaded with freshly cut logs rolled by. ''We're different from the rest of the state.''
 Indeed, Naterra Land Inc., a recreational land development company, sold five heavily forested lots last year in the Cataract Basin, a wide bend in the Escanaba River about 40 miles south of here. 
 The company, which has offices in Michigan and four other states, bought 1,360 acres in 2005 from the Upper Peninsula Power Company for an estimated $1,100 an acre. It sold riverfront lots in December in the Cataract Basin for more than $10,000 an acre, and lots off the river for $4,000 to $5,000 an acre, according to county property records. 
 ''The market is strong,'' said Scott Cisney, vice president in Naterra's Marquette office. ''People want something in the north woods. They've got the funds to do it.''
 The biggest landowners are also starting to quietly sell land. Plum Creek sold 1,060 acres last year in Marquette County to 10 buyers. Plum Creek said the sales prices ranged from $800 to $1,400 an acre, for land bought for just over $530 an acre.
 ''It's a beautiful business model,'' said Kathy Budinick, director for communications at Plum Creek, which owns 8.2 million acres nationwide, more than any other timberland company.
 In the first three quarters of 2007, it sold more than 92,000 acres. ''We recognize when we buy timberland that the trees and the land are growing in value,'' she said. ''How many other industries have inventory that appreciates in value?'' 
 A report on corporate land ownership in the Upper Peninsula, published last month by a consortium of universities and nonprofit conservation groups, found that much of the 8.2 million acres of forest owned by big timber management companies, as well as by the state and the federal government, is likely to remain in traditional use for producing lumber and paper and for recreation and wildlife conservation. 
 But the report, ''Large-tract Forestland Ownership Change,'' also concluded that the day is approaching when a portion -- probably 10 to 20 percent of the 2.1 million acres of commercial forest land owned by corporations -- could be developed for housing or recreational use. 
 Those lands lie along the thousands of wild streams and untouched lakes in the Upper Peninsula, close to existing communities, or near the shore of Lake Michigan and Lake Superior.
 In other words, those are the places that people want to buy for camps and cabins. Jackie Lykins, an assessment official in Marquette County, booted up her computer and displayed some of the dozens of sizable tracts of timberland -- parcels ranging from 40 acres to 400 -- that were sold last year to buyers from other states. Most were along streams and around lakes.
 Michigan, moreover, has made it economically practical for timberland management companies to plan for development. Its Commercial Forest Act requires companies to pay just $1.20 an acre annually in taxes as long as they manage for timber harvest and allow fishing and hunting. 
 Mr. Chercover, the industry research analyst, said he was sympathetic to those worried about changes in land use, but he also said that executives were maximizing value for their shareholders. ''It's the future of timberland management,'' Mr. Chercover said. ''I understand why people who live there don't like getting priced out of the market by some rich guy from Chicago who can buy 1,000 acres.
 ''But in the end, the Upper Peninsula will be what it's always been. A place to hunt and fish and hike and have fun.''

HEADLINE: A Tool to Stimulate the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Your Jan. 8 Business Day article about economic stimulus didn't mention one important tool that has particular currency right now: ratcheting up federal grants to states. States and localities depend on property taxes to finance much of their operations, but as foreclosures grow and home values fall, local revenues are taking a big hit, forcing towns and cities to cut back on needed projects at precisely the wrong time, economy-wise. 
 Tax collections are already down in 24 states because of the housing slump, and the 10 states hit the hardest, including California, will lose $6.6 billion in tax revenue this year. By increasing aid to states, the federal government can help offset this revenue crunch. 
 Moreover, economists have shown that this type of stimulus works quickly and effectively, with a large bang for the buck.

HEADLINE: Global Advances Challenge U.S. Dominance in Science

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The United States remains the world leader in scientific and technological innovation, but its dominance is threatened by economic development elsewhere, particularly in Asia, the National Science Board said Tuesday in its biennial report on science and engineering. 
 The United States' position is especially delicate, the agency said, given its reliance on foreign-born workers to fill technical jobs. 
 The board is the oversight agency for the National Science Foundation, the leading source of money for basic research in the physical sciences.
 The report, on the Web at nsf.gov/statistics/indicators, recommends increased financing for basic research and greater ''intellectual interchange'' between researchers in academia and industry. The board also called for better efforts to track the globalization of high-tech manufacturing and services and their implications for the American economy.
 Over all, the report said, surveys of science and mathematics education are ''disappointing and encouraging.'' Fourth- and eighth-grade students in all ethnic groups showed improvement in math, it said, but progress in science is far less robust. 
 Knowledge gaps persist between demographic groups, with European- and Asian-Americans scoring higher than other groups. 
 Many Americans remain ignorant about much of science, the board said. Many are unable to answer correctly when asked whether Earth moves around the Sun (it does). 
 They are not noticeably more ignorant than people in other developed countries except on two subjects, evolution and the Big Bang. Although these ideas are organizing principles underlying modern biology and physics, many Americans do not accept them. 
 ''These differences probably indicate that many Americans hold religious beliefs that cause them to be skeptical of established scientific ideas,'' the report said, ''even when they have some basic familiarity with those ideas.''

HEADLINE: Short on Fund-Raising, Red Cross Will Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Facing a $200 million operating deficit, the American Red Cross is preparing to cut as much as one-third of its headquarters staff, up to 1,000 employees, and pare regional management.
 The cutbacks will not diminish the relief operations and other services provided by the organization, said Suzy C. DeFrancis, the Red Cross's chief public affairs officer.
 ''We've just come to the conclusion that we've gotten too top heavy,'' Ms. DeFrancis said, ''that we are spending more than we are bringing in, and that the fund-raising environment is competitive.'' 
 But she added, ''We believe this exercise will make us strong'' in delivering service.
 She said the 126-year-old organization had not tapped its $800 million endowment to cover the deficit but relied instead on loans that it uses as part of its normal cash-management process. Its budget in 2007 was $3.45 billion, which includes its blood operations as well as its disaster services.
 Ms. DeFrancis said she needed more time to determine whether the deficit was the largest in Red Cross history.
 The organization has struggled with its fund-raising since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Then, it was criticized for plans to set aside some $200 million of the donations it was receiving as a reserve fund for future terrorist attacks and to improve its own readiness for such attacks.
 Under pressure from the news media and regulators, the organization quickly adopted a policy under which any money earmarked by a donor for a specific disaster could be used only for that disaster, instead of flowing into the Red Cross's general disaster-relief fund, a pool of unrestricted money used to underwrite disaster services. That fund has been nearly or entirely depleted since then.
 Moreover, the lack of a major disaster since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the organization raised more than $2 billion, has crimped fund-raising, former and current executives said. Last year was a case in point: The organization responded to myriad small and midsized disasters, like the wildfires in California, that did little to attract the attention of donors.
 Ms. DeFrancis declined to discuss fund-raising problems specifically, other than to say that the organization had not raised enough to cover costs. ''There are probably a lot of explanations for this deficit,'' she said.
 On the spending side, the Red Cross headquarters, housed in a palatial office building in northwest Washington, has long been perceived by many in the nonprofit industry as overstaffed.
 The organization has also long relied on out-of-date technology that has increased its cost of doing business. Red Cross chapters, for instance, use a variety of accounting systems, requiring a staff at headquarters that can translate them into a common ''language.'' The audit process is not automated and requires a large staff to handle it.
 The Red Cross has also made investments to improve its operations, like upgrading and expanding its communications equipment.
 ''Look, this restructuring is needed,'' said one former executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because he has received no official word about the restructuring efforts. ''It can be a good thing if they cut the right things, like some of the internal support functions, and focus what's left on providing services.''
 Another factor in the Red Cross's financial travails is the revolving door at its top. 
 The organization has had five leaders since 2002, which shakes the confidence of big corporate donors. It took the Red Cross 18 months to find its last president and chief executive, Mark W. Everson. He was dismissed in November because of his affair with the married head of a Red Cross chapter in Mississippi.
 During his six-month tenure, Mr. Everson, a former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, often complained about weak fund-raising, and said he had planned to pare the headquarters staff by 20 percent. This month, though, senior staff members were told that the job cuts would be deeper, two executives said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the board had not made any final decision.
 Department heads have begun notifying staff members whose jobs will be cut, former and current executives said. For example, about 60 members of the organization's national fund-raising staff have been told they should start looking for new jobs, and members of the organization's communications and finance staff have left recently.
 Staff members have been told that the cuts will be in the range of 25 percent to 30 percent, or 750 to 1,000 positions, three employees from different departments said, but Ms. DeFrancis said no final decisions had been made. 
 ''All those numbers are under review,'' she said. ''We are doing a comprehensive review meeting with the board this weekend where we will present our concepts about what needs to be done.''
 The board will meet in late February for a final vote on the overhaul.
 Like other nonprofits, the Red Cross is likely to be heading into a tough fund-raising environment. While a survey by the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University suggested that the fund-raising climate at the end of 2007 was somewhat better than it was in 2006, steep drops in the stock market and consumer confidence, rising inflation, falling retail sales and pessimism about the economy do not bode well for fund-raising this year.

HEADLINE: Interest Fades in the Once-Mighty V-8

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The V-8 engine, long a symbol of power for American car companies, is sputtering.
 At the Detroit auto show this week, Detroit's Big Three are promoting smaller engines and alternative-fuel vehicles, eliminating the V-8 from many models and relegating it to niche status.
 Ford Motor, which first popularized the V-8 in the 1930s, will start using a turbocharged 6-cylinder in many vehicles, including the next generation of its Explorer sport utility vehicle. The company has named its new engine technology EcoBoost, a nod to consumers' concern for the environment. 
 ''It's pretty clear that the V-8 is on its way out of the mainstream,'' said Ford's chairman, William Clay Ford Jr.
 General Motors recently canceled a $300 million program to develop a new V-8, citing new fuel-economy standards that require a 40 percent improvement in overall gas mileage by 2020. ''That cancellation was a direct result of the 35-mile-per-gallon legislation,'' Robert A. Lutz, G.M.'s vice chairman, said Tuesday.
 Even the famed Hemi V-8 from Chrysler will be quieted at stoplights when it is paired this year with hybrid technology in some big S.U.V.'s.
 Car companies, in a sense, are catching up with shifting consumer tastes: sales of V-8 engines in the United States have dropped 24 percent since 2004, according to the auto research firm R. L. Polk & Company.
 The V-8 will still be a staple in pickups and large S.U.V.'s, and Detroit continues to flex its muscle-car muscle with some other models. General Motors, for example, unveiled this week a limited-edition 620-horsepower Corvette ZR1 -- the fastest and most powerful Chevrolet ever -- and a high-performance Cadillac, the CTS-V, offering 550 horsepower. 
 Ford executives said they had at times wrestled with the decision to give up V-8s in some models, including a new sedan from the Lincoln luxury division, because they worried about customer reaction. 
 ''I worked on the Lincoln Continental program 20 years ago, and people were vehement that it had to have a V-8,'' said Mark Fields, Ford's president for the Americas. ''But now people don't really care if the performance is there.''
 Some Asian automakers, notably Honda of Japan, have stayed out of the V-8 market entirely. Toyota offers V-8s in its full-size pickups and S.U.V.'s, but it has dominated the midsize car market with less powerful engines. 
 ''The era of indulgence is over,'' said John A. Casesa, managing partner at the Casesa Shapiro Group, an investment firm in New York. ''When oil goes to $100 a barrel, the romance of a V-8 under the hood diminishes pretty quickly.''
 Chrysler is bucking the trend somewhat. The company is updating its Hemi engine and achieving better fuel economy by marrying the current edition to a hybrid system in its full-size Dodge Durango and Chrysler Aspen S.U.V.'s.
 But the automaker, which was bought last year by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, is developing a new line of V-6 engines that would be an alternative to the V-8s in popular models like the Jeep Grand Cherokee S.U.V. 
 ''There's a new group of young customers that may not appreciate or care what the Hemi does,'' said the Chrysler vice chairman, James E. Press.
 That observation would have been considered sacrilegious in the glory days of the V-8, when drivers blared Chuck Berry's ''Maybellene,'' singing along to the words, ''Nothing will outrun my V-8 Ford,'' and Detroit packed even smaller cars like the Dodge Dart and A.M.C. Gremlin with big engines.
 Mr. Ford, the 50-year-old great-grandson of the company's founder, Henry Ford, said the passing of the V-8 era is somewhat bittersweet for baby boomers like him.
 ''We all grew up when the coolest guy on the block had the most cubic inches under the hood,'' he said. ''That feeling dies hard.''

HEADLINE: Iraqi Spending to Rebuild Has Slowed, Report Says

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
Highly promising figures that the administration cited to demonstrate economic progress in Iraq last fall, when Congress was considering whether to continue financing the war, cannot be substantiated by official Iraqi budget records, the Government Accountability Office reported Tuesday.
 The Iraqi government had been severely criticized for failing to spend billions of dollars of its oil revenues in 2006 to finance its own reconstruction, but last September the administration said Iraq had greatly accelerated such spending. By July 2007, the administration said, Iraq had spent some 24 percent of $10 billion set aside for reconstruction that year.
 As Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Iraq, prepared in September to report to Congress on the state of the war, the economic figures were a rare sign of progress within Iraq's often dysfunctional government. 
 But in its report on Tuesday, the accountability office said official Iraqi Finance Ministry records showed that Iraq had spent only 4.4 percent of the reconstruction budget by August 2007. It also said that the rate of spending had substantially slowed from the previous year.
 The reason for the difference, said Joseph A. Christoff, the G.A.O.'s director of international affairs and trade, was that few official Iraqi figures for 2007 were available when General Petraeus and Mr. Crocker went to Congress. 
 So the administration, with the help of the Finance Ministry in Baghdad, appears to have relied on a combination of indicators, including real expenditures, ministries' suggestions of projects they intended to carry out, and contracts that were still under negotiation, Mr. Christoff said. But actual spending does not seem to have lived up to those estimates for spending on reconstruction, a budget item sometimes called capital or investment expenditures, he added.
 ''So it looked like an improvement, but it wasn't an improvement,'' he said.
 The United States Treasury Department and State Department criticized the conclusions in comments included in the report, saying that the G.A.O. had not accounted for all places in the Iraqi budget where investment or capital expenditures had been made. But the report said those departments had not been able to identify specific places where those other expenditures had taken place.
 A spokeswoman for the United States Embassy in Baghdad said Tuesday that she could not comment. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.
 After the United States spent more than $40 billion to rebuild Iraq's faltering electricity, water, sewage, transportation and petroleum sectors, with mixed results at best, Iraq's failure to devote its own resources to continue the task brought severe criticism from Western government and technical organizations.
 The reasons for that failure, Iraqi and American officials said, included the challenges of carrying out construction projects in a dangerous countryside, a lack of expertise in a nation drained of technical talent, and a fear that new anticorruption measures would be widely used to prosecute Iraqi officials accustomed to operating in a culture of bribes and financial back-scratching.
 Still, after Iraq's failure to spend its own money on reconstruction was first disclosed in late 2006, Iraqi and American officials repeatedly asserted that the problems would be much less severe the next year, as the new government led by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki found its way. 
 In addition, the officials said, with the American troop increase and security improvements, security problems would lessen. And American training programs were producing more skilled Iraqi contracting and finance officials. The figures put forth in September appeared to endorse those claims.
 But the accountability office figures, which Mr. Christoff said were taken directly from Finance Ministry records, show that through August 2007 the Iraqi government had spent less than half the percentage of its investment budget that it had spent in the same period in 2006.
 Rick Barton, co-director of the postconflict reconstruction project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said all measures of economic progress in Iraq were difficult to pin down precisely. But he said the United States, taking those difficulties into account, should have been wary of touting progress before the facts were clear.
 ''The data in these places is hugely unreliable to begin with, primarily because nobody gets out in the field to see what's going on,'' Mr. Barton said. ''But what is probably troubling is that when you know this, you shouldn't be using this to create wrong impressions or false impressions and pretending that you know what's going on.''

HEADLINE: Wrangling Over Stimulus Is One-Sided So Far

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The economy needs stimulating -- on that much, at least, Congressional Democrats agree. But from there, things get complicated. 
 Most Democrats want a quick tax rebate for middle- and lower-income workers. There are also Democrats who want investment incentives for small businesses and Democrats who want to create a fund for states with budget shortfalls, Democrats who want a short-term increase in food stamps and Democrats who want a temporary expansion of unemployment benefits. 
 There are Democrats who want a sizable increase in spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. And there are Democrats who want assistance for Americans struggling to pay high oil prices or whose homes are at risk of foreclosure. 
 And just to make the debate more interesting, there are Democrats who say that any of these initiatives should be ''paid for'' within five years -- through spending cuts or revenue increases -- to avoid increasing the deficit. Others say they should be paid for partially, and still others insist that deficit spending is appropriate in this case. 
 As Congress ponders how best to jump-start the economy, getting Republicans and Democrats to agree on a plan could turn out to be the easiest part of the process. More challenging may be to get Democrats to agree among themselves, especially because Republicans, led by the White House, are more likely to speak with a unified voice. 
 ''I think we ought to agree on a framework, and once we have a framework, I think we can get into the particular weeds on it,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who together with Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has taken a lead role in coordinating the planning. ''There has to be a temporary stimulus,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''It has to be focused on average Americans.'' 
 Mr. Kennedy said Democrats, in addition to a tax rebate, hoped to extend unemployment benefits to 46 weeks from 26 weeks, with an added 13 weeks in states with high unemployment. He also said senators had a list of infrastructure projects that could proceed rapidly with federal financing.
 The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi of California, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, have urged President Bush to work with them on a bipartisan stimulus plan. And many Democrats are reluctant to discuss specifics before a meeting with the White House next Tuesday. (Although the meeting is technically a briefing on Mr. Bush's trip to the Middle East, the economy will be discussed.) 
 But with economists largely agreeing that government intervention is needed, Democrats are eyeing a stimulus package of $100 billion to $125 billion. And in the corridors of the Capitol, on the campaign trail and in meetings with constituents, the jockeying has begun over how to allocate that money.
 ''Some places the housing crisis is more pronounced,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. ''In other areas it's more home heating oil. In other areas it's extreme job loss. Any package needs to address the pain being felt in the economy in all its different forms.'' 
 The prospect of Democratic infighting was heightened Tuesday by a Congressional Budget Office report weighing potential components of a stimulus plan. It said that extending unemployment benefits and increasing food stamps would help, but that longer-term proposals favored by some Republicans, including a permanent extension of tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, would provide little immediate benefit. Increased spending on infrastructure typically takes too long to help, it said. 
 Other proposals, like direct aid to states, got mixed marks. And it is some of these that may be hotly debated by Democrats. 
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, for instance, favors making it easier for small businesses to get loans. But Representative Barney Frank, also of Massachusetts, said he doubted such incentives were needed. ''I have not seen any analysis that there is a shortfall in business investment,'' he said. 
 After a meeting of House leaders Tuesday, Mr. Frank said he expected that Democrats would bridge their gaps. ''People care enough about dealing with this, they will subordinate their own issues,'' he said. 
 Ms. Pelosi issued a statement saying Democrats were working fast. ''Americans who are facing the prospect of losing their home or job, struggling with the high cost of gas or home heating bills, health care or groceries, cannot afford delay,'' she said. 
 House Republican leaders sent a letter telling Democrats they would cooperate ''provided that the majority takes tax hikes and other unrelated spending off the table,'' especially any increases to pay for the stimulus.
 Representative Mike Ross, Democrat of Arkansas, and a co-chairman of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog coalition, said the group would most likely want to pay for any tax breaks within five years under House ''pay as you go'' rules to avoid raising the deficit.
 But Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York said that would not fly. ''Pay-go is inconsistent with trying to resolve a recession,'' he said. 
 Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, said the challenge would be to find the best course of action given unusual factors like the housing crunch. 
 ''The debate is what mix of policies is best suited for this particular downturn or slump in the economy,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Revival Of 1992's Glum Mood

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
 In April 1992, having just dispatched his rivals for the Democratic nomination, Bill Clinton went to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania to give a big speech on his economic vision. He already knew that he would be able to run against ''the Bush recession,'' as he called it that day. But he decided to make a much broader argument.
 Mr. Clinton said that the economy hadn't really been working since the early 1970s. The recession had simply aggravated problems that existed long before George H. W. Bush took office. ''Even when the Bush recession ends,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''most Americans will find themselves worse off.'' 
 The economic worries of 1992 helped elect Mr. Clinton, of course. And by the end of the decade, thanks to both his policies and a huge stock market bubble, the American economy was roaring along again. The deep anxiety of 1992 seemed to be a piece of economic history. 
 No more. Almost 16 years after Mr. Clinton's speech at Wharton, the economy is again dominating a presidential race. While the details have changed, the main story line remains remarkably similar. A downturn has reawakened fears that the economy no longer works very well for the middle class. 
 Today, as was the case 16 years ago, the downturn itself isn't the main problem. By 1992, as a matter of fact, the economy was already growing again. This year, it's still possible -- if less likely after Tuesday's dismal retail sales report and another sharp decline in stock prices -- that the country will avoid a full-blown recession. 
 The main problem now is that the good times are no longer good enough to carry the middle class through the bad times. For much of the last 35 years, the incomes of most workers have been growing far more slowly than they once did. In the current expansion, which started in 2001, the median weekly paycheck of workers has actually fallen 1 percent, once inflation is taken into account, according to the Labor Department. 
 Economists argue about the reasons for the great wage slowdown -- technology, globalization, health care costs, the decline of unions, the rise of the new wealthy -- but it clearly seems to have made people feel more vulnerable to small economic swings. In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, only 19 percent of those responding said the country was headed in the right direction. That was the lowest percentage since the early 1990s. 
 This glumness is especially striking because perceptions of the economy usually lag behind reality, and the reality hasn't deteriorated much yet for most families. But as in 1992, said Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, ''people are more sour about the economy than the data would seem to warrant.''
 Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah on the Joint Economic Committee, put it this way to me: ''There is a growing disconnect between the way the economy is operating and the way people feel about it. And it stems from individual families' sense of economic anxiety.''
 The most important difference between 1992 and today -- if not the most obvious one -- is the source of that anxiety. Then, as Mr. Clinton noted at Wharton, Japan and Germany seemed to be leaving the United States behind. Companies weren't investing enough in new equipment, and productivity -- the amount an average worker turns out in an hour -- had been growing slowly since the 1970s. None of that would necessarily end when the recession did, he said.
 But as the budget deficit fell and stocks soared, business investment and productivity both picked up. Middle-class incomes surged for the first time in decades. Polls showed Americans in the late 1990s to be more optimistic than at any time since the mid-'60s.
 In some ways, the good times have continued under the current President Bush. For the last six years, the economy has been growing at a pretty healthy clip. The problem now isn't the level of growth but how little of it is filtering down to the middle class.
 In today's economy, middle-class incomes have almost no margin for error. Unless there is a true boom, incomes don't grow much. And the economy has slowed enough this decade to tip the balance and to leave people worrying that worse is yet to come.
 ''In '92, there was a greater fear of staying in one place,'' said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Mr. Clinton then and to Hillary Clinton now. ''In 2008, there is a greater fear of falling.''
 The solution will probably need to involve some combination of education, health care and tax changes. Keep in mind that middle-class families have received not only modest raises in recent years; they have also received smaller reductions in their overall federal tax rates than high-income families have. That's a tough combination.
 For now, the campaign debate has shifted toward short-term questions like how to design a good stimulus package. Unfortunately, no stimulus package will solve the larger issues. The threat of recession ''is a terrible distraction to everyone,'' as Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Senator John McCain's economic adviser, said, because it moves the debate away from globalization, energy policy and climate change, and onto smaller topics like one-time tax rebates.
 Yet I think the big questions may still end up dominating the debate. By this summer, and certainly by Jan. 20, 2009, the stimulus package will be old news, one way or the other. Middle-class anxiety won't be.
 ''The main problem is not short-term,'' Mr. Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman, said. ''But short-term problems have a way of grabbing people's attention.''

HEADLINE: Long Robust, Gains in the City's Property Values Are Starting to Flatten Out

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and RAY RIVERA

 BODY:
The robust growth in real estate values in New York, a trend that helped fuel years of record budget surpluses and city spending, has nearly skidded to a halt, city officials said Tuesday, and that shift could bring new pressure on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to raise taxes.
 The city estimates that when it conducts its annual valuation of all property in the city in May, it will be just 1.44 percent more than the last assessment, the smallest gain since the beginning of the Bloomberg administration. 
 In recent years, the city seemed insulated from dips in the national real estate market, posting several double-digit gains, including an 18 percent increase in values last year. But now, according to data from the tentative annual assessment roll, which will largely determine taxes for the fiscal year beginning in July, declining values of small homes outside Manhattan are pulling down the overall market as the effects of the country's mortgage trouble take hold.
 Precisely how the cooling market will affect revenues remains to be seen, but the data suggest that the kinds of surpluses that have allowed Mr. Bloomberg to increase spending on popular programs while saving for future costs are coming to an end. The city depends on property taxes for more than a third of its tax revenue and, given Wall Street's woes, is already anticipating declines in income tax collections.
 City budget officials declined to comment on the property numbers, but David I. Weprin, chairman of the City Council Finance Committee, said the lower assessments could lead to small increases in the tax rate or an end to the $400 property tax rebate given to homeowners for a property that is their primary residence. 
 ''This is an indicator that we might be up for some tough fiscal times, and Wall Street isn't helping, either,'' he said. ''Property values are no longer going up; they've stabilized, and I would expect that's the trend we'll see before they go down.''
 George Sweeting, deputy director of the city's Independent Budget Office, said the slowing real estate market would cost the city about $100 million in revenue, which could be made up by ending the property tax rebate, which would bring in $250 million in revenue. That change is likely to be politically unpopular.
 John Gallagher, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said the city was already taking steps to account for the new projections. Those measures include a 2.5 percent cut at all agencies for the next six months and an anticipated 5 percent reduction in the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
 ''The current budget and financial plan forecast that the tentative assessment roll would show property values had increased by 2.4 percent,'' he said, adding that the ''actual figure is below that forecast by one percentage point, and the budget modification expected later this month will reflect that. It's important to note that the city has already begun to take prudent fiscal measures in anticipation of a decline in revenues.''
 The city estimates market values from recent sales figures for houses and from potential income for apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives and commercial properties. Officials then set assessed value, from which taxes are determined, at a fraction of the market value.
 According to the report, market values for one-, two- and three-family homes dipped by nearly 3 percent, while those for apartment buildings, commercial property and utilities rose between 6 and 7 percent.
 Under current rates, owners of condominium and cooperative apartments could expect to see their tax bills go up an average of 6.8 percent, or $178.72. 
 But even owners of small properties that are worth less are likely to see their bills go up, Martha E. Stark, the city's finance commissioner, said at a news conference Tuesday. That is because in many cases the assessments for one-, two- and three-family homes were still far below the city target of 6 percent of market value, and will be adjusted upward.
 Owners of one-, two-, and three-family houses would pay an average of 4.9 percent, or $144.46, more in taxes.
 Fiscal experts said it was too early to say how the slowing real estate market would affect taxes, since the rate fluctuates from year to year.
 ''The property tax rate is the balancing item for the budget, so it wobbles around a bit anyway,'' said Carol O'Cleireacain, a former city finance commissioner and budget director who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Whether the city's economic problems are significant enough to compel Mr. Bloomberg to raise property taxes depends on a number of factors, she said, including other tax revenues and the fate of spending cuts the administration has ordered from agencies.
 Earlier this month, the Independent Budget Office projected a budget gap of $3.1 billion for the fiscal year that begins in July, and $4.6 billion for the following year based on problems in the national housing market that have spilled over into the financial services industry, a major driver of the city's economy. 
 The mayor is expected to touch on the city's economy in his State of the City address Thursday and will present a broader picture of the city's overall revenue when he delivers his preliminary budget, which is expected next week. That budget will be the basis for his executive budget in May. He and the City Council must then negotiate a final budget.
 At the same time, although the housing market is cooling, the city's hotel industry continues to thrive. The Marriott Marquis in Times Square was again the most valuable hotel in the city at $579.7 million, up 14.81 percent. 
 ''We were really pleasantly surprised by the hotel numbers, and that really does match up with what we've been seeing from the tourism point of view,'' Ms. Stark said.
 Hotel values are based on occupancy, room rates and other factors. Occupancy rates and income the hotels have been generating are at an all-time high, Ms. Stark said.
 Among commercial properties, the Time Warner Center remained the highest valued, at $1.1 billion, up 5.5 percent from the previous year. Mr. Bloomberg's town house jumped to $14.9 million, up from $13.5 million.

HEADLINE: Romney in Crucial Victory Over McCain in Michigan

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ANN ARBOR, Mich. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor who ran as a son of Michigan though he left the state nearly 40 years ago, won a commanding victory Tuesday in the Republican primary here with a message aimed at voters deeply anxious about the state's ailing economy.
 Mr. Romney defeated his principal rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, by winning a clear plurality of Republicans and conservatives, who turned out in greater numbers than they had in the 2000 primary, which Mr. McCain won.
 ''Tonight marks the beginning of a comeback,'' Mr. Romney said in declaring victory at a hotel rally in Southfield. ''Tonight is a victory of optimism over Washington-style pessimism.''
 Mr. Romney needed a victory in Michigan to save his candidacy after finishing second to Mr. McCain in New Hampshire and to Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, in Iowa. Mr. Huckabee finished third in Michigan. 
 With 97 percent of the electoral precincts reporting, Mr. Romney had 39 percent of the vote, compared with 30 percent for Mr. McCain and 16 percent for Mr. Huckabee. Ron Paul, the antiwar congressman from Texas, came in fourth with 6 percent of the vote.
 Mr. Romney's victory here means three different Republican candidates have won each of the first three major contests. The race moves to South Carolina and Nevada this weekend with no clear front-runner and two credible candidates, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee, yet to seriously contest a state.
 Katon Dawson, the Republican chairman in South Carolina, declared the race for the party's nomination wide open.
 ''Now, it's our time to hold the nation's first truly make-or-break contest this primary season,'' Mr. Dawson said Tuesday night.
 The economy and the troubles of the auto industry dominated the contest here from start to finish, with Mr. Romney seizing on Mr. McCain's suggestions that the jobs lost ''are not coming back.'' Mr. Romney also capitalized on his business background and his father's leadership in the auto industry to persuade voters that he was best equipped to deal with those problems.
 In conceding defeat last night, Mr. McCain congratulated Mr. Romney but said he would be direct about the problems facing the economy.
 ''We did what we always try to do: we went to Michigan and we told people the truth,'' Mr. McCain said. ''I am as committed now as I have ever been to making sure that no state, whether it's Michigan or South Carolina or anywhere in this blessed country, is left behind in the global economy.''
 He continued: ''But that global economy is here to stay and it is, by its nature, constantly changing, as you all know. To compete more successfully in it we must better prepare American workers and students to seize its opportunities. That is how we will build a stronger and more prosperous America.''
 Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that 55 percent cited the economy as their biggest concern, and 42 percent of them cast their ballots for Mr. Romney compared with 29 percent for Mr. McCain. In Iowa, by contrast, only 26 percent of Republican caucusgoers cited the economy as the most important issue, behind immigration. In New Hampshire, the economy was cited as the top concern by 31 percent of Republican primary voters, followed closely by Iraq, at 24 percent and immigration, at 23 percent.
 Mr. McCain campaigned heavily in Michigan, and hoped that a victory in the state would cement a front-runner status for him heading into South Carolina.
 A senior McCain adviser here said the Michigan result meant that Mr. McCain had to win in South Carolina to assert a dominance of the field. If he does not, this adviser said, it makes it more likely that Republicans will fail to coalesce around a candidate even after 21 states hold their nominating contests on Feb. 5. 
 The Michigan results showed much of Mr. Romney's support came from the three-county Detroit metropolitan area, home of many well-off Republicans and where the Romney name is better known. Mr. Romney's father, George, was governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969, and he repeatedly highlighted his Michigan roots in campaign appearances.
 The exit polls, conducted by Edison/Mitofsky for the television networks and The Associated Press, also found that Mr. Romney did well among those who decided in the last day or two, validating his strategy of saturating the state over the past five days with advertising and personal appearances.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, the only major Democratic candidate whose name was on the ballot in Michigan, was the winner on the Democratic side. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina withdrew their names at the request of the national Democratic Party, which penalized Michigan with the loss of its convention delegates because the early date of its primary violated party rules.
 But state party leaders said they believed the Michigan delegates would be seated.
 More than two-thirds of voters in Michigan's Republican primary described themselves as Republicans, up from 48 percent in the 2000 Republican primary. This gave a clear boost to Mr. Romney, who won Republican votes by double-digit margins. 
 Mr. McCain countered with stronger support among independents and Democrats, but they accounted for a far smaller share of the electorate than in 2000. This year, 32 percent of voters here described themselves as independents or Democrats, down from 52 percent in 2000 when Mr. McCain defeated George W. Bush.
 The exit polls of Michigan voters showed that more than two-thirds rated the national economy negatively (they divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney). And just 16 percent said they felt they were getting ahead financially.
 Voters with family incomes of less than $50,000 divided between Mr. Romney and Mr. McCain. Voters earning more tipped to Mr. Romney.
 Voters were most likely to say that the quality that mattered most to them in a candidate was one who shared their values, and more of them supported Mr. Romney, followed by Mr. Huckabee.
 Mr. Huckabee, speaking in South Carolina as the results trickled in, gave credit to Mr. Romney for his victory but pledged to win the next primary.
 ''He won a great race,'' Mr. Huckabee said of Mr. Romney. ''He worked hard. He, of course, has a great base there, but our hats are off to him for his victory there tonight.''
 He continued: ''So it looks like that I won Iowa, John McCain won New Hampshire, Mitt Romney won Michigan. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to win South Carolina.''
 The race in Michigan forced the Republican candidates to focus chiefly on the dismal economy of the state, where thousands of manufacturing jobs have evaporated in the last several years and where the unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is the highest in the nation.
 Forty-two percent of Republican primary voters said Mr. Romney's ties to Michigan helped sway their votes.

HEADLINE: Indian Leader in China Urges Closer Ties

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India on Tuesday described an ascendant Asia in which India and China had a special opportunity to overcome historic hostilities, promote regional development and collaborate on concerns about energy, water supplies and food. 
 ''Our systems are different, but people in both countries are united in their aspirations for a better future,'' Mr. Singh said during a morning speech at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
 Mr. Singh met with China's president, Hu Jintao, later on Tuesday before ending his three-day visit to Beijing, his first trip to China as prime minister. 
 Both countries stressed their common interests and a desire to build closer ties. On Monday, they raised their goals for two-way trade to $60 billion by 2010. 
 Beneath the proclamations of good will, India and China still face a range of disputes, including India's concern over trade imbalances and a longstanding disagreement over the boundaries of their Himalayan border. 
 India also wants Chinese cooperation as it develops its civilian nuclear program and seeks approval from international regulatory groups to buy nuclear technology. In his morning speech, Mr. Singh referred to India's desire for such cooperation. 
 Analysts had not expected any major breakthroughs on specific grievances during the trip. The Indian trade minister, Kamal Nath, led a business delegation and pushed China to open its markets for Indian products. 
 With no substantive changes in the border issue, Mr. Singh said the countries were adhering to principles agreed on in 2005 for resolving the issue. ''We are confident that those principles will guide us to a mutually satisfactory solution of this issue,'' he said, without offering a timetable for such a resolution. 
 On Monday, Mr. Singh and China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, signed a joint statement that focused on broad themes, but also touched on some specific issues. 
 One potentially substantive section dealt with Indian aspirations for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, an ambition some analysts say China has not encouraged. 
 The document said the Indian side reiterated its aspirations for permanent membership on the Council. It added that China understood and supported India's aspirations to play a greater role in the United Nations, including a role in the Council. 
 The joint agreement also called for negotiations to begin a regional trade agreement. 
 Before arriving in Beijing, Mr. Singh said that India had no ambitions to try to contain China's rise, but that the countries should cooperate for mutual benefit. On Tuesday morning, he returned to that theme. ''There is enough space for both India and China to grow and prosper while strengthening our cooperative engagement,'' he said.
 India has taken part in military exercises with the United States, Japan, Australia and Singapore, while Japan has promoted the idea of an alliance of Asian democracies. But Mr. Singh reiterated that India would maintain its historic independence in foreign policy, which ''enables us to pursue mutually beneficial cooperation with all major countries of the world.'' 
 India and China face inevitable competition as each pushes for economic development.
 On Monday, Mr. Wen, the Chinese prime minister, referred to that rivalry and, like Mr. Singh, struck a tone of cooperation. ''We should not ask who will outdo whom,'' Mr. Wen said. When China and India work together, he said, it is good for peace and development in Asia and the world. 
 Han Hua, an associate professor of international studies at Peking University, attended Mr. Singh's speech and said the visit's upbeat tone reflected the growing confidence of both countries, even if more diplomatic work was needed. 
 ''The challenge?'' Professor Han said. ''Trust. Mutual trust.''

HEADLINE: Two Backers Start Drive To Draft Bloomberg

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Supporters of a third-party presidential bid by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg began a 50-state petition drive on Tuesday seeking to ''draft'' the mayor, a billionaire who is edging closer to entering the race while continuing to deny he is a candidate. 
 The petition effort was announced by two veteran political hands who say the current system in Washington is broken and needs a nonpartisan, pragmatic leader like Mr. Bloomberg.
 Gerald Rafshoon, a former spokesman for President Jimmy Carter, and Doug Bailey, a longtime Republican consultant, are not the first to start an online petition drive for Mr. Bloomberg, but their move comes at the height of the primary season. They filed with the Federal Election Commission and the I.R.S. to start the draft-Bloomberg effort.
 ''He'd be a very unique candidate for a very unique time,'' Mr. Rafshoon said.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a 65-year-old Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent, continues to say that he is not a candidate, but he has been polling and conducting a voter analysis in every state as he decides whether to make a bid for president.
 ''It's very flattering, but I am not a candidate for president of the United States,'' he said in New York on Tuesday. ''I've got a job, which I think is a phenomenal job.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's supporters say that part of his appeal is that he would not take campaign donations but would instead pay for his bid by drawing on the billions he made building a media empire.
 The nascent pro-Bloomberg group said it is enthusiastic about the mayor not because of any position he has taken but because of his resume as a chief executive and an elected official -- particularly as a recession starts to look more likely. 
 ''It's the economy, stupid, and I would put my chips on Michael Bloomberg with his experience and his ideas,'' Mr. Rafshoon said.
 Mr. Bailey, who founded a political consulting firm in 1968, says Mr. Bloomberg has too much money to be beholden to special interests.
 When asked why a billionaire politician would need help from a petition drive, Mr. Bailey said: ''I'm not sure it is necessary. I hope it is helpful in convincing him.''

HEADLINE: No G.O.P. Anchor in Sight

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
Can anyone bring the Republicans together again?
 The convincing victory by Mitt Romney in the Michigan primary on Tuesday means three very different states -- with dissimilar electorates driven by distinctive sets of priorities -- have embraced three separate candidates in search of someone who can lead the party into a tough election and beyond President Bush.
 Mr. Romney won easily in Michigan, where he grew up, with a pointed focus on the slowing economy, which voters there overwhelmingly identified as the top issue. Senator John McCain of Arizona won New Hampshire last week with the backing of independent voters, who are so influential there. And Mike Huckabee of Arkansas won the caucuses in Iowa powered by social conservatives who make up a substantial part of its population. 
 On the most tangible level, the vote on Tuesday was proof from the ballot box of what polls have shown: this is a party that is adrift, deeply divided and uninspired when it comes to its presidential candidates and unsure of how to counter an energized Democratic Party.
 Even in victory, Mr. Romney stood as evidence of the trouble the party finds itself in. He won, but only after a major effort in a state he once expected to win in a walk. That was before he lost Iowa and New Hampshire, two other states where he had campaigned all out.
 More than any candidate in the Republican field, Mr. Romney has made a conscious effort to reassemble the coalition of economic and social conservatives that came together with Ronald Reagan and that President Bush kept remarkably unified in his two campaigns and through much of his White House tenure. 
 Mr. Romney's uneven performance has highlighted the strains in that coalition, and a central question about his candidacy is whether he will be able to rally its fractured components to his side. It was no coincidence that he invoked Reagan more than once in his victory speech on Tuesday, though it was perhaps equally telling that he also invoked the first President Bush, who like Mr. Romney struggled to convince Republicans that he was Reagan's rightful heir.
 ''The problem for the Republicans is they all have part of it,'' said Lou Cannon, the Reagan biographer, referring to the conservative movement. ''Huckabee has the social conservative part of it. Reagan had a lot of draw among independents, and McCain has stepped into that. And you have the conservative Wall Street types who are with Romney.''
 Mr. Cannon added, speaking of Mr. Romney, ''I don't know how you put Humpty Dumpty back together again, but certainly he has tried to do it.'' 
 Indeed, no other candidate has tried so assiduously as Mr. Romney to stitch the ideological fabric of his party back together. He shifted positions on some social issues -- including abortion rights, stem cell research and gay rights -- with an eye to winning the allegiance of social conservatives. 
 He presented himself as tough on national security, calling at one debate for doubling the capacity of the prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, when even the administration was starting to talk about closing it. He emphasized his background in business and his support for tax cuts and limited government to appeal to economic conservatives.
 Reagan and Mr. Bush were always able to get different parts of the Republican coalition to overlook differences, in part through their own political skills and strength, in part by emphasizing their commitment to principles. Mr. Romney, with his reputation among some conservatives as an ideological shape shifter, has struggled to do that.
 In Iowa, Mr. Huckabee outflanked him, picking off social conservatives in big numbers suspicious of Mr. Romney's changes in positions over the years. But Mr. Huckabee has been hammered by another part of the old coalition -- economic conservatives -- upset over his record of raising taxes and spending while governor of Arkansas. Indeed, the Club for Growth, one of Mr. Huckabee's biggest tormentors over his record on taxes, issued a statement nine minutes after the polls closed Tuesday headlined, ''Huckabee Loses in Michigan, Taxpayers Win.''
 Foreign policy conservatives have also expressed qualms about Mr. Huckabee because he criticized aspects of Mr. Bush's national security approach.
 Mr. McCain has embraced the national security mantle that first Reagan, by confronting the Soviet Union and communism, and then Mr. Bush, by emphasizing his aggressive approach to battling terrorism, wore with such success. 
 And Mr. McCain's appeal to independents was proved once again in New Hampshire, where unaffiliated voters are permitted to vote in either primary, a point his aides were making Tuesday night in asserting that he, alone in the field, could put some of the pieces of the coalition together.
 ''I think McCain is the one guy in this race who can recreate the Reagan coalition and draw in independents,'' said Mark McKinnon, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain who was media adviser to Mr. Bush in 2000 and 2004.
 But Mr. McCain has his own problems. He continues to be viewed with great suspicion by many conservatives because of his views on immigration, campaign finance laws and the use of aggressive interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects, not to mention his history of fighting with Mr. Bush.
 From Michigan, the Republican candidates head to South Carolina and Nevada on Saturday and to Florida the next week. Again, these are states with very different electorates and, at least potentially, very different concerns. The way things are going for the Republican Party this year, there may be five Republicans who can claim a victory by the time the votes are counted in Florida on Jan. 29.

HEADLINE: What to Expect When You're Free Trading

BYLINE: By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG. 
Steven E. Landsburg, a professor of economics at the University of Rochester, is the author, most recently, of ''More Sex is Safer Sex: The Unconventional Wisdom of Economics.''

DATELINE: Rochester 

 BODY:
 IN the days before Tuesday's Republican presidential primary in Michigan, Mitt Romney and John McCain battled over what the government owes to workers who lose their jobs because of the foreign competition unleashed by free trade. Their rhetoric differed -- Mr. Romney said he would ''fight for every single job,'' while Mr. McCain said some jobs ''are not coming back'' -- but their proposed policies were remarkably similar: educate and retrain the workers for new jobs. 
 All economists know that when American jobs are outsourced, Americans as a group are net winners. What we lose through lower wages is more than offset by what we gain through lower prices. In other words, the winners can more than afford to compensate the losers. Does that mean they ought to? Does it create a moral mandate for the taxpayer-subsidized retraining programs proposed by Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney? 
 Um, no. Even if you've just lost your job, there's something fundamentally churlish about blaming the very phenomenon that's elevated you above the subsistence level since the day you were born. If the world owes you compensation for enduring the downside of trade, what do you owe the world for enjoying the upside?
 I doubt there's a human being on earth who hasn't benefited from the opportunity to trade freely with his neighbors. Imagine what your life would be like if you had to grow your own food, make your own clothes and rely on your grandmother's home remedies for health care. Access to a trained physician might reduce the demand for grandma's home remedies, but -- especially at her age -- she's still got plenty of reason to be thankful for having a doctor. 
 Some people suggest, however, that it makes sense to isolate the moral effects of a single new trading opportunity or free trade agreement. Surely we have fellow citizens who are hurt by those agreements, at least in the limited sense that they'd be better off in a world where trade flourishes, except in this one instance. What do we owe those fellow citizens?
 One way to think about that is to ask what your moral instincts tell you in analogous situations. Suppose, after years of buying shampoo at your local pharmacy, you discover you can order the same shampoo for less money on the Web. Do you have an obligation to compensate your pharmacist? If you move to a cheaper apartment, should you compensate your landlord? When you eat at McDonald's, should you compensate the owners of the diner next door? Public policy should not be designed to advance moral instincts that we all reject every day of our lives.
 In what morally relevant way, then, might displaced workers differ from displaced pharmacists or displaced landlords? You might argue that pharmacists and landlords have always faced cutthroat competition and therefore knew what they were getting into, while decades of tariffs and quotas have led manufacturing workers to expect a modicum of protection. That expectation led them to develop certain skills, and now it's unfair to pull the rug out from under them. 
 Once again, that argument does not mesh with our everyday instincts. For many decades, schoolyard bullying has been a profitable occupation. All across America, bullies have built up skills so they can take advantage of that opportunity. If we toughen the rules to make bullying unprofitable, must we compensate the bullies?
 Bullying and protectionism have a lot in common. They both use force (either directly or through the power of the law) to enrich someone else at your involuntary expense. If you're forced to pay $20 an hour to an American for goods you could have bought from a Mexican for $5 an hour, you're being extorted. When a free trade agreement allows you to buy from the Mexican after all, rejoice in your liberation -- even if Mr. McCain, Mr. Romney and the rest of the presidential candidates don't want you to.

HEADLINE: As Economic Worries Grow, Bush Prods Saudi Arabia on High Oil Prices

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
President Bush on Tuesday urged Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC to consider the strain the high cost of oil was having on the American economy, addressing an issue that has begun to color the last year of his presidency and dominate the presidential election campaign.
 Speaking to a group of Saudi entrepreneurs and later to reporters, Mr. Bush expressed concern about the economy in some of his starkest language yet, saying that rising oil costs and gasoline prices were causing hardship for American families. He vowed to raise the issue with the Saudi leader, King Abdullah, during a meeting and dinner at the king's lush horse farm in the desert outside of Riyadh, the capital. 
 ''My point to His Majesty is going to be, when consumers have less purchasing power because of high prices of gasoline -- in other words, when it affects their families, it could cause this economy to slow down,'' the president said in an expansive interview summarizing his eight-day trip to the Middle East. ''If the economy slows down, there will be less barrels of oil purchased.''
 It was unclear whether Mr. Bush's entreaties alone would have any significant effect on the price of oil, because, as the president acknowledged, demand continues to rise faster than supplies, especially in expanding markets in China and India, as well as the United States.
 Neither King Abdullah nor Mr. Bush discussed the matter publicly as they met for dinner inside a tentlike hall on Tuesday night, chatting instead about the unusually cold weather. But Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, appeared to rebuff the president's appeal earlier in the day.
 Saudi Arabia, he said, shared the president's concern that a downturn in the American economy could have profound effects around the world, including on the oil market. He even raised the prospect of ''recession,'' a word Mr. Bush studiously avoided in the interview, even when pressed about ''the R-word.'' But Mr. Naimi said Saudi Arabia would raise production only ''when the market justifies it.''
 ''Presidents and kings have every right, every privilege, to comment or ask or say whatever they want,'' Mr. Naimi said in a news conference after Mr. Bush's remarks. ''The concern for the U.S. economy is valid, but what affects the U.S. economy is more than the price of oil.''
 Mr. Bush's remarks on oil, made as voters went to the polls in Michigan, underscored a growing worry inside the White House that the economy could sour in his final year in office.
 Mr. Bush has in general not weighed in so directly on economic matters. But with American consumers starting to feel the effects of rising energy costs, his administration is discussing ways to stimulate the economy. And he has raised the issue of oil's impact in public and private meetings with the leaders of several Persian Gulf states, including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and now Saudi Arabia.
 The response has been muted, according to Ed Gillespie, the presidential counselor. 
 ''They talked about the nature of the market and the vast demand that's on the world market today for oil,'' he told reporters late Monday, referring to the leaders Mr. Bush had met. ''That was a point that was obviously made in the course of these conversations by our friends, and that's a legitimate and accurate point.''
 Mr. Bush last met King Abdullah in Crawford, Tex., in April 2005, before the Saudi leader's half brother, King Fahd, died and he assumed the Saudi throne. Then, too, concern about rising oil prices prompted the Bush administration to prod Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, to raise production to ease prices.
 At the time, oil was selling for $54 a barrel; this year, futures have twice passed the $100-a-barrel mark, largely because of tensions between the United States and Iran.
 Prices have fallen in recent days, though, as concerns grow that a possible recession in the United States might cut consumption, just as Mr. Bush warned King Abdullah.
 Asked what specifically he wanted the Saudis and other OPEC producers to do, Mr. Bush said he hoped ''that OPEC, if possible, understands that if they could put supply on the market, it would be helpful.'' But he also said reducing prices would require new investments and exploration and a search for alternative fuels.
 In Abu Dhabi on Monday, Mr. Bush toured an exhibition of alternative energies at the Emirates Palace hotel built by a cash-flush government at a cost of $3 billion. He praised ''the can-do spirit'' of those seeking to exploit new technologies to replace the resource that had made the Persian Gulf states he visited rich.
 Tuesday's talk of oil overshadowed other issues that have dominated Mr. Bush's discussions with King Abdullah and other leaders. Those include the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, the war in Iraq and the diplomatic confrontation with Iran over its nuclear program.
 King Abdullah, like most Arab leaders Mr. Bush met, has not expressed full support for Israel living side by side with a Palestinian state, though he was instrumental in pushing through an Arab League proposal laying the terms for a peace that Israel has rejected. Mr. Bush, though, said the Persian Gulf leaders supported his peace effort, started in Annapolis, Md., in November.
 ''They want to see a deal done,'' he said, adding that the United States had to overcome ''years of disappointment.''
 On the question of Iran, Mr. Bush said he tried to explain his desire to intensify international pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program, despite a National Intelligence Estimate released in Washington in December that concluded that the Iranians had halted a covert nuclear weapons program in 2003.
 He distanced himself from that finding more starkly than before, arguing that Iran's continued enrichment of uranium was a threat because the knowledge used to master that process could be transferred to weapons research.
 ''I defended our intelligence services,'' he said, ''but made it clear that they're an independent agency, that they come to conclusions separate from what I may or may not want.''

HEADLINE: Bush Prods Saudi Arabia on High Oil Prices

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
President Bush urged the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Tuesday to take into account the toll that high oil prices are having on the American economy, gingerly touching on an issue that has begun to color the last year of his presidency and dominate the presidential election campaign.
 Speaking to a group of Saudi entrepreneurs and later in an interview with reporters, Mr. Bush expressed his concern about the economy in some of his starkest language yet, saying that rising oil and gasoline prices are causing hardship for American families.
 ''It's affected our families,'' Mr. Bush said in the interview with reporters, adding he would raise the issue with the Saudi leader, King Abdullah, during a meeting on Tuesday evening at the king's lush horse farm in the desert outside of Riyadh. ''Paying more for gasoline hurts some of the American families,'' he said. 
 As Mr. Bush himself acknowledged, it was not clear that the president's entreaties could have any significant effect on oil prices. Mr. Bush said the demand for oil, especially from expanding markets in China and India, as well as the United States, was rising faster than supplies. 
 Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, appeared to rebuff the president's appeal, though he did so gently. ''We will raise production when the market justifies it,'' he said at press conference after Mr. Bush's remarks. 
 Mr. Naimi said that his country shared Mr. Bush's concern that a downturn in the American economy could have profound effects around the world, including in the oil market. He even raised the prospect of ''recession,'' a word Mr. Bush studiously avoided in his interview with reporters even when pressed.
 ''Presidents and kings have every right, every privilege, to comment or ask or say whatever they want,'' Mr. Naimi said. ''The concern for the U.S. economy is valid, but what affects the U.S. economy is more than the price of oil. We are very much concerned. We don't want the U.S. economy go into recession in the future.''
 Nevertheless, Mr. Bush urged OPEC to consider increasing production, saying it would be helpful. His remarks, coming as voters went to the primary polls in Michigan, appeared to underscore worry inside the White House that the economy, which Mr. Bush again called ''fundamentally sound'', could sour on his watch.
 Mr. Bush, nearing the end of an eight-day trip to the Middle East, has not generally been inclined to weigh in directly on economic matters, but with rising energy costs taking a toll, the price of oil has come up in meetings with the leaders of several Persian Gulf states, including Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and now Saudi Arabia.
 The response has been muted, according to the presidential counselor, Ed Gillespie. ''They talked about the nature of the market and the vast demand that's on the world market today for oil,'' he said on Monday night, referring to the leaders Mr. Bush met. ''That was a point that was obviously made in the course of these conversations by our friends, and that's a legitimate and accurate point.''
 Mr. Bush last met King Abdullah in Crawford, Tex., in April 2005, before the king's half-brother died and he assumed the Saudi throne. At the time, concern about rising oil prices prompted the Bush administration to ask Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, to raise production to ease prices. At the time, oil was selling for $54 a barrel; it is now hovering above $90 a barrel.
 Since the beginning of the year, oil futures have touched the symbolic mark of $100-a-barrel twice because of tensions between Iran and the United States. But prices have fallen in recent days as concerns grow that a possible recession in the United States might cut petroleum consumption. Crude oil for February delivery fell 2.6 percent to $91.78 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Tuesday.
 There have been many factors behind the rise in oil prices in recent years, including high demand from China, tight global supplies, and a lack of enough exploration investments in the 1990s. Political tensions, especially in the Persian Gulf, where more than 60 percent of the world's oil reserves are located, has also played a big part in a quadrupling of oil prices since around 2000.
 For the most part, a growing American economy has had little trouble absorbing higher oil prices even at near-historic high levels. The United States consumes about a quarter of the world's oil every day. Petroleum consumption last year in America still managed to grow, barely, by 0.2 percent to 20.7 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Department. Global oil demand, meanwhile, has been boosted by strong growth in China and the Middle East, which together accounted for two-thirds of consumption growth last year.
 The risk today is that these high energy prices will act as an additional weight on the sputtering economy just as consumers are cutting down on their spending.
 While oil producers blame market speculators for rising prices, OPEC's behavior in recent years has largely contributed to the rising prices as well.
 Since the oil prices collapse of the late 1990s, OPEC has been patiently propping up oil prices through a careful policy of supply management led mainly by Saudi Arabia.
 Because it is the world's largest producer, Saudi Arabia has the biggest clout within the disparate OPEC group and its decisions are typically followed by other members.
 OPEC members do not directly set oil prices. Those are determined on commodity exchanges in New York or London. But through its decisions to lower or boost output, OPEC affects global oil supplies, and therefore plays a key role in influencing global prices. OPEC's 13 member countries account for 40 percent of the world's oil exports.
 Last year, thanks to Saudi leadership. OPEC cut its production twice in order to lower the level of commercial oil stocks held by developed economies. The strategy succeeded in forcing refineries to draw on their oil reserves instead of buying more oil on the market.
 ''OPEC started the snowball rolling,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. ''By reducing inventories last year, they created the environment where noise from Nigeria, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Algeria, you name it has an impact on the market. They were very successful with the two quota cuts.''
 Mr. Goldstein estimates that American consumers paid an extra $75 billion to $90 billion more in petroleum products last year than they did in 2006, because of higher prices.
 ''One of the real risk is that they start to believe in their own propaganda and think they are entitled to high prices,'' Mr. Goldstein said.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Trims Investment Banking Operations

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Bank of America, the banking giant, said on Tuesday that it was scaling back its investment banking operations, shedding an additional 650 jobs after suffering heavy trading losses from bad mortgage investments. 
 The layoffs will be on top of 500 jobs that were eliminated in mid-October, when Bank of America executives signaled plans for a retreat. Together, the cuts represent about 19 percent of the investment bank's 5,900 employees. 
 Executives said that they would reduce coverage of certain investment banking customers and narrow the services it provides to corporate clients overseas. They are also narrowing their trading activities, scaling back their presence in packaging the mortgages and other complex securities that have been hit hardest by a tightening credit market. 
 Bank of America also plans to sell its prime brokerage unit, which faced steep competition and huge investment requirements. The hedge fund Citadel Investments, which has a big prime brokerage arm, has been reported to be interested in the business. Bank of America has received several inquiries, executives said, but no decision has been made. 
 While many analysts and other experts expected a more drastic retrenchment, the moves are still a blow to the bank's plans to develop a top-tier investment bank. 
 Only a few years ago, it embarked on plans to invest more than $625 million to bolster its Wall Street presence. Now it is taking several steps back.
 ''It's your prerogative to use 'retreat' or 'retrench,'<0>'' Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of America's chairman and chief executive, said at a news conference on Tuesday morning. ''I see it as reacting to the realities of the market as you see them today.''
 The changes will reduce the bank's overall revenue, steering it to more predictable but lower-margin businesses. They also make Bank of America even more dependent on the consumer economy at a time when the housing market has deteriorated, credit losses have surged and talk of a recession looms. Just a few days ago, however, Mr. Lewis doubled down his bet with the $4 billion acquisition of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage giant. 
 The moves also raised questions about Mr. Lewis's patience for internal growth. One thing appeared clear: Executives say the company will occupy 34 floors of their new 50-plus floor Bank of America building in Midtown Manhattan, the same number that it previously planned. Space, however, will be allocated to other divisions of the bank.
 The retrenchment comes after a strategic assessment that began in October after Brian T. Moynihan, a longtime Bank of America executive, took over the business. Profit in the division had plummeted to $100 million from $1.43 billion a year earlier, leading to a 32 percent drop in earnings and questions about the bank's ability to manage risk.
 Mr. Lewis said the results were not acceptable and announced 3,000 layoffs across the company at the time. ''I've had all the fun I can stand in investment banking,'' he said in response to a question about acquisition plans at the time.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Lewis called his remarks unfortunate, saying they created a misperception about his commitment to the investment bank. Industry analysts say his remarks might have hastened the departure of some hedge fund clients and talented employees.

HEADLINE: Citigroup's Big Loss Fuels Anxiety and Depresses Stocks

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup, the nation's largest bank, reported a staggering fourth-quarter loss of $9.83 billion on Tuesday and issued a sobering forecast that the housing market and the broader economy still had not bottomed out.
 To shore up their financial condition, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, which has also been rocked by the subprime mortgage debacle, both were forced again to go hat in hand for cash infusions from investors in the United States, Asia and the Middle East, for a combined total of nearly $19.1 billion.
 Citigroup's gloomy news will most likely amplify the anxiety of consumers and workers already concerned that the mortgage crisis could plunge the economy into a recession. Adding to worries, the government reported that retail sales in December declined for the first time since 2002. 
 Growing pessimism led to another sharp sell-off in stocks, which fell about 2 percent for the day and are now down about 6 percent since the beginning of 2008, the third worst start for a year since 1926. 
 More bad news is coming, with Merrill Lynch expected to report sizable losses this week and major financial institutions like Bank of America retreating from their investment banking business. These moves add to concerns that financial institutions will be forced to pull back on lending at a time the economy most needs access to credit to help cushion against a downturn. 
 ''It looks like the financial sector as a whole will see a big decline in profits, and the only time this happened in the last 100 years -- financial firms' going from making good profits to negative profits -- was the Depression in the 1930s,'' said Richard Sylla, a professor of financial history at New York University. ''I don't think it will be as bad this time; the Federal Reserve is fighting the problem as hard as it can.''
 Just last week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the economy was worsening, bringing widespread hope that the Fed would move swiftly to lower interest rates. Wall Street's worsening results combined with Mr. Bernanke's comments will certainly add fuel to the economic stimulus package being debated by the White House, Congress and the central bank. 
 Citigroup's record loss was caused by write-downs from soured mortgage-related securities and reserves for current and future bad loans totaling $23.2 billion. Responding to a string of dismal quarters, the bank said it would also lay off another 4,000 workers, on top of announced reductions of 17,000 employees, and cut its dividend to conserve $4.4 billion cash annually.
 Citigroup, which earlier raised $7.5 billion from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority to improve its capital, said it had raised an additional $12.5 billion from a number of investors, including the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and Citigroup's former chairman and chief executive, Sanford I. Weill. Citigroup will also offer public investors about $2 billion of newly issued debt securities, a portion of which will be convertible into stock. 
 At the same time, Merrill Lynch announced it had issued $6.6 billion in preferred stock to the Kuwait Investment Authority, the Korean Investment Corporation, Mizhuo Financial Group, a Japanese bank and other investors, including the New Jersey pension fund and a Saudi investment fund. That is in addition to the $4.4 billion it raised in December from Temasek Holdings of Singapore. 
 While the banks were able to raise record amounts of cash, they had to circle the globe to get it, and they had to raise it in two separate rounds. There is ''a tremendous amount of liquidity in the world,'' Mr. Weill said in an interview. ''That is witnessed in the amounts of money Citigroup was able to raise in a very short period of time.''
 Citigroup, which has a large consumer lending business, sounded some warning bells on Tuesday that the American economy was turning. The bank reported sharp upticks in losses stemming from souring auto, home and credit card loans, with problems coming from the same areas being hit by real estate. 
 Two-thirds of the credit card losses, for example, occurred in just five states -- California, Florida, Illinois, Arizona and Michigan -- that have been among those hit hardest by the housing downturn. Gary L. Crittenden, the company's chief financial officer, acknowledged the bank's losses appeared to be accelerating month after month. 
 The banks' need for additional financing suggests that housing-related problem will persist. Citigroup executives expect house prices around the country will fall, on average, another 6.5 percent to 7 percent. 
 The news sent the company's stock tumbling 7.3 percent, to $26.94. It has now fallen about 50 percent in the past year. 
 The write-downs did not assuage fears in the market that more bad news was coming. ''I think the financials will continue to need to raise more money,'' said Barry L. Ritholtz, chief executive of Fusion IQ, a quantitative research and asset management firm. 
 The fear is that financial institutions will continue to take large write-downs as bad loans mount, while consumers, facing higher energy costs, falling house prices and a bleak outlook for job growth, will rein in spending even more than they already have. 
 Citigroup set aside $4.1 billion for future bad loans, and Mr. Crittenden said the bank is tightening lending standards as credit card defaults increase, a move that could make it harder for consumers to continue the spending that has helped fuel growth in recent years.
 Bank of America said on Tuesday that it would lay off 650 people on top of the previously announced 500 and retrench in a number of significant businesses, including certain trading operations and prime brokerage, or servicing hedge funds. Kenneth D. Lewis, its chairman and chief executive, sounded a somber note about the markets.
 ''I am not sure there are any quick fixes,'' he said in a meeting with reporters. ''Only time and a little more pain will be the answer.'' 
 Adding concern to the outlook is the significant role that financial service companies have come to play on the back of robust growth. From 1995 through 2006, financial service companies represented 17.8 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 index and contributed a whopping 25.1 percent of total earnings. No longer. 
 Including Citibank's large fourth-quarter write-down, financial service companies constituted roughly 7 percent of total fourth-quarter earnings, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's. 
 For a sense of how steep the fall has been, Mr. Silverblatt pointed out that for the fourth quarter, earnings for all companies in the index fell 11.2 percent. But taking out financials, the index was up almost 11 percent. 
 Mr. Ritholtz from Fusion IQ is watching carefully to determine if weakness in consumer spending is psychological and temporary or more severe, stemming from a lack of available capital. 
 ''Lending is a function of trust -- trust that people will pay back what they borrow,'' he said. ''The problem with the banks is that they don't trust their clients or each other.''

HEADLINE: Michigan, Hearing Promise of Revival, Returns the Favor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SOUTHFIELD, Mich. 

 BODY:
At the end of Mitt Romney's victory speech here on Tuesday night, he donned the mantle he had worn for the last week while campaigning to salvage his presidential candidacy -- that of native son.
 He invoked his father, George, a former chairman of American Motors and a popular three-term governor here, and attributed his victory to the ''spirit'' of the state where he was born and reared. 
 But just as important as Mr. Romney's personal ties was that he found himself, after setbacks in Iowa and New Hampshire, in an economically downtrodden state that has shed millions of jobs. The economic woes here played neatly into his strengths as a candidate, and his newly retooled message centered around his private sector experience and a promise to bring change to Washington. 
 Mr. Romney's advisers said they would focus on the emergence of the economy as a prime voter concern as they sought to build on his momentum here.
 But the road to the nomination for Mr. Romney continues to be steep, even if his victory on Tuesday again shook up an already remarkably fluid field and revived his candidacy. 
 After broadcasting commercials in South Carolina for months and building the most impressive field operation in the state, Mr. Romney's campaign pulled his ads in the state last week, raising questions about whether he would even compete in the contest on Saturday. 
 His advisers have conceded that the state is problematic for them given the influence of evangelicals, who are suspicious of Mr. Romney's Mormon faith.
 Over the past few days, Mr. Romney's advisers have vigorously debated how hard to compete in South Carolina, with some arguing he should skip the primary, pointing out it is winner-take-all in terms of delegates, and concentrate instead on Florida, where the primary is Jan. 29, as well as shore up support in Nevada, which also votes on Saturday. 
 But Mr. Romney's aides concluded that most of the news media's attention would be focused on South Carolina, so the campaign went back up with television commercials in the state on Tuesday, broadcasting an advertisement focusing on economic competition from Asia that had made its debut in Michigan.
 Senator John McCain and Mike Huckabee appear to be battling for the lead in South Carolina, with a revitalized Fred D. Thompson also a factor. Rudolph W. Giuliani's singular focus on Florida to rescue his flagging campaign also looms as an obstacle.
 Mr. Romney's aides are confident that he can make his reworked message resonate in the South and in the Feb. 5 primaries.
 ''One of the things we've seen happen is the maturation of the economy as an issue,'' said Alex Castellanos, a media consultant for the Romney campaign. ''Giuliani is still the security candidate. Maybe Huckabee is faith. Mitt Romney is the guy who knows what the economy is.''
 Mr. Romney's aides set out early on in his candidacy to burnish image as a business turnaround artist. His advisers concede, however, that the theme became muddled as they sought to hit other notes and as Mr. Romney struggled, in the face of relentless questions about his core convictions, to establish his conservative bona fides.
 Behind the scenes, members of his media team tussled over how much to focus on issues like Mr. Romney's hard-line stance on illegal immigration. 
 It was only when Mr. Romney got to New Hampshire that he homed in on a revamped pitch built around the notion that ''Washington is broken'' and that an outsider was needed to tackle its problems.
 Russ Schriefer, another media strategist for the campaign, linked Mr. Romney's reversal of fortunes in Michigan to the voice he seemed to discover while campaigning in New Hampshire. 
 ''What we did in New Hampshire allowed us to win Michigan,'' Mr. Schriefer said. ''It allowed us to be more focused on his natural strengths, on what I think his real appeal can be, and, you know, sometimes when you lose, you kind of have to strip things away and get down to the core.''
 Unlike the first two contests of the primary season, in which the Romney campaign went after his chief rivals -- Mr. Huckabee in Iowa and Mr. McCain in New Hampshire -- his campaign in Michigan refrained from attacking his opponents in television commercials. It did not want to risk cluttering the message it wanted to get across about Mr. Romney's ability to lead the state out of its economic downturn.
 The more positive approach may continue as Mr. Romney's advisers believe that a broader ethos has taken hold of the electorate, specifically the desire to bring change to Washington, as opposed to differences on specific issues.
 ''Guess what they're doing in Washington,'' Mr. Romney told about 400 supporters Tuesday night. ''They're worrying because they realize, the lobbyists and the politicians realize, that America now understands that Washington is broken. And we're going to do something about it.''
 Mr. Romney's aides believe his message about changing Washington and his economic expertise has promise in South Carolina and in Nevada. ''In Michigan, it's the auto industry,'' said Carl Forti, Mr. Romney's political director. ''In South Carolina, it's the textile industry.''
 The housing crisis, Mr. Forti added, has hit Nevada hard.
 Mr. Romney will campaign in South Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, before heading to Nevada. His campaign said it had not decided where he would take his message after that.
 Mr. Romney had his own idea on Tuesday night: ''Let's take it all the way to the White House.''

HEADLINE: Obama and Clinton Seek a Softer Tone in Democratic Presidential Debate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
A Democratic presidential debate unfolded with an exchange of pleasantries and acts of contrition among rivals on Tuesday as Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama promised to dispel a rancorous feud over race and gender that had threatened to divide the party and alienate voters.
 In a city known for its fierce prizefights, the political tone was purposefully gentle on stage here at the Cashman Center in downtown Las Vegas. For the first time in the yearlong campaign, the field of candidates was whittled to three, with former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina rarely challenging either of his rivals.
 It was a night of ''John'' and ''Barack'' and ''Hillary,'' soft voices, easy jokes and belly laughs. Even the normally pugnacious Tim Russert, one of the moderators, seemed subdued.
 ''We're all family in the Democratic party,'' Mrs. Clinton said, glancing toward her competitors who were seated closely around a table. ''We are so different from the Republicans on all of these issues.'' 
 The low-key tenor of the debate would seem to belie the dynamics of the race: Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama involved in a pitched fight for the nomination and Mr. Edwards struggling to break through. Clearly, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama came in deciding to lower the volume from the overtones of race and gender that had shadowed their contest for the past week and worried many Democrats -- including many of the candidates' advisers -- that the back-and-forth could imperil both candidates.
 At another point, Mr. Obama said he regretted the remarks he made last week during a debate in New Hampshire, when he exclaimed, ''You're likable enough, Hillary.'' Asked about the comments, his expression turned serious and he said, ''Well, I absolutely regret it, because that wasn't how it was intended.''
 In a two-hour session, which also included an opportunity for candidates to question one another, there was far more collegiality than in almost any of the dozens of debates and joint appearances in the past year. The rivals praised one another with phrases like ''Hillary's exactly right'' and, ''What Barack said is what John and I also meant'' -- a sharp break from the invective that had dominated the campaign in recent days.
 When it became time for Mrs. Clinton to pose a question to Mr. Obama, she instead offered a long statement inviting him to join with her in sponsoring legislation to require Mr. Bush to come before Congress to get approval for any agreement he might make with the Iraqi government to continue the American presence in Iraq. 
 ''We can work on this, Hillary,'' Mr. Obama said, flashing a wide, sweet smile.
 The debate, sponsored by MSNBC, came four days before the voters of Nevada take their turn in the Democratic presidential nominating contest. While Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are fighting to win the Nevada caucuses, they also are looking ahead to the South Carolina primary next week and nearly two dozen contests in the next three weeks.
 Many of the states include a large share of black voters -- as much as 50 percent of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina -- and all the candidates distanced themselves from comments about race made by their aides or supporters in recent days. The flurry began when some people interpreted comments by Mrs. Clinton as minimizing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s role in the passage of the 1964 civil rights amendment. 
 ''It is Dr. King's birthday,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''The three of us are here in large measure because his dreams have been realized.''
 For his part, Mr. Obama said that he, ''not only in hindsight, but going forward,'' regretted that members of his staff had prodded reporters to pursue the issue. 
 ''Our supporters, our staff, get overzealous,'' Mr. Obama said. ''They start saying things that I would not say.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton concurred, saying, ''We need to get this campaign where it should be.'' She also said comments by the founder of Black Entertainment Television, Robert Johnson, were inappropriate. 
 She did not say whether she would bar him from playing a role in her campaign after he made an apparent reference to Mr. Obama's drug use as a young man, which Mr. Johnson said was a misinterpretation of his remarks.
 Less than an hour before the forum began, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled the debate could proceed without Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio, who had sought to be included. A state judge had sided with Mr. Kucinich, elevating his hopes that he would be included on stage, but his plans were dashed and the debate proceeded with just the three on stage.
 Throughout much of the two-hour session, the candidates seemed to delight in the fact that most hot-button issues were pushed off the table, in favor of earnest discussions about the economy and energy policy. 
 Late in the debate, the candidates clashed over the Yucca Mountain national repository for nuclear waste in Nevada, a target of great opposition for many voters here. Mrs. Clinton noted that she had ''persistently been against'' the waste dump, but said that Mr. Edwards had voted in support of it and that some of Mr. Obama's supporters were involved in the repository.
 Mr. Edwards said his views had changed because of ''science that has been discovered'' and the disclosure of forged documents pertaining to the project. But then he turned to the issue of nuclear power, saying that he opposed building more nuclear power plants and suggesting that his two rivals were not as firm on the issue.
 Mr. Obama, whose home state of Illinois has a significant nuclear power presence, noted that he had been a critic of the Yucca project. Mrs. Clinton, meanwhile, has said that she would support alternative energy projects like solar and wind power instead of nuclear plants.
 Still, even the flash points among the Democratic candidates were tepid. They did not particularly grill or challenge one another, even when given the opportunity by Brian Williams, who also was moderating the debate.
 Mr. Edwards, for instance, asked Mr. Obama if he would have trouble overhauling the health care system when he had raised money from health care executives. Mr. Obama replied with ease, noting that he did not take money from lobbyists or political action committees and that he was comfortable taking money from industry leaders who accepted his message of ''change.''
 On another hot issue in Nevada, immigration, the candidates said that they supported a comprehensive immigration overhaul that included offering a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Mr. Edwards, in response to a question, also said that immigrants should learn to speak English as part of their acculturation in America.

HEADLINE: An Effort to Stem Losses At Citigroup Produces A Renewed Focus on Risk

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Ben Bernanke, meet Gary Crittenden. While you're easing credit, he is tightening it. 
 The Federal Reserve's open market committee, headed by Mr. Bernanke, is widely expected to cut interest rates by at least half a percentage point when it meets at the end of January. The committee's intent will be to ease credit and help the economy.
 Mr. Crittenden, the chief financial officer of Citigroup, had a different message on Tuesday, as Citi disclosed an $18.1 billion write-down. He told analysts that Citi was raising rates on credit cards and tightening the amount of credit it would extend. Asked by an analyst whether credit card lending was an area where Citi might want to ''pull back or increase pricing,'' he responded, ''All of the above.'' 
 He said the most attention was being paid to credit card holders in five states that accounted for two-thirds of Citi's credit card losses: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois and Michigan. 
 Citi is also reducing the amount of residential mortgage loans it is making. In the fourth quarter, it lent $29.5 billion to American homeowners, down 16.4 percent from the same period in 2006. It was the lowest total for any quarter since the first three months of 2005.
 Citi is not alone. While the tighter credit market has not stopped credit-worthy individuals or companies from obtaining loans, it has made loans more expensive for many of them, and left those with the greatest need for cash far less able to obtain it.
 ''They are parceling out credit with a keen eye on the balance sheet,'' said John Garvey, the head of the financial services advisory group at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ''There is a flight to quality and a renewed focus on risk.''
 That trend has directly countered the Fed's efforts. Compared with a year ago, before the Fed began to lower the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks can borrow -- conventional 30-year mortgages are lower, but so-called jumbo mortgages of more than $417,000 are higher.
 ''Over the second half of last year, the fed funds rate fell by 100 basis points,'' or a full percentage point, said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''But almost any measure saw rising interest rates and tightened credit availability for many borrowers. The Fed needs to drive the fed funds rate down dramatically to get interest rates for the public and corporations to go down rather than up.''
 Citi and its rivals are reacting to a period when credit standards were very loose, and many poor loans were made, leading to the current round of multibillion-dollar write-offs. 
 One measure of that came in a detail of the write-downs Citi announced. At the end of September, it put the value of some mortgage securities it owned at $2.7 billion. It had purchased those securities intending to repackage them as part of collateralized debt obligations and sell securities in the C.D.O.'s to investors. 
 The collapse of the C.D.O. market made such sales impossible, and Citi still owns the securities. But it has decided they are worth about 5 percent of what they had been, and has taken a write-down of $2.6 billion.
 The write-downs taken by Citi, and by some rivals, are based on assumptions about how bad the mortgage and home-price problem will become. If those assumptions turn out to be too pessimistic, then the assets written down Tuesday will turn out to have greater value.
 On the other hand, if the assumptions are too optimistic, more write-downs may come.
 Many of the assumptions were not disclosed, but Mr. Crittenden did say that Citi was assuming that home prices would decline 6.5 percent to 7 percent in 2008, and by a similar amount in 2009. He did not say what Citi was assuming for later years.
 Citi's shares fell $2.12, to $26.94, a 7.3 percent loss that left the price less than half its level of a year ago.
 That is bad news for investors for a reason other than the obvious one. The company plans to raise $14.5 billion by selling convertible preferred stock, with a 7 percent annual coupon. Of that, $2 billion will go to the public and the rest to a group of investors, including the government of Singapore and Sanford I. Weill, Citi's former chief executive.
 The conversion price of that new issue is to be 20 percent over the market price of Citi stock, but Citi refused to say over what period the market price would be calculated. The lower the price, the more dilution will be produced for existing shareholders.
 Citi also reduced its dividend by 41 percent, but the payout remains high compared to the share price.
 At 32 cents a quarter, the current annual yield is 4.75 percent, a quarter-point above the interest rate Citi pays on its ''ultimate savings account.'' A buyer of the stock gets a higher level of income, with better tax treatment and the possibility of capital gains. 
 But the share buyer also faces the possibility of capital losses. Perhaps investors recall what happened in 1991. On Jan. 15 of that year, exactly 17 years before Tuesday's announcement, the dividend of Citicorp, a Citigroup predecessor, was cut 45 percent amid worries over losses from commercial real estate and loans to highly leveraged companies.
 ''I'm embarrassed,'' Citi's chief executive, John Reed, said then, of the dividend reduction. ''I did not want to do it.'' 
 Nine months later, the dividend was eliminated, and the stock fell well below the January price. ''We clearly have picked up more, or at least our fair share of problems,'' Mr. Reed said. The dividend was not restored until 1994.
 Only two months ago, Citigroup arranged for its first big capital infusion of this cycle, with the government of Abu Dhabi investing $7.5 billion. It is guaranteed an 11 percent yield on that security, but only for a few years. Then the security will convert into common at a price that will vary based on Citi's share price at the time. If Citi's stock is at Tuesday's level, Abu Dhabi's $7.5 billion investment will be converted into common stock worth just $6.3 billion.
 If all the bad news is out, and Citi can maintain the new dividend indefinitely, then the current share price will probably look amazingly cheap in a few years. The fact it has fallen so far shows how worried investors are that things can get worse.

HEADLINE: Disease or Not, the Pain Is Very Real

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Drug Approved. Is Disease Real?'' (front page, Jan. 14) does a disservice to your readers, including the millions of patients afflicted by fibromyalgia, a debilitating condition. The fact that Western medicine does not yet understand a condition does not make it any less ''real.'' 
 Millions of people suffer from the physical pain and crippling fatigue associated with fibromyalgia. We are not hypochondriacs, but sick people in search of a cure, and of more compassionate medical care. 
 Would that it were true that fibromyalgia patients ''obsess over aches that other people simply tolerate''; in truth, they suffer from pain other people can scarcely imagine. To imply, as the article does, that doctors who advocate on behalf of these patients are somehow ''in the pocket'' of the pharmaceutical industry is to betray a stunning degree of cynicism, and of callow disregard for the real lives and deep suffering of millions of human beings. 
 Shai Held New York, Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The pain of fibromyalgia is real, even if some doctors don't think it is a disease. Fibromyalgia and the related chronic fatigue are syndromes, not discrete diseases. Because there is no single test to identify them does not make them a fiction in the mind of the sufferer. 
 The pain and discomfort experienced are similar to what ordinary people feel when they have the flu. These are autoimmune disorders, with the exact triggering mechanisms still unknown. There is no cure. Only time and a lower stress lifestyle help. 
 I am a retired farmer who developed chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia through exposure to grain dust and mold spores. My pain level comes and goes based on my stress level and exposure to airborne proteins and smoke. I have a high pain tolerance, and I take no drugs. When the pain comes, I accept it, and when it goes away, I'm relieved. But it is real. 
 Fred Schumacher Mankato, Minn., Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article suggesting that fibromyalgia isn't a disease translates a significant health problem into a polemic. The problem derives from medical materialism. By this I mean that doctors tell patients that nothing's wrong, if no abnormality can be found. 
 With this stance, patients fall between the cracks of classic medicine left on their own or to the burgeoning alternative medicine industry.
 When I took the Hippocratic oath, I didn't pledge to care for only patients with stroke or cancer but instead to do whatever possible to reduce suffering and improve health. Your article will make doctors, relatives and friends of millions with fibromyalgia conclude that their symptoms are just a ''physical response to stress, depression, and economic and social anxiety.'' 
 This is an opinion ignoring published medical literature showing brain abnormalities in fibromyalgia and drugs that clearly improve patient health. 
 What's needed is less talk and more federally financed, peer-reviewed research. 
 Benjamin H. Natelson
 Newark, Jan. 15, 2008
 The writer, a physician, is a professor of neurosciences and director of the Pain and Fatigue Study Center at U.M.D.N.J.-New Jersey Medical School.
 To the Editor:
 As a psychiatrist, I am painfully familiar with the rhetorical wars regarding what does or does not count as ''a disease.'' Historically, the concept of disease arose in order to explain prolonged suffering and incapacity in the absence of an obvious external cause, such as a knife wound. The word itself originally denoted a state of ''dis-ease.'' 
 A number of conditions in medicine, psychiatry and neurology (including many types of headache) create considerable suffering and incapacity, even though ''no biological tests exist to diagnose'' them, and even when ''the condition cannot be linked to any environmental or biological causes.'' 
 Those who are afflicted with such conditions deserve whatever safe forms of treatment are most helpful to them, including medication and psychosocial support. For these individuals, their ''dis-ease'' is all too real. 
 Ronald Pies Lexington, Mass., Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article is indeed a milestone for the fibromyalgia community and the millions of Americans who suffer from this chronic pain disorder. We are glad that The Times is shedding light on this medical condition on its front page. 
 But the article presents outdated opinions and doesn't discuss the research advances of the last decade by institutions like Johns Hopkins University, the University of Michigan, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. Instead, you chose to focus on the opinions of a few medical outsiders who still question the legitimacy of fibromyalgia.
 We at the National Fibromyalgia Association felt hopeful that the misperceptions and days of patient ridicule were behind us, but your article proves that we still have a lot of work to do. Fortunately, we are more than up to the task.
 Lynne Matallana President and Founder, National Fibromyalgia Association Anaheim, Calif., Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 To continue attributing the painful symptoms of fibromyalgia to ''stress, depression, and economic and social anxiety'' in an age that has abandoned similar assumptions about ulcers and other ailments seems like anachronistic scientific thought. This especially when a new pain treatment may hold promise. 
 But minimizing intractable pain, as do some doctors quoted in the article, by chalking it up as an inability to adapt to the ''vicissitudes'' of life, surely reveals less of the fibromyalgia patient's temperament than his doctor's.
 Jane MacPherson New York, Jan. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your article about the new fibromyalgia drug Lyrica may give hope to many women suffering from this debilitating condition. Yet what we need to remember is that medication is not the answer for everyone. I have suffered from fibromyalgia for many years. After several different prescription painkillers, I decided to take control of my situation.
 I changed my eating habits, lost weight and took whole food supplements, including fish oil. I have been symptom-free for several years, with occasional brief relapses. Acupuncture has also been known to help. 
 The sad part is, most doctors will not advise women that there are other, safer ways of handling fibromyalgia because it will be less money in their pockets. Fibromyalgia is most definitely a real condition, but like many others we should try a holistic approach before resorting to medication.

HEADLINE: Urban Schools Aiming Higher Than Diploma

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
At Excel High School, in South Boston, teachers do not just prepare students academically for the SAT; they take them on practice walks to the building where the SAT will be given so they won't get lost on the day of the test. 
 In Chattanooga, Tenn., the schools have abolished their multitrack curriculum, which pointed only a fraction of students toward college. Every student is now on a college track. 
 And in the Washington suburb of Prince George's County, Md., the school district is arranging college tours for students as early as seventh grade, and adding eight core Advanced Placement classes to every high school, including some schools that had none.
 Those efforts, and others across the country, reflect a growing sense of urgency among educators that the primary goal of many large high schools serving low-income and urban populations -- to move students toward graduation -- is no longer enough. Now, educators say, even as they struggle to lift dismal high school graduation rates, they must also prepare the students for college, or some form of post-secondary school training, with the skills to succeed. 
 In affluent suburbs, where college admission is an obsession, some educators worry that high schools, with their rigorous college preparatory curriculums, have become too academically demanding in recent years. 
 By contrast, many urban and low-income districts, which also serve many immigrants, are experimenting with ways to teach more than the basic skills so that their students can not only get to college, but earn college degrees. Some states have begun to strengthen their graduation requirements. 
 ''This is transformational change,'' said Dan Challener, the president of the Public Education Foundation, a Chattanooga group that is working with the area public schools. ''It's about the purpose of high school. It's about reinventing what high schools do.'' 
 What is required, educators say, is nothing less than revolutionizing schools built for another century, when a high school diploma was a ticket to social mobility in a manufacturing economy, and students with only basic skills could make it into the middle class. But the task is daunting, and the outcome uncertain, experts say.
 ''We don't know yet how to get everyone in our society to this level of knowledge and skills,'' said Michele Cahill, a vice president at the Carnegie Corporation, which, along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is financing many of the new efforts. ''We've never done it before.''
 Although federal studies show that most students yearn for a college degree, each year tens of thousands will not even make it through high school. In New York City, for example, roughly half the students complete high school though the new small high schools have shown substantial improvement in graduation rates. 
 Of the 68 percent of high school students nationwide who go to college each year, about a third will need remedial courses, experts say. For various reasons, from financial to a lack of academic preparedness, thousands of low-income students drop out of college each year. 
 Fewer than 18 percent of African-Americans and just 11 percent of Hispanics earn a bachelor's degree, compared with almost a third of whites, ages 25 to 29, experts say. Of families making less than $25,000 a year, 19 percent complete an associate degree or higher, compared with 76 percent of families earning $76,000 per year or more. 
 The innovations range from creating high schools that offer an opportunity to take college courses for credit, to devoting senior English classes to writing college application essays, and holding parties to celebrate students who complete them. New York City has a $10 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation to develop extensive college counseling and connections with higher education institutions at 70 small high schools and three redesigned large ones. 
 Although affluent suburban schools have been increasing academic rigor in recent years, many large urban schools have been organized around the same low academic expectations for nearly three decades, experts say. When these schools opened their doors about a hundred years ago, relatively few teenagers even went to high school, education historians say. Enrollment in high school was not universal until the end of the 1950s.
 By the 1970s, academic standards were being lowered to make it easier to move large numbers students of different abilities toward the diploma that was considered sufficient education for most, the historians say. 
 Today, however, some states are putting in place more rigorous high school exit exams, and students understand that a diploma no longer provides entry to the middle class. Over the past two decades, the percentage of low-income students who say they want a four-year degree or higher has tripled, rising to 66.2 percent in 2002, from 19.4 percent in 1980, according to federal statistics. And parents are stoking their children's hopes. 
 ''Parents are coming home every day and saying, 'I'm working and sacrificing so that you can do better than me,'<0>'' said Melissa Roderick, a co-director of the Consortium on Chicago School Research at the University of Chicago. 
 ''Parents want the same thing parents in the past wanted,'' Professor Roderick said. ''They want their kids to be middle class. The problem is that the economy has changed, so doing better now means going to college. And someone has to help them figure out how to do this because the parents don't know themselves.'' 
 John Deasy, superintendent of public schools in Prince George's County, said that he wants the students in his overwhelmingly low-income and minority district to have the same academic advantages as students in, say, Greenwich, Conn. 
 So the district has added eight Advanced Placement classes to all 23 high schools, including some in schools that had never offered one. The one high school that has drawn students from the upper middle class already had 26 A.P. classes.
 ''For a long time we believed in the 'some kids' agenda,'' Dr. Deasy said. ''Some kids will go to college, some kids will go to the work force, some kids can go to the military. That's garbage. We believe that every kid can learn at a high level and that college is for every child.'' 
 He added, ''If a student chooses not to go to college, that is O.K.'' 
 Many of the new efforts involve building close relationships with local higher education institutions. North Carolina, for example, is creating 70 new ''early college'' high schools, where students can take college classes. 
 A new ritual in Boston schools is College Month, which culminated last fall in ''Represent Your Alma Mater Day,'' when teachers from kindergarten to high school wore their college T-shirts to work.
 At Brighton High in Boston, for the first time this year, John Travers, the head of counseling, and his staff visited every freshman English class to begin mapping out the steps toward college: Maintaining a high grade point average. Taking tough classes. Building a resume. 
 After Mr. Travers's pitch, 14-year-old Katherine Nunez, who juggles her homework with helping her Dominican immigrant parents at their convenience store, said she was determined to make the honor roll. ''My parents talk about it every day -- the economy, money makes the world go round,'' she said. ''If I want to be successful, I have to go to college.'' 
 In 2005, 74.2 percent of the graduating seniors went on to post-secondary education: of those, 56 percent went to four-year colleges, 33 percent to two-year schools and 11 percent to advanced training, Mr. Travers said. The colleges at the top of the list: Bunker Hill Community College, the University of Massachusetts at Boston and Massachusetts Bay Community College. 
 Mr. Travers leads students on trips to colleges many of them pass every day on the ''T'' to high school, but have never visited. 
 ''We all went to Bentley on the bus together,'' said Rashell Wilson, 18, vice president of Brighton's senior class. ''We had a beautiful tour.'' 
 Ms. Wilson and her classmates ride the T over an hour after school to nonprofit programs where they get extra help with tutoring, and with their college applications. They take free SAT prep classes at night. 
 Ms. Wilson is the daughter of Jamaican immigrants. Her mother is a nursing assistant. Her father works in maintenance. 
 ''My parents instilled in me from Day One, 'You're going to college,'<0>'' she said. But her parents, she added, have not been to college and so cannot help her figure out how to get there. 
 So she has enlisted the help of her guidance counselor and teachers, her co-workers at the Boston law firm where she has an internship, and any other college-educated adult she can find. She has spent hours researching college admissions on the College Board Web site. 
 ''I want a whole lot more,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''I want to be financially stable. I don't want to be struggling on $30,000 a year.''

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article last Thursday about efforts in public high schools to improve preparation of students for college or for some form of post-secondary school training described incorrectly the economic makeup of the school district of Prince George's County in Maryland, where such efforts are being made. Nearly half of its students receive free and reduced-price lunches, a measure of income; the district is not ''overwhelmingly low-income.''

HEADLINE: Sundance Could Be A Sellers' Bonanza

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

DATELINE: PARK CITY, Utah 

 BODY:
The Sundance Film Festival, which opens Thursday night with ''In Bruges,'' the playwright Martin McDonagh's film debut, is one of the oddest ecosystems on earth. The festival of independent film transforms this normally quaint little village, one that offers world-class skiing and a lift smack in the middle of town, into a chilly open-air bazaar where you can hear film executives wearing mukluks and goofy hats shout into their cellphones about deal points and marketing commitments. 
 But at this year's festival, which runs until Jan. 27, the dynamics driving the usual mash-up of indie art and commerce are slightly different. With no end in sight to the writers' strike, studio specialty divisions and a slew of relatively new distribution companies will be looking for movies to fill their threatened schedules for later this year and 2009. And that could drive up prices for the undiscovered gem even more from last year's busy -- some would say overheated -- market that left more than a few buyers singed. 
 ''It would be hard for it to get any more excessive,'' said Mark Urman, who leads the theatrical division of ThinkFilm. But that observation comes with a giant caveat: ''The advent of studio specialty divisions has led to dramatic inflation, and now with the private equity you have more people who can afford to lose money,'' he said. ''We always say that cooler heads are going to prevail, and they usually don't.'' 
 It has been a very snowy year here in the Wasatch mountains, and the buzz seems to be piling up in drifts as well. There is a chattering class of publicists, buyers, sellers, cinephiles and yes, journalists, who create something of an echo chamber where buzz, that gauzy coin of the realm at Sundance, is created. 
 This year the ineffably anointed include ''Choke'' (a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, with Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston), ''The Wackness'' (a comedy about a high-school-age marijuana dealer trading drugs for therapy), ''Sunshine Cleaning'' (with Emily Blunt and Amy Adams playing crime-scene cleaners), ''The Great Buck Howard'' (about a law-school dropout who becomes the personal assistant to a mentalist played by John Malkovich), ''Pretty Bird'' (a comedy about inventors who are building a rocket belt, with Paul Giamatti), ''Mysteries of Pittsburgh'' (based on the novel by Michael Chabon) and ''Hamlet II'' (about a high school drama teacher writing a sequel to Hamlet to motivate his students and save his department). 
 The tenor of the festival is different this year, with the movies -- there are over 120 of them -- offering more comedy and optimism than last year's batch, which contained many darkly hued films about the Iraq war. 
 ''As I watched the films, many of them about families, many of those families dysfunctional, I felt that they were not trying to solve the problems of the world, that it was a more personal group of films,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, the longtime director of the Sundance festival.
 With fewer than 20 of the movies having already secured distribution, there will be plenty of deal making. 
 ''My take is that the strike is not going to change the economics disproportionately,'' said Graham Taylor of Endeavor Independent, which is bringing a number of films to the festival, including ''Phoebe in Wonderland,'' about a girl's search for enlightenment from an unconventional drama teacher. ''There is a lot of speculation about the strike, but ultimately I think the distributors are sophisticated, and they are not going to be pushed into paying more than what they can make work.''
 That steadfastness, however, can be tested in the high-mountain adrenaline of Sundance, where the crush of movies and buyers can sometimes result in decisions that backfire. Last year ''Grace Is Gone'' went for an eye-popping $4 million to the Weinstein Company, partly on the strength of its star, John Cusack. But it had a short theatrical run (bringing in less than $37,000 at the box office) and will likely not be a factor in this year's award season. Fox Searchlight paid nearly $4 million for the psychological thriller ''Joshua,'' but the movie made less than $500,000 domestically. 
 According to figures gathered by Variety last year's market produced sales of $53 million for 20 titles, but many of those films have yet to be released, and the 14 that were produced box office grosses of $34 million, creating a bit of a math problem for those who participated in the frenzy. 
 But for specialty divisions of the studios and big independents like the Weinsteins, the downside risk is much less punishing than building movies from the ground up. With indie divisions routinely budgeting anywhere from $10 million to $20 million for so-called ''small movies,'' spending a couple of million bucks at Sundance, a huge outlay in the context of the festival, is relatively small money. Especially in a strike-addled industry.
 And a boy, or a film executive, can always dream, right? Dreams do come true in the wake of Sundance. Last year ''Once'' was bought for a song -- about $150,000 -- and went on to earn $10 million and counting for Fox Searchlight. And Searchlight's ''Little Miss Sunshine'' is the stuff of Sundance myth, having been snapped up for more than $10 million at Sundance in 2006, at the time an almost unthinkable number, and going on to four Academy Award nominations, including two Oscars, and earning over $100 million worldwide.
 ''I think that Sundance is a wonderful place to look for film,'' said Peter Rice, president of Fox Searchlight. No wonder, he also bought ''Waitress,'' another standout from last year that went on to do very respectable business. Sundance remains a gamble, but the nickel slots are a thing of the past. 
 Jonathan Sehring, the president of IFC Entertainment, took a pass on ''Once'' because, although he loved the film, ''we are in the independent film business, and that means that we have to count pennies,'' he said. ''And that becomes more difficult every year. This year is projected to be a seller's market, in part because of the strike and in part because of the competition for films.''
 That is music to the ears of John Sloss, a go-to seller at Sundance and principal of Cinetic Media, a law firm that specializes in marketing independent film.
 ''It appears to me anecdotally that a number of distributors have holes in their release slate,'' Mr. Sloss said. And, he added, a number of big Sundance buys didn't work out last year, which reflects a general glut of cinema, not a distorted market at the festival. ''Everyone knew the fall was going to be a bloodbath, and so it came to pass. It doesn't mean that a great film, and there seem to be a number of them this year, is not going to do well.''
 On the continuum of dread versus anticipation, Mr. Sloss was in the grip of dread a few days before the festival. ''But then I get there, and the adrenaline kicks in, and then it becomes the most fun I have all year. This is why we got into the business.''

HEADLINE: Opposition Protesters Clash With Police in Kenya

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Kennedy Abwao contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya 

 BODY:
Opposition protests resumed in Kenya on Wednesday, and as many people here feared, violence erupted across the country once again.
 The worst clashes were in Kisumu, Kenya's third largest city and an opposition stronghold, where mobs of furious young men hurled stones at police officers, who responded by charging into the crowds and firing their guns.
 One of Kenya's television stations broadcast images of a police officer in Kisumu shooting an unarmed protester who was dancing in the street and making faces at security agents. After the protester fell to the ground, the officer ran up to him and kicked him several times. Witnesses said the protester later died. 
 ''There's been war since the morning,'' said Eric Otieno, a mechanic in Kisumu. ''The police are whipping women, children, everyone. We were just trying to demonstrate peacefully.''
 Eric Kiraithe, a spokesman for the Kenyan police, said the only people wounded by police officers were hooligans destroying property and robbing people. 
 ''What we are seeing are teams of young men trying to commit crimes,'' Mr. Kiraithe said. ''You cannot call this a demonstration.''
 Opposition leaders have vowed to carry on protests for two more days, and it seems that Kenya's security forces, which have deemed all protests illegal, are cracking down harshly. On Wednesday afternoon, police officers in padded suits sealed off downtown Nairobi, the capital, and ordered everyone out, sending wave after wave of bewildered office workers trudging down the roads leading to the suburbs.
 Fourteen of Kenya's leading donors, including the United States, issued a statement this week warning the Kenyan government that they were reviewing foreign aid in light of the crisis. The United States gives the country more than $600 million in aid each year.
 It seems that Kenya has been unable to get back to normal after a flawed election on Dec. 27 ignited unrest and violence that has already claimed more than 600 lives. Mwai Kibaki, the incumbent president, was declared the winner over Raila Odinga, a top opposition leader, but several election observers said the government rigged the tallying of the results to give the president a slim, 11th-hour victory.
 American diplomats in Kenya recently finished their own analysis of the voting results and concluded that the election was so flawed it was impossible to tell who really won. 
 Outraged opposition supporters have attacked members of the president's ethnic group, with many people killed by machete-wielding mobs. Most of the ethnic violence has diminished, though it has left more than 200,000 people displaced.
 On Wednesday, many protesters said that they would continue to wreak havoc until Mr. Kibaki stepped down. Judging by the amount of live ammunition and tear gas that was fired at demonstrators or near them, police officials seem increasingly determined to show that they will not back down. Opposition leaders are not budging either.
 ''Nothing will stop us from mounting these rallies,'' Mr. Odinga said.
 Kenya's economy, which powers trade and industry across a large part of eastern Africa, is taking a beating from all this. Tourists, drawn by wildlife and white-sand beaches, are canceling trips in droves, leaving some of the biggest hotels in the country only 20 percent occupied, which could lead to layoffs.
 On Wednesday morning, protesters fought with the police in the streets of Mombasa, Kenya's biggest port and a main artery to the rest of East Africa. Witnesses said that hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Muslims, tried to block traffic circles in the city center but that police officers in riot gear chased them away with tear gas. 
 Previous unrest in Mombasa seriously disrupted food and fuel supplies, forcing several neighboring countries, like Uganda and Rwanda, to ration gasoline. Many Muslims in Kenya support the opposition because they believe that the Kenyan government, a close American ally, has persecuted members of their religion during counterterrorism operations.
 Many Kenyans are getting tired of the violence and disruptions and the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the country. They had hoped that tensions would now decrease because the opposition had demonstrated that it could influence the government through its numbers in Parliament and did not necessarily need to take its grievances to the streets.
 On Tuesday night, the opposition party, which won more seats in Parliament than the president's party in the December elections, used its muscle to install one of its own members as speaker, which could mean serious gridlock in Kenya's government for the foreseeable future.

HEADLINE: Revising a Name, but Not a Familiar Slogan

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS QUENQUA

 BODY:
MORE than 35 years after its debut, the slogan for the United Negro College Fund, ''A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,'' remains one of the most recognized in American advertising history. 
 The years, however, have not been as kind to the organization's name, which has gradually become a source of alienation to the very people the group aims to serve. And while the fund is not prepared to drop the word ''Negro'' from its name, it plans to try to shift attention away from it. 
 A branding effort being introduced Thursday will seek to play down the full name and instead highlight the nonprofit's initials, U.N.C.F. An updated logo will seek to communicate the changing direction of the group while putting renewed emphasis on the well-known slogan. 
 ''Forty-plus years ago, when I started at Morehouse, I thought of myself as a Negro,'' said Michael L. Lomax, U.N.C.F.'s president and chief executive, referring to the historically black college. ''By the time I graduated in 1968, I was black. And then in the last 15 to 20 years I've become an African-American.''
 The nomenclature issue is a decades-old predicament for U.N.C.F., which has long struggled to keep up with younger generations of African-Americans without abandoning nearly 70 years of hard-won brand equity. 
 ''We want to hold on to our heritage, but we also want to find a way to say who we are that speaks directly and positively to a younger generation,'' Mr. Lomax said. ''I think we've found a happy medium.''
 The U.N.C.F. is following in the footsteps of at least one other major national nonprofit. In 1999, the American Association of Retired Persons formally changed its name to AARP when its mission shifted to representing the interests of all Americans over 50, rather than just those who are retired. 
 Mr. Lomax also cited the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People as a nonprofit that has had to contend with shifting attitudes toward language. Although that group has not formally changed its name, Mr. Lomax said that the full title was used infrequently, even by the N.A.A.C.P. itself, though a spokesman for the group said he was unaware of any formal effort to promote use of the acronym in place of the full name.
 U.N.C.F. finds itself caught up in a similar challenge to both those groups: its name is not only reminiscent of a bygone era, but suggests that it only serves African-Americans, which is no longer true. U.N.C.F., which is based in Fairfax, Va., works on behalf of all minority students, particularly poor ones, who are looking to earn a college degree.
 The centerpiece of the rebranding effort -- which is its first since the motto was written by a copy supervisor at Young & Rubicam in 1972 -- is the logo. The organization's familiar torch, which has been in black and white, will now be in several shades of orange and blue, representing metaphorically the varied ethnicities served by the organization. 
 The torch is accompanied by the initials rather than the group's full name, and the motto is featured prominently below that. The announcement of the redesign is scheduled to take place on Thursday at Spelman College in Atlanta. 
 The U.N.C.F. has made previous, less formal attempts to tweak its name. Other titles, like the College Fund, have been experimented with over the years, but none has ever caught on. 
 ''What we've had over the last decade or so has been very inconsistent use,'' Mr. Lomax said. ''There was a point where sometimes we would say 'U.N.C.F.' and sometimes say 'the College Fund' -- sometimes we were even saying 'College Fund U.N.C.F.'<0>''
 Surveys conducted for the organization suggest that the ''A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste'' motto enjoys ''exceptionally strong'' recognition by the public, but that only 56 percent of people make the connection between the slogan and U.N.C.F. Mr. Lomax hopes the new campaign will tie everything together in the mind of the public. 
 ''We think the bold contemporary articulation of what we are is summed up in 'U.N.C.F.,'<0>''he said. ''We're short-handing a little bit, but also trying to be bolder, a little less wordy.''
 The redesign is the work of Landor Associates, the branding unit of U.N.C.F.'s longtime ad agency Young & Rubicam, which is a part of the WPP Group. Hayes Roth, the chief marketing officer at Landor, gave credit to Mr. Lomax, who took the top job at U.N.C.F. in 2004, with initiating the rebranding. 
 ''One of his key issues was appealing to a younger audience,'' Mr. Roth said. ''They are fortunate in that they have an iconic brand line that really supersedes the visual aspects of the brand. That really is unusual, and is something we tried to leverage in the new branding.''
 The shift by U.N.C.F. to the new name and logo will not be instantaneous, however, Mr. Roth said. ''This will eventually impact everything they do from a written standpoint,'' including the group's Web site. ''But it's always a challenge to do everything at once,'' Mr. Roth said. ''It's expensive and complicated, especially for a nonprofit.''
 Founded in 1944, the U.N.C.F. is the country's largest minority scholarship program. It provides operating funds to 39 historically black colleges and universities, administers 300 scholarships and internships, and supports minority students nationwide. Last year it collected $195 million from more than 300,000 donors. Mr. Lomax said he hoped to equal that amount this year despite the softening economy.

PERSON: Milton Wolff 

HEADLINE: Milton Wolff, 92, Dies; Anti-Franco Leader

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Milton Wolff, the last commander of the American volunteers who fought against Franco in the Spanish Civil War and the longtime commander of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, died Monday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 92.
 The cause was congestive heart failure, said Peter N. Carroll, chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives.
 At first a young Communist rabble-rouser on soapboxes in New York City, Mr. Wolff was wielding a machine gun in Spain by the time he was 21. By 22, he was the ninth commander of what is commonly called the Lincoln Brigade; four of his predecessors had been killed, four wounded; none now survive, the archives confirm. 
 Mr. Wolff found himself holding together the remnants of North American volunteers on a counteroffensive that moved across the Ebro River to the violent Hill 666 in the Sierra Pandols. It was a last gasp by foreign troops supporting the elected leftist government of Spain against the revolt led by Gen. Francisco Franco. The Americans soon left Spain; Madrid fell in March 1939, and the war was over.
 While Mr. Wolff was in Spain, he became a friend of Ernest Hemingway, who served him his first glass of Scotch; Hemingway was in Spain as a reporter and wrote fiction about the conflict as well. Later, in a pamphlet issued when sculptures of the fighters were unveiled, he called Mr. Wolff ''as brave and as good a soldier as any that commanded battalions at Gettysburg.''
 After the exhausted volunteers arrived in New York aboard the ocean liner Paris on Dec. 15, 1938, it was Mr. Wolff who laid a wreath outside the railing of Madison Square Park, kept out of the park for want of a permit. 
 Mr. Wolff never stopped defying authority. He helped lead the fight against United States support of Franco's government and battled fiercely for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. He even offered the services of the aging veterans of the Lincoln Brigade to the North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Minh, who declined them.
 Mr. Wolff was born in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn on Oct. 7, 1915. He dropped out of high school and joined the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal program for unemployed youths. He was dropped when he protested what he considered the poor treatment of an injured friend, Mr. Carroll said.
 He found a job in the garment district and joined the Young Communist League. When a leader called for volunteers to go to Spain, Mr. Wolff raised his hand. He considered himself a pacifist and planned to serve as a medic, but switched to a machine-gun company when his Washington battalion went into action at Brunete in July 1937.
 The American volunteers were not actually members of a Lincoln Brigade, though that famous term was commonly used, even among veterans. Some, like Mr. Wolff, joined the Washington Battalion, others, the Lincoln Battalion. These battalions, and two others from other countries, made up the 15th International Brigade.
 After the Washington Battalion suffered crushing casualties, it was merged into the Lincoln Battalion. More than 900 of the 3,000 American volunteers in these battalions were killed. It is believed that fewer than 40 are still living.
 Mr. Wolff was fighting on the Aragon front in March 1938 and became commander when an artillery hit destroyed the battalion headquarters and killed several ranking officers. Then a captain, he led soldiers through perilous retreats and wandered behind enemy lines until they managed to swim across the Ebro.
 One day, Robert Capa, the legendary photographer, snapped Mr. Wolff standing next to Hemingway. The photo appeared on the cover of The Forward, and for the first time his mother knew her son was in combat. He had told her he was working in a factory to free a Spanish loyalist for hazardous duty.
 Mr. Wolff always said he first met Hemingway after stealing his mistress, something he told Salon in 1999 that Hemingway did not mind. Hemingway minded more when he found out that Mr. Wolff had no idea who he was. For his part, Mr. Wolff resented Hemingway's description of villagers loyal to the Republic as having murdered fascists in ''For Whom the Bell Tolls.''
 Mr. Wolff is survived by his daughter, Susan Wallis of Vermont; his son, Peter, of Connecticut; four grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.
 Mr. Wolff said he was turned down for combat duty in World War II because of concerns about his leftist politics. He later fought successfully against the ''subversive'' label pinned on the Lincoln veterans for decades. He personally delivered 20 ambulances to the Nicaraguan government when the Reagan administration was supporting rebels against it.
 One of his battles after the civil war was leading his veterans to urge the Brooklyn Dodgers to integrate. ''The guys were all Dodgers fans,'' he said. ''It was a way to carry on the struggle.''

HEADLINE: Ireland Uses Incentives To Help Start-Ups Flourish

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Ireland is now alive with enthusiasm for entrepreneurs, who seemingly rank just below rock stars in popularity. 
 For evidence, consider the Ernst & Young accounting firm's award for Irish Entrepreneur of the Year. The award show was prime-time television fare in October. (The winner, Liam Casey, runs a business, now based in China, that arranges for products to be manufactured and shipped from China to customers in Europe and the United States.) 
 Then there are the government-sponsored studies proclaiming that Ireland ranks third in the European Union in early-stage entrepreneurial activity. And Enterprise Ireland, an agency of the Irish government that gives fledgling small companies a helping hand, has even leased space in an office building in Midtown Manhattan to serve as an incubator for businesses hoping to expand into the American market.
 The relatively new emphasis on entrepreneurs in Ireland is the culmination of nearly four decades of government policies that have lifted the economy from centuries of poverty to modern prosperity. 
 The change began when Ireland entered the European Union in 1973. In subsequent years, the government rewrote its tax policies to attract foreign investment by American corporations, made all education free through the university level and changed tax rates and used direct equity investment to encourage Irish people to set up their own businesses. 
 ''The change came in the 1990s,'' said James Murphy, founder and managing director of Lifes2Good, a marketer of drugstore products for muscle aches, hair loss and other maladies. ''Taxes and interest rates came down, and all of a sudden we believed in ourselves.'' 
 The new environment also encouraged Ray Nolan, who founded Raven Computing in 1989 to provide software for lawyers to keep track of billable hours. He sold that company and founded another that created software for companies to manage billing and receipts. And in 1999, he founded Web Reservations International to provide booking and property management for hostels that cater to backpackers and economy travelers. 
 ''Hostel owners needed to keep track of people sharing rooms, and bookings for Americans coming to Dublin for three nights,'' said Feargal Mooney, chief operating officer of Web Reservations. ''Hostel accommodations go for 10 to 20 euro a night,'' he said, or $15 to $30 at today's exchange rates, ''so booking reservations in them wasn't profitable for the big travel companies.'' 
 As the business grew -- its 100 employees and banks of computers now handle reservations for some 50,000 hostels in 166 countries -- Web Reservations was offered an equity investment by Enterprise Ireland. ''But we said this is our baby, we didn't want to give up equity,'' Mr. Mooney said.
 But the company, which is expanding in the United States and in China, has taken advantage of the agency's help to open operations in Shanghai and New York. ''They've helped us with introductions to government officials in China, and we're in the office space on Park Avenue, expanding our systems in the States,'' Mr. Mooney said.
 Government help for Irish entrepreneurs grew out of an overall economic policy devised in 1987 that reduced personal taxes, said Kevin Sherry, a director of Enterprise Ireland who specializes in start-up companies. 
 Income tax rates in Ireland today are 20 percent on the first $50,000 of income and 41 percent on income above that. But there are value-added taxes of 21 percent levied on all goods and transactions, with the exception of health and medical services, children's clothing and food. 
 The tax on corporate profits, though, is 12.5 percent, which is an incentive to own a business. And government helps out. ''We have helped over 300 people or groups in the last dozen years or so,'' Mr. Sherry said. 
 Enterprise Ireland has also put up initial capital for venture investment funds and supports research and development. ''We must support new approaches, nanotechnology, biotechnology and other sciences,'' Mr. Sherry said, ''because we cannot succeed in the future using what got us here in the past.'' 
 Colm O'Gorman, who teaches entrepreneurship in master of business administration courses at Dublin City University, said the government agency is at the heart of several trends. Enterprise Ireland ''supports research and development at Irish companies and universities,'' Professor O'Gorman said, ''and it is encouraging more women to become entrepreneurs, as the role of women has changed in Irish life.'' 
 One reason for many changes in Ireland is its membership in the European Union, which has brought new perspectives and regulations from its governing councils in Brussels. 
 Elaine Doorly, for example, founded Radiation Safety Ireland three years ago to advise industry on effects of radiation in building materials, scanners and other sources, an evolving field that is driven by regulation from Brussels. 
 Ms. Doorly runs her consulting company part time while also working as the health officer specializing in radiological protection for the University of Dublin-Trinity College, the institution that is a leading site of Irish scientific research. She has held that post for 10 years. 
 ''I run training courses and consult with companies that are coping with the huge variety of radiation in ordinary objects, including the many screening systems that have been put in place since 9/11,'' said Ms. Doorly, who has a doctorate in physics from Trinity. ''It's a growth field but a niche industry.'' 
 Mr. Murphy, 46, of Lifes2Good is one of the entrepreneurs who has expanded his business beyond Ireland's borders. He qualified as a chartered accountant in the 1980s and worked in several countries in Europe before returning to Ireland in 1991 looking to own a business. 
 He served as financial officer for the inventor of a device that used electrical current to ease muscle pain and learned how to market such treatments by making infomercials for television stations in Europe. 
 Mr. Murphy founded Lifes2Good in 1997. Using infomercials to promote micro-current pain relief and health and beauty aids, the business spread throughout Britain and the Continent and grew to 40 employees and $30 million in annual revenue. Now he is trying to expand in the United States. 
 ''When you come to the U.S., you have to be prepared to lose a couple of hundred grand for six months without panicking,'' Mr. Murphy said. His American operation also works out of Enterprise Ireland on Park Avenue. 
 Mr. Sherry of Enterprise Ireland said the passion behind the efforts to support entrepreneurs comes from a desire to make Ireland a better place. ''We're old enough to remember when times weren't good. We don't want to go back there.''

HEADLINE: Fed's Survey Provides More Indications of Economic Slippage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Government reports released on Wednesday provided additional evidence that the economy was slowing amid credit problems and the housing downturn and raised expectations that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates when it meets this month.
 Businesses surveyed by the Fed said that economic activity slowed at the end of 2007, weighed down by a decline in holiday sales and tighter conditions in the housing market. Mortgage lending rates dropped, and home values continued to fall. 
 Inflation rose only slightly in the period, the Labor Department said in a separate report. While the Consumer Price Index recorded one of its biggest yearly gains in decades, much of the increase came from record high energy prices, and economists expect price pressures to taper off. 
 The reports help clear the way for the Fed to cut rates by at least half a point, analysts said. While a rate cut can stimulate economic activity, it can also lead to higher prices, making central bankers wary of any upticks in inflation. 
 Wednesday's report on the Consumer Price Index ''throws cold water on the argument that inflation is about to catapult to a higher, more destructive, level,'' wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group.
 Fed policy makers now appear more concerned about a slowdown in 2008. The business survey, known as the beige book, reinforced signs that the economy was becoming sluggish.
 ''Investors believe the Fed will continue to focus on cutting rates and keeping us out of recession, because inflation hasn't gotten out of hand,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for Standard & Poor's. 
 Investors who bet on the Fed's actions expect the bank to cut rates by a half-point -- or even more -- when the board meets Jan. 29 and 30.
 Stock markets appeared ambivalent to Wednesday's data, with the three major indexes swinging from red to black throughout the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 0.56 percent, and the Dow Jones industrials gave up 0.3 percent. Technology stocks fared worse, sending the Nasdaq composite index to a 1 percent loss.
 The Consumer Price Index rose 0.3 percent in December, more than analysts had expected. But inflation slowed from its 0.8 percent rise in November, quelling concerns among some economists.
 Over all, inflation rose 4.1 percent in 2007, one of the highest rates in decades, as prices were pushed up by significant increases in the cost of oil and food. But the core rate, which excludes the volatile costs of food and energy and offers a better sense of inflation in the broader economy, rose just 0.2 percent in December and 2.4 percent for the year, slightly above comfortable levels but still relatively contained. 
 The inflation report also suggested that the purchasing power of American workers was being steadily eroded. The cost of gasoline rose nearly 30 percent in 2007, and medical care costs also soared. Commodities and food prices increased about 5 percent for the year.
 Businesses surveyed by the Fed said that strong export sales and demand from tourists helped buoy economic activity from mid-November through the end of the year. Overall economic activity ''increased modestly.''
 The survey also confirmed previous reports that wage growth was flat in the period and that the labor market was weakening, especially in the construction and housing-related industries. 
 Food and energy prices rose, and production costs continued to go up, the survey said. In a separate report on Wednesday, the Fed reported that industrial production was unchanged in December and up 1.5 percent in 2007 as a whole. Manufacturing activity was flat for the month, and capacity utilization fell to 81.4 percent from 81.6 percent.
 ''An increasingly constrained consumer, deepening woes for the housing sector, and no desire to build inventories will all weigh on manufacturing output, which we expect to remain weak for some time,'' wrote Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, a New York research firm.

HEADLINE: European Antitrust Regulators Raid Large Drug Makers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
Antitrust regulators on Wednesday raided big European drug makers as part of an investigation into whether patents and lawsuit settlements are being manipulated to keep generic products off the market. 
 Inspectors from the European Commission seized information about intellectual property rights, litigation and settlements in patent disputes in a series of surprise visits to pharmaceutical companies. The commission would not identify the companies involved, but Glaxo, AstraZeneca, Wyeth, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Sanofi-Aventis and Pfizer said later that they had been contacted.
 In a statement the commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, said the investigation was in response to indications that competition in the European market ''may not be working well.''
 ''Fewer new pharmaceuticals are being brought to the market, and the entry of generic pharmaceuticals sometimes seems to be delayed,'' the statement said. ''If innovative products are not being produced, and cheaper generic alternatives to existing products are in some cases being delayed, then we need to find out why and, if necessary, take action.''
 The inquiry will consider whether illegal barriers have been created by the use of patent rights, vexatious litigation o r other means. 
 The European competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, told a news conference that the number of new drugs reaching the market had dropped to an average of 28 a year in the 2000-4 period from 40 a year in 1995-99.
 A Sanofi-Aventis spokesman, Geoffroy Bessaud, said the company had received a visit at its Paris headquarters and was cooperating with the investigation.
 The commission has already conducted inquiries into financial services and the energy market, the latter resulting in legal action against some utilities.
 David W. Hull, head of the European competition group at the law firm of Covington & Burling, said the regulators' announcement represented a shift in emphasis to generic drugs.
 ''The focus on generics is not surprising,'' Mr. Hull said, ''as the entry of generics onto the market has been a major issue for the U.S. antitrust agencies in recent years, and it was only a matter of time before it arrived in Europe.''
 Generic drugs have been used far less widely in countries like France than in the United States. 
 Some companies that produce brand pharmaceuticals for European use have fought to slow the introduction of generic drugs that could lower government health care costs.
 That fight is part of a larger struggle. Drug companies have long been at odds with governments of countries with universal health systems, where the prices of patented medications are much lower than in more profitable markets like the United States. The companies say, for example, that European governments enforce restrictions on direct advertising to consumers and that public agencies often tell doctors and patients which drugs will be paid for by the state.
 They respond to complaints, particularly those involving patent protection, by saying that patient safety is their first concern. Patenting new versions of older drugs improves care and assures patients that the medication is genuine, the companies say.
 Some fierce disputes in Europe focus on next-generation medications made from biological materials. In those cases, drug companies argue that their manufacture is so complex that copying them is nearly impossible.
 Generic-drug producers agree that new technologies require new rules on copying, but they accuse patent holders of seeking to impose additional testing to delay the output of generics and protect profit.

HEADLINE: After Bumpy Ride, Shares Lose Ground

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street staggered through another volatile session on Wednesday, closing mostly lower after a Federal Reserve report showed some economic growth at the end of 2007 and after Intel's disappointing profit report.
 Shares gave up a modest rally in the final 20 minutes of trading, continuing the fluctuations that marked the session as investors pored over profit reports and economic news that supported varying views about the soundness of the economy.
 Stocks initially gained after the Fed report -- the beige book survey of regional economies -- suggested economic activity had increased modestly from mid-November through December, though at a slower pace than in a previous survey. The report seemed to quell some concerns about prospects for the economy that followed Intel's disappointing earnings report on Tuesday. 
 The Fed's report heartened bullish investors who pointed to better-than-expected results from JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Company. The banks' reports appeared to remind Wall Street that the pain of souring loans was not evenly felt. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 34.95 points, or 0.28 percent, to 12,466.16.
 Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.75 points, or 0.56 percent, to 1,373.20, and the Nasdaq composite index finished down 23.00, or 0.95 percent, at 2,394.59.
 Investors remained anxious Wednesday, particularly after a drop Tuesday that took the Dow down nearly 280 points. Intel was by far the biggest decliner among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow and also weighed on the tech-dominated Nasdaq. The chip maker fell $2.81, or 12.4 percent, to $19.88.
 Bond prices fell to 104 6/32 from 104 22/32. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.73 percent from 3.68 percent late Tuesday. 
 Crude oil prices settled down $1.06 at $90.84 a barrel in New York trading after a report that domestic oil supplies had risen unexpectedly last week. Oil fell below $90 Wednesday for the first time since Dec. 19.
 After a letter from the Food and Drug Administration was posted Tuesday, shares in the medical technology company Stryker fell $1.36, or 1.91 percent, to $16.75. The F.D.A. note warns of problems at Stryker's major manufacturing plant in Mahwah, N.J., and reports a sterility problem that has halted sales of the Trident artificial hip. 
 The technology sector did see some cheer Wednesday, because of Oracle's deal to buy BEA Systems for about $8.5 billion. BEA jumped $2.88, to $18.46 a share, after word of its deal. Oracle rose 61 cents, to $21.92.
 Other economic news added to Wall Street's concerns. The Labor Department said inflation jumped in 2007 by the highest amount in 17 years, amid a spike in energy and food costs. Excluding those areas, core inflation remained relatively stable. The Fed is often guided by the core rate.
 Consumer prices in December rose 0.3 percent, while core inflation showed a 0.2 percent advance. Analysts had expected both figures to rise 0.2 percent, according to Thomson IFR.
 JPMorgan, warning of difficult conditions this year and problems in home equity loans, offered a first-quarter earnings report that revealed relatively light exposure to the faltering subprime loans as it booked a write-down of $1.3 billion, which was smaller than the huge losses of peers like Citigroup. JPMorgan rose $2.26, to $41.43.

HEADLINE: Two Views in the White House on an Economic Fix

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Steven R. Weisman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Bush weighs a stimulus package to jump-start the sagging economy, a debate has broken out inside the White House over how hard to push Congress to make Mr. Bush's tax cuts permanent -- a priority for the president, but one that Democrats say would kill the plan before it is even considered.
 On one side, according to people familiar with the deliberations, is a powerful group of pragmatists, including Henry M. Paulson Jr., the treasury secretary; Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff; and Ed Gillespie, counselor to Mr. Bush. They argue that the need for a stimulus is urgent, but have expressed concern that the administration may have to scale back its ambitions for permanent tax cuts to get a package through Congress. 
 On the other side, these people say, are staunch economic conservatives like Keith B. Hennessey, the new director of Mr. Bush's National Economic Council. They have reservations about the need for an economic rescue package and maintain that if the White House proposes one, it should use the plan as leverage to press lawmakers into making the tax cuts permanent.
 Mr. Bush, who has been traveling in the Middle East, has not yet received any formal recommendations from his economics team. But he is expected to make a stimulus package the centerpiece of his State of the Union address. He is due back in the Oval Office on Thursday, and is planning a conference call with Congressional leaders to solicit their views.
 The president's tax cuts, which lowered rates for individuals and investors, are set to expire at the end of 2010. Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that he will devote his last year in office to making them permanent, a vow he reiterated in a speech in Chicago before leaving for the Middle East.
 ''In a time of economic uncertainty,'' the president said, ''we ought to be sending a clear signal that taxes will remain low.''
 Vice President Dick Cheney has also been a strong supporter of the tax cuts, although it is not clear what role he is playing in the current debate.
 On Wednesday, the White House dismissed any suggestion that some of the president's top advisers believed they might have to cede their ground. Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said such reports were ''flat-out wrong,'' though he declined to offer specifics.
 The debate casts a fresh spotlight on the White House economic team, a little-known collection of forecasters, strategists and business executives who have struggled for influence inside an administration that has long been preoccupied with terrorism and the war in Iraq. 
 It is a team that has often been in flux. Mr. Bush is on his third treasury secretary, Mr. Paulson, who was wooed away from his job as chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs by Mr. Bolten, himself a former executive there. (The first one, Paul H. O'Neill, cooperated in a tell-all book after he left, and the second, John W. Snow, was unceremoniously pushed out the door.)
 Mr. Bush has had four National Economic Council directors; Mr. Hennessey replaced Allan B. Hubbard, an Indianapolis businessman who has known Mr. Bush since their days at Harvard Business School together. And there have been five chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers, a group now headed by Edward P. Lazear, who is on leave from his job as a Stanford University business professor. 
 In an interview Tuesday, Mr. Lazear said the president was ''very firm in terms of his principles that the tax cuts need to be made permanent.'' And while Mr. Lazear declined to discuss the administration's strategy -- his job is that of economic forecaster, not political strategist, he said -- he also made clear that the White House understood the political realities it faces. ''We're not doing this just to play games here,'' he said. ''So we obviously want to propose something that we feel would do the American economy some good, and that means it has to be enacted.''
 Within the current economic team, Mr. Paulson clearly wields the most clout. With his Wall Street credentials, he has Mr. Bush's ear, as well as that of some leading Congressional Democrats, including Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. Kenneth M. Duberstein, a Republican strategist who is close to Mr. Paulson, calls him ''first among equals.''
 Mr. Schumer said that he has told Mr. Paulson it would ''cause real problems'' for the White House to insist that a stimulus package be linked to permanent tax cuts. One Republican close to the White House said he believed Mr. Paulson and the other pragmatists would ultimately persuade the administration that it would be worth making some concessions to get a rescue package through Congress.
 ''They're not going to start off signaling that they're going to be flexible, but Paulson and Bolten and Gillespie know that this is going to be a negotiation,'' said this Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''Their view is a stimulus is essential and their No. 1 priority, and therefore everything else has to be negotiable to achieve the priority. It's a huge shift.''
 Mr. Paulson came into the administration viewed as someone who could bridge the divide with Democrats, yet he has had some difficulty doing so. His effort to forge a bipartisan agreement to revamp Social Security never got off the ground, although he was able to nudge the administration toward a more liberal policy of helping homeowners in the subprime mortgage crisis.
 As a whole, the economics team has also drawn criticism for overly optimistic economic predictions. At the end of November, on the same day that Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, hinted strongly that the Fed would lower interest rates to stave off a downturn in the economy, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Lazear offered a rosier economic forecast for 2008.
 Mr. Lazear predicted ''solid growth,'' and Mr. Paulson said the economy remained ''broadly healthy,'' while adding, ''I expect the expansion to continue.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Lazear defended those predictions, saying they were in keeping with what most economists believed at the time. But he also said that the economic team had known since August, when the housing crisis grew especially acute, that it might have to consider an economic rescue package. 
 ''We still have not heard from the president as to what he wants to do on this,'' Mr. Lazear said Tuesday. ''He's been focused on the Middle East.''

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing Around the Olive Branch

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It is a testament to the decline in party relations in the House that a simple private meeting Wednesday between Democratic and Republican leaders to discuss an economic stimulus plan was treated as remarkable.
 In 2007, the first year of Democratic rule and Republican exile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and the minority leader, Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, barely spoke. The senior party leaders and their respective staffs circled one another like the Sharks and the Jets, displaying a similar spirit of trust, cooperation and understanding.
 But Ms. Pelosi said Wednesday that she hoped the glimmerings of bipartisanship seen on the economy could serve as a model and lead to increased dialogue between the two parties, easing some of the bitterness from last year and the partisan rancor that has pervaded the House from the days leading up to the Republican takeover in 1994. 
 ''I don't want my legacy to be a continuation of that attitude,'' said Ms. Pelosi, the first woman to hold the speaker's job. ''I had to get a certain amount of work done. I did. Now we need to go on to the next step, which is to expand the conversation.''
 After a dozen years in the minority, Democrats came to power a year ago, promising a new tone and pledging that they would not treat minority Republicans like they had been treated: shut out of negotiations, prevented from offering amendments and just generally overrun by Republicans trying to solidify their grip on Congress.
 But from the Republican perspective, things got off to a bad start when Democrats rammed through legislation on the minimum wage, energy, combating terrorism and other party priorities without allowing Republicans opportunities to push their alternatives. Angry Republicans fought back, using procedural moves, politically charged amendments and efforts to embarrass the speaker through tactics like highlighting her request for a larger airplane than her predecessor used for public trips.
 Democrats won bipartisan approval of many of their chief issues, but the enmity simmered through the year, fueled by repeated clashes over the Iraq war. It subsided only slightly as Congress wrapped up last month and finished off spending bills, energy legislation and war financing.
 Ms. Pelosi acknowledged that she occasionally short-circuited the process but said it was necessary to achieve some of her first-year goals. And she said she understood what Republicans were trying to accomplish in the minority, having spent considerable time there herself. But she said she hoped the climate could be improved. ''Now that everybody has established their parameters, I think that we will be able to move forward with confidence,'' she said. ''I have respect for them. I want everything we do here to have legitimacy, to have a broader base of support, not just a simple majority. So I welcome the opportunity to increase not only the bipartisanship, but the communication.''
 Ms. Pelosi dismissed the notion that her attitude was an outgrowth of public calls for conciliation that are being sounded with some success in the presidential primary campaign. But others believe those are echoing in the corridors of a nervous Congress. 
 ''There's a general pervasive feeling that Washington is broken,'' said Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, chairman of the House Republican Conference. ''And I think it is incumbent upon us to talk about how we intend to fix Washington, and what have we learned from our time in the majority, and what have we learned from our time in the minority.''
 Still, some veteran lawmakers are dubious that the tensions between the two parties can be eased, particularly in an even-numbered year. ''Get serious,'' said Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho. ''It is a presidential election year.''
 Yet the tone in Congress, at least in the first 48 hours of the session, is a bit different from 2007. Members of both parties are moving cautiously, feeling one another out and not wanting to be the first to drop a political bomb. If voters are looking for change, the mood suggests, it is probably best to show you are getting the message now rather than waiting to get it in November.
 ''Bipartisanship is spreading out all over,'' declared Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat, as he prepared for the economic meeting with Mr. Boehner and Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri.
 The Republican leadership was approaching the Democratic overture gingerly but certainly did not want to be seen as refusing any olive branch. Or taking it and breaking it in two. 
 ''I am hopeful we can work together,'' Mr. Boehner said.
 Mr. Blunt, the No. 2 Republican, said maybe things could be better, at least part of the time.
 ''This is a political year,'' he said. ''So my guess is we'll have a conciliatory start and a conciliatory finish and the middle won't be all that good.''
 Ms. Pelosi said she envisioned more regular meetings with her Republican counterparts, though not on a fixed schedule. And she said she believed the top lawmakers had at least a foundation of cordial relationships to build on.
 But no one expects the two sides to suddenly drop their gloves and embrace. A serious Congressional election is looming, and both parties will soon be trying to coalesce around a presidential nominee, eager to draw distinctions between the two competing ideologies.
 And, as Ms. Pelosi noted, Congressional political conflict is daily and intimate. But she said it was her hope that House members of both the Republican and Democratic persuasion could figure out a way to clash over ideas while finding at least a smidgen of common ground.
 ''You can do both,'' she said. ''This body was created to be a marketplace place of ideas. The idea was you would come and debate different points of view. It is not a bad thing to say, 'We disagree.'<0>''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Offers Broad Plan to Help Upstate Economy

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer offered details on Wednesday of his proposal to infuse $1 billion in state funds into upstate cities, farms and parks as a way of revitalizing the regional economy, rescuing it from what he called an economic storm. 
 He began New York's first-ever State of Upstate address with a story about a snowstorm that paralyzed Oswego County last year and told how he met plow operators, firefighters and ordinary New Yorkers who worked to dig out their neighbors, feed the hungry and help those in distress. 
 When he offered praise, he said they replied: ''That's the way it always is. When there's a storm, everyone pitches in to help.''
 ''The storm we face today is not natural,'' Mr. Spitzer said in his speech, delivered at Buffalo State College. ''It is economic. But if we put that same strength, that same resiliency and that same community-mindedness to work, if we summon the will to work together, we can overcome this storm.''
 The governor's $1 billion plan includes $350 million to promote business development by preparing development-ready sites and industrial parks, financing technology parks and retooling the brownfield cleanup program, which seeks to revitalize contaminated sites.
 The governor proposed that $10 million be used to create a venture capital fund that would provide seed money for 10 to 15 small upstate companies with the potential to expand into major employers. His plan also calls for investing $50 million in upstate agriculture businesses to improve access to farmers' markets, creating or expanding food processing centers and developing alternative fuels. 
 He said he would establish a new state post, director of agricultural development, to oversee the fund. Another $50 million would go to upstate cities to help fight crime and poverty.
 Even while facing political problems elsewhere, Mr. Spitzer has made the revitalization of upstate New York a priority of his administration. The region is battling job losses, the continued loss of young people who cannot find work, and violence in some cities.
 Mr. Spitzer's aides have suggested that the governor's interest in the area is driven by policy and data, rather than politics. The governor likens his upstate revitalization proposal to the massive infusion of aid to New York City in the early 1970s.
 In the plan, which needs legislative approval, Mr. Spitzer proposed taking advantage of the weak American dollar to finance a new international marketing office to entice Canadians to do business in New York. He also called for spending $5.5 million to restore Niagara Falls State Park; some of that money, he said, would be used to rebuild and reopen the Goat Island Bridge.
 Mr. Spitzer said he would create individual development plans for each upstate city, working with mayors, business communities and colleges and universities to jump-start economic growth.
 He proposed investing $100 million to build or rehabilitate 10,000 homes and apartments and sending 200 state troopers to help inner cities fight violent crime. Mr. Spitzer also proposed building crime analysis centers equipped with high-tech tools in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany.
 Mayor Byron W. Brown of Buffalo applauded Mr. Spitzer's efforts, especially the anticrime initiatives. ''It was a tremendous address,'' Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said.
 But others, especially Republicans, questioned the approach. 
 ''So far, it doesn't add up,'' said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, a conservative group. ''It suggests that upstate's problems can be solved simply by dumping state dollars on it.''
 After the speech, Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno issued a statement in which he offered tepid praise. ''Governor Spitzer's State of Upstate address shows that he recognizes the importance of strengthening the upstate economy,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''However, upstate New Yorkers are hoping that the governor follows up his speech with real action.''
 The Monroe County executive, Maggie Brooks, a Republican, called Mr. Spitzer's proposals for upstate ''exciting'' and aggressive, but she wondered if he was spreading his agenda too thin.
 ''I congratulate the governor for putting together an agenda that is specific to upstate, but I do think you can try to solve all the problems at once and fail, as opposed to targeting one or two specific initiatives and succeeding,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''I worry about the size of the agenda.''

HEADLINE: The Anti-Charm Offensive

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
 For a while this week, the Democratic presidential race seemed to have morphed into one of those movies like ''Singin' in the Rain.'' Two guys, a gal and an adventure. What a glorious feeling; they're happy again.
 ''It's great that we have this young man from the South who grew up in a mill town, an African-American who has so much to give our country, and we have a woman. This is good news for our country,'' Hillary Clinton told a rally of her supporters after the good-vibrations Nevada debate. 
 (John Edwards always gets the short end of these formulations -- the Donald O'Connor role. ''Son of a millworker'' does not offer quite the same scope as first woman or first African-American. Plus, the young man is 54.)
 It didn't last. By yesterday Barack Obama was telling his supporters in Henderson, Nev., that the Clintonites were misrepresenting his position with a flier that claimed his Social Security plan was ''a trillion-dollar tax hike for hard-working families.'' Still, the amity was a nice interlude.
 Clinton and Obama both seemed a little chastened, or frightened, by the raw racial feelings they'd inadvertently stirred up in the near-hysteria that surrounded the New Hampshire primary. The debate, a thoughtful and polite discussion of the issues, didn't make for political drama, but it did remind you that these three can be rather likable people.
 But not too likable. The election is ''not going to be an issue of, you know, who's got the nicest smile or, you know, who's going to be fun to have a beer with,'' said Obama, to general agreement.
 Likability has become another one of those qualities that used to be desirable in a candidate until it started reminding us of how we got George W. Bush. We're not falling for that likable-guy trap again. No siree. From now on we want the kind of person you would try to avoid standing next to in a long line at the supermarket.
 Over in Michigan, the Republican voters clearly had the same thought on Tuesday when they went out and gave their primary win to a candidate absolutely no one would want to have a beer with. (Or in his case, a bracing lemonade.) Mitt Romney! Mitt Romney!
 Michigan voters are so frightened of falling into permanent economic collapse that they'll grab onto almost anything. Romney, the native son who lived in Michigan in the Eisenhower era, played them for all they were worth. He was going to bring back the old-time auto industry and the rest of the 1950s with it. There was no lost job that could not be retrieved under Mitt's skilled-businessman's supervision. He'd bring them all home!
 Human nature being what it is, you have to give politicians a pass for one pander per primary. (The Democrats have spent the last week in Nevada arguing about who is the most against a federal plan to store used nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain as if it were a plot to tax air.) But in Michigan, Romney went way over quota.
 He told the auto executives that they were being picked on when Congress required fuel efficiency to reach 35 m.p.g. by 2020. (Washington told Detroit to improve mileage in 1975, and just 32 years later, here's Big Brother, harping again.) And he promised $20 billion in federally funded research and development to get the auto industry back on track.
 Let's see, $20 billion for Michigan, and 46 states left to go. We're looking at nearly a trillion dollars in potential pander just to get Mitt to the conventions. We won't have to worry about Congress doling out pork anymore -- Romney will give the entire store away himself. 
 In his victory speech, Romney said his inspiration came from ''Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush.'' I'm not sure how Reagan would have felt about that $20 billion, but I'm pretty sure this is the first time the words ''George Herbert Walker Bush'' and ''inspiration'' have appeared in the same sentence. 
 John McCain, a disappointed runner-up, said: ''We did what we always try to do. We went to Michigan and we told people the truth.'' He was making it pretty clear that he felt that somebody had gone to Michigan with a different game plan. (Mike Huckabee, who came in third, promised ''leadership that comes right from the earth,'' which made him sound a little like a weed.) 
 How long can the Republicans avoid letting anybody win two primaries? Fred Thompson is said to be doing well in South Carolina, and Ron Paul has been campaigning in Nevada. True, the lean and hungry libertarian has been pursuing the unusual strategy of holding invitation-only rallies, but given the deep, deep weirdness of the Nevada caucus system, you never know. And Rudy Giuliani has been holding himself in reserve for Florida. (In Michigan, Rudy got 2.8 percent of the vote. When this man reserves, he reserves.)
 If the Republicans were a movie, they'd be one like ''The Dirty Dozen'' in which a mismatched bunch of oddballs get thrown together to accomplish a dangerous mission. (Who will survive?) Romney could play the irritating rich guy.

HEADLINE: Don't Tie the Next President's Hands

 BODY:
President Bush is discussing a new agreement with Baghdad that would govern the deployment of American troops in Iraq. With so many Americans adamant about bringing our forces home as soon as possible, a sentiment we strongly share, Mr. Bush must not be allowed to tie the hands of his successor and ensure the country's continued involvement in an open-ended war. 
 Given what's at stake in Iraq in terms of American and Iraqi lives lost, national treasure and broad national security interests, the negotiations on any new agreement must be fully transparent -- which they are not. The national debate must be vigorous and thoughtful, and then Congress must vote on whatever deal results.
 The White House and the Iraqi government decided in December to pursue the pact as a way to define long-term relations between the two countries, including the legal status of American military forces in Iraq. The ostensible goal is a more durable political, economic and security relationship than is possible under a United Nations resolution, the current international legal basis for the American military presence in Iraq.
 Iraqi officials, increasingly unhappy with restrictions on sovereignty because of the presence of 160,000 foreign troops, have said that they won't extend the United Nations mandate beyond this year. A Washington-Baghdad deal would have to take its place for the troops to stay.
 Formal negotiations won't start until February and few details are known, but already the two sides are laying down markers. The Iraqi defense minister, Abdul Qadir -- apparently tone-deaf to the American political debate -- told The Times's Thom Shanker that his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012 or be able to defend its own borders from external threat at least until 2018.
 That is far too long for most Americans, but not for Mr. Bush, who is quite comfortable leaving American troops fighting in Iraq for another decade.
 A related issue concerns whether the agreement would grant assurances that America would help Iraq defend against foreign aggression -- something a senior White House official says has not been ruled out. That's a worrying prospect. Such guarantees could further encourage Iraqi dependence on the American military and might draw the United States into a regional conflict. 
 Among other questions still to be answered are how long the United States wants basing rights in Iraq and how it might assuage Iraqis demanding the right to try American troops and contractors accused of killing civilians and other misdeeds. (The United States almost always brings troops home for trial.)
 Mr. Bush is rushing to complete a deal before he leaves office in January 2009. That is just as reckless and irresponsible as most of his decisions regarding Iraq. America's interests demand that his successor has maximum flexibility to plot a course, which we hope includes a quick and orderly withdrawal of troops. 
 One way to ensure that flexibility is to make sure that Congress approves any deal with Iraq, as leading Democrats, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, are insisting. The time for Congressional intervention is now.

HEADLINE: Bush Lauds Egypt Leader, Avoiding Record on Dissent

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt 

 BODY:
President Bush lavished praise on President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Wednesday, emphasizing the country's role in regional security and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process while publicly avoiding mention of the government's actions in jailing or exiling opposition leaders and its severe restrictions on opposition political activities.
 Ending an eight-day trip through the Middle East in which he highlighted democratic change as the foundation for peace and security throughout the region, Mr. Bush strikingly avoided direct criticism of Mr. Mubarak, an autocratic leader in power since late 1981. In the past, Mr. Bush criticized Egypt for arresting political dissidents. 
 ''I appreciate very much the long and proud tradition that you've had for a vibrant civil society,'' said Mr. Bush, whose appearance with Mr. Mubarak was unannounced and, according to the White House, had been uncertain until the last minute. 
 Mr. Bush's remarks reflected some of the contradictions evident in the issues he addressed on his trip.
 He spoke passionately at times about the birth of liberty and justice in countries that restrict them and the role of women in societies that still largely sequester them. 
 And yet he avoided public disputes with monarchical leaders widely accused of limiting freedoms as he sought Arab support for the peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, the war in Iraq, diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and easing the strain on the American economy caused by high oil prices.
 On Sunday, in the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Bush delivered what his aides described as the keynote address of the trip when he spoke of setbacks in democratic reforms in remarks that his aides said were aimed at Egypt, among other nations.
 ''You cannot build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison,'' he said. ''You cannot expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government. And you cannot stand up a modern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms.''
 Mr. Bush has previously criticized Egypt for arresting Mr. Mubarak's main opponent in the presidential elections in 2005, Ayman Nour, who Mr. Bush last year said was ''unjustly imprisoned.'' Mr. Bush has also met with another prominent opposition leader, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who has since fled Egypt, fearing arrest.
 Mr. Bush mentioned neither man directly and included only an oblique reference to ''strong civic and religious leaders who love their country and are determined to build a democratic future.''
 ''I appreciate the example that your nation is setting,'' he said, facing the Egyptian president.
 Mr. Mubarak expressed strong support for Mr. Bush's efforts to broker a peace treaty in Israel, something that has become a focus of last year of the Bush administration. ''We're ready, hand-in-hand with the United States of America'' to support the process Mr. Bush has advocated, he said, ''for the sake of comprehensive and just peace.''
 Neither mentioned a source of tension between Israel and Egypt, its control of its border with Gaza. Israel has accused Egypt of laxity or complicity in smuggling weapons through tunnels into Gaza, which is under the control of Hamas, the Islamic group. 
 ''Egypt has to do more,'' Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told The Jerusalem Post last week. ''Those tunnels need to be dealt with,'' she said. ''We're prepared, obviously, to give'' assistance, ''but the will to do it is very important here.''
 An administration official said that Gaza figured prominently on Mr. Bush's agenda for the talks in Egypt on Wednesday, but it was not clear how hard he pressed the issue of Egypt's willingness to help isolate Hamas in Gaza. Mr. Bush's visit here was the shortest of his trip, which included stops in Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. He stayed only three hours, reflecting Egypt's diminished significance to the administration. Mr. Mubarak noted the brevity, saying in English, ''You need much more days.''

HEADLINE: A Center Called McCain

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Nobody's been right all the time on Iraq, but Senator John McCain has been less wrong than most. He knew a bungled war when he saw one and pressed early for increased force levels. He backed the injection last year of some 30,000 troops, a surge that has produced results.
 Modest results, yes, and violence has blipped upward again this month, and, yes, Iraqi political progress is slow. But progress is always slow when a population terrorized over decades is freed. Violent attacks were down 60 percent in December from their 2007 high and refugees have begun to go home. 
 A trickle homeward, yes, a speck in the ocean of 2.2 million Iraqis forced into exile, but tens of thousands of people don't return unless they see hope. That's why more than 4 million Afghans have gone home since the Taliban's fall.
 Yes, I know, the myriad Iraqi dead won't return.
 McCain was politically dead six months ago, his campaign undone by his backing of President Bush's Iraq policy. His remarkable resurgence, which has put him in the lead among Republican candidates, according to recent polls, is one measure of the Iraq shift.
 That shift has unsettled the political ground. With Iraq looking less hopeless, McCain has scored points for being consistent and forthright on the war -- a quality shared only by Barack Obama (in his opposition to it) among leading candidates. 
 At the same time, an economy getting a subprime pummeling has nudged Iraq from the center of Americans' concerns. The victory of McCain's rival Mitt Romney in the Michigan primary came in a state craving quick fixes for 7.4 percent unemployment. McCain didn't offer that.
 So, three states have chosen distinct Republican candidates, with a social conservative, Mike Huckabee, triumphing in Iowa; McCain taking New Hampshire with independent support; and Romney using his C.E.O. image to win Michigan. Bush's party is split: God, heroic nation and Wall Street are out of sync.
 It's been widely assumed that the Democratic Party's shoot-itself-in-the-foot capacity, evident in 2004, would have to hit overdrive to wrest defeat from victory this year. These Republican splits comfort the notion of inevitable Democratic triumph.
 But, as Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute noted, ''There's no doubt that the one Republican candidate that leaves most Democrats quaking is McCain. They're uneasy about the breadth of his appeal.''
 McCain's attractiveness to independents, between 10 percent and 30 percent of the vote nationally, involves policy and personality. His readiness to take on global warming, back immigration and demand legal representation for war on terror detainees give him centrist appeal at the price of opposition within his party.
 But McCain does not win the wavering as policy wonk; he's flesh and blood. The straight-talking survivor of more than five years of Vietnamese imprisonment is at home in his own skin in a way Bush will never be. McCain has a temper but no need to be macho to convince. He walks without his arms clenched.
 None of this would matter if McCain's support of the Iraq war had condemned him. But it now appears that is not the case. In New Hampshire, where independents were an important factor, McCain's support was broad. He tends to defy categorization.
 But he's categorical in his opposition to tyranny. Saddam Hussein, as Nick Cohen, a British author, observes in his important book on liberal hypocrisy in Iraq called ''What's Left?,'' represented ''not a tin-pot dictator but real Fascism,'' complete with a ''messianic one-party state'' and ''armies that swept out in unprovoked wars'' and ''secret policemen who organized the gassing of 'impure' races.''
 This death-and-genocide machine killed about 400,000 Iraqis in internal persecutions and another million or so people in Iran and Kuwait. When you've been imprisoned, as McCain has, you know what terror means: death of spirit, soul, life itself.
 Saddam's nightmare ended in a misbegotten, mishandled, bloody and costly war. Does Bush's fraudulent, blunder-ridden rush to war matter more than the prizing of 26 million human beings from a sadistic tyrant who modeled himself on Hitler and Stalin?
 That core question has seldom, if ever, been dignified by honest debate through all the verbal Iraq wars fought on U.S. soil. I still believe Iraq's freedom outweighs its terrible price. So does McCain. In the looming battle between the Baptist minister, the corporate whiz and the war hero -- and perhaps Mr. 9/11 -- to unite the frayed strands of Republicanism, McCain now has a fighting chance. 
 If he's nominated, some lines would be blurred in the White House fight. McCain's not my choice for president. He's too conservative across a range of social questions, and his temperament and age raise concerns. But he's too honorable to dismiss at a moment so critical to U.S. standing in the world.

HEADLINE: Sarkozy Uses French Clout as His Own Slips

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Under fire at home, his marital status a mystery, President Nicolas Sarkozy is projecting French power in far-flung places and promoting himself as a global intellectual. 
 In the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, he signed a deal to create a permanent French military base there, which French officials said would involve 400 to 500 air, naval and ground personnel. The base will give France, a major arms supplier in the Arab world, a limited but important role in helping to protect a strategic energy zone, gather intelligence and warn Iran against aggression toward its neighbors. 
 The pact was twinned with a separate French deal to help the tiny state build two nuclear energy reactors. 
 ''France,'' Mr. Sarkozy said, ''responds to its friends.'' 
 In Saudi Arabia the day before, Mr. Sarkozy infused a speech with more than a dozen references to God, a very un-French thing to do, because France prides itself on its strict separation of church and state. 
 Praising Saudi Arabia for its strong religious base, Mr. Sarkozy referred to God, ''who does not enslave man, but liberates him, God who is the rampart against unbridled pride and the folly of men.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy left the kingdom with a sword and agreements on expanding oil and gas cooperation and political dialogue and providing university and professional training. He also offered France's help in developing nuclear energy facilities there. 
 The French leader has made foreign travel a hallmark of his presidency, visiting more than a score of countries, including Russia, China and the United States, since taking office in May. Next week, he is scheduled to go to India, perhaps with the model-turned-singer Carla Bruni (who may or may not already be his wife) on his arm.
 The goal of all this movement is to increase France's standing as a major power and to create what Mr. Sarkozy said in a news conference on Jan. 8 was a ''politics of civilization to establish France as the soul of the new renaissance that the world needs.'' 
 The ''politics of civilization'' is not Mr. Sarkozy's idea. He borrowed it from Edgar Morin, 87, a French philosopher-sociologist and former Communist and resistance leader, who wrote a book about the subject but seemed puzzled by the sudden embrace of the notion by Mr. Sarkozy. 
 ''I think he is trapped by his circumstances and by all his quantitative promises that he cannot deliver,'' Mr. Morin was quoted as saying on France Inter radio afterward, acknowledging that he considered Mr. Sarkozy a ''brilliant strategist.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy later invited him to the Elysee Palace for a chat. 
 Certainly, Mr. Sarkozy's standing at home is suffering. Two polls in the past two days indicate that his popularity continues to slip. Only 45 percent of the French who responded said they approved of Mr. Sarkozy's performance, down from 51 percent in December, according to a BVA poll released Tuesday. Forty-eight percent had a negative opinion of him, up from 43 percent. 
 In an Ipsos poll released Wednesday, Mr. Sarkozy's popularity dropped in a month to 49 percent in a month from 55 percent. 
 The flaccid economy and the high price of consumer goods are two of the main reasons for the slippage. Mr. Sarkozy's seeming lack of focus has not helped. 
 After he predicted at last week's news conference that France's 35-hour workweek would disappear this year, labor unions and the political opposition attacked him, saying he was trying to subvert French law. He reversed himself the next day, saying, ''It is not the government's intention to abolish the legal working limit.''
 Meanwhile, the unveiling of a much-touted ''Marshall Plan'' for the country's troubled suburbs has been postponed until next month, amid bickering about it between two of his cabinet members.
 But the biggest distraction in Mr. Sarkozy's presidency these days is the question of whether he secretly married Ms. Bruni last week in the Elysee Palace. 
 The regional daily L'Est Republicain -- the same newspaper that broke the story of the president's divorce from his wife, Cecilia, last fall -- reported this week that Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Bruni married in a ''small, private ceremony'' at the Elysee presidential palace last Thursday, the same day Mr. Sarkozy played host to Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain there. 
 During post-New Year's greetings to the news media on Tuesday, Prime Minister Francois Fillon seemed to tamp down the rumors.
 ''Thursday's schedule was not very compatible with your rumors,'' Mr. Fillon said. ''It was a busy day.''
 When Mr. Sarkozy was quizzed by journalists about the status of his relationship with Ms. Bruni during a stop in Qatar on Sunday evening, he demurred. ''Don't count on me to confirm or deny,'' he said, according to the popular daily newspaper Le Parisien. ''My answer -- it is no comment. When I have something to say, I'll say it. Stop, then, from being interested in my private life.''
 The Italian news media, meanwhile, have been reporting that Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Bruni were planning to honeymoon soon at a small luxury hotel near Verona. The hotel comes with a chapel.

HEADLINE: Mr. Right

BYLINE: By ADRIAN WOOLDRIDGE. 
Adrian Wooldridge, the Washington bureau chief for The Economist, is the co-author of ''The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 JOHN McCAIN has gone from Republican front-runner to road kill to front-runner again over the past year. Now, after Mitt Romney's victory in the Michigan primary on Tuesday, Mr. McCain's candidacy is again back up in the air -- and with it the entire Republican presidential race. 
 There is a reason Republican primary voters are so confused by Mr. McCain. He is a Republican who is disliked by the hard core of his party but loved by many independents and Democrats. He is almost universally regarded as a moderate and a maverick, a combination that independents love and conservatives loathe. The trouble with this widespread understanding of Mr. McCain's politics is that it is entirely wrong. 
 Mr. McCain's willingness to squabble with his fellow party members makes him look more like a moderate than he really is -- which is why independents and Democrats turned out to vote for him in New Hampshire and Michigan. He has certainly squabbled with the conservative establishment. He initially voted against the Bush tax cuts. He denounced Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as ''agents of intolerance.'' He battled with his fellow Republicans over pork-barrel spending and campaign finance reform. He feuded with the White House over torture and Guantanamo.
 But there is a radical difference between disagreeing with your fellow conservatives and fudging on basic principles. Mr. McCain has a solid record on the defining principles of the modern conservative movement -- traditional values, the free market and national defense -- a record that is far more solid on these core beliefs than Mr. Romney's. 
 In fact, Mr. McCain's squabbles with his fellow conservatives have almost always been in the name of fundamental conservative principles. He opposed torture because he thought it was a violation of the American tradition of respect for human life and human rights. He opposed President Bush's tax cuts because he thought the goal of small government required Congress to cut spending also. He excoriated pork-barrel spending and unlimited campaign donations because he thinks these practices institutionalize bad (and big) government. He promoted immigration reform because he thought the ''conservative'' alternative (encouraging illegal immigrants to go home) is unworkable economically and dubious morally. Business interests, which have been growing disenchanted with the Republicans, would hardly disagree. 
 Mr. McCain's basic political insight -- that there is a distinction between the constituencies in the conservative movement and the principles of conservative governance -- provides the Republican Party with the best available solution to its problem this November: the unpopularity of the Republican establishment. Not only can he argue that the establishment has put expedience above principle, but he can also tout his own record in battling that establishment.
 The conservative movement is engaged in a lively debate about the future of the Reagan coalition of pro-business Republicans, social conservatives and defense hawks. Ed Rollins, the former Reagan adviser who now works for Mike Huckabee, argues that the coalition is dead and that a new one must be created. Mr. Huckabee would tilt the party away from people who look like Mr. Romney and toward people who look like himself -- blue-collar social conservatives. Pragmatists like Mr. Romney argue that they could stitch the coalition back together and then manage it better. 
 Mr. McCain offers a third way for conservatives: stick to the core principles while feuding with movement barons like James Dobson and Grover Norquist.
 There are dangers in McCainism. Directly confronting the Republican Party's contradictions could plunge it into a civil war. But the prospect of a Democratic presidency -- particularly a Hillary Clinton presidency -- would surely avert that. A more worrisome possibility is that McCainism relies so much on a single man, one who is now 71 years old. Margaret Thatcher similarly uprooted the Conservative establishment in Britain only to leave her party with an identity crisis when she left office. 
 That said, there are still good reasons Mr. McCain is worth the risks his candidacy would pose. His moderate image would serve him well in a general election. More important, Mr. McCain is more likely than any of his rivals to offer conservatives what they want: a vigorous pursuit of the fight against terrorism, the appointment of conservative judges, retrenchment and reform of government.
 Over the coming months the conservative voters who are so suspicious of Mr. McCain will have to decide whether their loyalties lie with their beliefs or with their interest groups. And the independent voters who warm to him will have to ask whether they really want another conservative in the White House.

HEADLINE: Fed's Chairman Is Said to Back Aid to Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has told lawmakers that he can support tax cuts or spending measures to stimulate the economy, even if they increase the budget deficit, provided the measures are quick and temporary. 
 Mr. Bernanke is to testify before the House Budget Committee Thursday. Democratic lawmakers said he had told them that he would not comment on proposals to link a stimulus package with a permanent extension of President Bush's tax cuts. That is expected to disappoint Republicans who favor such a link. 
 Faced with growing evidence that the economy is slipping into a recession, Congressional Democrats and President Bush are trying to come up with a package that would put more money in Americans' hands within the next few months.
 The Fed's willingness to give a nod to fiscal stimulus is important. Many lawmakers will not support action without the chairman's blessing, and the double dose of stimulus that the Fed and Congress are considering must be carefully calibrated. 
 If Mr. Bernanke opposed Congressional action on the ground that spending increases and tax cuts would increase the budget deficit, the Fed might restrain its own effort to stimulate the economy with lower interest rates. 
 Mr. Bernanke wants to keep the Fed out of political jockeying, but he is also wary of endorsing measures that could aggravate the government's long-term fiscal problems. Unlike his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, Mr. Bernanke has generally refused to insert himself into the particulars of partisan battles over specific tax and spending proposals. Mr. Greenspan was often criticized for endorsing Mr. Bush's tax cuts of 2001, which contributed to ballooning deficits for several years. 
 Democratic lawmakers who have spoken with Mr. Bernanke said he would not endorse any specific plan but supported the general idea of propping up consumer spending and investment with temporary tax or spending measures.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, said Mr. Bernanke was ''generally supportive'' of a stimulus package as long as it was well conceived. ''He said that while he wasn't going to endorse a specific plan, if an economic stimulus package was properly designed and enacted so that it enters the economy quickly, it could have a very positive effect,'' Mr. Schumer said.
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged last week that economic conditions had worsened and strongly suggested that the Federal Reserve would reduce the benchmark interest rate at the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee on Jan. 30. On Wall Street, investors are betting that the central bank will reduce overnight lending rates to 3.75 percent from 4.25 percent. 
 On Wednesday, the central bank released its so-called beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks, and it stated that economic growth slowed noticeably in November and December. 
 The report said that holiday-season retail sales were ''generally disappointing.'' Seven of the 12 Fed districts reported a ''slight increase in economic activity,'' two described conditions as ''mixed'' and three reported slowdowns.
 The Fed chairman met privately on Monday with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. In that meeting, according to Congressional officials, Mr. Bernanke neither urged Congress to enact an emergency measure nor signaled any opposition.
 While declining to discuss details, Ms. Pelosi said, ''I am encouraged by my conversations with the administration and the Fed, which is separate and independent, that there is a sense of urgency, that there is a need for a stimulus package and we should find our common ground as soon as possible.''
 The Fed chairman was said by others to have echoed the concept if not the precise words of economists like Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton, who have called for any plan to be ''timely, targeted and temporary.''
 Democratic lawmakers generally favor measures aimed at low- and middle-income families, arguing they need the extra money most acutely and are most likely to spend it immediately. Though Democrats are weighing a variety of measures, a consensus appears to be building that the package should cost about $100 billion. 
 Among the proposals circulating among Democrats are one-time tax rebates to almost all workers; temporary increases in unemployment benefits, food stamps and Medicaid payments; and federal grants to state and local governments. Some Democrats are pushing for increased spending on public infrastructure like highways and bridges, but aides to Ms. Pelosi said that issue might be dealt with separately to avoid slowing down any stimulus package.
 Administration officials and many Republican lawmakers were open to tax rebates, but many want to include temporary business tax breaks, like an investment tax credit or permanent reductions in the corporate rate.
 The House Democratic and Republican leaders met Wednesday and emerged promising to work together on a stimulus plan. Congressional leaders are to meet with Mr. Bush next Tuesday.
 On Wednesday, Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, rejected a proposal favored by many Democrats to have the federal government pay a larger share of the cost of Medicaid, the health program for low-income people that is financed jointly with the states.
 He said that increasing the federal share of Medicaid could be a means of increasing federal control over health care, a change opposed by the White House.
 ''I don't think that Medicare and Medicaid were intended as jobs programs,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''They were intended to help those with serious economic disadvantages.''
 One precedent for this proposal was the 2003 tax cut law, which provided $20 billion in ''temporary fiscal relief'' to states. Half of the money was to avert cuts in Medicaid programs.
 Mr. Bush and his advisers have been pushing for years to make his 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. Many economists argue that making the tax cuts permanent would have no immediate effect on the economy, because they are not scheduled to expire until the end of 2010. But supporters say the move could provide a short-term lift because investors would have greater certainty about tax policy in the future.
 Mr. Bernanke, who was a Fed governor and then chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers before becoming Fed chairman, is expected to rebuff efforts by Republicans or Democrats to draw him into that battle. Since becoming Fed chairman in February 2006, Mr. Bernanke has generally refused to comment on specific tax and spending proposals unless they had a direct bearing on the overall economy.
 ''If he gets peppered on these issues, my guess is that he will duck,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm.
 Mr. Bernanke is expected to warn lawmakers Thursday that the nation faces severe budget problems in the decades ahead as more than 70 million baby boomers reach retirement age.
 He has long made it clear that there are times when it makes sense for the federal government to run higher deficits to head off an economic downturn.
 ''In the short run, fiscal policy makers may have important and legitimate reasons to depart from budget balance, sometimes even substantially,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech in 2003, when he was a Fed governor. Those reasons, he continued, could include a national emergency or ''a stimulus package to assist economic recovery.''

HEADLINE: Focus Shifts To S. Carolina For Romney And Rivals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and MICHAEL COOPER; Michael Powell contributed reporting from Tigerville, S.C.

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C. 

 BODY:
The jumbled Republican presidential race shifted Wednesday to South Carolina, where Mitt Romney's rivals aimed fresh criticism at him in an effort to stymie any momentum gained from his victory in the Michigan primary the day before.
 Mr. Romney arrived in South Carolina on Wednesday morning, continuing to press a retooled message focused on the economy and fixing Washington that worked so well for him in Michigan. But he also sought to restrain expectations for his performance in the primary here Saturday, in which the latest polls, though taken before Michigan, show him running behind both John McCain and Mike Huckabee.
 Mr. McCain, Mr. Huckabee and Fred D. Thompson are each staking their candidacies to varying extents on South Carolina, as the outcome here will most likely bear heavily on Florida's all-important primary on Jan. 29. 
 As a result, all the leading Republican contenders -- except for Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was in Florida -- jockeyed for advantage Wednesday across South Carolina, where they emphasized their social-conservative credentials for the state's influential evangelical Christian voting bloc. 
 Continuing to reach out to his evangelical base, Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist pastor, spoke at North Greenville University, a Southern Baptist institution. There he dwelled on the economic pain suffered by the middle and working classes, but also reasserted his opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage and, at the prompting of the university's president, eagerly told of how as a child he accepted Jesus as his Savior.
 Mr. McCain, who has had an uneasy relationship with evangelicals dating from his failed presidential run in 2000, made a point of reminding audiences Wednesday about his longstanding opposition to abortion.
 But though surveys suggest that Mr. Huckabee poses a bigger threat to him here, Mr. McCain trained much of his fire on Mr. Romney.
 ''If he is as good as he says on this issue,'' Mr. McCain said of the economy, ''why is it that the manufacturing jobs left the nation at 7 percent when he was governor of Massachusetts'' but ''left by 14 percent in the state of Massachusetts?''
 Eric Fehrnstrom, a spokesman for the former governor, responded to Mr. McCain by saying that four years after Mr. Romney took office, ''the budget was balanced, the economy was adding jobs, unemployment was down, and Wall Street responded with a credit rating upgrade.''
 But experts have pointed out that while Massachusetts' economic and fiscal condition improved under Mr. Romney, its job growth trailed that of the nation as a whole.
 Mr. Thompson also jabbed at Mr. Romney on Wednesday, maintaining that he had pandered to voters in Michigan by making unrealistic promises to rescue the auto industry. 
 Mr. Romney himself, meanwhile, continued with his tactic of portraying himself as a tireless champion for jobs, even in failing industries. Having singled out the auto industry while in Michigan, he pointed to the textile and furniture industries here.
 ''I'm not willing to declare defeat in any industry,'' he said. ''I'm going to fight for every job.''
 In part because Mr. Romney's prospects in South Carolina are complicated by many evangelicals' suspicion of his Mormon faith, his campaign is maneuvering simply to exceed expectations here. In keeping with that approach, Mr. Romney, speaking to reporters, sought Wednesday to cast Mr. McCain as the undisputed South Carolina front-runner.
 ''It would be an enormous surprise if he was unable to win here,'' Mr. Romney said.
 It is in Mr. Romney's interest, of course, to set up Mr. McCain for something of a fall, although Mr. McCain himself predicted at a news conference that he would win the state. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Romney heads to Nevada. That state holds its caucuses on Saturday, the same day as the South Carolina primary, but has been largely uncontested by Republicans except Mr. Romney.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks Blend Of Policy And Persona

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: RENO, Nev. 

 BODY:
There has been Commander in Chief Hillary Rodham Clinton, the steely leader who, voters were assured, would ''destroy'' terrorists and be Thatcher-like tough. 
 There has been Strong-and-Experienced Hillary Clinton, but that proved to be so uninspiring that Change-Agent Hillary and Likable-Since-I-Was-a-Kid Hillary were rolled out.
 And Teary-Eyed Hillary, of course, won the New Hampshire primary last week, after the candidate choked up describing the rigors of the race. 
 But as her advisers said after New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton cannot cry her way to the Democratic nomination. So she and her team have been searching for the right personality to help her connect emotionally with voters -- an intuitive talent of her chief competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Barack Obama -- while also emphasizing her competence and experience.
 Her newest public face is a blend of policy and persona. She held two roundtable discussions with average people, experts and activists on Wednesday in Nevada, which holds its presidential caucuses on Saturday, focusing on a proposed nuclear waste repository near Las Vegas and the economic ills and mortgage foreclosures in the state and the nation. 
 That was where I-Feel-Your-Pain Hillary emerged, a reprise of her husband Bill Clinton's touchy-feely message from his 1992 campaign. 
 Mrs. Clinton listened. She nodded. She expressed sympathy. She promised to fight for the people in the room.
 ''I used to be middle class, but I don't know what I am anymore,'' said Valerie Franklin, a plant manager, who was invited to the economic discussion here.
 ''Valerie's question is one that a lot of people asking: Am I still in the middle class?'' Mrs. Clinton said a moment later.
 (Another rival, John Edwards, a former senator, often talks about the pain of real people he meets on the trail.)
 But while Mrs. Clinton played the part, she has not used her husband's four-word expression of empathy. Instead, she promised to address people's pain by invoking another famous phrase from another former president several times on Wednesday: Harry Truman's ''the buck stops here.'' 
 Often referring to herself as a ''pragmatist'' who is in ''the solutions business,'' Mrs. Clinton's approach is not to become teary-eyed again but to present herself as more of a ''hands-on leader'' (another phrase of hers on Wednesday) than Mr. Obama.
 The Clinton team decided to dust off the Truman phrase after Mr. Obama said, in their televised debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday, that one of his weaknesses was not being a good office manager. While Mr. Obama limited this to keeping a clean desk, Mrs. Clinton acted like he had committed the worst sin imaginable for Democrats: sounding as if they would govern like George W. Bush.
 ''You have to be able to manage and run the bureaucracy,'' she said at the debate. ''We've seen the results of a president who frankly failed at that. You know, he went into office saying he was going to have the kind of Harvard Business School C.E.O. model, where he'd set the tone, he'd set the goals, and then everybody else would have to implement it.''
 Mr. Obama replied that he was nothing like Mr. Bush, and he suggested that some of his own strengths were not shared by either Mr. Bush or Mrs. Clinton, who strikes some Democrats and independents as divisive and secretive.
 ''What has been missing is the ability to bring people together, to mobilize the country to move us in a better direction, and to be straight with the American people,'' Mr. Obama said.
 By Wednesday morning, the conciliatory tone of the debate had faded and an Obama spokesman was saying that Mrs. Clinton was running to be White House chief of staff, while she and her team were saying that Mr. Obama would be so hands-off that he could not demand Truman-like accountability. 
 All of these remarks by Mrs. Clinton add up to her challenging, once again, Mr. Obama over experience, with her arguing that she is better equipped.
 In response to one reporter's question on Wednesday, for instance, Mrs. Clinton said that she had the experience to try to head off a national recession and that she ''saw what it took to push through the Congress in 1993 the economic stimulus package.'' (Only one problem: That package relied on Democratic votes, not the sort of bipartisanship that Mr. Obama is promising, and contributed to Democrats losing control of the House of Representatives in 1994.)
 But she is also hoping that the latest Hillary Clinton will help people connect with her personally -- an element in effective leadership. She even extended her new touch to the reporters covering her campaign, several of whom have been tired or ill after months on the trail.
 On the flight from Las Vegas to Reno on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton hopped on the public announcement system and announced the maiden voyage of ''Hil Force One.'' She poked fun at both herself -- ''in the event of an unexpected drop in poll numbers, this plane will be diverted to New Hampshire'' -- and at the reporters, drawing laughs. (Mr. Bush pulled a similar joke on his press plane in June 1999.)
 ''My name is Hillary,'' she told the press corps, ''and I am so pleased to have most of you on board.''

HEADLINE: Health Care Could Sway Nevadans

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Amanda Cox contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
Voters in Nevada fret about the economy. Many are disquieted by the war. They worry about taxes, the federal threat of a nuclear waste site in their midst, immigration and gun rights. 
 But with the Nevada caucuses coming Saturday, little seems to concern people here as much as health care. The state has an unusually high number of people with no insurance, doctors are hard to come by, Medicaid reimbursements are low and health care safety nets are eroding.
 ''I used to be able to go to the V.A. and they'd take care of us,'' said Anthony DiMaria, 84, who served in the Marine Corps. ''Now they send you a letter saying you have what they call 'means,' and they aren't going to take you in anymore. Is that the kind of life we fought for?''
 Just as the presidential nominating contests in other states have been defined in part by national issues with local poignancy -- immigration in Iowa, unemployment in Michigan -- Nevada's caucuses could turn on how well the candidates address the United States' growing health care crisis. 
 Older voters -- and the children who help care for them -- worry about Medicare benefits, young people in jobs without coverage say they cannot afford to pay for their own and most everyone knows or has cared for someone with too little insurance. 
 In interviews with 30 registered voters around this city -- in a retirement community, a middle-class neighborhood and downtown on the steps of a courthouse -- almost half said that health care was the most compelling and worrisome problem the candidates needed to solve. 
 ''I have a daughter who had a major car accident three years ago and she can't get health insurance,'' said Terrence M. Jackson, 61, a lawyer. ''I pay $15,000 a year for her medical coverage. And there are millions of people who can't get coverage.''
 Among Democrats -- whose caucuses are the main event on Saturday because Republican candidates have largely sidestepped the state -- voters were particularly outspoken in identifying health care over the mortgage foreclosure crisis, the national economy or the war in Iraq as their principal concern. 
 ''We had to go to one of those plans that are Medicare-driven and they tell you what you're going to do and not going to do,'' said Carol Wilken, 62, who said at a retirement community here that the candidates' health care plans would drive her vote. ''It's the pits. Don't ever get old.''
 While insurance difficulties plague nearly every state, Nevada has come to its problems in some unique ways. The fastest-growing state for most of the last two decades, it has a largely mobile employee base -- particularly in Las Vegas -- with residents who move from job to job, often never gaining insurance. The state's large Hispanic population -- which tends to lead the numbers of uninsured -- further contributes to the high numbers.
 Finding doctors who will accept Medicaid is difficult in the state, especially in rural areas, and the state's income eligibility requirements are high and the paperwork required to enroll is excessive and inaccessible compared with other states, health care experts say. 
 A recent poll of 500 likely Democratic voters in Nevada found health care to be ''the single most important issue in determining'' a presidential vote among 20 percent of those polled. Only the economy, with 21 percent, was mentioned by more respondents. (The poll, conducted by Research 2000 for The Reno Gazette-Journal, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.)
 The percentage of people without insurance in Nevada is among the highest in the nation, significantly higher than in Iowa, New Hampshire or Michigan -- the states that have already voted. According to the Census Bureau, an average of 18.3 percent of Nevadans did not have health insurance from 2004 to 2006, compared with 9.3 percent in Iowa.
 The Democratic and Republican candidates concur that affordable health care eludes many Americans, but they are deeply divided on how to remedy the problem and insure the 47 million people without health insurance. 
 The Democrats, whose plans would cost $65 billion to $100 billion annually, believe that the federal government should play a role, in part through the elimination of the Bush administration's tax cuts for the wealthy.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and John Edwards, the former North Carolina senator, say they would require all Americans to get coverage and would provide subsidies to that end, while Senator Barack Obama of Illinois would require only children to have coverage. Mr. Obama's plan would require employers to provide coverage or contribute to a new public program. They have all mulled expanding the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. 
 Republicans prefer plans that rely on the marketplace over government, and they generally eschew mandated coverage. 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, has called for a voluntary move from the employer-based system to one granting tax benefits to those who buy their own insurance.
 Mitt Romney, who signed a universal coverage plan into law when he was governor of Massachusetts, would give states the flexibility to come up with their own answers, with federal assistance. Senator John McCain of Arizona is focused on containing health care spending, and has said that essentially high-cost diseases, like diabetes and heart disease, should get more attention. Mr. McCain proposes that hospital and doctor compensation be linked to performance measures.
 Among the voters interviewed here, few were particularly informed about what any of the candidates have proposed. While no candidate was overwhelmingly supported by those interviewed, Mrs. Clinton's association with health care registered with some voters.
 ''I know it was a major issue when she was a first lady,'' said Jeffrey Eskin, 55. ''And my feeling is that it was started and not completed.'' 
 The issue cuts both ways for Mrs. Clinton, whose health care plan in the Clinton administration failed spectacularly.
 ''I think with Senator Clinton, she's trying to bring in a socialistic health care system which would probably bankrupt the country,'' said Marlene Lansdell, a registered nurse and a Democrat. ''Health care is my No. 1 issue, but they are going to make changes that are going to be extremely costly and the taxpayer will foot the bill. I don't want a free-for-all.''
 So for the next few days, most everyone here seems to be listening intently -- and hoping for inspiration. Cheryl Reber, who at 26 was recently removed from her parent's coverage, has no insurance in her job as a legal secretary, but says she tries not to think about that. 
 ''I haven't had to face any health care problems yet,'' Ms. Reber said, adding that the possibility haunts her. ''I don't want to go as far as Canada, but we need something more affordable.''

HEADLINE: State Makes Bid to End Costly Tax-Refund Loans

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
New York officials filed civil complaints on Thursday against two tax preparation firms that offer high-interest loans against income-tax refunds, saying the companies had aimed the loans at low-income black and Hispanic families and military families in violation of state antidiscrimination laws.
 The two firms, Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax Service, are among the largest tax-preparation companies in the country, with hundreds of thousands of customers each tax season. Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax each team up with banks to offer high-interest, short-term loans known as ''refund anticipation loans,'' based on customers' estimated income-tax refunds. 
 Such loans can carry annualized interest rates as high as 700 percent -- though the period of the loan is normally days or weeks -- and have been called predatory by some advocates. 
 The complaints ask that the firms stop the practice.
 The tax preparation firms earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually by charging administrative and processing fees on top of those interest payments, even though most taxpayers who file online can get their federal income tax refund directly from the Internal Revenue Service, at no cost, within 10 days of filing, according to state officials.
 In an interview, John T. Hewitt, the founder and chief executive of Liberty, denied that Liberty marketed the loans specifically to black and Hispanic families or military families, and said that the company did not collect data on its customers' race or ethnicity. He also said that refund loans had been around for decades and that the company would vigorously contest the complaint.
 ''I guess the timing is not a surprise,'' Mr. Hewitt said of the lawsuit. ''I think they want a little publicity.''
 A spokeswoman for Jackson Hewitt said the allegations against the firm were ''without merit.''
 According to one outside study cited in the complaints, in New York, the loans are made disproportionately to lower-income blacks and Hispanics, as well as to people in the military and their families.
 ''You can focus on the abusiveness of the product itself, which other entities have done, but the most egregious thing is that they target the most vulnerable people in the community,'' said Kumiki Gibson, commissioner of the state's Division of Human Rights. ''They are targeted specifically for these products because of their status as people of color, people in the military.'' 
 State officials said some customers end up owing the firms more than they get in refunds, because the interest and fees are so high and because the refund estimates are often inaccurate. The complaints also say that the loans are undermining federal tax credits intended to support the working poor, like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Nationwide, according to a study by the National Consumer Law Center, half of all people who obtain the refund loans also get the tax credit.
 Refund-anticipation loans have attracted scrutiny in recent years from officials in several other states. But Thursday's complaints appear to be the first based on a state's antidiscrimination laws. New York is one of only a handful of states where those laws make the families of military personnel a protected class along with racial and ethnic minorities and other groups.
 Over a 10-month investigation, officials said, the Division of Human Rights amassed several years' worth of statistical evidence indicating that the loans had been marketed to those groups. 
 The complaints also rely on outside data, like a study of tax returns from 2002 to 2005 by the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a New York-based advocacy group for low-income people.

HEADLINE: A Car-Fraud Sting With a Long Arm

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER and ANN FARMER

DATELINE: The cars came from all over 

 BODY:
upstate New York and Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The owners brought them to middlemen who would deliver them for a fee to a nondescript garage in Queens. The cars, the owners thought, would be stripped down for parts, and they could then claim the vehicles as stolen and recoup tens of thousands of dollars from insurance companies.
 Good old-fashioned word of mouth helped the garage thrive for about 18 months. 
 ''The word gets out on the street very quickly,'' Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said at a news conference on Thursday.
 But there is one thing that did not get out: The Queens garage was actually being run by undercover city police detectives in a sting known as Operation Disappearing Act. 
 On Thursday, authorities announced details of the sting that they say resulted in charges against 61 suspects in at least 4 states and seizure of 70 vehicles worth $1.7 million. Ten of the suspects were not in custody as of noon Thursday, officials said.
 Among the 61 people charged were a New York City police officer, a director of security at a city-run hospital, and an employee with the federal Homeland Security Department, the district attorney's office said in a statement. 
 Suspects face charges ranging from grand larceny and insurance fraud to illegal possession of a vehicle identification number and plates. Most face up to seven years in prison if convicted, the district attorney's office said.
 The city police officer who was arrested, Shantell McKinnies, 27, has pleaded not guilty to charges of grand larceny, falsifying business records and insurance fraud. The Police Department suspended her from duty. She had collected $26,255 for a Dodge Charger she had reported stolen, officials said.
 ''It is very troublesome when you see people supposed to uphold the law, end up breaking it,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But when they break the law, they are treated like everyone else.''
 The lawyer for Officer McKinnies declined to comment. 
 As dozens of suspects were processed in Queens Criminal Court, at least one lawyer for a defendant said he believed the operation amounted to entrapment. 
 ''The Police Department and the Queens district attorney proactively went out and induced people who otherwise would not commit a crime to commit a crime,'' said Peter Toumbekis, a lawyer for Andre Williams, 46, a resident of New Rochelle, N.Y. 
 As part of the operation, which started in July 2006, some suspects turned over vehicles to middlemen who would deliver them for a fee to the undercover ''chop shop'' in Queens, officials said. The middlemen then returned the keys to the owners, who could use them to make stolen-vehicle claims to the police and insurance companies. 
 Industry experts said the transactions, known as ''owner give-ups,'' were a common type of automobile insurance fraud that inflates premiums, since the company's losses are passed on to consumers. 
 ''It is a significant problem,'' Steven Nachman, deputy superintendent for fraud and consumer services at the state's Insurance Department, said in an interview 
 ''We anticipate that with the credit crunch and the overall downturn in the economy,'' the crime is likely to become more common ''in the coming months or a year or two,'' he said.
 In the last five years, there have been similar cases, Mr. Nachman said, ''but this is large and significant in terms of the number of arrests.'' 
 As a part of the operation, the undercover detectives paid the middlemen about $1,000 per vehicle, the district attorney's office said. Of those arrested, 15 are charged with acting as middlemen in the transactions, and 5 are charged with possessing stolen cars or possessing or removing vehicle identification numbers for vehicles, according to the district attorney's office.
 The vehicles included luxury cars like Cadillac Escalades and BMWs, the district attorney's office said. The operation also netted more than 40 false insurance claims.
 An official close to the investigation said that not all of the 70 cars were related to transactions by the 61 people charged, but that over the course of the operation they were recovered as stolen vehicles or found to have had their identifying numbers defaced.
 Saulina Turner, 21, who said she has worked in undercover security, was at Criminal Court to show support for her aunt, Dionne Humphry, 36, who was one of those accused. ''I just want to say this is ridiculous,'' Ms. Turner said. ''This is a hardworking mother. This is way out of her character. We know that her vehicle was stolen in 2006 around Christmastime.''

HEADLINE: Fearing Deportation but Clinging to Life and Homes in U.S.

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: WAUKEGAN, Ill. 

 BODY:
She is a homeowner, a taxpayer, a friendly neighbor and an American citizen. Yet because she is married to an illegal immigrant, these days she feels like a fugitive. 
 Whenever her Mexican husband ventures out of the house, ''it makes me sick to my stomach,'' said the woman, who insisted on being identified only by a first name and last initial, Miriam M.
 ''I'm like, 'Oh, my God, he took too long,'<0>'' she said. ''I'll start calling. I go into panic.'' 
 Over the last year, thousands of illegal immigrants and their families who live here have retreated from community life in Waukegan, a microcosm of a growing underground of illegal immigrants across the country who are clinging to homes and jobs despite the pressure of tougher federal and local enforcement. 
 From Illinois to Georgia to Arizona, these families are hiding in plain sight, to avoid being detected by immigration agents and deported. They do their shopping in towns distant from home, avoid parties and do not take vacations. They stay away from ethnic stores, forgo doctor's visits and meetings at their children's schools, and postpone girls' normally lavish quinceaneras, or 15th birthday parties.
 They avoid the police, even hesitating to report crimes.
 ''When we leave in the morning we know we are going to work,'' said Elena G., a 47-year-old illegal Mexican immigrant and Waukegan resident of eight years who works in a factory near here. '' But we don't know if we will be coming home.''
 Last year, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested more than 35,000 illegal immigrants, including unauthorized workers and immigration fugitives, more than double the number in 2006. They sent 276,912 immigrants back to their home countries, a record number.
 Since about three-quarters of an estimated 11.3 million illegal immigrants nationwide are from Latin America, and many have spouses, children or other relatives who are legal immigrants and citizens, the sense of alarm has spread broadly among Hispanics.
 A survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, found in December that 53 percent of Hispanics in the United States worry that they or a loved one could be deported.
 Stores catering to Hispanic immigrants in places like Atlanta and Cincinnati have closed because of the drop in customers. Michael L. Barrera, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said anecdotal reports had indicated that small storefront businesses had been the hardest hit by a sharp decline in spending by immigrants. 
 ''The raids have really spooked them in a big way,'' said Douglas S. Massey, a Princeton demographer who has studied Mexican immigrants for three decades.
 Based on his own surveys and recent reports from other scholars doing field research in the Southwest and in North Carolina and other states, Professor Massey said the ''palpable sense of fear and of traumatization'' in immigrant communities was more intense than at any other time since the mass deportations of Mexican farm workers in 1954. 
 Federal immigration officials say that stepped-up enforcement over the last year by the Bush administration and some local authorities has persuaded growing numbers of illegal immigrants to return home. But in places like Waukegan, a racially mixed middle-class suburb north of Chicago, most have chosen to stay, held by families and jobs.
 This city has been an immigrant landing for generations. Latinos have been coming since the 1960s and now are 40 percent of the population of 91,000. The number of illegal immigrants among them swelled in the last decade. 
 Despite their illegal status, those immigrants found steady jobs in factories and landscaping. Lacking Social Security numbers, they used Internal Revenue Service taxpayer numbers to open stores and businesses, enroll in the community college and take out bank loans to buy cars and homes. 
 The welcome began to fade four years ago, when the city government increased fines and penalties for driving without a license. Since Illinois requires a valid Social Security number for a license, many illegal immigrants lost their cars when they could not afford the fees for impounded vehicles.
 Last summer the City Council voted to enter an agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency, to train Waukegan police officers to initiate deportations of immigrants who were convicted felons. While city officials insisted the officers would handle only cases of imprisoned criminals, rumors spread that the traffic police would check the immigration status of anyone they stopped. 
 Also, in recent months federal immigration agents conducted two big raids nearby. 
 ''People came to me and said, 'Father, when did we become the enemy?'<0>'' said the Rev. Gary M. Graf, a Roman Catholic priest whose Waukegan parish includes many Latino immigrants.
 City officials said that the tougher traffic ordinances were not intended to single out illegal immigrants or Hispanics, but to reduce accidents with uninsured drivers. 
 ''The only reason we did it was for safety,'' Mayor Richard H. Hyde said. ''We don't want anybody on the road that doesn't have a license.''
 Nonetheless, for many residents fear has become a daily companion. One woman, a 37-year-old naturalized citizen who was born in Central America but grew up in Waukegan, has decided to stay away from the city even though her mother still lives here. The woman, a lawyer practicing in the Chicago area, fell in love with an illegal immigrant from Guatemala. 
 After they were married in 2004, she realized that under immigration law it would be difficult for him to become legal, even though she is a citizen. Because he had crossed the border illegally, seeking legal status would require him to return to Guatemala for years of separation, with no guarantee of success. She abandoned plans to move back to Waukegan. She and her husband feel safer in Chicago, with its large Hispanic population.
 ''I know everything about Waukegan; it's my town,'' said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous because of her husband's status. ''I know the high school, the first Mexican restaurant. I should feel free to go in and out whenever I want to. But it's not the same freedom anymore.''
 Raimundo V., 30, an illegal Mexican immigrant who has lived here for 13 years, said he canceled repairs on his home, which he owns, stopped buying in local stores, and was trying to save as much money as he could in case he should be arrested and deported. 
 ''My expectation here is to be prepared for anything that comes,'' Raimundo said. 
 Miriam M. and her husband, married in 2004, own a tidy house on a peaceful street and are raising four children from previous marriages, all United States citizens. He runs his own landscaping company, paying business and property taxes. 
 Even though Miriam M. is a citizen, it is difficult for her husband to obtain legal papers, since he entered illegally from Mexico 12 years ago. She did not focus on her husband's illegal status when she first met him.
 ''Boyfriend and girlfriend, you don't think much about it,'' she said. ''All right, maybe I didn't want to think much about it.''
 Now he stays close to home and avoids downtown Waukegan, driving around the city limits when he can. 
 Another immigrant, L. Gomez, 36, a Colombian recently on her way to becoming legal, said she had gone to the police and the courts in years past for protection from a violent husband. Since the crackdown, she said, she has avoided the authorities, even when her husband threatened her. 
 Hispanic business owners in Waukegan complain of a sales slump that they said went beyond the effects of a sluggish national economy. 
 ''People are turning away from Waukegan business and going elsewhere to invest or to buy,'' said Porfirio Garcia, a Mexican-American who is president of Exit/Re-Gar Realty, a real estate brokerage firm. 
 At the Belvidere Mall, which caters to Hispanic customers, Maria Sotelo, a legal Mexican immigrant, said she was closing her store there after 17 years because her sales dropped in the last six months to $500 a week from $5,000. She sold satin and voile dresses for quinceanera parties and T-shirts from Mexican soccer teams. 
 ''Since it all started with immigration, people don't come here anymore,'' Ms. Sotelo said. 
 Mr. Hyde and other city officials said they expected to wait several years before Congress adopted new laws to control illegal immigration. Meanwhile, the mayor said, he will do what he can by enforcing local law. 
 ''Do I believe in closing the borders?'' Mr. Hyde said. ''Do I believe in putting troops down there? You bet your life. Illegal is illegal, and that's the end of the conversation, really.''

In the breezy, amoral heist comedy ''Mad Money,''''Fun With Dick and Jane'' meets ''9 to 5'' on the way to recession. If this uncomfortably timely movie lacks the political bite of the first and the cozy star chemistry of the second, it sputters to fitful life in the crooked grin of Diane Keaton, whose character, Bridget Cardigan, an upper-middle-class homemaker in suburban Kansas City, Mo., develops an insatiable lust for larceny.
 As in ''Fun With Dick and Jane,'' financial crisis inspires serious theft. No sooner has Don (Ted Danson), Bridget's husband, sprung the alarming news that he has been downsized from his cushy corporate job and is $286,000 in debt, than she springs into action. 
 Is there a place in the workforce for an upper-middle-class woman of a certain age with a degree in comparative literature and no job experience? Yes, if she accepts humiliating work as a janitor in the local Federal Reserve Bank. Surrounded by money in a high-security environment of surveillance cameras, checkpoints and employees subject to random searches, Bridget, while pushing a mop, becomes obsessed with getting her hands on some of the dough. 
 The lucre she craves is literally filthy. Every day carts of old bills are transported under lock and key to shredding machines. Since the money is going out of circulation, diverting some wouldn't really be theft, would it? That's how Bridget rationalizes her scheme, in which she enlists two handpicked co-conspirators to change the locks on the carts so they can grab some moola during its transit to the shredders. She airily calls it recycling. 
 Bridget initially decides to steal just enough to allow her family to get out of debt and not have to sell its fancy house. But just enough soon becomes more than enough, as she amasses a basement's worth of dirty money.
 Bridget and her partners -- Nina Brewster (Queen Latifah), a single mother raising two children, and Jackie Truman (Katie Holmes), a flibbertigibbet who lives in a trailer with her husband, Bob (Adam Rothenberg) -- are a demographically oddball threesome calculated to appeal equally to the Woody Allen, Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Springer crowds. 
 Having grabbed some loot without being caught, the women go wild and deliriously toss it into the air. As the movie invites you to share their delight, you may feel a tad unclean. Is wealth, ill-gotten or not, the answer to everything? Yes, yes, yes! proclaims the movie, directed by Callie Khouri from a screenplay adapted by Glenn Gers from the British television film ''Hot Money.''
 The attachment to the project of Ms. Khouri, whose screenwriting debut, ''Thelma and Louise,'' made her Hollywood's go-to gal for stories of empowered sisterhood, lends it a feminist credential. And because two of the film's women become their family's breadwinners, ''Mad Money'' is another fable of sisters doing it for themselves. Mr. Danson's stay-at-home husband becomes a reluctant collaborator who agrees to run a sham consulting business from the house as a cover story for their affluence. 
 The movie's weakest link is Ms. Holmes's underwritten Jackie, a one-note character who dances around the bank wearing headphones. While Bridget and Nina bond amiably (Nina is one of Ms. Latifah's meatier recent screen roles, which isn't saying much), Jackie registers as a ditsy afterthought. Nina is given a love interest in Barry (Roger Cross), a soft-hearted security guard who, spotting the signs of money stuffed under her shirt, remarks, ''Unless you have very hard, rectangular breasts, we need to talk.'' 
 The film's other feminist predecessor is ''9 to 5,'' another movie in which three smart women defy the system. But in ''Mad Money,'' Glover (Stephen Root), the stubbornly doltish bank manager who thwarts investigators by insisting his security is unbreachable, isn't half as pungent a villain as the evil sexist boss in ''9 to 5.''
 This movie is awkwardly structured. Beginning with a scene of the thieves frantically disposing of their stolen cash by fire and flushed toilet as the feds close in, it jumps back three years, then periodically leaps ahead to show snippets of the women under police interrogation. The confusion is a sign that ''Mad Money'' doesn't trust its audience to stay seated until the caper is underway. 
 ''Mad Money'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

HEADLINE: With Big Backlog of Homes, Builders and Buyers Wait

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
New-home construction fell again in December as builders scrambled to cut back in the face of rising inventories and fewer orders. The drop-off is likely to hurt businesses that serve the housing industry, which economists do not expect to bottom out until the middle of the year. 
 Groundbreakings remained at the lowest level in more than 16 years, and permits for new residential construction projects recorded their slowest month since the housing recession of the early 1990s, the Commerce Department said on Thursday.
 Housing starts fell 14 percent last month, to an annual rate of 1.006 million, seasonally adjusted. Residential construction dropped nearly 40 percent in 2007 as a whole.
 Permits for new buildings, a leading indicator of housing construction, dropped 34 percent last year. Permits slowed by 8 percent in December, to a 1.068 million annual rate.
 Builders have been plagued for months by a deep backlog of unsold homes, despite a steep decline in prices. Many potential buyers appear to be waiting for prices to fall further; others cannot obtain a mortgage because of the recent problems in the credit market.
 Economists said that builders would continue scaling back this year to wring out the current inventory overhang. 
 ''Builders are making precious little headway in clearing inventories, despite generous incentives and aggressive price cutting,'' wrote Richard Moody, chief economist at Mission Residential in Austin, Tex. ''We will see significantly slower single family building activity in 2008.''
 Apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings had recorded an uptick in November, as some builders hoped to take advantage of tighter lending standards that have kept some families from obtaining mortgages. But that trend appears to have tapered off: groundbreakings for multifamily homes fell more than 40 percent last month and permits declined after increasing in November.
 Also on Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits dropped by 21,000 last week. But the number of so-called continued claims -- those who are still on benefit rolls after having drawn an initial week of aid -- rose by 66,000 to 2.75 million in the week that ended Jan. 5, which was the latest week for which figures were available.
 The four-week moving average of new claims -- a more accurate gauge of labor market trends because it irons out volatility in the week-to-week figures -- fell for a third week, to 328,500, from 340,250 the week before.
 Adding to the gloomy economic news, a measure of manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia area unexpectedly fell to its lowest level since 2001. Manufacturing business significantly shrank this month, according to the Federal Reserve's Philadelphia index, which dropped to minus 20.9 from minus 1.6 in December. Negative readings indicate contraction.
 Production costs rose and orders fell for Philadelphia-area businesses. Payrolls also shrank, according to the Fed's survey.

HEADLINE: To Buy A Home, Be a Renter

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his new blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

DATELINE: The shape of the new American housing market 

 BODY:
-- the post-bubble market -- is starting to emerge. It is one that favors the young who never owned a house and the banks that have access to cheap deposits. It may be harshest on the two coasts, where both distress and a newfound lack of mobility may be on the increase.
 The ideal home buyer now -- in a reverse of what was true for years -- is a renter who is not burdened with a house. Such a buyer will need a down payment from somewhere, and he or she will need enough income to meet the monthly payments for the foreseeable future, including any increase in adjustable rates that seems probable. 
 But not owning a home, which may be hard to sell, is a big plus.
 A year ago, having a home that had appreciated in value meant that an owner could trade up to a more expensive home. Now it means that the homeowner cannot move until the old home is sold, and that is getting more difficult.
 First, the seller has to find a buyer who can get a mortgage. Second, the price has to be high enough to pay off the old mortgage and leave enough cash for the down payment on a new home. Both were taken for granted a year ago. In many markets, neither is a sure thing now.
 That has created a daisy chain of delays and cancellations that has frustrated builders, homeowners and real estate agents. 
 Selling one house depends on the buyer's selling another house, and that deal in turn depends on yet another sale, and so on and so on. 
 A failure to get a mortgage approved at any stop along the way can halt the sales of an entire series of homes.
 The loss of mobility stems from the fact that homeowners with houses worth less than they owe can find themselves unable to move to accept a job in a different city.
 That has been true when home prices have declined in the past. What is new this time, and could bring much greater pain and more selling pressure in many markets, is the existence of ''exploding mortgages,'' loans with monthly payments that will rise sharply within a year or two.
 Homeowners who can refinance such mortgages are doing so now, but others -- without enough income to qualify for a new mortgage or with a house not worth what is owed -- may be forced to sell if they cannot get concessions from their lenders.
 That threatens a downward spiral in prices, most likely in areas where prices rose the most and where unconventional mortgages were most often used. Broadly speaking, that means many areas on the East and West Coasts, plus once-hot areas like Arizona and Nevada.
 Just how bad it will be depends in part on how the banks fare. Those with money to lend will be able to charge more than they formerly did -- and thus get better profits. 
 That gives a leg up to banks that can finance themselves with low-cost deposits. Bank of America, in agreeing to acquire Countrywide Financial, purchased a mortgage distribution network that could no longer be financed as it had been. But the more home prices fall, the greater the risk that banks will have to write off more losses, resulting in steep drops in capital levels and even causing failures of financial institutions -- thus reducing the supply of available loans.
 That reduction of supply is particularly threatening to buyers of more expensive homes. Jumbo mortgages, those over $417,000, cannot be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that are still buying loans. There is legislation pending to raise that limit in some parts of the country, but it appears that many such loans were so risky that they cannot be refinanced. The only way prices got so high was that people who could not afford to buy those homes were given mortgages they could not hope to repay unless home prices kept rising.
 It is possible that we will see a negative spiral, in which lower prices reduce the availability of loans, and thus push prices lower. That, in turn, could leave more homeowners unable to refinance exploding mortgages, producing more forced sales that push prices even lower -- and further reduce bank capital.
 That would be the reverse of the cycle that prevailed until mid-2007, when easy credit made loans available even to those with dubious credit, driving up prices and, for a time, making it appear that there was little risk in mortgage lending.
 At some point, the pressure on the government to step in will be intense. Its efforts so far have been mixed. Tougher lending standards ordered by regulators may only increase defaults, but efforts to persuade banks to renegotiate loans may reduce the dislocation for some homeowners. 
 But barring a huge government program, the housing decline may be prolonged and bitter for nearly all involved. The worse it gets, the bigger the losses for financial institutions and the less able they may be to make the loans to turn things around.

HEADLINE: Their House To Yours, Via the Trash

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus @nytimes.com

 BODY:
By 9:15 most mornings, Thomas Germain, a ruddy-faced man in a yellow slicker, is pushing his oversize black wheeled suitcase down 12th Street in the direction of the Strand Bookstore on Broadway. Sometimes, the suitcase is stuffed full of books; sometimes the books fill a box or two or three that he balances carefully on top of it, a mass of swaying literature he rolls all the way from Greenwich Village or SoHo or Stuyvesant Town. 
 By 9:30, he's often sitting outside the Strand, waiting for the store to open, drinking a breakfast of Budweiser with his friend Brian Martin, who's pushed and pulled his own collection of books to the same destination in a large, teetering grocery cart. 
 The men are regulars at the Strand, book-scavenging semipros who help the city's best-known used-book store keep its shelves stocked. They have no overhead, no employees and no boss. They also have no home. What they have is experience, and a fitful sense of industry. 
 ''Perseverance,'' Mr. Germain said one recent Monday. ''Other people fail at this because they don't persevere.'' 
 For them, that means rising from their street-side slumber around 3 a.m. to start sifting through recycling bins outside people's homes or in front of buildings. (For the record, paperbacks are recyclable; the city requires the covers to be removed from hardcovers before they can be recycled, a request that for booklovers is tantamount to asking 10-year-old girls to rip Barbie's head off before discarding her in the trash.) 
 The two 50-ish men -- Tommy Books and Leprechaun , they call themselves -- are often the first people waiting on the Strand's bookselling line, a queue also populated by N.Y.U. students, genteel booklovers moving to smaller apartments, frugal cleaner-outers, and a fair number of down-and-out fellow book scavengers, many of whom live on the street. 
 Hundreds of men and a smaller number of women eke out a living scavenging books in Manhattan, according to Mitchell Duneier, author of ''Sidewalk,'' a book about the subculture of sidewalk book scavengers and vendors. Some of them sell their books on the street; others, the less entrepreneurial, or the more impatient, go for the surefire cash at the Strand. 
 When the store opened that Monday morning, Tommy Books and Leprechaun each in turn emptied their boxes onto the counter, where Neil Winokur, a Strand employee, quickly sorted them into two piles. An incomplete encyclopedia got rejected, as did Donna Tartt's ''Secret History.'' (Too many on the market.) An hour or two later, another scavenger scored a hit selling the store a supply of children's books, but had no luck with Newt Gingrich's ''Winning the Future'' (''No one buys him here,'' said Mr. Winokur). 
 Around lunchtime, Neil Harrison, another regular who's lived mostly on the street, showed up with a stash of leather-bound 19th-century books, their marbleized covers aswirl with greens and blues. He said that a building superintendent had allowed him to clear out a storage area used by a man who had died whose family did not want the books. Mr. Harrison didn't know the authors -- Thackeray, Gibbon -- but he knew enough to know that the books had value. 
 Sure enough, the books went straight to the third floor, where book preservationists would clean them up and eventually offer them for sale. ''Six hundred,'' Mr. Winokur told him (he thought the store could sell the Thackeray volumes for between $1,000 and $1,500). When he heard the number, Mr. Harrison crossed himself, then whooped. He peeled off a $20 to give a clerk as a tip; he left and came back five minutes later to hand Mr. Winokur $20, paying back some money he'd borrowed from the store the week before. 
 Is there any other industry in which such high-quality goods regularly make their way to consumers via a trash bin? Stand in the bookselling line at the Strand and the store starts to feel less like a dusty bastion of erudition and more like a messy, mulchy place where old ideas struggle to find new life.
 Even in better days than these for books, the economy of publishing was bloated, based on guesswork, mercurial taste and the talents of people whose keenest interests rarely included making money. Book recycling in Manhattan is just the opposite, a perfectly efficient system with no fat at all: So many discarded books go from someone's garbage to a scavenger to a bookseller and, often enough, land gently in someone else's home. Feel guilty, if you must, for never finishing Tony Judt's ''Postwar: A History of Europe since 1945''; but don't feel guilty for chucking it. It will most likely live to haunt someone else's bedside table. It will find a new home.
 Tommy Books and Leprechaun would like a new home themselves, they said. Also, a van.

HEADLINE: A January to Remember as a Dismal Start

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
While the chairman of the Federal Reserve told Congress on Thursday that a recession can be averted, Wall Street sent Washington a different message: it's already here.
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 306 points, capping a 14.2 percent slide from its all-time high in October. After 12 days of trading, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is off to its worst January on record. And the Russell 2000 index, which tracks small companies, sank into a bear market. 
 ''All the momentum is pointing down,'' said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird. ''There's no way to sugarcoat that.'' 
 Corrections of this magnitude have coincided with recessions in the past, though not always. In 1990, a steep sell-off presaged a downturn, while a similar drop in 1998 came and went with no apparent effect on the broader economy. 
 But the stock market isn't the only part of the financial world that is pointing to trouble. The Baltic Dry index, a shipping index that is considered a leading indicator on the health of the global economy, has plummeted. And investors have fled high-risk corporate bonds, which can default in times of trouble.
 And a troubling trend is emerging in the S.& P. 500. Shares of energy and materials companies, the top performers last year, have fallen to the bottom of the pack. Investors appear to be betting that those sectors will be hurt by a coming downturn, and are looking to get out.
 Indeed, losses accelerated throughout the day, with a flurry of selling in the final hour of trading. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange reached its highest level since the summer. 
 ''Selling causes more selling. People panic and want to cut their losses,'' said David Kovacs, a quantitative investment strategist at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa. ''Everyday now, you have more and more investors leaning toward the camp that yes, this is going to be a recession, and it could be a severe one.'' 
 Manufacturers, hit hard by the housing downturn, are facing new woes. The Fed said on Thursday that business at Philadelphia-area manufacturers, a bellwether for the industry, slowed significantly.
 A similar drop occurred in early 2001 -- just before the onset of the last recession. 
 The Fed report was the first of a steady drumbeat of poor economic news that sent the main stock indexes deep into the red. The S.& P. 500 tumbled 2.9 percent, below its low for last year, set in March. It closed down 39.95 points at 1,333.25. 
 The Dow industrials lost 306.95 points, or 2.5 percent, to 12,159.21, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 2 percent, to 2,346.90. 
 Hints from Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, that the central bank would lower interest rates at its meeting later this month left many investors unimpressed. In testimony before Congress on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke promised to support a government stimulus package to prop up the ailing economy.
 Some market watchers said the chairman was leaning on government support in lieu of aggressively cutting rates.
 ''The market is frustrated with Bernanke,'' Mr. Kovacs said. ''Bernanke said it would be nice to have an economic stimulus package to help him with his fight. You didn't see Greenspan asking for help.''
 Meanwhile, traders were reminded that the fallout from last year's subprime collapse continues to spread. Merrill Lynch, which ousted its chief executive after substantial losses from the troubled mortgage market, reported a $9.83 billion loss for the fourth quarter, the worst performance in company history. Its shares closed down 10 percent at $49.45.
 The news came on the back of similar write-downs at Citigroup, which was also hurt by bad bets on soured mortgage-backed securities. Investors are worried that Wall Street write-downs will make banks less willing to lend, a trend that would cut off a primary source of lifeblood for the economy.
 ''It's compounding investors' fears about how widespread the losses really are,'' said C. Hayes Miller, an analyst at Baring Asset Management in Boston.
 Investors also faced more bad news from the housing industry. Groundbreakings for new homes fell last month to their slowest pace in 16 years, the Labor Department said, and economists expect the market to soften well into the middle of this year.
 Some of the day's deepest losses came from two prominent bond guarantors. Shares of MBIA and Ambac Financial, which have big exposures to faltering mortgage securities, tumbled after credit ratings firms said they would re-examine the companies' financial health. Ambac, which on Wednesday announced a loss of $32.83 a share, fell 52 percent, or $6.73, to $6.24. Shares of MBIA dropped 31.2 percent, to $9.22.
 Crude oil slipped 71 cents, settling at $90.13 a barrel, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite from its price, ticked down slightly.
 Asian markets declined early Friday. The Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan slid 2.81 percent, to 13,395.78. The broader Topix plunged 2.53 percent, falling below 1,300 for the first time since September 2005. 
 In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index declined more than 3 percent.

HEADLINE: A Mining Town With a Bleak Past Starts to Blossom

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PREUSCH

 BODY:
DOUG GREENWELL and his wife, April, took a ski holiday to Jackson Hole, Wyo., five years ago with the idea of looking for a vacation home. She found it too cold. He found it too expensive.
 Besides Jackson, the Greenwells, who are from Richland, Wash., had been considering several other upscale ski areas in the West, including Bend, Ore., and Sun Valley, Idaho. None satisfied. But Mr. Greenwell had been following the environmental cleanup under way in the north Idaho town of Kellogg, a mining community at the center of one of the country's largest Superfund sites.
 With the cleanup nearly done, the Greenwells saw potential for the mountain town to grow into a resort community built around the Silver Mountain ski area. In 2003, they paid $42,000 for a 100-year-old miner's cabin a few blocks from the base of the gondola that carries skiers and snowboarders from the town to Silver Mountain's slopes. 
 ''Our thought was, 'Can we get something very affordable, enjoy it and see some appreciation,' '' Mr. Greenwell said. ''And it's worked out pretty well.'' 
 The couple are part of a wave of outdoors-oriented second-home buyers who are making over the once woebegone Silver Valley, which straddles Idaho's panhandle. Kellogg is reinventing itself, as buildings are being renovated and condos and lofts built. And those who have a second-home pioneer spirit are taking notice.
 Born in the 1880s silver boom, the valley's 14 communities -- with names like Smelterville and Silverton -- thrived for decades on the mineral wealth taken from the Bitterroot and Coeur d'Alene mountain ranges. Then in 1981 the Bunker Hill mine in Kellogg -- known to locals as Uncle Bunker -- closed. Some 2,100 jobs vanished. The population, which peaked at midcentury at more than 5,000, dropped below 3,000.
 Two decades of hardship followed, during which the Environmental Protection Agency declared a 21-square-mile chunk of the valley a federal Superfund site because of mining and smelting waste. The E.P.A. has spent about $440 million on the cleanup. Yards have been scraped of tainted soil and replanted with grass. 
 Now, million-dollar condos are rising above rickety miners' cottages on McKinley Avenue, the town's main street. Just two blocks from Gondola Village, though, there still stands a mountain of mining waste as big as a city block.
 The Scene
 Kellogg is bisected by Interstate 90, which winds through the narrow valley of the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River about an hour east of Spokane, Wash. Hills of pine, fir and tamarack rise to the north and south. Some of those hills are stubbly with young trees after being stripped bare for decades.
 South of the highway sits the historic city center, Uptown, and north of I-90 is Sunnyside, a newer area built on a former cedar swamp that is home to Dave Smith Motors, which bills itself as the largest Dodge dealer in the world.
 Legend holds that the town site was discovered after a jackass belonging to Noah Kellogg kicked over a hunk of galena ore, setting off a mining rush. A sign at the edge of town used to joke that the place was inhabited by the descendants of Mr. Kellogg's donkey.
 Residents are relaxed and jocular, with some wary and many hopeful, over the arrival of condo-buying Californians in their long-neglected rural region. Not that the changes are too dramatic. All-terrain vehicles can still be seen on the streets, and the local newspaper features full-page color ads for deer rifles.
 ''I wear jeans and Patagonia stuff, and sometimes I feel like I'm overdressed,'' said Patrick Ryan, a home designer and builder from central Washington who last year paid $254,000 for an 1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom rambler in a subdivision built for mining executives in the 1960s; it's just one block from the gondola.
 That gondola is important in practice and as a symbol, because Kellogg is relying on outdoor recreation to sustain its revival. Though Silver Mountain is a smallish ski area, with one high-speed quad, four smaller lifts and 1,600 acres of cleared terrain, it does get 300 inches of snow a year and has good tree skiing between its twin peaks, Kellogg (6,300 feet) and Wardner (6,200 feet).
 ''It's insane, dude,'' said Richard Grunburg, a snowboarder from Newport Beach, Calif., who bought a half-share in two condos at Gondola Village in 2004. ''When it's good, it's really good.''
 Pros
 In addition to the allure of Silver Mountain, there is also a nearby system of snowmobile trails that stretches across Idaho's panhandle and into western Montana. Mountain bikers ride the same slopes in summer, while conventional cyclists cruise through the valley on the paved 72-mile-long Trail of the Coeur d'Alenes.
 And should any outdoor adventures result in injury, there's the Shoshone Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital with emergency care, which moved into a new facility in Kellogg two years ago.
 Cons
 Night-life decisions in Kellogg are basic and limited. If you smoke, grab a drink at Dirty Ernie's. If you don't, try the Jackass Saloon, where city council campaigns can start over frosty mugs of microbrews. Most of Uptown Kellogg has yet to recover from the economic shock of the 1980s and 1990s, with several storefronts and historic buildings still boarded up.
 Then there are the poisonous metals. A century of mining in the Silver Valley dumped lead, zinc and cadmium into the soil and water in and around Kellogg, the E.P.A. says. But last year the agency and the mining companies cleaned up the last of contaminated residential and commercial land; 3,200 properties and streets have been cleaned. 
 The Real Estate Market
 The Silver Valley's second-home market started in earnest in March 2004, when the resort developer Jeld-Wen Communities of Klamath Falls, Ore., offered the first phase of condominiums at Gondola Village in Silver Mountain. 
 ''We basically had a muddy parking lot with some pink tape showing the outline of the buildings and a couple of Realtors saying, 'No, seriously, it's going to be really nice,' '' said Neal Scholey, sales manager for the Silver Mountain Corporation.
 Buyers were persuaded. The 68 planned studios and one-bedroom units, priced between the low $100,000s and low $400,000s and designed in the style of what the company calls eclectic mining architecture, sold out in four days in 2004. In 2005, 110 units sold in a day. The next year 99.
 The average price of homes sold in the Silver Valley has nearly tripled in the last five years, from $55,836 to $152,054, according to Multiple Listing Service statistics.
 Things have slowed a bit, though. So far, Silver Mountain Corporation has sold just over a third of the first 49 home sites for sale at its new golf course-centered Galena Ridge development west of town. Quarter-acre lots there are selling for between $169,000 and $309,000.
 Back in town buyers are still fixing up old cottages in the Uptown area or building ski chalets in the adjacent city of Wardner. But much of the development right now centers on condos or other multifamily developments, real estate agents say. The three-story red brick Lincoln School is being converted into 17 lofts with 14-foot-high ceilings. They range in price from $299,000 to $499,000, and are meant to attract young urban couples.
 ''The terms 'condos' and 'lofts,' you did not hear those terms here three years ago,'' said Roger Crigger, president of the Shoshone County Board of Realtors. ''In fact, most people didn't know what a loft was.''

 BODY:
A. A. BRONSON'S SCHOOL FOR YOUNG SHAMANS Some group shows, like this one organized by A. A. Bronson, feel atmospherically of a piece. Mr. Bronson is the surviving member of General Idea, a group of three artists and lovers who were together from 1969 to 1994. Since his partners, Jorge Zontal and Felix Partz, died of AIDS in the 1990s, Mr. Bronson has worked alone, but not really alone. As an artist, mentor of artists, healer and gay role model, he remains, in one way or another, a collaborator. That's what this rich show is about. 
 Photographs in the front room form a recap of Mr. Bronson's creative life so far, from nude self-portraits made in 1969, to a General Idea poster, to a 2001 portrait of his current partner, the architect Mark Jan Krayenhoff de Leur. (Above, ''Self Portrait, August 2, 2007.'') 
 And there's a recent collaboration with his former student Terence Koh, in the form of a double toilet, a kind of Porto-San for anonymous sex that is both sculptural and functional. Performance has been Mr. Bronson's primary medium since the 1990s, specifically as a self-described healer, a role that involves both playacting -- he's fully attuned to the ''sham'' in shaman -- and real laying on of hands. 
 The installation in Connelly's project room, the heart of the show, catches the ambiguous zaniness of the concept. In the center is a tent-shaped sorcerer's throne, assembled by Mr. Bronson and Scott Treleaven. Work by an earlier self-styled doctor-priest, Joseph Beuys, hangs on a wall, as does a homage to the American artist Robert Morris, whose role-playing with sexual identity influenced General Idea. 
 Then there are the younger artists who appear as Mr. Bronson's acolytes. The designer Item Idem contributes a shaman's cape made of gold Louis Vuitton bags and melted car tires, dedicated to Beuys. What look like tantric mandalas come from Michael Dudeck, and ritual instruments in the form of hammers and brooms are by the pseudonymous J. X. Williams. There are also several ritualistic videos, by the Guatemalan-born Naufus Ramirez-Figueroa, the anti-masculinist Danish artist Peter Brandt and the feminist queer performer Sands Murray-Wassink, formerly of Topeka, Kan., now of Amsterdam. 
 Christophe Chemin from Berlin levitates on film and draws attractively in ink. Desi Santiago's fluorescent pentagram adds to the necromantic flavor, as do Andrew Zealley's soundtrack and the layer of aromatic sage scattered across the floor of a show that is about mourning, magic and moving on.

 Museums
 FRICK COLLECTION: GABRIEL DE SAINT-AUBIN, through Jan. 27. One of 18th-century France's greatest draftsmen, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin drew all the time and everywhere he went. He usually worked small, and in many cases you need one of the magnifying glasses provided at the museum to fully appreciate the subtlety and detail. Nevertheless, he had tremendous range. Whether conjuring epic visions of Ancient Roman history or recording intimate views of domestic quietude, he produced works of nonstop graphic liveliness, extraordinary sensuousness and hypersensitive alertness to perceptual reality. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Ken Johnson)
 HISPANIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA: 'FRANCIS AL$(YUML$)S FABIOLA,' through April 6. The first of three collaborations between the Dia Foundation for the Arts and the Hispanic Society of America is an astutely site-specific display of 300 Fabiola paintings collected by the artist Francis Als, who is based in Mexico. Made by devout amateurs worldwide, all are based on a lost original from 1885 and show Fabiola, the fourth-century saint, in profile, wearing a vibrant red veil. North Building Galleries on Audubon Terrace, Broadway between 155th and 156th Streets, Washington Heights, (212) 926-2234, diaart.org.

 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF TIME: EUROPEAN CLOCKS AND WATCHES FROM THE COLLECTION,' through April 27. This enthralling, compact show presents about 90 European timepieces, ranging from pocket watches to grandfather clocks and dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries. There are traditional mantel clocks in wooden, peaked-roofed houses and extravagantly fanciful forms like one from 1579 that has a revolving globe engraved with star charts and figures of the zodiac held up on the wingtips of a flying horse, all beautifully fashioned in silver. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'FOCUS: ELLSWORTH KELLY,' through March 3. Few artists of the so-called Minimalist persuasion have made the principle of less is more seem as capacious as Mr. Kelly. His penchant for drawing inspiration from a complex interplay of lived experience, plane geometry and other art is confirmed by a large gallery devoted to more than two dozen paintings, reliefs and works on paper from the museum's collection (including several recent acquisitions). The combination of ''classic'' Kelly and new, less familiar arrivals is revelatory. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TELEVISION DELIVERS PEOPLE,' through Feb. 17. This show of single-channel video works, which takes its title from a 1973 piece by Richard Serra, tries to put in perspective the cultural changes wrought by the DVR, YouTube and, more recently, the writers' strike. It runs close to four hours (two and a half on a projection screen and another hour or so on a series of television monitors), and combines television-obsessed works from the 1970s, '80s and '90s with material from young artists like Ryan Trecartin and Kalup Linzy, for whom the ''idiot box'' is just one of many interactive screens. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'KARA WALKER: MY COMPLEMENT, MY ENEMY, MY OPPRESSOR, MY LOVE,' through Feb. 3. Kara Walker's exquisite, implacable, loose-cannon retrospective at the Whitney Museum is about race, whether in silhouette panoramas cut from black paper, in incendiary drawings or in narrative videos made with shadow puppets. They add up to one of the most important and stirring bodies of art produced by any American in the past 15 years. (See above.)

 Galleries: Uptown
 'THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SIMPLE' This beautiful show mixes works of reductive abstraction and of anti-orthodox insouciance by 19 artists. A pristine black-and-white diptych by Ellsworth Kelly faces off with a wooden chair by Tom Friedman that has been drilled with so many holes that it seems to be dissolving in space. Elsewhere there are a hassock-size cylinder of cast black glass by Roni Horn and a large, gnarly tree limb covered by gold glass beads by Liza Lou. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com, through Jan. 31. (Johnson)
 'ONE: TEN ARTISTS/TEN MATERIALS, IN MEMORIAM TO SOL LEWITT' A homage to Sol LeWitt organized by the sculptor Dove Bradshaw, this finely tuned show features Minimalist and Conceptualist works by Robert Barry, Marcia Hafif, Jene Highstein and seven others. A piece by Mr. LeWitt is included: a single, roughly horizontal line penciled across one wall according to instructions that read, ''A not straight line from the left side to the right, drawn at a convenient height.'' Bjorn Ressle, 16 East 79th Street, (212) 744-2266, ressleart.com, through Jan. 26. (Johnson) 
 'UNDOING THE ONGOING BASTARDIZATION OF ''THE MIGRATION OF THE NEGRO'' BY JACOB LAWRENCE' The 60 paintings making up the ''Migration'' series are now divided between two museums and, contrary to Lawrence's wishes, are usually presented only in fragmentary form. Triple Candie is showing the whole series in the Harlem neighborhood where Lawrence created it, a place that became predominantly African-American as a direct result of the migration itself. The catch is that the show is made up of reproductions. A problem? Conventional market wisdom says yes; the experience of seeing all of Lawrence's amazing images in sequence says no. Triple Candie, 461 West 126th Street, (212) 865-0783, triplecandie.org, through Jan. 20. (Cotter)

 ART & PROJECT BULLETINS: 1968-1989 Everyone who was anyone in Conceptual Art was given the run of at least one, and usually several, issues of Art & Project during the 21-year life of its publisher, the Amsterdam gallery of the same name. Each issue was only a single sheet of newsprint folded into four pages, but the format was perfect for photo-documentation, drawings and proposals, as well as for artworks that existed nowhere else. This exhibition of 132 of the 156 issues forms a fascinating line. Specific Object/David Platzker, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 242-6253, specificobject.com, through Jan. 25. (Smith) MASK The ubiquity of the mask, regardless of time, place or purpose, is the impetus behind this richly textured exhibition, which includes a global sampling dating back to pre-Columbian South America. Old and older tend to dominate, but while masks may not be what they once were in terms of physical ingenuity or conjuring, the motif remains both powerful and useful to living artists. Masks, after all, are us, as this show proves 75 times. James Cohan Gallery, 533 West 26th Street, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com, through Jan. 26. (Smith)
 Out of Town
 ALJIRA, A CENTER FOR CONTEMPORARY ART: '5 DAYS IN JULY: A VIDEO INSTALLATION,' 'BENDING THE GRID: REST IN PEACE' AND 'REBUILDING NEWARK,' through Feb. 23. The historical centerpiece here is ''5 Days in July,'' a video installation distilling the events of the catastrophic racial disturbances in Newark in 1967. It is complemented by ''Bending the Grid,'' Helen Stummer's tough, beautiful photographs of street memorials created in honor of young people who died violent deaths in the city in the past few years. As to the future, ''Rebuilding Newark'' offers a modest but heartening survey of community development organizations that have materialized over the past 40 years. There are a lot of them, and Aljira should be counted as one. 591 Broad Street, Newark, (973) 622-1600, aljira.org. (Cotter)
 Last Chance
 ASIA SOCIETY: 'ZHANG HUAN: ALTERED STATES' The Chinese artist Zhang Huan, the subject of this small, midcareer survey, is best known for the early, often poetic, sometimes sensationally masochistic performance work he did in the 1990s, which can only be seen in videos and photographs now. The objects in this show, which include giant fragments of Buddhist sculptures made from copper sheets and incense ash, are products of his new workshop-style studio in Shanghai. 725 Park Avenue,at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday.

 TOM BURR AND WALTER PFEIFFER With a transgressive sense of humor, the artists in this joint exhibition invite us to peek into closets of various kinds. In his installation, ''The Storage Project,'' Mr. Burr has filled the gallery with storage furniture made from cheap fiberboard. Closets and nightstands, in various states of assembly, hold a motley assortment of his own clothing. In Walter Pfeiffer's photographs, which date from the late 1970s to 2007, and include black-and-white and color shots, images of well-coiffed, pouty young men in leather jackets mingle with crisp, diaristic still lifes. Mr. Burr's worn-out wardrobes and Mr. Pfeiffer's alternately glam and grungy vignettes combine to form a personal space in a productive state of disarray. Swiss Institute, 495 Broadway, near Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 925-2035, swissinstitute.net; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)
 ALBERTO BURRI In the 1950s and '60s, when the Italian avant-gardist Burri (1915-1995) was an international star, his patchwork paintings made of grimy, abraded, ripped and stitched low-thread-count fabric were seen as radical rejections of conventional taste. Now examples in this beautiful six-decade overview seem exquisitely tasteful, and so do the paintings resembling fields of dried, cracked mud and the two-color compositions of hard-edged forms on lightly textured Celotex panels. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 'FACEOFF' Six artists offer very different takes on psychological portraiture. Luke Abiol renders sitters exotic; Justine Reyes makes them grotesque. Bayete Ross Smith suggests how malleable a photo ID can be. Diane Wah does a spoof on the ''Vagina Monologues.'' Christopher Clary turns portraiture into striptease, while Ivan Monforte turns it into a confessional. Rush Arts Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 311, Chelsea, (212) 691-9552, rushartsgallery.org; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)
 'THE HAND-DRAWN NEGATIVE' Made by scratching a soot-covered glass plate, placing it face down on light-sensitive paper and exposing it to the sun, the cliche-verre allowed mid-19th-century French painters to experiment with the photographic process without abandoning draftsmanship. A collection of 71 cliches- verre, amassed by the Parisian dealer Albert Bouasse-Lebel around 1911, is being exhibited in this country for the first time. It includes masterly examples by artists of the Barbizon School, like Corot and Daubigny, and should be required viewing for anyone interested in the current resurgence of cameraless photography. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)
 MORRIS LOUIS The stain paintings of Morris Louis usually look as if they were made about a minute ago. The six large canvases here represent about three of the different pouring techniques and compositional structures of Louis's brief maturity. (He died in 1962 at 49.) Even today, nearly 50 years after they were made, their freshness and immediacy are breathtaking. They represent a modernist pinnacle of economy: the almost magical, certainly joyful conversion of gesture, liquid color and canvas into abstract painting. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com; closes on Saturday (Smith). 
 PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART: 'ANTONIO MANCINI: 19TH-CENTURY ITALIAN MASTER' The first American museum survey of this little-known painter includes portraits, self-portraits and rather too seductive images of Neapolitan street urchins. The works date from 1868, when Mancini was a 16-year-old prodigy, to 1929, just before his death, when he rounded out a sketchy self-portrait with diaristic notions in bright red paint. His life was characterized by grinding poverty and mental instability, as well as considerable success. The paintings tend to be skirmishes of contradictory impulses: academic idealization, gritty realism, bravura society-portrait brushwork and even proto-kitsch. Altogether a fascinating plateful. Benjamin Franklin Parkway, at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org;closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 CHARLES RAY In his first New York exhibition in nearly 10 years, Mr. Ray defines himself more clearly as a sculptor's sculptor, parlaying his interests in scale, weight and illusion into meditations on sculpture's presence -- above all its stillness and its ability to mimic yet deny life. The works form a rich cat's cradle of intersecting meanings. One shows a boy playing with a toy car. Another is a greatly enlarged plastic toy -- in solid stainless steel. A third depicts a tiny chick breaking out of its egg, venturing into the world of space and objects. While consistent with everything that has preceded it, this show feels, similarly, like a brand-new place for Mr. Ray. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: In Tentative Deal, Directors Send Message

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
After months of informal talks, Hollywood's movie and television directors agreed Thursday afternoon to a new contract with production companies. The accord would appear to send a none-too-subtle message to striking screenwriters: This is not the time to get hung up on new media.
 The deal could also lead to a resolution of the writers' dispute that has crippled the entertainment business for almost 11 weeks, shutting down production of television comedies and dramas, forcing movie studios to postpone big-budget movies like ''The Da Vinci Code'' prequel, ''Angels and Demons,'' and throwing tens of thousands of people out of work. 
 But a quick end to the strike will most likely occur only if the writers, who walked out on Nov. 5, are willing to lower their own more aggressive demands, especially concerning compensation for the distribution of their work over the Internet, cellphones and other new-media devices. 
 Patric M. Verrone, president of the West Coast writers guild, said he planned to thoroughly review the directors' contract. 
 ''Ultimately, the membership will weigh in, too,'' said Mr. Verrone, who has been struggling to maintain the writers' solidarity. To dismiss the directors' settlement out of hand would risk an open rebellion in his ranks. 
 The preliminary, three-year deal between the Directors Guild of America, which represents about 13,500 directors and associated production workers, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers will take effect when the directors' existing deal expires on June 30. 
 The union said its bargainers would submit the deal to its board with a recommendation for approval on Jan. 26. If approved, a member vote would follow. 
 The agreement achieves a breakthrough for union members in several digital areas. It roughly doubles the residuals rate that was paid for decades when films and television programs were resold on cassettes or DVDs. 
 It also requires Hollywood studios and production companies -- for the first time -- to pay a reuse fee when advertising-supported programs are streamed free over the Internet, as many television networks do now on their Web sites. 
 The residual starts after a 17-day period to promote the program, and is pegged at about $600 an episode of a one-hour network prime-time drama, for 26 weeks. (In the first year of a new series, the promotional period is 24 days.) That is a rate considerably higher than was last offered to writers when their negotiations with companies fell apart in early December. 
 ''It's really an excellent deal,'' Gilbert Cates, who led the directors' negotiating committee, said in a telephone interview. 
 In a letter to members, Michael Apted, president of the directors guild, told members he and other leaders ''felt it was our responsibility to you and to our industry to act,'' referring to the damage caused by the extended writers' strike. 
 Over all, the agreement -- which also increases minimum compensation rates and other gains for the union -- was meant to reflect the directors' belief, bolstered by an independent study of industry economics, that digital media will provide a negligible amount of revenue during the life of the contract. 
 In the directors' opinion, digital media revenues will become significant only after 2010.
 The agreement between producers and directors came just six days after formal negotiations began. But negotiators on both sides for months had been laying groundwork for a deal. 
 Since the holidays, moreover, Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, and Peter Chernin, the president of News Corporation, had met with Mr. Cates, Jay Roth, and other guild leaders, in an attempt to clear away obstacles to a deal.
 The guild was particularly insistent on establishing its jurisdiction over all electronic entertainment from the companies, whether original or based on existing films and programs. 
 Some executives initially balked at establishing the relatively rich payout for electronic downloads. But they relented, on condition that these rates would not serve as a precedent for future negotiations.
 That breakthrough led to last Friday's announcement that talks would begin, and the deal that rapidly followed. The chief executives of the industry's eight largest entertainment conglomerates said in a statement on Thursday that they were willing to meet informally with leaders of the Writers Guild of America to find ways to jump-start those talks. 
 In a joint statement, leaders of the writers guilds and of the Screen Actors Guild, whose own contract expires June 30, stressed last week that the directors negotiate only for themselves. 
 Tensions within the writers guilds have escalated as Warner Brothers Television, CBS Paramount Network Television, Universal Media Studios, 20th Century Fox Television and other production companies began exercising a contractual right to terminate overall deals with some writers (like Barbara Hall of ''Joan of Arcadia'') as a result of the work stoppage. 
 The move, under so-called ''force majeure'' clauses in contracts, left dozens of writers wondering whether their lucrative arrangements would still be available once the strike ends. 
 On Monday, a group of prominent writers met with two members of the writers guild negotiating committee to discuss the ramifications of any deal by the directors. According to two people who were briefed on the meeting but requested anonymity to avoid conflict with guild leaders, the group stopped short of making an overt break with the union leaders.
 If some writers are looking to the directors for solutions, many nonetheless resent that their brethren have often set the agenda for other Hollywood unions' contracts. 
 The directors' agreement also highlights a deep philosophical cleft between David Young, a former organizer in unions representing garment workers and carpenters who is now executive director of the West Coast writers guild, and Mr. Roth, a longtime labor lawyer who is national executive director of the directors guild.
 Mr. Young has staked his regime, and the fortunes of his writers, on the notion that Hollywood workers must grasp their full share of income from emerging digital media now, or watch it escape their grasp forever. 
 Mr. Roth has concluded that the electronic pot of gold remains far in the future, and that the best approach for the moment is to establish his union's jurisdiction, without pressing heavy economic demands before the shape and potential of new delivery systems are clear.
 In reaching their agreement, directors' representatives were wary of locking companies into a heavy residuals schedule that might strangle new businesses before they take hold. While the percentage of income paid in residuals to any one union is relatively small, the overall burden rapidly increases as each union takes a similar cut. 
 Thus, 2.5 percent of revenue from new media paid to writers -- something they have demanded in their negotiations -- would most likely be multiplied 8 or 10 times by payouts to other unions. That would result in a residuals burden of as much as 25 percent, even before considering similar payments to stars and others who get big cuts of revenue under negotiated agreements.
 In one regard, the directors' industry agreement points toward possible trouble for all involved. When online media ultimately replace DVDs, something that might not happen until 2015 or so, consumers are expected to pay a much lower price for a film or program than the $15 or so that now flows to distributors for each title. 
 A reduction in packaging costs might offset some of the drop, but the entertainment industry may be looking at a significant decline in its revenues, rather than an electronic bonanza, the directors have reckoned.

HEADLINE: Europe's Social Safety Net, and America's

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman (''The Comeback Continent,'' column, Jan. 11) indicates that European countries have managed to combine growth with protection of the ''social safety net.'' Having just spent five months in the Benelux region of Europe, I would add that they have a sort of ''future safety net'' unlike anything found in America. 
 Their aggressive efforts to reduce waste and increase energy efficiency will give their economies an increasing advantage over ours. By enabling their citizens to travel without automobiles (their pedestrian, bike, bus and train access is vastly superior to ours), they are insuring against the devastating impact of rising fuel costs, which will cripple America's economy. 
 By supporting family farms and controlling sprawl, they are protecting the fertile lands that will be increasingly valuable as agricultural sustainability becomes more imperative. And all of these policies also raise the quality of life for their citizens.

 To the Editor:
 As an American expat in Europe, I am surprised to see that the social welfare debate has reopened in the United States. While it's true that Americans can and should learn from the experience of Europe and other parts of the world, Paul Krugman has been taking the wrong lessons from this decade's economic revival in Europe.
 What has underpinned its revival is an unmistakable shift toward markets, competition and flexible labor laws as well as a growing recognition that the forces of globalization must be harnessed rather than feared. 
 While European populations do remain wary of these concepts, the key reforms have been largely mandated by the European Union, which has used market principles as the foundation for European integration. European integration, in turn, has been the primary driver of Europe's economic revitalization. 
 Given the reality on the ground in Europe, it would be sad and ironic if American thought leaders started placing false hopes in the very same discredited economic policies that hampered Europe for decades just as their European counterparts have recognized their futility. 
 Harpriye A. Juneja London, Jan. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Paul Krugman calls Europe the ''comeback continent'' because of its resurging economy, yet repeats another stereotype -- Americans pay less in taxes than Europeans. The situation actually is more complex.
 For their taxes, Europeans receive many benefits for which most Americans must pay additional fees and payments out of pocket. Many Americans, if they have health care at all, are paying for escalating premiums and deductibles. Other Americans are saving $100,000 for each of their children's college education, yet European children attend for free or nearly free. 
 Millions of Americans are scraping to save the amount they will need for retirement beyond Social Security, but the European retirement system is much more generous. Many Americans pay extra for child care, or self-finance their own sick leave or parental leave after a birth, but Europeans receive all of these (and more) from their taxes. 
 When all these differences are added up, it turns out that many Americans are paying out as much as Europeans -- we just receive a lot less for our money. The ''overtaxed European'' is another stereotype used to scare Americans away from the European model, so it's unfortunate that Mr. Krugman reinforced that stereotype.

HEADLINE: G.M. Expects Improvement, but Says It Is Vulnerable to Industry's Woes

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said Thursday that it expected significantly improved operating earnings and cash flow in the next two to three years, but that high fuel prices and declining consumer confidence would be a drag on sales this year in the United States. 
 In a presentation to analysts, G.M. said that it planned to reduce its annual labor costs in the United States by about $5 billion by 2011, mainly through the labor agreement reached with the United Automobile Workers union last year.
 The new U.A.W. contract allows the automaker to shift hourly retiree health care liabilities to a union-run trust fund and hire workers at lower pay.
 G.M. said it expected to cut hourly and salaried pension and health care spending in the United States to an average of $1 billion a year beginning in 2010, down from $7 billion a year over the last 15 years.
 The company said it also aimed to reduce structural costs as a percentage of revenue beyond 2010, with a target of 23 percent by 2012. G.M. said structural costs were below 30 percent, compared with 34 percent in 2005.
 The chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said G.M. would face challenging head winds in 2008, including weak American auto industry sales, high fuel prices, high commodity and steel prices, and mounting regulatory requirements.
 ''This has been a turnaround so far without any tail wind from the industry,'' Mr. Wagoner told the analysts. ''Frankly the outlook for '08 is uncertain and a lot of people view it negatively.''
 G.M. expected industry sales to come in slightly above 16 million this year, while it projects global industry volume to grow to a record 73 million vehicles, up two million from 2007.
 Despite this year's projected weakness, G.M. said it ''sees the probability of a stronger U.S. industry in 2009 and beyond.''
 A return of American auto sales to historical trends in 2010 to about the 17 million mark, for example, would be worth $1 billion to $1.5 billion in additional pretax income, G.M. said.

HEADLINE: When Going Gets Tough, a Not-So-Tough Turns to Meth

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Crime does pay in the movies, at least for a while -- the outlaws in ''Bonnie and Clyde'' and ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'' have delightful rides until the authorities intervene. 
 ''Breaking Bad,'' a new seven-part series on AMC about a middle-aged chemistry teacher in Albuquerque who becomes a methamphetamine dealer, wants no part of that Hollywood formula. Walt White's decision to turn to crime -- part midlife crisis, part D.I.Y. estate planning -- almost instantly lands him neck-deep in a morass of trouble without his ever experiencing the slightest shiver of a thrill. 
 The series has a slight vein of black humor, but it is very, very dark: ''Thelma & Louise'' as seen by Dostoyevsky. 
 The gloom is understandable, of course. The economy and the political landscape today are weighed down with the steady lowering of middle-class expectations. The young know better than to assume that they will be better off than their parents; the old cling to the railing, fearful of falling beyond the reach of pensions and Social Security payments. 
 And crime is a particularly tempting fantasy. Be it the new movie ''Mad Money,'' in which Diane Keaton plays a bourgeois housewife forced to work as a janitor when her husband is laid off, or ''Breaking Bad,'' films and television increasingly tap into that sense of economic and social backsliding, finding humor and pathos in the white-collar world's undignified struggle for dignity. 
 It's the pacing that makes ''Breaking Bad'' more of a hard slog than a cautionary joy ride. It has good acting, particularly by Bryan Cranston (''Malcolm in the Middle''), who blends Walt's sad-sack passivity with glints of wry self-awareness. But the misadventures of Walt and his slacker sidekick, Jesse (Aaron Paul), are a picaresque comedy filmed at the speed of a tragic opera -- jokes, visual and verbal, are slowed down from 78 r.p.m. to 33 1/3 by an underlying earnestness, as if it were a foreign art film set in the American Southwest.
 This is the first series offered by AMC since its heady offering last summer, the hit ''Mad Men.'' And the network's next may well be much better. Television follows the same pattern as fiction and families: The second novel and the middle child almost never live up to the expectations stoked by the first.
 ''Breaking Bad,'' created by Vince Gilligan, a writer and executive producer of ''The X-Files,'' couldn't be more different from ''Mad Men,'' but it also lacks that series's originality and sparkle. This crime story is in many ways a bleaker male version of ''Weeds,'' Showtime's comedy about a widowed soccer mom who sells pot to keep up with the Joneses.
 Walt's slide into the crime lane is perhaps easier to understand. He has just turned 50; his wife, Skyler (Anna Gunn), is pregnant; their teenage son has cerebral palsy; and his teaching salary is so small that he works a second job in a car wash. Fate doesn't leave it at that: after collapsing at the car wash, Walt discovers that he has a fatal disease. ''Are you a smoker?'' the paramedic examining him in the ambulance asks. 
 ''No, never,'' Walt replies, almost indignantly. The paramedic remains silent.
 That Walt once held promise and high expectations is signaled early on. In the first episode he is already awake when his alarm clock rings at 5 a.m., and he dutifully rises and begins trudging on an indoor stepper, one of those cheap exercise gizmos sold on late-night cable, and stares into space. The camera travels to the wall in front of him and lingers on a framed certificate, an acknowledgment of his contribution to a Nobel Prize in chemistry. (Skyler, who writes short stories, has her own set of disappointments.) 
 Walt doesn't tell his wife or friends about his condition, possibly because he rarely gets a word in edgewise. His wife is kindly but briskly overbearing, checking to see if he took his echinacea and scolding him for buying fax paper at Staples with the wrong credit card. 
 And Walt's in-laws are the kind who would drive even a stronger man crazy. Skyler's sister, Marie, played deliciously by Betsy Brandt, is a narcissist and busybody, categories that should cancel each other out but rarely do, and Marie's husband, Hank (Dean Norris), is a swaggering D.E.A. agent who has vast reserves of self-regard and who inadvertently gives Walt his criminal start. 
 ''The Wire,'' on HBO, is the rare series that takes its criminals from the criminal class -- drug dealers are second- and third-generation felons with no connection to the outside world. Most shows prefer comic contrasts, the ''Trading Places'' conceit: a P.T.A. mom turns pot dealer on ''Weeds''; a New Jersey mobster is a suburban dad on ''The Sopranos.'' 
 The Whites are a middle-class couple trapped in a lower-middle-class struggle -- with creditors, health-insurance brokers, employers and the lifeless bedroom community they call home. They are upstanding citizens with outstanding debts, and when life deals them an insurmountable blow, Walt strikes back by joining the underworld.

HEADLINE: Planning Newark's Next Big Step: An Apartment Tower Near the Arts Center

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
An impressive cultural complex in the heart of this down-and-out city? They said it could not be done, but Lawrence P. Goldman, the man behind the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, proved them wrong. 
 Now, 10 years after he cut the ribbon on the $187 million arts center, Mr. Goldman, its president, is selling another dream: a shimmering tower opposite the arts center that would bring downtown Newark its first new residential construction in at least four decades. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Goldman and a Philadelphia developer announced plans for a $150 million mixed-use project that would include retail space, indoor parking and up to 300 market-rate rental apartments, 20 percent of them reserved for artists whose rents would be subsidized. 
 The developer, Dranoff Properties, a company with a reputation for breathing new life into low-end neighborhoods through high-end apartments, says the proposed building, 2 Center Street, would include a lap-swimming pool, wine storage, ''private dining salons'' and the kind of luxuries that might lure wealthy suburbanites into urban centers. 
 ''If you build it, they will come,'' said Carl E. Dranoff, the company's president, who recently converted a boarded-up RCA factory in Camden into a rental building with 340 apartments, almost all of which are spoken for, he says. ''This will not be some run-of-the-mill project,'' he said. ''It will be highly visible, and when you approach Newark, it will be a vivid icon on the skyline.''
 The project still needs bank financing and public subsidies to get started. Also on the drawing board are a hotel, a condominium residential building and a Venetian-style pedestrian plaza that would be built once 2 Center Street proved viable. 
 ''Newark is on the edge of a great leap forward,'' Mr. Goldman said, standing by a window of his office, which overlooks the twin parking lots he hopes will one day be replaced by brick-and-glass high-rises. ''It's going to happen. It's just a question of when.'' 
 But as a recession looms and the subprime crisis spreads, there are some who wonder whether 2 Center Street might have to wait awhile. 
 ''This is an extraordinarily risky time to be engaged in a housing venture,'' said James W. Hughes, a professor of planning and public policy at Rutgers University. ''While we don't know the housing slump's full depths, there is the potential for a major correction that could last several years.'' 
 He added, ''On the other hand, by the time a project like this is completed, the housing market could even out.'' 
 For the moment at least, downtown Newark continues to ride a wave of optimism generated by the election of Mayor Cory A. Booker in 2006, the opening of the Prudential Center arena last October and a series of deals that have injected vigor into what for generations was a moribund real estate market. 
 Arthur Stern, whose company, Cogswell Realty Group, took a leap of faith last year by turning a derelict Art Deco office building into 316 rental apartments, said young professionals continued to come to Newark, a 15-minute train ride from Midtown Manhattan, after finding New York, Jersey City and Hoboken too expensive. As long as New York's real estate market stays healthy, he and others said, Newark will hold its own. 
 ''There may be dark clouds on the horizon, but right now everyone remains completely bullish in Newark,'' said Mr. Stern, whose building, 1180 Raymond Boulevard, is two-thirds rented, and about 80 percent of the tenants are people who commute to New York. ''Everyone is still scrambling to get things built.''
 For Mr. Goldman, the fact that 12 big-name developers, all but one from out of state, expressed interest in the site shows how far the city has come since the lean years, decades really, when Newark was a no-go zone for real estate investment. 
 As vice president of Carnegie Hall in the 1980s, Mr. Goldman oversaw an ambitious restoration and expansion effort that was partly financed by a 60-story skyscraper built on a parking lot owned by the music hall. The building, Carnegie Hall Tower, still brings in $200,000 a year for the performance space. 
 When Mr. Goldman was charged with building the performance center in Newark in 1989, he persuaded the state to acquire 12 acres in and around the site to make sure the center could benefit from its own success. 
 Foam core panels that lean against a wall in Mr. Goldman's office offer hints of that vision: sketches of a thriving promenade along the Passaic River; mockups of a boathouse for the Rutgers crew; and a fanciful pedestrian bridge, inspired by the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, that would span the highway that now separates the arts center from the water. 
 As part of the deal announced on Thursday, Dranoff Properties will get a 65-year lease on the 1.2-acre site at the corner of Park Place and Center Street. In additional to a lump sum, which neither side would reveal, the developer will pay the arts center an annual rent, a portion of it based on revenue from the commercial and residential tenants. 
 City and state officials said they were prepared to pitch in with tax abatements and, if necessary, government-backed bonds. 
 ''We think this project is crucial because of its potential for sparking greater development,'' said Stefan Pryor, the deputy mayor for economic development.
 Mr. Dranoff hopes to break ground early next year, but said it was too early to talk about rents or exactly how affordable the so-called affordable units would be. Still, news that a fifth of the apartments would be set aside for working artists was pleasant news for the city's small but growing cadre of painters and sculptors. 
 At Newark Art Supply, a five-minute walk from the performing arts center, the owner, Ade Sedita, said the city's supply of inexpensive housing has been fast disappearing. ''Once a week, a newly arrived artist comes in asking about cheap housing, and I usually disappoint them,'' she said.
 Even if the 2 Center Street rents are subsidized, she and other artists wondered whether they would be manageable for the average artist subsisting on rice and beans. ''<0>'Affordable' sounds nice until you look at the cold, hard numbers,'' she said. 
 Ben Goldman, the director of City Without Walls, a local art gallery, said he, too, welcomed the project, but like any nonconformist, wondered whether local artists might become agents of their own demise. ''We've clearly become part of the strategy of using artists to turn areas into luxury enclaves,'' he said. ''I'm not saying this won't work to our benefit, but in the long run the odds are against us.''
