HEADLINE: Panoramic Hindsight On Wall St. Disaster

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
THE END OF WALL STREET
 By Roger Lowenstein 
 339 pages. The Penguin Press. $27.95. 
 Roger Lowenstein's account of endemic financial collapse is bookended by anecdotes about Robert L. Rodriguez, an unusually cautious fund manager. The prologue of ''The End of Wall Street'' describes a dream Mr. Rodriguez had in February 2006. He saw himself in a courtroom, being grilled about why his mutual fund had invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises that, he dreamed, were already bankrupt. 
 Why, the dream's lawyer asked him, had Mr. Rodriguez not read audited financial statements about Freddie and Fannie before investing in them? Was Mr. Rodriguez aware that neither Freddie nor Fannie even had such statements to produce? And did he know that both entities were now bankrupt? He awoke in a sweat, feeling both scared and prescient. In the waking world Freddie and Fannie were still solvent. But Mr. Rodriguez's firm, First Pacific Advisors, decided to jettison them from its mutual fund anyway. 
 At the conclusion of Mr. Lowenstein's book, after all the agonies of the financial meltdown have been analyzed and chronicled, it is late 2009. Mr. Rodriguez has decided to take time off from his business and do something different: drive a race car, at speeds of more than 150 miles per hour, around the American Le Mans Series racetrack in Monterey, Calif. Compared with weathering the shock waves of Wall Street's implosion, this is his idea of a relatively stress-free way to spend time.
 ''The End of Wall Street'' offers one expert reporter's domino theory about Wall Street's collapse. It is a complex but imaginative book, an especially useful piece of the jigsaw puzzle that current Wall Street books are busy creating. Even its title has a valuable double meaning. The Wall Street that gave Mr. Rodriguez his nightmare is effectively gone, but what will replace it? To the extent that the word ''end'' refers to a purpose as well as to a conclusion, this book tries to envision new, improved business models that may emerge.
 But first things first: Mr. Lowenstein, who has written other books about pension debts, the Great Bubble of 2000 and the cautionary disaster tale of Long-Term Capital Management, must also provide a blow-by-blow account of recent events. He is well suited to this sobering task as a former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and a current contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine. His is not a story of blowhard personalities, even if it is filled with C.E.O.'s and financial regulators who arguably control the future of global finance. Instead it is a coherently issue-oriented book that frames each stage of the crisis in terms of the real world's ability to confound theorists, number-crunching quants, economic historians and other putative experts, many of whom have seen their most cherished ideas destroyed by the events of the last few years. 
 This underlying seriousness does not mean that Mr. Lowenstein lacks an ear for the howlers that enliven this woefully unfunny comedy of errors. ''I do not want Fannie and Freddie to be just another bank,'' he quotes Representative Barney Frank as having said in 2003, about the two mortgage organizations dedicated to promoting home ownership for middle-class buyers. ''I do not want the same kind of focus on safety and soundness.'' He needn't have worried about such oversight. Within a year the rapid rise of the NINA loan (short for ''no income, no asset'') was ratcheting up the likelihood of future disaster.
 ''The End of Wall Street'' is not an exercise in caricature and hindsight. Mr. Lowenstein is too smart to blame the series of interrelated crises (in a book with chapters called ''Subprime,'' ''Lehman,'' ''Citi's Turn,'' ''The TARP,'' ''Reluctant Socialism'' and ''Great Recession'') on cliches. Yes, the chief executive of a major bank was somebody apt to be called back from a lavish vacation spot in order to hammer out a humiliating fire sale or emergency financing deals. And yes, that chief executive was badly out of touch with his employees' lives. (Virtually all of the major players in this story are men.) 
 But Mr. Lowenstein is less interested in garden-variety arrogance than in the business theories that led to such grievous, destructive miscalculations. He cares about the popular but insupportable idea that a cataclysm is unlikely to happen simply because it has not happened before. He cares about a world of newly interconnected financial systems that invalidates classic theories of causality and consequences. And he is able to identify the creative instruments of financial destruction with the directness that is all-important to a book like this. 
 So it takes him only a few sentences to domesticate the abstract idea of credit-default swaps. It takes only one splendid anecdote to illustrate why one senior Merrill Lynch executive, sent to evaluate the possible acquisition of a high-flying subprime mortgage firm in the spring of 2007, needed only two pieces of evidence to make his assessment. The first thing he did was ask to see the executive parking lot, taking note of the high Porsche-Maserati quotient. The second was to ask the company's three top executives what kept them awake at night. Their answer: Nothing. His conclusion: Kill this deal. 
 At the risk of drowning in the alphabet soup of the era's exotic and impenetrable new mortgage-based financial instruments, Mr. Lowenstein also explores the policies of the prominent public officials empowered to stanch the bleeding. He cites the reliance of Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, on econometrics and a willingness to overlook economic history (''He seemed allergic to anecdote'') and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.'s occasional inability to grasp the enormity of his requests to Congress. (''A federal safety net for the world's biggest mortgage market,'' Mr. Lowenstein writes. ''It had never been done.'') He describes the astonishing period in 2009 when Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner wound up conferring with the heads of either JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs or Citigroup an average of once every two days. 
 The proclivity of C.E.O.'s for misleading and falsely reassuring shareholders is also vividly recalled, in a book that works hard to combine insight with color. In a 2007 letter to Citigroup shareholders the chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, described taking a trip to China, where he taught a class on credit, and his wife helped paint a school. This precluded his chance to mention Citigroup's involvement in risky subprime mortgage instruments. An adjoining letter from Robert Rubin, then chairman of the executive committee, tossed off generalities about ''transformative change'' in the global economy and touted the economy's strength ''despite serious financial imbalances, geopolitical risks and multiple other issues.'' However, Mr. Lowenstein explains, ''Rubin did not burden his readers by enumerating what those 'issues' might be.'' It was not a secret he could keep forever.

HEADLINE: Fed Ends Its Purchasing Of Mortgage Securities

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's single largest intervention to prop up the American economy, its $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, came to a long-anticipated end on Wednesday.
 The program has been credited with holding mortgage interest rates at near-record lows and slowing the nationwide decline in home prices that threatened to send the economy into an extended slump.
 When the central bank announced the program two days before Thanksgiving 2008, the spread, or difference, between the rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage and a 10-year Treasury note exceeded 2.5 percentage points, or 250 basis points, nearly twice the typical spread. 
 Demand for mortgage bonds had been frozen since the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage-finance companies, in September 2008. ''We were in a deflationary spiral, causing mortgages to go underwater, more foreclosures and a further decline in housing prices,'' said Susan M. Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The potential maelstrom of destruction was out there, bringing down not only the housing market but the overall economy. That's what was stopped.''
 She called the Fed's mortgage purchases ''the single most important move to stabilize the economy and to prevent a debacle.'' 
 The program was initially for $500 billion. The purchases began in January 2009, and in March, the Fed raised the goal to $1.25 trillion. The purchases were to end by Dec. 31, but in September, the Fed said the purchases would taper off more slowly, ending on March 31.
 The purchases caused rates for 30-year mortgages, which exceeded 6 percent in late 2008, to fall to below 5 percent by March 2009. They are hovering slightly above 5 percent today. 
 Economists had feared that mortgage interest rates would climb sharply after the 15-month program, but those fears have abated in recent weeks. Fed policy makers have suggested that they would consider resuming the purchases if conditions warranted it, but only as a last resort.
 ''Financial markets have improved considerably over the last year, and I am hopeful that mortgages will remain highly affordable even after our purchases cease,'' Janet L. Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech on March 23. ''Any significant run-up in mortgage rates would create risks for a housing recovery.'' 
 Ms. Yellen is President Obama's choice to be the next vice chairwoman of the Fed, after Donald L. Kohn retires in June, but she has not been formally nominated.
 Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, said the private market for mortgage-backed securities had sufficiently recovered for the Fed program to end without a hiccup.
 ''Just as the Fed is stepping out, private investors appear to be stepping in,'' Mr. Yun said. ''As long as there are buyers on Wall Street for mortgages, it should have no impact on consumers. Having said that, it's possible that the mortgage rate could be higher later in the year, but that would be due to macroeconomic forces unrelated to the Fed purchase program.'' 
 A major factor in that recovery was the government's announcement last December that it would guarantee debts owed by and securities issued by Fannie and Freddie, according to David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. 
 While the future of the two mortgage-finance entities remains uncertain, the government backing has been particularly reassuring for foreign investors, including the Chinese and Japanese central banks, that hold securities based on mortgages originated in the United States, Mr. Crowe said.
 Another reason mortgage interest rates are not expected to rise sharply is that the supply of the securities has not increased substantially, said Michael Fratantoni, vice president for single-family research at the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 ''Home sales really are running at quite a slow pace, and we haven't seen much of a spring buying season yet, so there haven't been a lot of mortgages originated or securities issued,'' Mr. Fratantoni said. He projected that as the job market recovered, mortgage rates for 30-year mortgages would rise to 5.8 percent or so by the end of the year.
 For consumers, the biggest impact of the Fed purchases was to encourage mortgage refinancing, Mr. Fratantoni said. ''Although they did induce some additional sales, more importantly, the Fed enabled a lot of homeowners to have lower monthly payments,'' he said. 
 Brent W. Ambrose, professor of real estate in the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University, said the Fed had ''done a credible job of telegraphing what its intentions were,'' giving the markets ample time to prepare for the end of the program.

HEADLINE: Parking Lot Is a Battleground for a Bronx Hospital and a Doctors Union

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
To officials at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, replacing an overcrowded parking lot with a five-story parking garage would end the daily hassle of fighting for a space, benefiting staff members and visitors alike. 
 City officials agreed, deciding to use $19.8 million in federal stimulus money to pay for the garage's construction.
 But a doctors union has turned the nondescript parking lot into a battleground, arguing that the project should not qualify for stimulus money because it claims the project would eliminate 20 parking attendant jobs. 
 The union, the Committee of Interns and Residents, plans to file a lawsuit on Thursday in State Supreme Court in the Bronx to block the financing.
 Hospital officials say the suit is merely an effort by the union to cause trouble as part of a long-running campaign by the hospital's young doctors to join a national union, a move St. Barnabas has vigorously opposed.
 The union has been engaged in a contentious struggle. It has been attacking St. Barnabas for months on a number of fronts -- they point to outdated defibrillators, unsanitary clinics and too few nurses -- and leaders have seized on the garage project as another point. But this time, they are also taking aim at the city, arguing that it should not use federal money meant to create jobs on a project that the union says will do the opposite. 
 The lawsuit calls for St. Barnabas to hold another round of hearings with a revised cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the 26 jobs at the current parking lot.
 ''As a matter of public policy,'' the Committee of Interns and Residents says in a draft of the lawsuit, ''the City of New York should not give tax breaks to projects that eliminate permanent union jobs in the Bronx.'' 
 The garage would roughly triple the number of spaces to about 600, but would employ only about six people, hospital officials said. It would create roughly 80 temporary construction jobs.
 Matt Wing, a spokesman for Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, said the city should review whether the project created ''real economic opportunities for Bronx residents.'' 
 ''If the city finds out that this project is losing more jobs than it's creating,'' Mr. Wing added, ''then they simply don't deserve stimulus dollars.'' 
 St. Barnabas and city officials deny that jobs will be lost, pointing to a pledge from Central Parking, the company running the lot, that it would try to reassign the attendants to one of its other 400 lots in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 They maintain that the garage represents a much-needed improvement over an inefficient lot that can take more than an hour to exit and forces hospital employees and visitors to look for parking on the street. St. Barnabas dismisses the controversy as a distraction.
 ''Without question,'' said Steven Clark, a St. Barnabas spokesman, the doctors union ''has really been very bitter against the hospital and has made any attempt possible to create controversy. This is just the latest and the greatest of what has been going on.''
 St. Barnabas spends $500,000 a year operating the parking lot, money that could be better spent elsewhere, Mr. Clark said. The hospital will run the new parking lot through a new affiliated entity called Arthur Management Corporation, he said.
 The union dispute is pending before the National Labor Relations Board. The hospital argues that the 280 resident physicians can not unionize because they are still students, not employees.
 In the meantime, the young physicians and the union have gone on the offensive, sending postcards to thousands of Bronx households, placing negative advertisements in newspapers and in bus shelters, and creating a Web site collecting articles critical about the hospital's financial and medical performance.
 ''Resident physicians who work 80 hours a week and provide an awful lot of care should absolutely have a voice in how a hospital that's almost entirely publicly funded spends those scarce funds,'' said Justin Wood, research director for the Committee of Interns and Residents.
 The money for the garage would come from a pool of $120 million made up largely of tax-free bonds that the federal government allocated for the city to administer. The garage was one of six city projects to qualify for financing, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation.
 ''This allows a hospital in one of the poorest Congressional districts in the country to focus its resources on its central mission, which is to provide medical resources to the people of the community, not to employ parking attendants,'' Mr. Lombino said. ''Maintaining the status quo of a terribly inefficient and antiquated parking system is not a way to grow and retain jobs.''
 St. Barnabas, which dates to 1866, lies in the Fordham-Tremont section of the Bronx, a low-income community where medical needs can be great, but resources, and options, are few. 
 On a recent afternoon, parking attendants expressed little enthusiasm for the residents' fight on their behalf. 
 Central Parking ''has close to 500 parking lots, so finding a new job won't be a problem,'' said an employee, who declined to be identified for fear of jeopardizing his job prospects. ''It's not that much of a concern for us.''
 He said the parking lot was ''way beyond old-fashioned and inefficient.''
 ''Right now,'' he continued, ''the place is very packed and people have to look for parking outside -- that doesn't make any sense. They need to do something different.''

HEADLINE: Christie Survives His Dive Into Uncharted Political Waters. For Now.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In more normal times, you would think the new governor had gone out and promptly laid an egg. 
 How else to look at poll results released on Tuesday? They showed that after Gov. Christopher J. Christie of New Jersey gave his first budget address on March 16, the percentage of registered voters who disapproved of his job performance increased by 11 points and the percentage who approved dropped by 9.
 According to the Farleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll, his approval rating at the beginning of March stood at 52 percent, compared with 21 percent who disapproved. After the speech, the numbers were 43 percent approval and 32 percent disapproval. At the start of the month, 47 percent of voters said they had a favorable view of him and 25 percent unfavorable. After the speech, it was 38 percent favorable and 39 percent unfavorable. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. 
 But given the desperate financial times and the shock-and-awe content of the speech -- in which he called for the layoffs of 1,300 state workers, an $820 million cut in aid to public schools and nearly a half-billion dollars less in aid to towns and cities -- the real story was the part of Mr. Christie's glass that is more than half full. If a governor in New Jersey can pick a fight with schoolteachers and the police (he has said it's essential to hold down pay and benefits for both) and cut aid to schools across the state and not be run out of Trenton by liberals with pitchforks, we're really in uncharted waters. 
 ''The fact that his approval rating declined is not surprising,'' said Peter J. Wooley, a political science professor and director of the poll. ''The fact it didn't decline more steeply than it did is very surprising.'' 
 It is, of course, too early for poll results to be much more than a snapshot in time. Still, if the Republicans ever hope to be more than the Party of No, they should be paying careful attention to how Mr. Christie fares in his demolition derby in Jersey.
 In some ways, Mr. Christie is playing the only hand he has. He didn't get the vote of teachers' or public employees' unions. The only votes he can depend on come from his Republican base. He was elected on a promise to cut spending, and you can't do that without taking on public employees' unions. A state has to balance its budget, and the numbers are so bleak there's not much room for sleight of hand.
 On the other hand, few politicians have walked the walk with quite the gusto Mr. Christie has. Exhibit A has been his escalating battle with the powerful state teachers' union, the 204,000-member New Jersey Education Association. The governor has urged local public school employee unions to reopen their contracts and freeze salaries for a year, criticized the pay of the union's executive director and depicted the union as defenders of the unsustainable status quo. 
 ''I understand politics, and I understand Governor Christie's tactics,'' the union's president, Barbara Keshishian, said. ''If I were cutting funds from schools to provide tax cuts to the wealthy, I'd be looking for a distraction, too.''
 But it's not just a distraction. More than half of all union members work for the federal, state and local governments. Three times as many union members now work in the post office than in the auto industry. The steady jobs with good pensions and benefits disappearing from the private workplace remain largely unscathed in the public one. Ingrid W. Reed, director of the New Jersey Project at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers, said she was struck by how potent an issue this seemed during Gov. Jon S. Corzine's town hall meetings a few years back.
 ''You heard this all the time even before the economy tanked,'' she said. ''I can only imagine what it's like now -- the idea that it's just not fair that public employees don't feel the same pain they're feeling.''
 There's a fine line between being tough and being a bully. Even some Republicans worry that Mr. Christie is driving too fast against traffic in fighting with teachers, acting on his own to try to rescind Bergen County's blue laws to raise revenue and refusing to reinstate an income tax surcharge on households earning $400,000 and up. You could argue the goal should be as many good jobs, public and private, as possible, not a shared descent. But it's hard to argue that government in New Jersey isn't broken, which is why Mr. Christie will get a shot at fashioning a Republican model for hard times that goes beyond saying no. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 5, 2010

 CORRECTION:
The Our Towns column on Thursday, about a move by New Jersey's governor, Christopher J. Christie, to take on the state's police and teachers' unions in the face of a budget crisis, misspelled the surname of the director of a poll showing that Mr. Christie's approval rating declined after his first budget address. He is Peter J. Woolley, not Wooley.

HEADLINE: Militia Members Draw Distinctions Between Groups

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ADRIAN, Mich. -- The Stone family, and the fiercely militant Christian group that revolved around them at a ramshackle homestead outside of town here, were best known by their neighbors for their active use of guns and their increasingly heated talk about fighting back violently against the government.
 But their biggest and most surprising adversary was practically next door: the local branch of the Michigan Militia.
 From a distance, the two might seem like peas in a pod: both wear fatigues or camouflage, train in the woods with heavy weaponry and believe in threats to liberty from Washington.
 But here on the ground the distinctions were crucial. The Michigan Militia, which in past years had links to extremist groups with neo-Nazi flavorings, has moderated over the years, according to members and experts who track the organizations. Meanwhile, the Hutaree (pronounced Hu-TAR-ay), as the Stone group was called, was going the other direction, with increasing talk of violence. 
 The crucial moment of that tension came Saturday night when one of the Stone family members -- desperate and on the run from the law -- called the local militia commander, Matt Savino, and begged for help in getting guns or shelter. Mr. Savino offered neither, not only refusing to help but in fact calling the State Police, who passed the call to the F.B.I.
 ''This was a new situation for us, and we did what we thought was right,'' Mr. Savino said.
 Led by a former high school marching band member, nine people in the Hutaree group have been arrested in raids since Saturday, linked to what federal law enforcement officials said was a plot to kill a police officer and then foment violence at the ensuing funeral. Eight pleaded not guilty at a court hearing in Detroit on Wednesday. 
 The decision to help the police corner the Hutaree -- though Mr. Savino said he was not sure his tip made any difference -- has drawn flak from some other militia members in Michigan and around the country, but Mr. Savino remains comfortable with his call.
 ''Some people have said, 'Those are your brothers,' stuff like that,'' said Mr. Savino, 34, a former assistant manager at a GNC nutrition and health products store, who is currently unemployed. ''The problem is, most of those people aren't here, they don't know those people, and they don't know what that group is.''
 A spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Detroit, Sandra R. Berchtold, confirmed that agents spoke to Mr. Savino, but she declined to say what sort of information he provided.
 The context of Hutaree life in and around Adrian, where guns and resentment of federal authority is fairly common, is crucial to understanding the Hutaree and the Stones, many people in the area say. Yes, they shot guns, did skirmish exercises on their land and hosted regular monthly meetings of people in militaristic clothing, said one neighbor. But they also kept to themselves, and their talk was deemed by many people to be just that.
 ''We never thought they were dangerous,'' said Jane Ream, 68, who lives just up the road with her husband, Dick. ''And lots of people shoot guns -- that's normal around here so you don't pay any attention to it.''
 Several people who have known the Stones for years said they were unsure what, if anything, might have transformed angry rhetoric into what the indictment released on Monday by the Department of Justice on Monday called an active conspiracy against law enforcement.
 The retired principal at the school that David B. Stone Sr., 45, the patriarch and leader of the group, attended in this town of 21,000 people about 60 miles southwest of Detroit, remembered the young Mr. Stone as a child who ''stayed in the middle and didn't get noticed,'' or in trouble either. 
 The principal, Richard G. Butler, 79, who worked his whole career in Adrian schools, said Mr. Stone -- pictured in a yearbook in the early 1980s with short hair and a flamboyant vest -- loved motorcycle dirt bikes and played in the band all through high school, marching on the field and playing on stage as well.
 Squinting at an old yearbook on a recent evening here on his porch overlooking the woods, Mr. Butler could not remember what instrument Mr. Stone played, and the band picture did not help since the young man stood in the back. But never, he added, did Mr. Stone seem like a person headed for trouble.
 ''Whatever happened to him happened after high school,'' Mr. Butler said.
 The Michigan Militia also changed over the years, Mr. Savino and other militia members said, especially since the early 1990s, when the name became associated with an earlier wave of antigovernment angst after the election of President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, in 1992.
 Some militia groups in Michigan then had a strain of vehement anti-Semitism, in particular, that has mostly faded over the years as more radical members left, said Mark Potok, who tracks extremist groups at the Southern Poverty Law Center. People like Mr. Savino and his father, Jim Gulliksen, who is the local chapter's chief executive officer -- and like his son, a Navy veteran -- said they have worked since then to distinguish the group from its past. Estimates of statewide Michigan militia membership range from several hundred people to 500 or more.
 ''My goal is to get the militia name clean,'' said Mr. Gulliksen, 60, who works as a manager in the paint and hardware department at the local Wal-Mart.
 The strict Christian dogma espoused by the Hutaree does not fly as well these days either, at least in Adrian militia circles. Mr. Savino said that he converted to Islam in the late 1990s after a soul-searching separation from the Lutheran faith he had grown up with, and that he believed that he was the only Muslim in the militia.
 But people across the militia world, and people like Mr. Potok who study it, agree that anxiety within that world is rising -- from economic frustrations growing out of the recession, or fear of the Democratic Party leadership in Washington, or both -- and that small, outlier groups like the Hutaree are probably the ones to keep on eye on.
 One longtime friend of the Stones who also got a call for help last weekend from a Hutaree leader did say yes. 
 The friend, Robert C. M. Dudley, 80, said he met Mr. Stone 10 or 15 years ago at a weekly dinner for people to talk about ''what's wrong with the country.''
 When Mr. Stone's son Joshua knocked on Mr. Dudley's door on Saturday night, seeking help, Mr. Dudley said he let him and the group of people he was with sleep in their van. But he said he thought it wise not to ask too many questions. ''I figured it was none of my business,'' he said.
 Joshua Stone was ultimately tracked to the property and arrested on Monday.

HEADLINE: St. John's Picked West Coast Guy, Lavin, to Solve Big East Puzzle

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Just about every coach can break down film, but Steve Lavin takes it to a different level. Lavin, the new boss at St. John's, is married to an actress, Mary Ann Jarou, whose television roles include an appearance on ''The King of Queens.''
 After her husband was introduced at a news conference Wednesday in Taffner Field House in Jamaica, Queens, Jarou dished some Hollywood gossip. 
 ''A lot of people don't know this but Steve is quite the amazing film critic, he can break down a movie better than Siskel and Ebert,'' Jarou said. ''He'll say, 'The editing -- they could've done a better job,' or 'That scene was pretty powerful.' ''
 Jarou said Lavin's cinematic sensibility grew from his youth in San Francisco, when his parents took him to see everything from the Three Stooges to Charlie Chaplin. He is, indeed, a West Coast guy.
 Lavin last coached at U.C.L.A. in 2003, finishing a seven-year stint with a university-worst record of 10-19 (145-78 over all) before his career dissolved into a job with the cameras and microphones of ESPN.
 When asked which film actor Lavin most resembled, Jarou replied: ''Gene Kelly,'' a star perhaps best known for ''Singin' in the Rain.''
 But it will take more than a song-and-dance routine to make St. John's relevant again nationally or in the Big East or even in New York, where the basketball recession is extreme at Madison Square Garden.
 St. John's has not been to a Final Four since 1985 under Lou Carnesecca, who sat beaming on stage alongside Lavin, Athletic Director Chris Monasch and the college's president, the Rev. Donald J. Harrington.
 Lavin said he would talk basketball with Carnesecca over coffee. Another elder who might get a bigger role is Gene Keady, a retired longtime Purdue coach.
 Keady was Lavin's mentor, hiring Lavin as an assistant in 1988 at Purdue. Lavin said he planned to attend the Final Four and talk to Keady there about a staff position.
 If Keady accepts Lavin's offer, it would not technically be a full-time assistant position, Lavin said, but might involve sitting on the bench in games.
 That could help Lavin with game strategy, not always thought to be his strength at U.C.L.A.
 Another aspect of the job, recruiting, could be bolstered by the hiring of assistants familiar with high school and amateur leagues in New York and the Northeast.
 Although Lavin would not confirm any names, one often mentioned for such a role is Barry Rohrssen, the Manhattan coach whose recruiting helped elevate Pittsburgh when he was an assistant there.
 But Lavin said he also knew how to charm high school players. U.C.L.A. was a brand name and he attracted some top talent by recruiting nationally and internationally.
 To describe how he will negotiate New York gyms, Lavin used a television analogy. ''It's not as though I'm going to be Mr. Magoo, wandering around,'' he said. 
 Lavin looked and acted bi-coastally suave. His appearance and words were the sort that come from a man accustomed to being watched and heard, his hair combed and jelled in Pat Riley fashion.
 He described himself as ''the youngest of six children, clearly an Irish-Catholic family.'' As for not being a New Yorker, he noted that not every pope is Italian, a line that drew smiles in the audience at this Catholic university.
 At the very least, he proved he could mix metaphors with the best of them. ''As you can see, I've got a full plate,'' Lavin said. ''I look at it as the glass is half-full.''
 Lavin, who replaces Norm Roberts, was hired after a search that was at times awkward and included the public wooing of Billy Donovan of Florida and Paul Hewitt of Georgia Tech. 
 Lavin inherited a team that went 17-16 and could return five starters. Roberts, said Lavin, ''really stabilized things here; there's momentum here.''
 After the session ended, Lavin and Jarou were ready for their close-up, brought together for the benefit of photographers, a bouquet of red roses placed in her arms, no thorns apparent.
 She said she hoped to work in television or theater. He spoke of a different Midtown stage. ''New York City, Madison Square Garden, the Big East, the tradition,'' Lavin said. ''How do you beat that?''

HEADLINE: Why Go to the Salon If It Can Come to You?

BYLINE: By DANA SCHUSTER

 BODY:
IT'S been two years since Janna Levine has stepped into a salon. Her blowouts, cuts, highlights and even her Brazilian keratin frizz-reducing treatments are all done in the privacy of her Manhattan apartment. 
 She met her house call hairstylist, Gaetano Ruvio, at the Irene L. Salon on the Upper East Side where, at the time, he worked one or two days a week when he wasn't serving downtown clients at his full-time gig at the Miguel Lopez Salon and Spa in SoHo. Their memories differ a bit as to who asked whom first. Mr. Ruvio remembers being the one to suggest the arrangement; Ms. Levine thinks she initially broached the topic. Regardless, the negotiations were successful, and before long, cellphone numbers were exchanged, text messaging commenced and Mr. Ruvio started arriving at Ms. Levine's door with a backpack of supplies. 
 ''I'll go to my clients' homes anytime before 11 a.m. or after 8 at night,'' he said. When Mr. Ruvio is not at the salon or the gym, he's open for business (excluding Sundays). His accommodating schedule, not to mention the reduced prices he charges, don't go unappreciated. 
 ''When you're sitting and getting highlights in the salon for three hours, your life is on hold for three hours,'' said Ms. Levine, a real estate agent in New York. ''Not only am I saving money, but I am also in my apartment, so I can sit in front of my computer and shoot out e-mails. I don't need to take time off work.'' 
 It's not uncommon for hairdressers to make house calls for events like weddings or bar mitzvahs. But a seemingly underground contingency of individuals book their regular beauty appointments directly through their hairstylists, eyebrow groomers, bikini waxers and facialists, often unbeknownst to the technician's or stylist's employing salon. 
 Linda Wells, editor in chief of Allure magazine, has taken note of the phenomenon. House calls, she said, ''started as something that were more expensive. It was a celebrity preparing for the Oscars kind of thing.'' But these days, ''people are whispering to their stylists to come to their homes and a lot of the time it is less expensive,'' she said. ''The client is paying in cash and not paying overhead. It can be sneaky.'' 
 While Ms. Levine saves only a nominal amount on her weekly blowouts, she estimates she pays less than half the price for other treatments than she would in a salon (approximately $150 for highlights instead of $350). And then there is the time saved traveling to and from the salon, ''really the greatest luxury,'' she said. 
 Kevin Stamler, a law student at the University of Southern California, who also owns an event planning company and a promotions company, has an even more economical set-up with his hairstylist, Rian Heart, who works for Salon Sessions in Pasadena, Calif.
 Mr. Stamler met Ms. Heart at a nightclub in Los Angeles. ''She told me she's a hairstylist and said: 'I'll come to your house. I do it for people all the time.' '' 
 She even offered to cut his wavy locks free in exchange for the clients she foresaw Mr. Stamler sending her way, thanks to his business connections. 
 Ms. Heart usually charges $100 for a house call, the same price Salon Sessions charges for her haircuts. But the cost can vary.
 ''Say a girl is having a bachelorette party and she wants all her girlfriends to come over and get their hair done,'' Ms. Heart said. ''Most of the time, I'll do the organizer's hair for free if they get five or more people to come, because I've already made that money and some back.''
 It's no surprise that many people in the beauty industry are looking to make a side dollar or two. Marina Valmy de Haydu, director of the Christine Valmy International Schools, estimates that salons pay their employees around 40 to 60 percent commission on services rendered (excluding tips). 
 But there can be a lot of hands dipping into that pot. There is ''one person washing you, another massaging your head, another towel-drying your hair,'' said Nicolle Cannone, a Westchester-based owner of a line of baby clothing, who gets at-home sessions with a stylist. 
 After Mrs. Cannone's sister became friendly with a hairdresser at a pricey Manhattan hair salon (which Mrs. Cannone did not want named as to not jeopardize her stylist's full-time job), a deal was arranged for the stylist to come to Mrs. Cannone's home, where both sisters' hair is cut in the hallway at $60 a head (more than a 50 percent discount from the salon price).
 ''The average person doesn't really know that they can do these side deals,'' said Ying Chu, the beauty and health director at Marie Claire. 
 Ms. Chu and Ms. Wells seem wary of forgoing the salon for most procedures. They both noted that a salon offers amenities such as lighting, proper chairs and the opportunity to escape the distractions of the home or office, not to mention legal liability if something goes wrong. 
 ''On the upside, yes, they are coming to you,'' Ms. Wells said. ''But do you really want a bikini wax in your bedroom?'' 
 Still, Ms. Wells occasionally has her hair blown out at the office by River Lloyd of Serge Normant at John Frieda in downtown Manhattan. And once a month, an eyebrow specialist, Maribeth Madron, who works twice a week at the Pipino Salon at Spa Chakra on Fifth in Manhattan, comes to the Marie Claire offices to pluck and shape the brows of 10 to 15 employees. 
 While some salon owners interviewed stated that they would fire any employee who provided services to clients independently, Garren, the owner of Garren New York salon, says it all comes down to trust and respect.
 ''It's a topic where you sort of turn a blind eye,'' Garren said. ''As long as they're doing what they need to do us for us during the hours they're working for the Garren salon, I don't have a problem with it.''
 In Mr. Ruvio's case, the Miguel Lopez Salon and Spa understands that his house-call clients aren't taking away from business, as most of his personal clients are Upper East Side mothers who wouldn't make the trek downtown, Mr. Ruvio said.
 He had one warning for those considering home haircuts.
 ''It can get messy,'' Mr. Ruvio said, ''but fortunately they have housekeepers, so somebody is there to clean up after.''

HEADLINE: Britain Questions 'Too Big to Fail'

BYLINE: By PETER THAL LARSEN and RICHARD BEALES

 BODY:
Speeches by central bankers tend to be dry affairs. For this reason alone, remarks by Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England's executive director in charge of financial stability, deserve attention.
 In a discussion about bank size, he made reference to the limits of Facebook friendship and the structure of Al Qaeda. Rhetorical flourishes aside, Mr. Haldane delivered a serious message: regulators are thinking increasingly radical thoughts about tackling big banks.
 Mr. Haldane's thinking isn't confined to an ivory tower. The Bank of England will become directly responsible for regulating British lenders should the Conservative opposition win the general election. Moreover, Mr. Haldane has put forward some startling numbers. 
 Using credit ratings to help quantify the implicit support banks enjoy from the government, he estimates Britain's largest lenders benefited from an average taxpayer subsidy of $:55 billion a year ($82.87 billion) over the last three years. An alternative approach, looking at the relative financing costs of big and small banks, suggests the annual subsidy is worth $:30 billion.
 The detail is less important than the scope of the figures. None of the various bank taxes under discussion so far would come close: President Obama's proposed levy on bank liabilities, if applied to British banks, would raise less than $:4 billion a year. Yet removing the implicit subsidy provided by taxpayers is perhaps the biggest challenge regulators face.
 So far, policy makers have focused on new rules enabling them to wind down even large, systemically important financial institutions. To some extent, banks are helping by drawing up ''living wills.'' If this succeeds, creditors will have to price in the possibility of lenders being allowed to fail, and the implicit subsidy should disappear. Banks will face pressure from shareholders to justify their size. Some might even choose to break themselves up.
 But if that approach doesn't work, the other way to address the too-big-to-fail problem is to put explicit limits on the size of banks. Mr. Haldane was careful not to express a preference on how to address the issue. But the challenge to Britain's banks is clear. A bank tax may not be the only consequence of their role in the financial crisis.
 Disclosure, Not Bans
 Bill Lockyer, the California state treasurer, is asking big banks that underwrite the state's bonds to tell him about their role in the market for related credit insurance, or credit-default swaps. It's a fair question. And this kind of disclosure could be a better way to deal with concerns about credit-default swaps, rather than imposing a hasty and simplistic ban.
 Mr. Lockyer said in letters to six big banks that he had no preconceived notions about their role in markets for credit-default swaps. But some of his queries were clearly aimed at potential conflicts that have been widely aired in recent months.
 One is the extent to which underwriters of bonds may in other contexts effectively sell them short through derivatives markets -- an issue that has also been raised in the Greek debt crisis. Another is the possible negative impact of credit-default swaps on the cost and availability of debt for California, a worry shared by corporate borrowers.
 If banks cannot show that they use credit-default swaps only for legitimate purposes like hedging, Mr. Lockyer would have good reason to exclude them from lucrative underwriting roles in the future. If the institutions come across as self-serving, that would be telling. In any case, the banks would in effect set out parameters for behavior that Mr. Lockyer and others could hold them to.
 The approach makes more sense than calls for an outright ban on credit-default swaps or positions not hedged in these securities. It also makes sense for regulators to continue toughening collateral and capital requirements for derivatives, including credit-default swaps.
 Speculation and herd behavior in derivatives markets can add to price volatility in underlying markets, but these instruments have genuine value for hedging and other purposes. For instance, they can reward investors who doubt the optimism and spin of politicians, company managers and hired bankers.
 A ban or a severe restriction might make borrowers' lives easier, but that is not certain, nor is it necessarily an appropriate goal. But customers -- especially big ones like California -- should press banks for disclosure and commitments about good practice.

HEADLINE: American Airlines Teams Up With the City to Draw Tourism

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The competition for supremacy among major airlines at New York's airports is paying dividends for the city's campaign to attract more visitors.
 On Wednesday, American Airlines announced that it had formed an $8 million marketing partnership with the city's tourism agency, NYC & Company. 
 American will be the exclusive airline sponsor of the city's summer and fall tourism campaigns this year and next, and, in exchange, it will help promote New York across the country. The airline will also contribute $3.5 million toward NYC & Company's marketing budget, increasing it by about 15 percent.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been pushing for more visitors to the city, but the latest round of budget cuts reduced NYC & Company's allocation from City Hall. To offset that reduction, tourism officials have sought help from corporations seeking a higher profile in the city.
 ''We just have to become more self-sustaining,'' said George Fertitta, the chief executive of NYC & Company. ''We'd be doing this anyway, but it's even more important now.'' 
 Referring to the agency's corporate partners, he added, ''We're using a lot of their assets to drive people to New York.''
 Right now, airlines are among the most eager partners because the competitive situation at the city's airports is in flux. Delta Air Lines is seeking to expand its presence at La Guardia Airport by adding flights there in a swap with US Airways for slots at Ronald Reagan National Airport, in Washington. 
 Not wanting to be eclipsed by Delta, American Airlines said on Wednesday that it had struck a partnership with New York-based JetBlue Airways. JetBlue agreed to trade some of its slots at Kennedy International Airport for some of American's slots at Reagan Airport. American also agreed to allow JetBlue's passengers to connect to overseas flights on American with a single ticket.
 More important for New York officials, American and JetBlue agreed to encourage their passengers to stop over in the city for a night or more during their trips. Those additional overnight stays could significantly help the city's economy, Mr. Fertitta said.
 ''If we got another 100,000 people who happened to be coming through New York to stay over, that would mean probably $25 million in economic impact,'' Mr. Fertitta said.
 Mr. Bloomberg has set a goal of drawing 50 million tourists a year by 2012. The city was on pace to meet that goal before the number of visitors dropped off last year to 45.25 million, according to NYC & Company's estimates.

HEADLINE: Billions of Dollars Are Pledged for Haiti, but Skepticism Remains

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- An international effort to finance the reconstruction of Haiti attracted billions of dollars in pledges at a conference here on Wednesday, but the very size of the outpouring raised questions about whether the commitments would be met and how fast the financial support could help salve the needs of the Haitian people. 
 ''Now it comes down to implementation,'' said Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. ''We must make sure that Haiti gets the money it needs when it needs it.'' 
 The pledges, from 59 nations or international organizations, add up to nearly $5.3 billion over the next two years, and a total of $9.9 billion for three years or more, Mr. Ban said. It was unclear how much of that constituted new money and how much had been allocated before, but Haiti itself had sought initial pledges of $3.9 billion, and Mr. Ban set the target at $11.5 billion over the next decade. 
 The United States was among the largest single donors, with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton committing to $1.15 billion on top of the more than $900 million already spent. 
 ''Aid is important, but aid has never saved a country,'' Mrs. Clinton said, noting that the Haitians would have to do the work with the help of the international community. 
 Haitians remain skeptical because millions of dollars were pledged in the past for hurricane relief, but only a fraction was actually paid. 
 Donors said the scale of this disaster -- a magnitude-7 earthquake that flattened Port-au-Prince and surrounding areas on Jan. 12 -- was different. 
 ''All those others did not come after an earthquake, an earthquake that was a shocking and brutal event for the rest of the world,'' said Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, in an interview. Indeed, some of the smaller pledges came from far-flung countries like Mali, which said it would give $200,000, and Montenegro, which pledged $10,000. 
 Yet anger mounts among Haitians who hear about billions in aid while hundreds of thousands of them still struggle for earthquake relief. 
 Georges B. Sassine, a Haitian businessman with a delegation presenting its own reconstruction plan, said that his countrymen were waiting to hear that things were moving, that ''x, y and z are going to start now.'' It was a message echoed by members of the Haitian diaspora, nongovernmental organizations and others, a cross section of society allowed to address the gathering; even for a United Nations conference, it was a wide array.
 The money is supposed to be funneled into a multinational fund supervised by the World Bank, and then doled out through projects agreed to by an interim reconstruction commission consisting of Haitians and the largest donors. Former President Bill Clinton and the Haitian prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive, are to lead the commission. 
 Aid experts point to the lack of adequate shelter, a critical issue for safety and public health, as a sign that the sluggish aid response in some sectors must speed up, particularly as hurricane season approaches. 
 ''There is mud and dirt everywhere, and a plastic sheet and a tarp is not going to do it,'' said William G. O'Neill, a Haiti expert at the Social Science Research Council in New York and a periodic consultant for the United Nations mission. ''That just didn't sink in for some reason.'' Donors should have started shipping temporary houses months ago, he said. 
 The speed at which the world's attention can shift was underscored at a news conference by a sudden raft of questions about possible new Security Council negotiations over Iran sanctions. 
 Despairing the change in focus, Haiti's president, Rene Preval, cracked, ''Do I need to develop a nuclear program for Haiti so that we come back to talking about Haiti?''

HEADLINE: China, Concubines and Google

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Some 2,400 years ago, a Chinese king invited a legendary military strategist named Sun Tzu to give a demonstration in military training -- using women from the palace.
 Sun Tzu agreed, organizing 180 of the king's beautiful young women into two companies. He made the king's two favorite concubines officers in charge, and explained the principles of marching.
 The women treated this as an uproarious joke. An ancient account explains that when Sun Tzu beat the drum to signal ''right turn!'' ''the girls only burst out laughing.'' 
 So Sun Tzu patiently repeated the instructions and beat the drum to signal ''left turn!'' Again, the women simply burst into laughter. So Sun Tzu seized the two favorite concubines, accused them of failing to maintain discipline -- and beheaded them. Now the other terrified women followed orders perfectly.
 That's the kind of historical tale that members of China's Politburo absorbed while growing up -- and reflect today. In battles over Google and the currency exchange rate, they model the hardheaded Sun Tzu, accepting that making omelets will require breaking eggs.
 So look out.
 One of the most important diplomatic relationships in the world is between China and the U.S., and it is deteriorating sharply. What's more, many experts believe it will get considerably worse over the coming year -- and one reason may be that China's leaders seem to feel as if they have their backs to the wall.
 We tend to think of China as an invincible force rising up to challenge the West, but today's disputes -- and a corresponding domestic crackdown -- seem to reflect the leadership's sense of vulnerability. From abroad, we are awed by an economy that sometimes soars at nearly 10 percent a year. At home, the leaders appear to worry about a fragile society and the risk that a rise in unemployment could lead to vast social upheaval.
 That's one of the reasons China is adamantly refusing to let the renminbi rise further. There's no question that China's undervalued currency irresponsibly creates global imbalances -- but if you're in the Zhongnanhai leadership compound, your concern is just staying in power.
 Likewise, I'd bet that it is the government's sense of insecurity -- not strength -- that has the leadership fulminating about Google. When the Chinese government jostled with Google, young Chinese didn't leave flowers at Zhongnanhai to show support. Rather, they left flowers and supportive notes at Google's headquarters in Beijing. 
 ''Patriotic education'' and carefully nurtured nationalism mean that in many disputes between China and the West, the Chinese people and the Chinese government stand together. We in the West see human rights in Tibet as a moral imperative and a rising renminbi as an economic imperative; Chinese citizens and leaders alike see these issues as part of a 200-year-long string of Western imperialist efforts to bully or dismember a fragile China. 
 But the Internet is different. The Politburo doesn't want a free Internet, and the people do. 
 Mostly, I think we exaggerate the disaffection of Chinese toward their government. Most Chinese citizens aren't very political and aren't deeply upset by the lack of a ballot -- as long as living standards continue to improve. And many Chinese prefer a local search engine, Baidu, to Google. 
 Still, ordinary Chinese are profoundly irritated by corruption, nepotism, lies, official arrogance -- and hassles when they try to use the Internet.
 The United States government has been reluctant to support financing for the proxy servers that enable Chinese or Iranians to leap firewalls. That's because the most effective software to evade censorship was devised by Falun Gong, a religious group that is despised by the Chinese government. The fear is that China would be outraged. But we shouldn't let that dissuade us, for we have a powerful interest in chipping away at firewalls that protect dictatorships. 
 The mood among young Chinese reminds me of Taiwan or South Korea or Indonesia in the 1980s, when an increasingly educated middle class -- beneficiaries of enlightened economic policies of oppressive governments -- grew to feel stifled and patronized by their governments. Eventually, in each case they upended one-party rule and achieved a democracy.
 Chinese leaders surely fear that parallel, and that is likely to be one of the reasons they are cracking down frantically on dissent. But again, all this may be a sign of weakness, not strength. 
 The Communist Party's greatest success is the extraordinary economic changes it has ushered in over the last three decades with visionary policies and impressive governance. Its greatest failing is its refusal to adjust politically to accommodate the middle class that it created. And its greatest vulnerability is the way it increasingly neither inspires people nor terrifies them, but rather simply annoys them.

HEADLINE: Business Jets, an Economic Indicator?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE LEDER

 BODY:
THE image of the Big Three auto executives flying in their corporate jets to Washington in November 2008 to ask for billions in federal bailout money may still be fresh in most people's minds, but the fact is that business jet use has been falling sharply -- by double digits -- for the last two years. 
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, which tracks business jet use, the number of flight operations peaked at 4.8 million in 2007, then fell by 11 percent in 2008 and 19 percent more in 2009, to 3.4 million flights. (In February 2009 alone, business flight operations fell by more than 30 percent.)
But now, business jet use may be on the way back, helped by a recovering economy and increased sales overseas.
In both December and January, business flight operations increased, compared with a year ago, according to the F.A.A.
Doug Oliver, a spokesman for Cessna, which is based in Wichita, Kan., and is known for its Citation business jets, said that while Cessna did not expect orders to pick up until 2011, he was seeing a few positive signs in an industry known for its cyclical nature. Some of that growth is coming from overseas, including India and Brazil.
''The downturn just whacked us and everyone else,'' said Mr. Oliver. ''But there are pockets here and there that are promising, and cancellations have slowed.''
Cessna, a unit of Textron, employs about half as many people as it did two years ago. Last year, the company had planned to deliver 535 business jets to customers, but so many orders were canceled that it wound up producing only 289 planes. This year, that number is expected to fall even more -- to 225 planes, according to Mr. Oliver.
Things were so bad that Terrance P. Kelley, the chief executive of Gold Jets, a business aviation consulting firm based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., described the industry as being in a virtual free fall, similar to the residential real estate market in South Florida.
Mr. Kelley said many companies began sharply limiting use of their corporate jets in late 2008 and into 2009, and some sold their planes after the drubbing the auto executives took from Congress. Large banks, including several that have received billions in bailout funds, have come under increased scrutiny for allowing executives -- and former executives -- to use the corporate jet as a taxi service.
Earlier this year, for example, Bank of America declined to renew an agreement with Charles K. Gifford, a director and its former chairman, that provided him with 120 hours of corporate jet use for each of the last five years. In 2009, that perk cost the bank $956,007, plus $293,004 more to cover the taxes that Mr. Gifford would have owed on that perk.
''Most companies that I talk to see a repeat of 2009 and no real recovery until the second half of 2011,'' said Mr. Kelley of Gold Jets. ''While they had been more optimistic in late 2009, most have come to the realization that this will be a long and slow recovery.''

HEADLINE: The Real Census

DATELINE: The Census Bureau 

 BODY:
the real Census Bureau -- reports the good news that 50 percent of American households have mailed in their decennial head-count forms so far. There's no word on the ersatz ''census'' forms mailed out this year by the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee as a fund-raising gambit. 
 ''Do Not Destroy'' and ''Official Document'' emblazoned the envelope. Inside, many of the fake census questions seemed intended to reinforce respondents' conservative views -- ''Do you believe the huge, costly Democrat-passed stimulus bill has been effective in creating jobs or stimulating America's economy?'' -- before putting the bite on them. 
 In a show of good sense, both houses of Congress, Republican majorities included, have decided that there ought to be a law against such deceptive mailings. The bill sent last week to President Obama will require any mailing marked ''census'' to show the sender's true name and address and have a prominent disclaimer that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Census Bureau. 
 Violators will face penalties and find their mail undelivered. Considerable embarrassment was the only price the R.N.C. paid under the existing, insufficient law. 
 Lawmakers were properly concerned that mailings of fraudulent pitches stamped ''census'' would lead people to toss out the real thing and not fulfill their constitutional duty. If responses are low, the Census Bureau has to spend more time -- and money -- sending out census-takers to those who missed or ignored the mailed form. 
 Meanwhile, antigovernment activists propose a boycott of the census as Big Government nosiness. This would be illegal, and it is bad news for states and citizens since an undercount means they could lose out on deserved federal aid dollars or political representation. 
 Even that logic isn't stopping Representative Michele Bachmann, a Republican of Minnesota. She has been urging a boycott except for the house-count question. Her local newspaper reports that if enough people boycott, the state could lose a Congressional seat in redistricting. So far, 60 percent of Minnesotans have mailed back their forms, faster than the national average.

HEADLINE: Views on Reform, Then and Now

BYLINE: By CYRUS SANATI

 BODY:
TWO and a half years have passed since the credit crisis upset the markets, leading to the collapse of several major investment firms.
By the fall of 2008, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans were calling for financial reform. What had once been considered radical, requiring hedge funds to register with government regulators, for example, was now described as necessary. Financial reform was to be carried out quickly to restore confidence in the markets.
But something changed in the summer of 2009. The market started to come back from its lows, and health care dominated the agenda. Intense lobbying on behalf of Wall Street caused some legislators who had called for quick action to argue for more time to evaluate the crisis. While reform was still seen as necessary, what was viewed as logical earlier in the year was now seen as draconian government meddling. 
By fall, hopes of a bipartisan compromise in the House had broken down. Some Republicans were concerned that all the new regulation would stunt the nascent economic recovery.
That is not to say no steps have been taken toward passing a bill. But the versions that have passed in the House and the one being debated in the Senate contain provisions that are shadows of some of the strong changes that were first proposed. Debate in the Senate is expected to dominate the legislative calendar through summer.
''Clearly what has happened over the last 18 months, Congress needs to look at the regulatory structure,'' June 21, 2009.
''If the Senate is able to produce a bill, I think it's just as likely that we'll be talking about the same issue a year from now as we are right now,'' March 17, 2010.
Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio
''We've seen deregulation sweep over America in a way that has simply devastated our economy. Given this reality, business as usual is not acceptable. Fundamental financial market oversight reform must pass,'' Nov. 18, 2009.
''I don't believe in overreaching or regulation for regulation's sake. We must be surgical in how we regulate,'' March 24, 2010.
Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas
''I look forward to working with Secretary Geithner, the administration and my colleagues in Congress to quickly and responsibly address our economic challenges,'' Jan. 26, 2009.
''There is no need for Chairman Dodd to push this reform process up against an artificial deadline,'' March 15, 2010.
Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire
''We agree that the Federal Reserve should have a limited range of responsibilities and that its main focus should be on conducting monetary policy,'' Nov. 19, 2009.
''The Fed, the F.D.I.C., comptroller and so forth, should have some kind of coordination or say-so in dealing with consumer products,'' March 18, 2010.
Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama
''We'll have it done this year,'' referring to full passage of a financial regulation bill, June 17, 2009.
''I'm more interested in getting this right than getting it at a certain date,'' March 11, 2010.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut
When President Obama ''talks about financial services regulatory modernization, I think what he said is something that I'm very energized about being involved in,'' Feb. 24, 2009.
''We can't overreact right now, we have got to right the ship.'' ''We have got to make sure that we empower investors to go about their normal calculation of risk,'' Dec. 17, 2009.
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, Republican whip

HEADLINE: Washington's Scrap Dealers

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
JOE JIAMPIETRO and Jim Wigand are two of the busiest deal-makers around, calling on financial titans like Wilbur Ross and John Paulson, and orchestrating some of the biggest and most complex transactions in banking.
Their pay? Each earned less than $260,000 last year. Their employer? The United States government.
From their perch at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the two senior officials are responsible for sorting through the carnage of the financial crisis and finding buyers for the deposits, branches and loans of more than 200 failed banks.
Between them, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro have sold more than $508 billion in assets over the last two years, from financial giants like Washington Mutual and Corus Bankshares to little-noticed community lenders. They have reeled in new investors with innovative transactions. One October night, they announced they had found a buyer for nine failed banks. 
''Just take a look at the deal tables,'' Mr. Jiampietro boasted, half-jokingly. ''We would have 100 percent market share.''
By several measures, Mr. Jiampietro and Mr. Wigand seem to have performed well for the government -- although it could take years to see how their transactions work out. They have done this by acting like bankers, not bureaucrats, in negotiating deals meant to protect the savings of depositors and get the financial system back on its feet.
''You don't want inexperienced rookies in there up against the professionals on the other side,'' said one senior federal official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named because he regularly interacts with banks.
Wall Street does not mistake them for amateurs, either, although some of their deals have caused investors to grumble. Bond investors have lashed out at the structure of the Washington Mutual deal, which penalized them but protected the F.D.I.C.'s insurance fund from a potentially devastating loss. Some federal watchdogs say the government has offered too many sweetheart terms to potential buyers. And some private equity firms complained that the agency's rules limited their ability to compete in auctions with traditional bank bidders.
One thing is not in doubt: Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are likely to stay busy for some time. Hundreds of small and midsize banks are expected to collapse in the coming years, putting enormous pressure on the F.D.I.C. deal team to find buyers or investors.
Most people do not think of marathon deal-making as typical government work. But Mr. Wigand, 53, and Mr. Jiampietro, 44, aren't your typical government employees.
Mr. Wigand, a career civil servant with a technocratic bent befitting the son of a NASA engineer, has worked on failed bank transactions for more than two decades. He helped write the F.D.I.C. field manual on such deals, based on his experience selling assets during the savings and loan crisis. Now, as the agency's deputy director for bank resolutions, Mr. Wigand is applying those lessons to today's environment.
Mr. Jiampietro, an investment banker and a lawyer, has drawn on previous experience in Washington and on Wall Street in his role as a top adviser to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair. A former aide to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Jiampietro spent more than a decade advising financial firms on mergers and other complex transactions. (He has also kept a toe in politics, donating money to the Obama campaign and to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a childhood friend.) To join the F.D.I.C., in March 2009, he took himself out of consideration for a senior Treasury Department post.
Together, from a government building just blocks from the White House, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro work with a core group of a dozen senior managers and sometimes as many as 200 federal employees, whom they are quick to credit for any success. They also rely on a coterie of outside firms, including Perella Weinberg Partners and others, that help them value and manage the assets of failed banks.
But they approach the job as if they were co-heads of the government's own financial institutions group. They eschew Washington's alphabet-soup acronyms in favor of jargon like ''doughnut structures,'' ''true-ups'' and ''equity kickers.'' And like their Wall Street colleagues, they shroud their deal-making plans under the cover of code names. (The sale of Washington Mutual was known as Project Orca, while the one for BankUnited of Florida was called Project Beach.)
Mr. Wigand specializes in structuring transactions and overseeing the deal team's daily operations. Mr. Jiampietro serves as the F.D.I.C.'s eyes and ears in the markets, and advises on the biggest and most complex deals. He regularly meets with bank executives, hedge fund managers and other big investors to get their feedback on deal terms and other agency policies.
Advisers who sit on the other side of the negotiating table say the two are open-minded, pragmatic and tough.
''They listen; they probe,'' said H. Rodgin Cohen, a top bank lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. ''They will try to spend the time to think through ideas that you have.''
Of course, there are differences between deal-making in the private and public sectors. Most investment bankers spend years courting clients to win advisory work. F.D.I.C. officials do not have to solicit new business: their assignments arise as regulators prepare a takeover of a troubled bank. They are only sellers -- with a mandate to minimize losses. (''The business comes to us,'' Mr. Wigand noted.)
And even though Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are among the country's highest-paid government officials, they each earn less annually than Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, makes in a week.
The government deal-makers also play by stricter rules. For example, they must offer the same terms to all prospective bidders, while their colleagues in the private sector can fine-tune a deal to satisfy a specific buyer. By law, they must choose the offer that is ''least costly'' to the F.D.I.C. fund. And forget about private jets, commemorative deal toys or lavish closing dinners.
''Wall Street is all about the money,'' said John Douglas, a bank specialist at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell and a former F.D.I.C. legal chief. ''In Washington, you also have to worry about Congressional reaction, public reaction, what it looks like on the front page or when the inspector general comes in.''
Over the last two years, the two men have come under ever-rising pressure. Middle-of-the-night board meetings grew so frequent that Mr. Wigand said he had lost track of how many he had participated in.
Last summer proved so frantic, Mr. Jiampietro said, that he and Mr. Wigand resorted to holding a planning session on the Amtrak Acela train en route to New York. Sitting at a fold-out table with two deputies, they worked out the complex deal for Corus, a deeply troubled construction lender, that they referred to only as Project Cork.
''When we got to Penn Station, all the fundamentals were established,'' Mr. Wigand recalled.
As fears of bank runs mounted, deal talks that once took months to negotiate were compressed into days.
In the case of Colonial Bank, a $25 billion Southeastern regional lender that failed in August, the F.D.I.C. staged an auction just over a week after the disclosure of fraud involving its biggest borrower. Stunned by the news on a Wednesday, Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro immediately began putting out feelers to several banks that had previously expressed an interest in Colonial.
Over the weekend, staff members in Washington and Dallas pulled together a term sheet and other documents for prospective buyers to review. By Monday, the group headed to New York to make a face-to-face pitch to several prospective buyers. Working long hours, they ultimately settled on a bid from the BB&T Corporation of North Carolina that would cost the insurance fund about $2.8 billion.
BB&T's takeover of Colonial was a signature deal for the F.D.I.C. It is among the 124 deals so far that involved a loss-sharing arrangement, a tool Mr. Wigand dusted off from the savings and loan crisis, in which the government agreed to take some of the pain if a buyer incurred losses from a target's loans.
Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro contend that the arrangement helps raise prices and eases the burden of managing billions of dollars of troubled assets, ultimately saving the insurance fund money. Critics say the terms are too generous to buyers, because the government is responsible for the bulk of the losses. Recently, as bidding has picked up, the agency has scaled back its most buyer-friendly arrangements.
''One of the lessons of the last crisis is that you have to adapt to the market and be nimble,'' Mr. Wigand said. ''It's not one size fits all.''
Their team has adjusted in other ways, as well. After East West Bancorp of California participated in an F.D.I.C.-assisted deal last fall, several top officials noticed that its stock price soared.
''A lot of that value creation is coming from us,'' Mr. Jiampietro recalled the officials saying. ''Shouldn't the F.D.I.C. get a part of it?''
Now, in five recent deals, the agency has been able to get a piece of the upside by obtaining short-term securities like warrants issued by the acquirer.
Mr. Wigand and Mr. Jiampietro are introducing other changes, too. They began offering government-guaranteed financing to entice private investors to take some of the most troubled loans from failed banks off the agency's hands. And as early as this summer, they may start packaging loans from multiple failed banks to create complex mortgage bonds -- using the same type of financial alchemy that contributed to the financial crisis to clean up the mess.
''You always hear that people in the government don't work very hard,'' Daryl Bible, BB&T's chief financial officer, said. ''That's not these guys.''

HEADLINE: Flush and Looking To Spend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
AS the economy continues to recover, many companies are flush with cash. Now they just need a way to spend it -- and that may include some deal-making. 
The top 50 holders of cash in corporate America have nearly $473 billion in cash on their books, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Among these are seasoned deal-makers like Berkshire Hathaway, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle.
Take, for instance, the Simon Property Group, which added to its reserves over the last year to prepare for acquisitions. In February, the mall operator announced a $10 billion unsolicited takeover bid for General Growth Properties, most of it backed by cash.
As companies exercised caution during the financial crisis, many began socking away cash to help them weather the market turmoil. But bankers argue that having too much cash on hand is wasteful because companies could put it to better use.
To spend cash, companies have several options, including capital expenditures, research and development and share buybacks. But if companies are looking to bolster their growth significantly, mergers are one of the quickest ways to do so.
As the markets recover, the percentage of deals that include a stock component will inevitably rise. So far this year, about 17 percent of worldwide merger activity has consisted of cash-only deals, down slightly from 18.3 percent for the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters.
Even so, bankers say, it's hard to argue with the certainty of a cash offer.

HEADLINE: Carbon Permits Said to Be in Excess in Europe

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- As the global economy faltered last year and factories idled, industries in the European Union benefited from one of the most lucrative outcomes of the recession: a huge excess of permits to emit carbon dioxide. 
 The scale of the surpluses should become clear on Thursday, when the European Commission in Brussels is expected to issue preliminary figures for emissions from each factory and power plant covered by its Emissions Trading System in 2009. 
 Those figures are likely to confirm that carbon trading, also known as cap-and-trade, is failing to put the kinds of financial pressures on major polluters that proponents promised when the system was formally begun in 2005. 
 Defenders of the system say surpluses created by the economic collapse show that the system is working, by rewarding companies at times when they polluted less and by cutting them slack at a time of economic hardship. 
 But critics say the system is in danger of losing sight of its original purpose and becoming another form of corporate handout unless Europe orders deeper emissions cuts, requiring companies to use up their surplus permits and invest more in clean technology and efficiency measures. The prospect of a shortfall of permits led international climate officials on Wednesday to call for possible stiffer targets for Europe. 
 Shortfalls could also strengthen support in the United States and Australia -- which have not yet introduced national systems to control emissions -- to try alternatives to trading, like a straightforward carbon tax. 
 The chief beneficiaries of the European system have been some of the Continent's largest industrial companies, like the steel producer ArcelorMittal and the concrete maker Lafarge, which received many of their permits for free from governments to help them meet the challenge of competition from parts of the world without such regulation. 
 Many of these companies have booked millions of euros from the sale of their excess credits in anticipation that that they would have plenty in years to come, or because they needed to generate cash to shore up their balance sheets as the economic crisis bit deeper. In many cases these companies have also held onto some of their surplus, which will make it easier for them to offset future emissions once the economy recovers. 
 The price of carbon permits has been languishing at around 13 euros, or $17.60, apiece for some months, meaning that if companies exceeded their emissions quota, they would need to pay 13 euros for each excess ton of carbon dioxide produced -- a price that experts have said is far too low to result in a significant change in the way companies generate and use energy. 
 For traders of the carbon credits, the immediate question is how the figures to be released Thursday will affect the price of emissions permits, each of which represents a ton of carbon dioxide. The permits are traded on several exchanges throughout Europe, which dominates a global industry worth about $140 billion a year. 
 If the figures show a larger-than-expected drop, that could mean even more permits trading on those markets, driving the price of permits even lower than is already the case. A smaller-than-expected decline could lift prices somewhat. 
 ''We know how bad the economic downturn has been, and that means the carbon market is somewhat prepared,'' said Isabelle Curien, an analyst in Paris for Deutsche Bank. ''But there are still uncertainties for carbon markets, and the impact on prices could be significant if analysts miss their forecasts by a large enough margin.'' 
 Emissions reports are issued by Brussels annually, and ''we're never absolutely sure how much factories and power plants have emitted, or how many permits they might still have, until we actually have that information,'' Ms. Curien said. 
 Commenting on the possibility of a higher target, the European Union climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said on Wednesday that she was ''now analyzing costs, potentials and co-benefits'' in going to 30 percent. ''To achieve a 20 percent reduction by 2020 is not nearly as ambitious today as it was two years back before the crisis,'' Ms. Hedegaard wrote in an e-mail message. 
 The main idea behind carbon trading was to give companies the incentive to reduce emissions by requiring the heaviest polluters to buy additional pollution permits. As a cap on the number of permits steadily tightened, companies that invested in greener production would be best placed to continue competing in a low-carbon economy of the future. 
 The decline in industrial production because of the recession could mean emissions from industries covered by the European Union trading system have dipped by as much as 11 percent, said Kjersti Ulset, the head of European carbon analysis for Point Carbon, a research firm based in Norway. 
 European Union governments have committed to keeping the system going until at least 2020. That should ensure there is eventually a shortfall of permits as the overall cap tightens and the authorities restrict the distribution of free permits in the future. 
 For the moment, however, many companies are profiting from their surpluses. 
 Lafarge earned 142 million euros from selling permits in 2009, according to the company's annual report. That figure is almost double the 85 million euros that Lafarge made from selling permits in 2008. 
 The money ''allowed us to further invest into R.&D. programs and improve the environmental performance of our plants,'' a company spokeswoman, Claire Mathieu, said. 
 ArcelorMittal has earned $108 million from selling permits since 2007, according to its annual report for 2009. The company specified that it had purchased the permits it sold, but gave no further details about its trading strategies. 
 The company has no plans to continue selling permits ''since we may need them in the future'' to cover the costs of pollution, said Jean Lasar, a spokesman. ''However, if we do sell any carbon credits, the proceeds will be invested in energy-saving projects to improve our long-term carbon footprint.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Rose in February

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Factory orders rose in February, bolstered by demand for industrial machinery and commercial aircraft. It was the 10th increase in 11 months as manufacturing continued to provide crucial support for the economic recovery. 
 The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that new orders rose 0.6 percent last month, just ahead of analysts' estimates of a 0.5 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Still, that was below January's upwardly revised increase of 2.5 percent and the smallest increase since August 2009, the department said.
 Inventories held by manufacturers rose 0.5 percent, a figure that may disappoint economists, who are hoping to see stockpiles grow rapidly as a sign of confidence. A healthy rise in inventories would give a strong boost to the economic recovery.
 In January, factory inventories rose 0.3 percent, a disappointing pace.
 Orders for big-ticket manufactured items, known as durable goods, also rose 0.6 percent, slightly higher than a preliminary estimate released last week. Machinery orders jumped 5.1 percent, driven by higher demand for heating and air-conditioning equipment and turbines and other power generation gear.
 Orders for commercial aircraft, a volatile category, jumped about 33 percent last month. But the auto industry continued to struggle, with orders for motor vehicles and parts falling 1.7 percent, the second consecutive drop.
 Nondurable goods, like chemicals, food products and apparel, rose 0.3 percent, a healthier showing than many economists expected. Chemical orders, particularly pesticides and fertilizers, as well as food products, led the increase.

HEADLINE: Inventive New Private School Hits Old Hurdles

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The founders of the Blue School aspired to create something different: a private school not fixated on the Ivy League prospects of preschoolers and devoid of admissions hysteria. An education that, as they put it, ''you don't have to recover from.''
 The school was in the East Village, not uptown, and its leaders were not bluebloods but the founders and spouses of the Blue Man Group, the alternative theater troupe.
 The school, which is entering its fourth year, has remained true to its progressive roots, with ''imagination stations'' and ''glow time.'' Children help direct the curriculum, and social and emotional skills are given equal weight to reading and math. 
 But the school has also developed some characteristics familiar to any New York private school parent. Children must now take the same $510 intelligence test that other schools require for admission. Tuition for kindergarten is now more than $28,000. 
 And despite the fact that it has no permanent real estate, limited financial aid and no track record of placing students in top schools, six families applied for each available slot in next fall's preschool class.
 ''We've become what we were rebelling against,'' said Matt Goldman, one of the founders.
 The Blue School, consciously or not, tapped into one of New York's great and frustrating economic paradoxes. In an entrepreneurial city where even volatile commodities like real estate eventually find their equilibrium, the desire for private school seats has outpaced supply for many years, in some cases by an order of magnitude.
 Even though a substantial number of schools opened when the economy was humming, the math remains the same, or in some cases is worse. ''Demand levels are much more significant than they were 10 years ago,'' said Roxana Reid, founder of Smart City Kids, an admissions advisory service. 
 The Blue School's founders say they began their school not for economic opportunity, but because they were disappointed in the options they had found for their own children. 
 ''We saw beautiful preschools, but most of them didn't involve the parents as much as we wanted to be involved,'' said Jen Wink, another founder. So they built a play group and, after one year, made it a school.
 They hired curriculum consultants and specialists and experts. They traveled. They debated, internally and externally. They were attracted to the Reggio Emilia philosophy of learning, which integrates what children want to learn with what teachers and parents want to impart. To that end, it has two ''provocateurs'' on the staff whose job is to inspire different ''threads of learning,'' planting ideas and building areas of study around the ones that take. 
 After a teaching candidate read ''The Great Kapok Tree'' to a class of first graders, they took interest in the rainforest. A provocateur built the classroom into a rainforest, replete with a kapok tree whose (plastic) leaves cover the ceiling. The children have studied the animals that live in the rainforest and are now exploring whether the Littles, characters from another story they read, might live in the kapok tree. They write letters to the Littles and even create math tests for them. 
 Once a week, 4-, 5- and 6-year-olds mix together at imagination stations grouped around subjects like language arts, music and movement. On a recent morning, one group was stationed in the hallway singing ''Frere Jacques'' in Mandarin; in a classroom, another group was imitating the sound of rain on a giant drum (it was pouring outside). When the children got overly excited by their Blue Man Group-style drumming, they calmed down with breathing exercises. 
 Another Blue Man inspiration is glow time, when natural or incandescent light is replaced by black light and children transform their environment using props like shaving cream, play dough or glow-in-the-dark blocks to study things like light, shadow and outer space. 
 But the approach at the Blue School, which now has 87 students in preschool through first grade and is preparing to expand, does not come cheap. While the founders never intended to educate children at no charge, they said they did not expect to have to charge $28,400. 
 ''When we started, we knew that some private schools charged $32,000 a year, and we were like, 'You're kidding me,' '' said Mr. Goldman, who is a graduate of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. ''Now we say, 'How do they do it with just $32,000?' '' 
 The founders looked at what other private schools charged and settled on a tuition right in the middle, he said. 
 One major cost is the same one that has bedeviled many private schools, and is the reason more of them have not opened: real estate. Twice the founders have come close to acquiring the 50,000 to 60,000 square feet they need to expand the school through eighth grade, but the deals fell apart. 
 The school is changing as it goes. Beginning this school year, the founders required an intelligence test, administered by a company called the Educational Records Bureau, as part of the application process. The test is required at most of the city's exclusive private schools, though some, like the Mandell School, do not ask for it. 
 The founders said that since many of their applicants were also trying to get into schools that required the E.R.B. test, it did not seem like too much of an imposition, because the test result can be sent to multiple schools. The school, like many others, says that it does not require a minimum E.R.B. score, and that the test is one of many tools used in admissions.
 ''It gives us one piece of the child, which is valuable,'' said Renee Rolleri, another founder, ''and we can better respond to their academic strengths and areas to work on.'' 
 Many parents are clearly unfazed by the school's requirements and absence of a track record. 
 ''This school was our top choice; we wanted to be a part of it,'' said Marah Anderson, whose son Finnegan is in kindergarten. Ms. Anderson said that her son was accepted to two other schools, but that she preferred the holistic approach of the Blue School. ''There is a lot of research that supports this approach to learning,'' she said. ''It's just not as widely implemented.'' 
 The school is soliciting donations to bolster its financial aid and help in its search for space. But it says that despite the common perception that money helps in private school admissions, donors' children will not be given preference.
 ''What we have learned,'' Mr. Goldman said, ''is that you are judged as a school at least as much by the admissions process as by the education itself.''

HEADLINE: The Pace of Deal-Making Picks Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
CORPORATE buyers are intensifying their hunt for deals -- and they're becoming a bit bolder.
More than two years past the start of the financial crisis, deal-making is continuing a steady ascent as companies seek to bolster their growth through mergers and acquisitions. And as their collective appetite grows, so too does their willingness to consider more aggressive international transactions or unsolicited bids.
The last few months have brought a welter of multibillion-dollar deals, like Comcast's purchase of a majority stake in NBC Universal, Kraft's successful $19 billion takeover of Cadbury of Britain and the American International Group's $51.4 billion sale of two major units. And a spate of unsolicited hostile offers has emerged, notably the Simon Property Group's $10 billion bid for General Growth Properties, which had filed for bankruptcy.
''The next two quarters will probably be defined as a very aggressive period of speed-dating, where companies will try out different combinations to see if they make strategic sense and are actionable,'' said Paul G. Parker, head of global mergers and acquisitions for Barclays Capital. 
Worldwide deal volumes swelled to about $564 billion for the three months ended March 31, according to data from Thomson Reuters, 18.4 percent higher than the same time last year. That is a little over half the deal volume of the first quarter of 2007 (which was nearly the peak of mergers activity), but deal-makers say they do not expect to reach those levels for some time.
''The economy's far from ideal, but companies now have more confidence than they have had in the last 18 months,'' said Victor I. Lewkow, a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.
The conditions that foster successful deal-making are continuing to improve. The stock markets have largely stabilized, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising almost 5 percent for the quarter, providing greater clarity into how much companies are worth and helping instill confidence in management teams about potential deals they may be considering.
Just as important, robust stock and credit markets have continued to make financing available 4for buyers contemplating a takeover. Interest rates remain low, and many strategic companies are drawing upon hoards of cash they stockpiled over the past year.
''The debt markets are wide open,'' said Mark Shafir, Citigroup's global head of mergers and acquisitions. ''There's a lot of capacity in the marketplace.''
Whereas mergers activity last year was dominated primarily by health care and financial services companies, deal-makers say now they are spending time on a broad range of industries.
''It's across the board,'' said Eduardo G. Mestre, vice chairman of Evercore Partners. ''I have a very hard time saying that one sector is more active than another sector.''
The economic recovery has also helped alter the dynamics of buyers and sellers. The average worldwide deal premium has fallen nearly 5 percentage points, to 27.5 percent, for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, although it rose 25 percent for transactions in the United States.
While buyers have gained more confidence in pursuing their targets, companies eyed as acquisitions have gotten a better sense of how much they are worth -- and more are deciding that the best way to grow is to sell themselves.
''Many companies have moved toward new 52-week highs,'' said Chris Ventresca, a head of North America mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase. ''They still have uncertainty with regard to their business outlook and don't see a catalyst for significant stock price appreciation. That provides some basis for sellers to think about traditional premiums over their current stock performance.''
Still, other potential acquisitions say that they are better equipped to grow alone, leaving insistent suitors to ponder whether to try a hostile takeover. Beyond Simon, Air Products and Chemicals, Astellas Pharma, Carl C. Icahn and Elliott Management are among those that have chosen to make unfriendly bids.
The improvement in the debt markets has also helped the private equity industry -- largely relegated to the margins in 2009 -- assert itself as an active presence once again. Leveraged buyout firms struck about $31.7 billion worth of deals during the first quarter of 2010, amounting to about 5.6 percent of all mergers activity worldwide.
Private equity firms like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts have spoken of their billions of dollars in ''dry powder,'' or committed investor capital, for some time. Now, with banks proving willing to lend and investors comfortable with riskier bond and loan offerings, such firms are expected to push for bigger deals again, though not as large as the immense leveraged buyouts of three years ago.
Some are also finding buyers for some of their portfolio companies, like Apax Partners' $3 billion sale of Tommy Hilfiger to Phillips-Van Heusen and Oak Hill Capital Partners' $1.1 billion sale of Duane Reade to Walgreen. These sales help the buyout firms generate profit and clear room for future acquisitions.
''Private equity firms spent most of last year helping their portfolio companies,'' said Randi C. Lesnick, a partner at the law firm Jones Day. ''What we've been seeing and hearing is an uptick in their interest in new deals.''
Deals have also taken on a more international character: Cross-border transactions added up to about 36.6 percent of all mergers for the first quarter, nearly doubling last year's number. Deal-makers point to a wide array of mergers, like the Kraft-Cadbury deal and the takeover of A.I.G.'s Asian life insurance arm by Prudential of Britain.
Emerging markets like China and Brazil have proved a font of deal activity: they accounted for $181.7 billion of deals this quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, or 32.2 percent of worldwide volume.
Their expanding presence in mergers and acquisitions has manifested itself both directly, as in Geely of China's agreement to pay $1.8 billion for Volvo, and indirectly, as in Prudential's effort to expand its Asian presence through its A.I.G. deal and Kraft's desire for Cadbury's footprint in India, Russia and other countries. (A few deals, including Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines' $150 million offer for Hummer, fell apart, reportedly because of regulatory troubles.)
Deal-makers say that as China and other developing countries continue to seek natural resources and to put their swelling coffers to good use, they will be seeking even bigger pieces of the mergers pie. ''They are emerged markets,'' said Antonio Weiss, Lazard's global head of investment banking. ''It's become old-fashioned to think of these regions as emerging.''

HEADLINE: For Butler's President, Excellence Is Expected

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As the first American-born child of Chinese immigrants, Bobby Fong, the Butler University president, learned math by computing baseball statistics. He learned about the United States by studying the game of baseball.
 ''Baseball was my introduction to American life,'' Fong said Tuesday in a telephone interview. ''I'm an immigrant's son; I didn't speak English much until I began kindergarten.'' 
 He grew up in Oakland, Calif., and when the Dodgers and the Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco in 1958, Fong could not understand what all the fuss was about. 
 ''Everybody was raving about Duke Snider and Willie Mays,'' Fong said. ''I raised my hand one day in class and asked, 'What's baseball?' ''
 The teacher explained to Fong that if he wanted to understand American life, he needed to learn about baseball. ''I did and I've been overcompensating ever since,'' he said.
 Today, Fong has a new passion: college basketball. Fong has discovered how a winning basketball team can move a university into a national spotlight -- for all of the right reasons.
 Butler has become the inspirational face of March Madness. The team's success has had instant impact. ''In the last few days we've had trouble keeping the admission Web site up,'' he said. ''It crashed at least once.'' 
 What makes the N.C.A.A. tournament fascinating are the contrasts. Saturday's national semifinal game between Butler and Michigan State offers a stark contrast. 
 Butler has an undergraduate enrollment of 3,900, Michigan State about 35,000. Butler Coach Brad Stevens, 33, who quit his job at Eli Lilly, a pharmaceuticals manufacturer, to become a volunteer assistant at Butler, is making his first Final Four appearance. Tom Izzo, 55, has taken Michigan State to six Final Fours in the last 12 seasons, winning a national championship in 2000.
 Stevens earns a reported $750,000; Izzo's salary is estimated at $2.8 million a year. 
 The decision facing Fong, probably sooner than later, is whether to break the bank to keep Stevens when larger programs come calling.
 Both of Fong's parents died before he entered college, giving him a different perspective about money versus happiness and security. 
 ''I always needed to worry about where the next dollar was going to come from,'' he said. ''I don't think there's anything wrong with worrying about how to be secure economically. It may be a necessary thing, but it's not the sufficient thing. There are things that ultimately will make for satisfaction in life that go far beyond that.''
 Fong, the Butler president since 2001, said Stevens had created a legacy there that could be as good as gold. 
 ''However long he stays, he doesn't have to leave simply for the cash,'' Fong said. ''All of us want to leave a legacy, and the nature of that legacy may be more important than simply being comfortable beyond a certain level. Once you hit a million, the difference between one million and four is numbers. What Tom Izzo has at Michigan State is a legacy. That's really by far the more valuable thing.''
 We shall see. 
 The difference between the Michigan States and the Butlers of the world is the ability to consistently be among the last teams standing in late March. 
 Sometimes a university is so smitten by the sweet taste of success that it cuts corners and makes concessions and exceptions to its core values. Sometimes the concession is whom you hire as coach. Sometimes it is whom you accept as student-athletes. 
 ''We work from the presumption that there should be not a gap between academic excellence and athletic excellence,'' Fong said. ''Our promise to our students is that if we admit you, we believe that you are capable of getting a degree from Butler University. It's not that we're trying to keep people out. We expect students to hit the ground running. We don't have any developmental or remedial courses. The expectation is that you are here to be a student first.''
 Fong received an undergraduate degree in English from Harvard and his doctorate in English literature from U.C.L.A. It was at U.C.L.A. that he began a continuing passion for the work of Oscar Wilde. 
 He continues to be a passionate baseball card collector, and his soul is found in the classroom. ''My real job is being a professor of literature,'' Fong said.
 Butler has become a compelling narrative, a midmajor university that, from all appearances, has successfully married academic and athletic aspirations.
 ''My students will never forget being part of this experience at Butler University,'' Fong said. ''It's going to be tied into the stories they tell of their own lives going forward. Those memories are going to warm them in hard times.''
 Even then this moment will be difficult to comprehend: the Butler Bulldogs in the Final Four.

HEADLINE: Obama Oil Drilling Plan Draws Critics

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON --President Obama's proposal to open vast expanses of American coastlines to oil and natural gas drilling drew criticism from both sides in the drilling debate.
 The plan, which Mr. Obama said would balance the need to produce more domestic energy while protecting natural resources, would allow drilling along the Atlantic coastline, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and the north coast of Alaska. It would end a longstanding moratorium on exploration from the northern tip of Delaware to the central coast of Florida, covering 167 million acres of ocean.
 ''Drilling our coasts will do nothing to lower gas prices or create energy independence,'' Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. It will only jeopardize beaches, marine life, and coastal tourist economies, all so the oil industry can make a short-term profit.''
 On the other hand, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called Mr. Obama's proposal ''a step in the right direction, but a small one that leaves enormous amounts of American energy off limits.'' 
 Mr. McConnell also sought proof that the drilling would ultimately be permitted. ''Will the administration actually take concrete steps to finish the studies, approve the necessary permits, and open these areas for production?'' he said in a statement. ''Will they stand by as their allies act to delay the implementation in the courts?''
 House Republican Leader John Boehner also criticized the plan for keeping the vast majority of America's offshore energy resources off limits at a time when, the Ohio representative said, Americans want an ''all of the above'' strategy for promoting American energy production and creating American jobs.
 Mr. Obama, speaking at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington, anticipated the reaction and tried to blunt the criticism.
 ''Ultimately, we need to move beyond the tired debates of the left and the right, between business leaders and environmentalists, between those who would claim drilling is a cure all and those who would claim it has no place,'' he said. ''Because this issue is just too important to allow our progress to languish while we fight the same old battles over and over again.''
 While Mr. Obama has staked out middle ground on other environmental matters -- supporting nuclear power, for example -- the sheer breadth of the offshore drilling decision took some of his supporters aback.
 ''We're appalled that the president is unleashing a wholesale assault on the oceans,'' Jacqueline Savitz of the environmental group Oceana said on Wednesday. ''Expanding offshore drilling is the wrong move if the Obama administration is serious about improving energy security, creating lasting jobs and averting climate change.''
 And it is no sure thing that it will win support for a climate bill from undecided senators close to the oil industry, like Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, or Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana.
 Under the plan, the coastline from New Jersey northward would remain closed to all oil and gas activity. So would the Pacific Coast, from Mexico to the Canadian border.
 The environmentally sensitive Bristol Bay in southwestern Alaska would be protected and no drilling would be allowed under the plan, officials said. But large tracts in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in the Arctic Ocean north of Alaska -- nearly 130 million acres -- would be eligible for exploration and drilling after extensive studies.
 To critics who branded the decision both unnecessary and a threat to the environment, Mr. Obama said in his remarks: ''There will be those who strongly disagree with this decision, including those who say we should not open any new areas to drilling, But what I want to emphasize is that this announcement is part of a broader strategy that will move us from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that relies more on homegrown fuels and clean energy. And the only way this transition will succeed is if it strengthens our economy in the short term and long term. To fail to recognize this reality would be a mistake.''
 Mr. Obama also tried to answer oil industry officials and Republicans in Congress who would claim that the president did not go far enough.
 ''They'd deny the fact that with less than 2 percent of oil reserves, but more than 20 percent of world consumption, drilling alone cannot come close to meeting our long-term energy needs,'' he said, ''and that for the sake of the planet and our energy independence, we need to begin the transition to cleaner fuels now.''
 The Senate is expected to take up a climate bill in the next few weeks -- the last chance to enact such legislation before midterm election concerns take over.
 The proposal is also intended to generate revenue from the sale of offshore leases and help win political support for comprehensive energy and climate legislation. Mr. Obama and his allies in the Senate have already made significant concessions on coal and nuclear power to try to win votes from Republicans and moderate Democrats. The new plan now grants one of the biggest items on the oil industry's wish list -- access to vast areas of the Outer Continental Shelf for drilling.
 But even as Mr. Obama curries favors with pro-drilling interests, he risks a backlash from some coastal governors, senators and environmental advocates, who say that the relatively small amounts of oil to be gained in the offshore areas are not worth the environmental risks.
 The Obama administration's plan adopts some drilling proposals floated by President George W. Bush near the end of his tenure, including opening much of the Atlantic and Arctic Coasts. Those proposals were challenged in court on environmental grounds and set aside by President Obama shortly after he took office.
 Unlike the Bush plan, however, Mr. Obama's proposal would put Bristol Bay, home to major Alaskan commercial fisheries and populations of endangered whales, off limits to oil rigs.
 Actual drilling in much of the newly opened areas, if it takes place, would not begin for years.
 Mr. Obama said several times during his presidential campaign that he supported expanded offshore drilling. He noted in his State of the Union address in January that weaning the country from imported oil would require ''tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development.''
 Perhaps in anticipation of controversy, the new policy had been closely held within the administration. White House and Interior Department officials began briefing members of Congress and local officials in affected states late Tuesday.
 It is not known how much potential fuel lies in the areas opened to exploration, although according to Interior Department estimates there could be as much as a three-year supply of recoverable oil and more than two years' worth of natural gas, at current rates of consumption. But those estimates are based on seismic data that is, in some cases, more than 30 years old.
 The first lease sale off the coast of Virginia could occur as early as next year in a triangular tract 50 miles off the coast that had already been approved for development but was held up by a court challenge and additional Interior Department review, officials said.
 But as a result of the Obama decision, the Interior Department will spend several years conducting geologic and environmental studies along the rest of the southern and central Atlantic Seaboard. If a tract is deemed suitable for development, it is listed for sale in a competitive bidding system. The next lease sales -- if any are authorized by the Interior Department -- would not be held before 2012.
 The eastern Gulf of Mexico tract that would be offered for lease is adjacent to an area that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms. The eastern Gulf area is believed to contain as much as 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 17 trillion cubic feet of gas, the richest single tract that would be open to drilling under the Obama plan.
 Drilling there has been strongly opposed by officials from both political parties in Alabama and Florida who fear damage to coastlines, fisheries, popular beaches and wildlife. Interior Department officials said no wells would be allowed within 125 miles of the Florida and Alabama coasts, making them invisible from shore.
 The Interior Department and the Pentagon are discussing possible restrictions on oil and gas operations in some areas off Virginia and Florida, home to some of the nation's biggest Navy and Air Force facilities. States are also likely to claim rights to the revenues from oil and gas deposits within 3 to 12 miles of shore and to some portion of lease proceeds, officials said.
 Interior Secretary Ken Salazar developed the offshore drilling plan after conducting four public meetings over the past year in Alaska, California, Louisiana and New Jersey. The Interior Department received more than 500,000 public comments on the issue.
 Mr. Salazar has said that he hoped to rebalance the nation's oil and gas policy to find a middle ground between the ''drill here drill now'' advocacy of many oil industry advocates and the preservationist impulse to block oil exploration beneath virtually all public lands and waters.
 He has called the offshore drilling plan a new chapter in the nation's search for a comprehensive energy policy that can open new areas to oil and gas development ''in the right way and in the right places,'' according to an aide.
 In many of the newly opened areas, drilling would begin only after the completion of geologic studies, environmental impact statements, court challenges and public lease sales. Much of the oil and gas may not be recoverable at current prices and may be prohibitively expensive even if oil prices spike as they did in the summer of 2008.

HEADLINE: German Cabinet Agrees On Bank Tax for Bailouts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- The German cabinet agreed in principle on Wednesday to impose a tax on banks to help finance bailouts but left details of the plan to be worked out in legislation in coming months. 
 The German plan to finance a so-called stability fund won cautious backing from the French economy minister, Christine Lagarde, who attended the cabinet meeting in Berlin, where she called for international coordination on the matter. 
 Berlin expects that the levy will raise 1 billion to 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion to $1.62 billion) a year, Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, said after the meeting. 
 While that amount would be modest compared with the size of bad loans held by German banks, the government expects the reserves to become a reasonably large fund over time. 
 The German tax envisions fees that would be paid by all banks and diverted directly into a fund, according to a working document by the ministry of finance. Levies would be adjusted according to each bank's risk profile. 
 While Germany will introduce national rules regardless, ''it's a good idea if other countries have the same system,'' the official said. 
 At the request of the Group of 20, the International Monetary Fund is working on proposals for a bank tax, and it plans to deliver a report to G-20 ministers in April when they meet in Washington. The ministers will meet again in Pusan, South Korea, in June. 
 After their meetings, the French and German finance ministers issued a statement expressing support for the idea of introducing a tax that would differentiate between the risk levels of banks ''with the intention to reduce the risk profile that some financial institutions exhibit.'' 
 The program should ''aim at an international level playing field,'' the document said. 
 Political opponents of the governing German coalition contend that the fund will bring in too little money. They have dismissed it as a political maneuver before an important regional election in Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, in May. 
 The idea of a bank levy was first floated by President Obama in January, when he announced plans for a financial crisis responsibility fee aimed at the biggest American banks. The idea was to complete the recovery of the cost to taxpayers of the bank bailout. Details were left to Congress, where a fierce fight was expected. 
 In Britain, David Cameron, the leader of the Conservatives, the largest opposition party, recently made a similar pledge. A general election will be held in Britain by June, and the Conservatives hold a narrow lead in opinion polls. 
 Late last year, Sweden introduced a permanent stability fee on banks and other credit institutions.

HEADLINE: Drill, but Not Everywhere

 BODY:
For years, the debate over offshore drilling for gas and oil has been a war of sound bites between the ''drill now, drill everywhere'' crowd that dominated the Bush administration and the Republican campaign in 2008, and members of the environmental community who would leave the country's outer continental shelf untouched. 
 Neither provided a satisfying answer to the twin demands of reducing this country's dependence on foreign oil and protecting precious coastal areas. On Wednesday, President Obama struck a sensible middle ground. 
 He announced a decision to expand oil and gas exploration in selected areas of America's coastal waters that will satisfy neither extreme but is, on the whole, a careful and useful addition to the steps he has already taken to reduce the nation's energy dependence. 
 Mr. Obama noted pointedly and correctly that increased oil and gas drilling cannot possibly address the country's long-term energy needs. It should be seen as just one element of his broader energy strategy -- including fuel efficiency standards to be announced on Thursday, big investments in alternative fuels in the stimulus package and new loan guarantees for nuclear power. 
 The new strategy -- the result of more than a year of work by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar -- also confronts an essential political reality: the Senate will insist on offshore drilling as part of a broader bill, expected after Easter, addressing climate change and other energy-related problems. Mr. Obama is trying to anticipate and shape that discussion by identifying areas that he thinks can responsibly be opened for exploration while quarantining others. 
 Nearly all of America's coastal waters have been up for grabs since 2008 when President George W. Bush lifted a longstanding presidential moratorium on drilling in the outer continental shelf. A few months later, Congress allowed a parallel Congressional moratorium to expire. Mr. Bush also lifted a separate moratorium on drilling in Alaska's Bristol Bay that was imposed by his father in 1990 after the Exxon Valdez spill. Bristol Bay is home to America's richest fishing grounds and is the main driver of a $2.2 billion regional fishing industry.
 Under the Obama administration's plan, Bristol Bay will once again be completely protected, which is wonderful news. Further north in Arctic waters, the plan would allow drilling on existing leases in relatively small areas of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas to proceed -- which seemed inevitable, given legal and economic obstacles to reversing them. It would, however, postpone any further development pending the outcome of detailed scientific and environmental studies. Alaska's environmentalists were encouraged, and they should be.
 The rest of the plan is as significant for the areas it protects as for those it opens. Exploration will not be allowed on the Pacific Coast or along the Atlantic Coast north of Delaware. Seismic exploration -- which in effect means exploratory drilling -- will be allowed along the central and southern Atlantic Coast from Delaware to Florida, but, again, no new leases will be granted until the scoping process and the environmental reviews are finished.
 The Interior Department's seismic information is decades old, and one important point of the new plan is to discover what's out there. The department's most optimistic present estimate of the resources in the areas covered by the plan, including the Gulf of Mexico, is 63 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil.
 That sounds like a lot, but it isn't, since the United States consumes more than 7 billion barrels each year. As Mr. Obama noted, the basic energy math remains unchanged: a country that consumes one-quarter of the world's oil, but owns about 2 percent of the world's known reserves, cannot drill its way to self-sufficiency.

HEADLINE: Risk Is Clear In Drilling; Payoff Isn't

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington and Clifford Krauss from Houston. Amanda Coyne contributed from Alaska and Victoria Cherrie from North Carolina.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In proposing a major expansion of offshore oil and gas development, President Obama set out to fashion a carefully balanced plan that would attract bipartisan support for climate and energy legislation while increasing production of domestic oil.
 It is not clear that the plan announced Wednesday will do either. 
 While the oil industry, business groups and some Republicans offered muted support for the proposal, most environmental groups denounced it. And the senators whose support Mr. Obama is courting for highly contentious climate and energy legislation to be introduced in the coming weeks gave decidedly mixed reactions: For every senator who praised it as at least a partial answer to the nation's energy needs, another raised alarms about befouled beaches and continued dependence on fossil fuels.
 Even Mr. Obama sounded somewhat torn in announcing a drilling plan that would open large tracts of the Atlantic coast, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and Arctic waters off Alaska to oil exploration and eventual drilling. 
 ''This is not a decision I've made lightly,'' he said as he stood at Andrews Air Force base in Maryland on Wednesday near an Air Force fighter converted to burn renewable biofuels. 
 ''There will be those who strongly disagree with this decision, including those who say we should not open any new areas to drilling,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But what I want to emphasize is that this announcement is part of a broader strategy that will move us from an economy that runs on fossil fuels and foreign oil to one that relies more on homegrown fuels and clean energy.''
 Mr. Obama's plan, delicately pieced together by the Interior Department with White House input, carved out a large coastal buffer zone in the eastern gulf to mollify Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, an opponent of drilling there. It also included continued access to the oil fields off the North Slope of Alaska to win the support of Alaska Senators Mark Begich, a Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, a Republican.
 Most New England officials, including Maine's two Republican Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, are considered swing votes on energy legislation. They strongly oppose offshore drilling, and the North Atlantic was exempted. And because there is almost no support for drilling and there is little recoverable oil off the Pacific Coast, the whole area was declared off limits, said Ken Salazar, the interior secretary. 
 But by opening the mid-Atlantic region, from Delaware south to Central Florida, for oil exploration, Mr. Obama angered New Jersey's two Democratic senators, Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, who have been generally supportive of Mr. Obama's push for climate legislation.
 Mr. Menendez issued a strong statement Wednesday, saying, ''I have let the administration know that if they do not protect New Jersey from the effects of coastal drilling in the climate change bill, then my vote is in question.''
 Mr. Begich of Alaska is among those undecided on climate legislation, waiting to see what would be done on offshore oil drilling, among other issues. He supports exploration in the Arctic under appropriate safeguards. He said the Obama plan was helpful, but not enough to win his support.
 ''It's not a perfect deal, but it's better than nothing,'' Mr. Begich said, adding that there is no provision for the states to share in the revenues from lease sales and royalties. ''It helps move us down the path.''
 If the political capital to be gained from the proposal seemed uncertain, so did the potential for vast oil supplies to reduce dependence on foreign imports.
 Oil company executives and geologists expressed guarded enthusiasm for the president's initiative. But experts said it was impossible to know how much oil and gas the new tracts contain, in part because some existing data is based on 30-year-old studies. 
 Even at the high end of government estimates, the new production, if and when it occurs, will displace only a small fraction of the oil and gas the country now imports and consumes.
 Stocks of some major oil companies fell on Wednesday, but share prices for the energy sector rose overall, possibly a result of the president's action. 
 The American Petroleum Institute, using the high end of government estimates, hopes that the opening of the areas on the Atlantic and eastern gulf alone would make available more than four billion barrels of oil and more than 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas -- enough to fuel more than 2.4 million cars and heat eight million households for 60 years. 
 ''It's a promising development and it recognizes that the administration understands the potential job creation and domestic energy production that will result from offshore access,'' said Erik Milito, director of the institute's upstream and industry operations. 
 But T. Boone Pickens, the billionaire Texas oilman, who has been a practicing geologist for 50 years, said, ''I've seen some optimistic reserve estimates for offshore United States and I am not sure they will hold up.'' 
 In the last 15 years, the industry has made swift strides in new methods to acquire and analyze seismic data in waters that were impossible to reach when geologists last studied the areas. Current seismic and drilling information cover only a tiny fraction of the area that would be opened for drilling, especially along the Atlantic coast. ''We don't have a good understanding of what the true potential is,'' said Bobby Ryan, Chevron's vice president for global exploration. 
 He added, ''Until you really get in there with modern technology and evaluate it, you don't really know.'' 
 Still, some industry analysts say there is at least the potential for some huge oil and gas finds offshore once oil companies are allowed to explore.
 Jon Blickwede, a senior geologist for Statoil, the Norwegian oil company active in the Gulf of Mexico, said he was optimistic that exploring the eastern gulf area ''has the kind of potential to decrease our dependence on foreign imported crude oil and natural gas as well.''
 He based his assessment on the fact that the geology of the eastern gulf is very similar to that of coastal central and southern Mexico, where there are productive oil fields.
 The reaction on Wednesday to Mr. Obama's proposal from citizens in the states that may see stepped-up oil and gas activity was as mixed as that in Washington, drawing both supporters and opponents. In Wainwright, Alaska, a small coastal village at the state's northern tip, John Hopson Jr., a whaling captain, welcomed the policy announcement as a potential source of new jobs. The Shell Oil Company holds leases in the Chukchi Sea about 80 miles off the coast of Wainwright. 
 ''It gives our community a chance at development,'' Mr. Hopson said.
 But in North Carolina, Frank Tursi, a preservationist with the North Carolina Coastal Federation, said he believed that there was very little oil off the state's popular beaches and high risk from drilling into the seabed.
 ''It all leaves the president with a delicious irony and that is: In order to garner support for a bill that is intended to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the administration is willing to expand the very substance that causes those emissions in the first place,'' Mr. Tursi said. ''Pandering for votes that rely on a polluting fuel of the past is not the kind of change many of us expected.''

HEADLINE: Build America Bonds Will Save $12.3 Billion, Analysis Says

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- State and local governments will eventually save $12.3 billion from bonds issued in the first year of the Build America Bonds program, a Treasury Department analysis has found, compared with what they would have spent by issuing traditional tax-exempt bonds to finance projects.
 The analysis, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times on Thursday, represents a defense of the Treasury-supported Build America Bonds, a program that began last April as part of the stimulus package and is intended to spur spending on infrastructure. 
 Unlike traditional tax-exempt bonds that states and municipalities use to raise money, the Build America Bonds are taxable. The Treasury provides a 35 percent direct subsidy to the bonds' issuers to offset borrowing costs. So far, $90 billion has been raised through 1,066 bond issues in 48 states under the program, which is to expire at the end of this year. The bonds have a typical maturity of 10 to 30 years. 
 President Obama has proposed making the program permanent, with a 28 percent subsidy rate. 
 The analysis examined 92 cases from April to September in which governments issued both Build America Bonds and tax-exempt municipal bonds on the same day. On average, bonds issued under the new program saved money for their issuers, although the savings were greater for bonds at longer maturities. 
 The analysis identified several reasons for the lower net borrowing costs associated with the Buy America Bonds. The subsidy, as a response to the recession, was designed to save issuers more than the implicit subsidy associated with traditional tax-exempt bonds. 
 Second, the bonds have appealed to a broader set of investors, including pension funds and sovereign wealth funds controlled by foreign governments, and the wider demand has probably helped drive down interest rates for the bonds, the analysis found. The bond program began when the municipal bond market was still reeling from the aftershocks of the credit crisis, and it gave states and municipalities another avenue for borrowing. 
 ''Build America Bonds have expanded the investor base for municipal debt, and state and local governments are saving money as a result,'' Alan B. Krueger, the assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy, said in an interview. 
 The total cost of the program is difficult to estimate, though a Congressional body, the Joint Committee on Taxation, initially projected that the almost two-year program would cost the federal government $4.3 billion over 10 years. 
 Mr. Krueger recently visited the West 96th Street subway station in Manhattan, which is being revamped through a Build America Bond issue by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 ''People are working there because of the Build America Bonds program,'' he said. ''It's going to mass transit, schools, sewer systems, parks, municipal buildings, town halls, universities and hospitals.''
 The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, was to travel to the Bronx on Friday to tour the Mott Haven campus, a four-school construction project for 2,300 students and 200 employees, financed in part through Build America Bonds, but officials canceled the visit on Thursday, citing a scheduling conflict.
 The analysis also addressed criticisms that have been raised about underwriting fees associated with the Build America Bonds. 
 So far, issuers have spent nearly $700 million on underwriting fees. The fees have gone down from about $8 per $1,000 of bonds issued to about $6.69, approaching the average of $6.19 for tax-exempt municipal bonds.
 While the underwriting fees did start out higher, ''the difference hardly eats into the savings'' the issuers have reaped, Mr. Krueger said.

HEADLINE: Sharp Increase in March In Personal Bankruptcies

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
More Americans filed for bankruptcy protection in March than during any month since the federal personal bankruptcy law was tightened in October 2005, a new report says, a result of high unemployment and the housing crash. 
 Federal courts reported over 158,000 bankruptcy filings in March, or 6,900 a day, a rise of 35 percent from February, according to a report to be released on Friday by Automated Access to Court Electronic Records, a data collection company known as Aacer. Filings were up 19 percent over March 2009. The previous record over the last five years was 133,000 in October.
 ''Even with the restrictive new law, we're back up over where we were before the law changed,'' Mike Bickford, president of Aacer, said in a phone interview Thursday from his headquarters in Oklahoma City. He faulted the stagnant economy, saying a surge in bankruptcies generally follows economic contraction by 6 to 18 months, and he pointed to March as a historically busy month for bankruptcy filings.
 Other experts point out that filings invoking Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, a simple and inexpensive option, are rising faster than more complex Chapter 13 reorganization filings, under which consumers repay a portion of their debts so they can keep their homes, suggesting that more homeowners are simply walking away from underwater mortgages.
 ''Fewer people are trying to save their homes,'' Katherine M. Porter, a University of Iowa law professor and bankruptcy expert, said in an interview by phone on Thursday. ''They realize their payments are not affordable, and bankruptcy judges do not have the power to adjust the mortgages to make them more affordable.''
 Statistics from the United States Trustee Program, the Justice Department office that oversees bankruptcy cases, show that Chapter 7 filings as a percentage of all bankruptcies have increased to about 73 percent in 2009 from about 62 percent in 2006-07. Of the 158,141 bankruptcy filings in March, 118,505, or 75 percent, were Chapter 7s and 38,241 were Chapter 13s, the Aacer report says.
 ''We think that means fewer and fewer families think they're really going to save their homes,'' Professor Porter said. ''They don't have any equity, so why try to keep up with their home payments?''
 The nation's high unemployment rate is one more reason for people to choose Chapter 7, Professor Porter said. ''To file Chapter 13, you need ongoing income, and to the extent we have more people who are unemployed, they can't use Chapter 13 because they don't have that income to pay into the plan,'' she said.
 Finally, Professor Porter said, March is the high season for bankruptcy filings because many people in financial distress get a tax refund check that they can use to pay the $1,500 to $3,500 that a bankruptcy lawyer charges.
 ''People use their tax refunds to pay their attorney fees,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Short Week Ends Higher Ahead of March Jobs Data

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street investors on Thursday pushed past doubts about the technology sector and seized on signs that the global recovery was firming up.
 After a volatile day, the major indexes ended with strong gains, extending a rally that lifted markets in Asia and Europe. 
Investors were encouraged by data that showed manufacturing remained at relatively robust levels in the United States and Europe. In addition, China and Japan reported improving business confidence, which helped create an appetite for risk. 
 Stocks were also helped by a report from the Labor Department, which said the number of people filing first-time unemployment claims fell last week.
 The data came on the eve of the government's report on employment in March. The more optimistic analysts believe as many as 400,000 jobs were created, partly because of hiring for the Census. 
 ''There's a growing sense that things are probably not getting worse,'' said William J. Schultz, chief investment officer for McQueen, Ball & Associates. ''People are grudgingly putting money back into the market.''
 The unemployment numbers helped calm jitters that had surfaced in the market on Wednesday when a report indicated that the private sector lost jobs in March.
 Wall Street's reaction to the March employment report may not be clear until next week. The stock market is closed on Friday in observance of Good Friday, though bond markets will be open.
 On Thursday, investors seemed confident the report would show a turning point. Some analysts say they believe that the market has gotten ahead of itself and priced in significant growth without firm evidence, helping create some of the volatility.
 A downturn in technology stocks also hindered some of the upward movement. Research In Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, dropped 7.4 percent, to $68.48, after reporting disappointing earnings. Microsoft dropped 0.4 percent, to $29.16, amid concerns that the AppleiPad would limit sales of laptops.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 70.44 points, or 0.65 percent, to 10,927.07. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 8.67 points, or 0.74 percent, to 1.178.10, with materials and energy stocks leading the way. The Nasdaq composite index dipped into negative territory at moments, but closed up 4.62 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,402.58. 
 Analysts said another factor driving Thursday's gains was an influx of cash into equities as investors adjusted their portfolios for the new quarter.
 The strong manufacturing data revived hopes that factories and plants would continue to help lead the global recovery. In the United States, a survey showed manufacturing expanded for an eighth consecutive month in March. In Europe, data showed a surge in exports helped fuel growth in crucial industries.
 United States Steel surged 3.4 percent, to $65.70. Alcoa rose 3.2 percent, to $14.70.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 10/32, to 98 1/32. The yield rose to 3.87 percent, from 3.83 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Slight Rise in Manhattan Apartment Prices in First Quarter, Data Show

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Apartment prices in Manhattan rose modestly in the first three months of this year compared with the previous quarter, but they were well below the peak of 2008, according to sales reports to be released on Friday by four major brokerage firms.
 Apartments in Manhattan sold for an average price of $1.4 million in the first quarter this year, according to closing data tracked by the firms. That is well off the peak in the first quarter of 2008, when apartments sold for about $1.7 million. The 2010 price is a slight increase over the average price in all of 2009, when it was around $1.3 million. It might be some time, however, before the Manhattan real estate market returns to its frothy heights. Appraisers, economists and brokers all cited as impediments to growth the troubled state of the national economy, the difficulty in getting mortgages and the backlog of condominiums in various stages of construction. 
 ''We're going to see flat growth of prices through the year, if not a little longer,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property. ''We're not going to have any kind of 'V' recovery.''
 The apartments that sold best were far from the sprawling Park Avenue co-ops and glassy luxury condominiums that grace real estate ads and appear in movies and on television. Sixty percent of the apartments that closed in the first quarter cost less than $1 million, according to data tracked by the Corcoran Group. While brokers might point to spending by the very wealthy, it is the buyers of lower-priced apartments who are driving the market, said Pamela Liebman, the chief executive officer of the Corcoran Group.
 ''That one-bedroom market is just really, really busy right now,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''People are taking advantage of the low interest rate, the low price.'' In 2007 and 2008, two-bedrooms were the hot commodity.
 The borough's wealthiest residents were far less active in the market than they were two years ago. Wall Street bankers and hedge-fund executives might have earned record bonuses last year, but fewer apartments that cost more than $10 million are being sold. In the first quarter of 2008, 71 apartments sold for more than $10 million, compared with 9 in the same time in 2009, according to Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens. 
 This past quarter, 18 apartments sold for more than $10 million. That is partly because two years ago, more people were closing on apartments in high-priced buildings like the Plaza and 15 Central Park West. But it is also because wealthy buyers seem to be holding out for bargains, relatively speaking. 
 ''There are obviously people out there who can well afford it,'' said Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens. ''But they, too, are price sensitive and want to know that what they're getting is good value for the current market.'' Mr. Willkie said that sale prices for $10 million-plus apartments had fallen about 20 percent since 2008.
 The end of easy credit that enabled buyers to take out big mortgages has also had an effect. Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, which collected data for the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman, said it was much harder to finance high-priced apartments with small down payments.
 ''You don't have 35-year-old investment bankers putting 10 percent down on $4 million apartments,'' Mr. Miller said. ''The net is not cast as wide for qualifying mortgages. That has not expanded, and it probably won't in our lifetimes.''
 There are signs that more people are in the market to buy. All four brokerage firms reported that the number of deals rose sharply in the past year. Buyers closed on 2,299 apartments in Manhattan in the first quarter, compared with 1,200 in the first quarter of 2009 and 2,857 in the first quarter of 2008, according to Mr. Heym.
 Ms. Liebman said that even in this sluggish real estate market, she had tracked 190 bidding wars in the first quarter. Mr. Miller credited the bidding wars to the fact that while there were 8,027 apartments for sale, a typical first-quarter figure, just a small percentage were at prices buyers were willing to pay. Buyers are simply ignoring overpriced apartments and concentrating on more realistic ones, he said.
 Mr. Miller said the well-priced properties were ''moving much more quickly than in prior quarters.''
 That is a bit of good news for brokers, who point out that Manhattan is still holding up more strongly than the rest of the nation's real estate market.
 ''While other parts of the country have taken years and years to recover, there's a lot of confidence in the market,'' Ms. Liebman said. ''The biggest complaint I'm getting from my brokers is 'I need more property.' ''

HEADLINE: 3 Relatives Dead, Child Feared Speaking Up, Police Say

BYLINE: By VICTORIA CHERRIE

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE -- A 10-year-old girl ran out of her home with her 2-year-old brother to waiting police officers late Monday night. Leaving behind her father, who then fatally shot himself, the girl proceeded to help unravel a grisly murder-suicide, the police said. Two adults and two children were dead. 
 The father, Kenneth Jermaine Chapman, 33, had suffocated his wife, Nateesha Ward Chapman, 34, in an apartment they had recently moved from, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. In the family's new apartment nearby, he stabbed 13-year-old Na'Jhae Parker and suffocated her 13-month-old sister, Nakyiah Jael Chapman -- within a day of killing their mother. With the two children's bodies in the apartment for several days, Mr. Chapman continued to live there with his 10-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son. 
 The 10-year-old, a fifth grader, suspected that her stepmother and siblings were dead, the police said. But she continued to attend school and not discuss the situation for fear that she could endanger herself and her 2-year-old brother.
 Officials at McClintock Middle School in Charlotte called the Chapmans' home when Na'Jhae, an eighth grader, did not show up for class. A school spokeswoman declined to give any details of the call.On Thursday, new details emerged about other warning signs of the family's troubles. Mecklenburg County Youth and Family Services said that it received a telephone referral about the family on Sept. 21. A department spokesman declined to give details about the call but said the information did not meet the legal definition for abuse or neglect or indicate that a child was in danger.
 Two calls were made to 911 about the family: one by a friend of Mr. Chapman's, on March 19, and one by Nateesha Chapman's uncle, at about 11:15 Monday night. 
 The friend told the police on March 19 that he was concerned about a Facebook posting that indicated that Mr. Chapman might be suicidal, according to a police spokesman, Rob Tufano said. The friend said Mr. Chapman had told him to ''check the news in a few days.'' 
 An officer went to the family's old apartment about 6:30 p.m. that day. All the lights were out and no one answered the door, Mr. Tufano said. The officer returned later, but no one answered the door.
 On Monday night, Nateesha Chapman's uncle asked the police to check on his niece, whom he had tried to reach several times in the past two weeks. When officers went to the family's new apartment, the 10-year-old girl and 2-year-old boy ran from the home. 
 Hours later, guided by information from the girl, the police went to the family's old apartment and found Ms. Chapman's body.
 The Chapmans moved to Charlotte from Martinsburg, W.Va., about a year ago to be closer to Ms. Chapman's relatives and to benefit from a better economy, friends said. 
 ''Up here it seemed like everything was all right,'' said Solomon Wright, a neighbor in West Virginia who taught Na'Jhae, the 13-year-old, and her 10-year-old sister in school. ''I never saw the evil. That's what troubles me the most. I didn't see it. If I had, maybe I could have helped.''
 At McClintock Middle School in Charlotte this week, students decorated Na'Jhae's locker with flowers. On Thursday, teenagers marched through Charlotte's Uptown area to raise awareness of domestic violence.

HEADLINE: Eames Experts Selling Their Singular Trove

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
John and Marilyn Neuhart, designers and historians in Southern California, have devoted much of their careers to documenting the life and work of Mr. Neuhart's former employers: the mid-20th-century masters Charles and Ray Eames, known for contouring plywood and fiberglass sheets into lightweight chairs.
 During the last 40 years the Neuharts have organized exhibitions of Eames designs and written books about the couple. (Their third, a two-volume slipcased set titled ''The Story of Eames Furniture,'' is scheduled to be released this fall by Gestalten Verlag.) Their research materials have filled a wall of more than 100 black binders, which the couple, who are in their 80s, have consigned to an all-Eames sale on Thursday at Wright auction house in Chicago. 
 ''We needed to find a home for all this good stuff,'' Ms. Neuhart said. Maintaining it is time consuming, she said, adding: ''You have to look after it. You have to dust it and take it out every so often and make sure no silverfish have gotten in. It's been a big relief to see it go.'' 
 They had not managed to interest a museum in the files. ''The problem now is that endowments are way down,'' she said. ''We were fighting the economy, and we decided not to fight.''
 The meticulously organized lot, estimated to bring $150,000 to $200,000, comes with an inventory about 60 pages long. It lists photographs of furniture, showrooms, exhibits and office and house interiors, in addition to lecture notes and scripts for the Eameses' corporate-sponsored educational films, like ''The Expanding Airport'' and ''View From the People Wall.''
 The Neuharts are also selling a four-foot-wide model of the Eames office in Venice, Calif., which is estimated at $10,000 to $15,000. Mr. Neuhart built it out of wood, wire and photocopies, hanging minute slatted blinds in the windows and tacking calendars onto the cubicle walls.
 Wright has brought in 130 pieces from about 75 other consignors as well: Eames chairs, sofas, radios, dressers, desks, tables, screens and a few birch plywood splints for broken legs. The lots mostly date to the 1940s and '50s, carry estimates of a few thousand dollars and have original surfaces.
 ''With Eames furniture, originality is prized,'' said Richard Wright, the auction house owner. ''People would much rather have a soulful finish than a refinish.''
 Ms. Neuhart said: ''Eames furniture fanatics are just that, fanatics. They get upset about the smallest hardware change.'' She is not consigning her own well-used Eames pieces, which have sentimental value. A decrepit lounge chair and ottoman set, she said, ''really needs to move on now, to the big chair heaven in the sky.''
 Ellis Island Ferry Relics 
 Remnants of a ferry that once carried millions of immigrants to Manhattan from Ellis Island now lie exposed on that island's lawns. Last fall the National Park Service and the Navy raised the ferry parts near the Ellis Island dock, and a dozen rusted chunks of the boat's underbelly are temporarily on display near the tourist boat dock. 
 The most visible piece for visitors is a cloverleaf propeller blade on a seawall. From 1904 to 1954 these parts churned below the decks of the ferry named the Ellis Island.
 Some of its 5,000 daily passengers were boldface names. Fiorello La Guardia commuted to the island around 1910 as an immigration office translator, and in 1940 the pianist Arthur Rubinstein accompanied his children to Ellis Island when they were quarantined after developing fevers during his concert tour in South America.
 In the 1950s, as the government emptied the island's offices and hospital, the ferry was abandoned at anchor. It sank during a 1968 storm. The Park Service has been pondering whether to raise it ever since; at low tide its boxy superstructure and snub-nosed decks long protruded above the waterline. But tests in the last few years have shown that its condition was hopeless.
 ''The hull was the consistency of wet cardboard,'' said Richard D. Holmes, an archaeologist for the Park Service. ''If it could have been saved, it would have been. Nothing was done casually.'' The ferry's dock pilings had rotted away too. ''As the harbor gets cleaner,'' he said, ''there are more marine borers.'' 
 Divers and excavating machinery operators hauled the ferry's mucky shards to the surface. ''Things broke apart in the air and collapsed into the water,'' said John Hnedak, a deputy superintendent with the Park Service. The salvageable metal, including rudder parts and anchors, will be left outside only for a few months. ''It's not imperiled, but we do have to get it back into the water,'' Mr. Holmes said.
 The Park Service will eventually submerge the artifacts near the island shore, wrapping them in an anchored sling that can be dredged up as exhibition plans and financing evolve. One of the chipped and dinged rudders will most likely be displayed in the immigration museum galleries, near a new seven-foot-long model of the ferry that will be delivered this summer.
 Al LaChance, a former Navy diver in Virginia who explored the wreck two decades ago, is building the model based on vintage plans, photos and passengers' descriptions of ferry details. He has spent $4,000 and 5,000 hours during the last three years, carving the parts out of brass and basswood and painting them in their original shades of dark green with white trim.
 ''I've hand-placed 16,000 pins as rivets, one by one,'' he said. The hard-to-see interior is as historically accurate as the shell, he said, adding, ''There are bathrooms, a brig, a sick bay and berthing rooms for the crew.''
 On the deck dolls are dressed as crew members and Chinese, Dutch and African immigrants. Over the head of a tiny skipper at the wheel, Mr. LaChance has hung a clock face. ''I dismantled a ladies' watch to make that,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 21, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Antiques column on April 2 about remnants of a ferry that were raised from water near the Ellis Island dock erroneously included a branch of the military as a participant with the National Park Service in the dredging and salvage process. While the Navy has been involved in previous efforts, it did not take part in this one.

HEADLINE: Susan Tifft, 59, Chronicler of News Dynasties

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Susan E. Tifft, a journalist who wrote sweeping histories of two newspaper dynasties, the Binghams of Louisville, Ky., and the Ochs-Sulzberger clan of New York City, in collaboration with her husband, Alex S. Jones, died Thursday morning at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 59. 
 The cause was cancer of the uterus, her husband said. 
 Ms. Tifft was a writer and editor at Time magazine when she joined forces with her husband to write ''The Patriarch: The Rise and Fall of the Bingham Dynasty'' (Summit Books, 1991). At the time, Mr. Jones was covering the news media for The New York Times.
 With a wealth of detail, it told the story of the Binghams, owners of The Louisville Courier-Journal, and the mutual suspicions, jealousies and rivalries that led to the sale of the newspaper to the Gannett chain in 1986. The family's tortured relationships made for a rich, Gothic-tinged family drama and a cautionary tale at a time when several important American newspapers were being sold to chains. 
 The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the book in 1991, called it ''the best kind of family history -- one so packed with archival fact and telling anecdote that a reader can be excused for believing that at times he or she understands the Binghams far better than they seem to have understood themselves.''
 Ms. Tifft and Mr. Jones followed up with ''The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times,'' the first full-scale portrait of Adolph S. Ochs, who acquired The Times in 1896, and his descendants, who have published the newspaper ever since. The book was published by Little, Brown in 1999.
 Most reviewers found ''The Trust'' a compelling look at the personalities behind the institution, a reminder, as Harold Evans put it in a review for The Los Angeles Times, that ''character counts.'' But at 780 pages it could test the patience of readers. The reviewer for The Cleveland Plain Dealer characterized the book as an ''all-too-dutiful accounting of every leaf on this lush family tree.'' 
 Susan Elizabeth Tifft was born on Feb. 14, 1951, in Rumford, Me., and grew up in St. Louis. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Duke University in 1973. 
 In 1980 she became the press secretary for the Federal Election Commission and the rules committee of the Democratic National Convention. She later wrote speeches for the re-election campaign of President Jimmy Carter and Vice President Walter F. Mondale.
 After serving as the public affairs director for the Urban Institute in Washington, she enrolled in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, where she received a master's degree in public administration in 1982. She then went to work for Time, where she remained until 1991 writing on politics, economics, foreign affairs and education.
 In 1985, she married Mr. Jones. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Sara, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and a brother, Douglas, of Fairlee, Vt.
 In 1998 she and her husband accepted a joint appointment as Eugene C. Patterson Professor of the Practice of Journalism at what is now the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke. 
 Last year the Sanford Institute created the Susan Tifft Undergraduate Teaching/Mentoring Award, to be presented during the annual commencement ceremony to an outstanding professor teaching an undergraduate public policy course. The first award is scheduled to be given at this year's graduation ceremony, on May 15.
 After discovering that she had cancer in 2007, she started a blog on CaringBridge.org that reported on her disease and its treatment. It was a breezy, up-tempo journal whose tone could be inferred from the byline she used in one entry: ''Cancer Chick.''
 At her death Ms. Tifft had completed most of a book for the Penguin Press, tentatively titled ''The Luck of the Gender,'' about the place of women in the longevity revolution.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Issues Rules to Limit Water Pollution From Mining

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency issued tough new water quality guidelines on Thursday that could curtail some of the most contentious coal mining techniques used across Appalachia. 
 In announcing the guidelines, Lisa P. Jackson, the agency's administrator, cited evolving science on the effects of mountaintop removal mining, an aggressive form of coal extraction that uses explosives and vast machinery to tear off hilltops to expose coal seams, dumping the resulting rubble into streams and valleys below. The goal of the new rules, Ms. Jackson said, is to prevent ''significant and irreversible damage'' to Appalachian watersheds. 
 ''Let me be clear,'' Ms. Jackson said during a phone call with reporters. ''This is not about ending coal mining. This is about ending coal mining pollution.'' 
 The most substantial effect of the new guidelines -- which the agency will promulgate to regional offices that issue permits -- will be to benchmark the permissible levels of mining runoff likely to be introduced into the waterways surrounding a proposed project. Operations that would result in levels roughly five times above normal would be considered too damaging. 
 Ms. Jackson suggested that one practical result of the guidelines would be to make it far more difficult for so-called valley fill operations, where layers of soil and rock are removed from mountaintops and piled in nearby valleys and streams, to receive permits. 
 Also on Thursday, the E.P.A. published a pair of scientific reports that supported the new guidelines and announced plans for a new Web-based clearinghouse that will track mining permits under review. 
 Environmental groups hailed the guidelines as long overdue and an important step in bringing science to bear on environmental policy. 
 ''I think it's a very good day for people in Appalachia,'' said Jon Devine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''E.P.A. is making clear that it is intending to follow the science when it issues permits.'' 
 Mining industry representatives, however, said the guidelines threatened jobs in the region. 
 ''America's coal mining communities are deeply concerned by the impact of policy announced today by E.P.A. on coal mining permits, employment and economic activity throughout Appalachia,'' Bruce Watzman, senior vice president for regulatory affairs at the National Mining Association, said in an e-mailed statement. 
 ''The policy was announced without the required transparency and opportunity for public comment that is afforded to policies of this magnitude,'' Mr. Watzman added.

HEADLINE: A Day of Toiling Ferrets, Tasty Ink and a Combative Gordon Brown

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
LONDON -- For some odd reason, Prime Minister Gordon Brown emerged relatively unscathed earlier this year when a book depicted him as a volatile bully who swears at underlings, destroys office supplies and jabs his pen compulsively into the upholstery of his car in a bad-tempered manner at times of stress. 
 Maybe he had such a poor image already that it did not really matter. Or maybe the public actually liked to think of Mr. Brown as a bruiser, said Laurence Janta-Lipinski, a research executive at the polling company YouGov. ''Brits in uncertain times want a tough leader,'' he said. 
 So at first glance, it did not seem that far-fetched when the left-leaning newspaper The Guardian published an article on Thursday disclosing a plan by Mr. Brown's Labour Party to capitalize on his ''reputation for anger and physical aggression'' as a bold campaign strategy in the forthcoming national election. 
 The plan, the newspaper reported, is to unleash a series of tough-guy posters using the slogan ''Vote Labour. Or Else'' and saying things like ''Step outside, posh boy,'' in a reference to the privileged background of the Conservative leader, David Cameron. To counter a Conservative poster asserting that Mr. Brown has squandered public pensions, The Guardian wrote, the new campaign will distribute posters saying, ''I took billions from pensions -- Wanna make something of it?'' 
 Strategists are even discussing ''engineering a high-profile incident of violence on the campaign trail,'' the article said. One option, it continued, may be to have Mr. Brown punch Mr. Cameron in the face on television, forcing ''the bloodied and bruised Cameron'' to go to a hospital where staff members could then ''demonstrate the efficiency and compassion of the National Health Service under a Labour government.'' 
 Of course, the article was written by the dubiously named Olaf Priol, and Thursday was April Fools' Day, when British newspapers like to print fake stories. Last year, for instance, The Guardian reported that it would soon be published in 140-word chunks ''exclusively via Twitter,'' with rewritten archival material, like ''JFK assassin8d @ Dallas, def. heard second gunshot from grassy knoll.'' 
 No April Fools' article has ever quite matched the classic BBC television report about the Swiss spaghetti harvest in 1957, which showed farmers plucking limp spaghetti from trees and laying it to dry in the sun, and which claimed that the year's bumper crop was a result of effective spaghetti weevil-eradication methods. 
 But the papers (and the BBC) try just the same. This year, The Guardian article joined a host of other efforts, including The Sun's assertion that it had invented a new type of tasty ink and that readers should ''lick here'' on an empty square in the paper to try it; The Daily Telegraph's report that ferrets wearing little yellow jackets are installing broadband cable in rural areas; and The Independent's article about plans to convert part of the London subway system into a nuclear particle accelerator. 
 Meanwhile, on the radio, the BBC reported that Shakespeare might actually be French. 
 But the Conservatives were not idle, buying an April Fools' election advertisement in The Guardian purporting to come from the ''Department of Government Waste.'' The advertisement highlights 13 years of ''effective waste maximization,'' a reference to Labour's 13 years in power, and comes with its own fictional department Web site and inspirational video starring ''Robin Ewe,'' the supposed secretary of government waste and in fact a man in a bad toupee. 
 Like the best satires, The Guardian's article contained a nugget of truth. It is true, for instance, that John Prescott, who served as deputy prime minister under Prime Minister Tony Blair, drew admiration for his unreconstructed old-Labour pugilism in 2001 when he punched and set upon a man in a crowd who had hit him in the face with a raw egg. 
 It is also true that Mr. Brown has suffered few ill effects from stories about his bullying and explosive temper. 
 ''It's definitely the case that Britons want a tough and passionate and strong prime minister in these tough economic times,'' Mr. Janta-Lipinski of YouGov said in a (non-fake) interview. He added: ''However, if Brown resorted to physical violence against his opponents, it might not go over so well.'' 
 The Conservatives would not like it much either, according to the fake Guardian article, which claimed that internal research suggested that Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the Tory shadow chancellor, might show unattractive wimpiness in the face of Mr. Brown's physical threats. 
 They ''would in fact not 'come here and say that' if challenged by Brown,'' the article said, ''instead turning pale and running away, or arranging for an older brother to wait outside the Houses of Parliament to attack him when he is least expecting it.''

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Insurance Regulators Reject Most Requests for Higher Rates

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
With the encouragement of Gov. Deval L. Patrick, Massachusetts insurance regulators took the extraordinary step Thursday of rejecting nearly 9 out of 10 rate increases requested by the state's health insurers.
 Mr. Patrick, a Democrat who is running for re-election, most likely against a former health insurance executive, said the move was needed because ''small businesses and working families can't wait any longer'' for relief. The requested premium increases, which were for individual and small-group plans, ranged from 7 percent to 34 percent.
 Small businesses cheered the state's intervention, but health insurers predicted disruption in the marketplace, including voided contracts and legal challenges. They said Mr. Patrick's main target seemed to be his leading Republican challenger, Charles D. Baker Jr., the former chief executive of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. 
 Mr. Patrick's move, which Mr. Baker dismissed as ''an election-year gimmick,'' reflects the political advantage that many candidates perceive in attacking health insurance rates this year. Some analysts considered it a turning point in the health care debate in Washington when the Obama administration highlighted double-digit increases announced by Anthem Blue Cross of California.
 ''Right now, premium increases have never been more political,'' said Sandy Praeger, the insurance commissioner in Kansas and past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. ''If there is any way to justify not granting the increase, commissioners are looking for them.''
 President Obama proposed in February that the federal government be given new powers to rule on whether premium increases are justified and to force insurers to reduce them.
 In the end, Congress did not go that far. The new law requires that the administration review premium increases annually, beginning this year. When rates are considered unreasonable, insurers will have to justify them publicly. But the law does not allow the federal government to control prices, leaving that authority to the states.
 States vary widely in regulation of insurance pricing. In California, for instance, the insurance commissioner, Steven Poizner, is reviewing Anthem's proposed increases of up to 39 percent. But he can deny them only if he finds that the company is not spending at least 70 percent of premiums on health claims, as required by state regulations.
 In Massachusetts, the power to disapprove rates has been vested in the insurance commissioner since 1977. That authority had never been used before Thursday, said Insurance Commissioner Joseph G. Murphy, who was appointed by Mr. Patrick.
 In February, at Mr. Patrick's direction, the state's Insurance Division required health insurers to give the state 30 days' notice to review proposed rate increases scheduled to take effect April 1. Previously, insurers simply filed their increases when the new rates started, and they were rubber-stamped by regulators. 
 But on Thursday, Mr. Murphy denied 235 of the 274 proposed increases. He said he disapproved requests when companies significantly exceeded the region's medical inflation rate of 5.1 percent, failed to justify why varying rates were paid to different hospitals, and did not forcefully negotiate prices with providers.
 Insurers have a right to appeal, and rates from the previous year stay in effect in the meantime. Consumers will receive refunds or credits if they have already started paying higher rates.
 Mr. Murphy said his department estimated that the denials would save consumers -- and thus cost insurers -- $6 million to $8 million a month. 
 Lora M. Pellegrini, the president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, called the denials ''a very reckless act'' and warned that insurers on thin margins might have trouble paying claims. Three of the state's four largest health insurers reported operating losses last year.
 Ms. Pellegrini said the timing of the announcement suggested that it was ''largely political.'' She said Mr. Patrick should focus attention on the primary cause of health care inflation, which she identified as rising medical costs.
 A Boston University study recently found that hospital costs per Massachusetts resident were 55 percent higher than the national average. An investigation this year by the state attorney general concluded that the pricing leverage exerted by academic medical centers played a major role.
 ''Arbitrary government price controls will not solve the problem and will likely cause unintended harmful consequences,'' the state's largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, said in a statement. 
 Ms. Pellegrini warned that government rate regulation would splinter the coalition of stakeholders who have supported the state's pioneering universal coverage law.
 ''This feels like an unraveling of all that good work,'' she said.
 But Barbara B. Anthony, the state under secretary for consumer affairs, who oversees the Insurance Division, said the state had studied whether the rate denials would pose a threat to solvency.
 ''During times like this,'' Ms. Anthony said, ''it's unfortunate, but reactions tend to be hyperbolic and exaggerated.''
 Mr. Patrick has said the price controls are needed as a bridge until the legislature can act on his administration's proposal to restructure the way doctors and hospitals are paid. The governor and Democratic lawmakers are working to construct a system that would pay health care providers collectively to keep patients healthy while eliminating incentives that encourage unneeded treatment.
 Mr. Patrick has also proposed legislation that would give the state new authority to reject unreasonable hospital and physician prices, just as it did Thursday with insurance premiums.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Rebukes Aide Who Left Work on Finance Bill to Be Lobbyist

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A leading House member issued a stern rebuke on Thursday of a former aide who had become an industry lobbyist after working on legislation to overhaul the nation's financial regulations. 
 In January, a few weeks after the House passed the sweeping measure, the aide, Peter S. Roberson, left to work for the world's top clearinghouse for over-the-counter derivatives. 
 The clearinghouse and others like it stand to gain billions of dollars in new business as a result of the legislation. 
 Mr. Roberson left as Congress was poised to subject swaps and derivatives to comprehensive regulation for the first time. One type of derivative, credit-default swaps, was at the heart of the global financial crisis that crippled the American International Group and worsened Greece's fiscal woes.
 Mr. Roberson's departure, which was reported by The Bond Buyer and other publications, outraged his former boss, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He ordered his staff to have ''no contact whatsoever with Mr. Roberson on any matters involving financial regulation'' for as long as Mr. Frank was chairman.
 ''Fortunately, examples of staff members doing what Mr. Roberson has done are rare, but even one example is far too much,'' Mr. Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a statement.
 The episode also reflects the jockeying in private as Wall Street prepares for tougher rules that will require much of the global derivatives market -- estimated to exceed $600 trillion as of June 2009 -- to move from closed-door trading onto more transparent clearinghouses and exchanges. 
 ''It is going to be a very profitable multibillion-dollar business,'' said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and a former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
 Based in Atlanta, IntercontinentalExchange operates the clearinghouse and has close ties to the handful of Wall Street banks that dominate the derivatives market. The firm declined to comment and would not make Mr. Roberson available for an interview. 
 Mr. Roberson, formerly a lobbyist for the Bond Market Association, joined the Financial Services Committee staff on March 15, 2007, and was paid $124,416 in 2009, his last full year on the job, public records show. 
 Mr. Frank said that when Mr. Roberson told him he was leaving to lobby for ICE Trust, the clearinghouse owned by IntercontinentalExchange, he ordered Mr. Roberson to stop working. Mr. Frank said he also told the committee's staff director, Jeanne M. Roslanowick, to take Mr. Roberson off the payroll and pay him only what he was already owed. That occurred on Jan. 25. 
 ''When Mr. Roberson was hired, it never occurred to me that he would jump so quickly from the committee staff to an industry that was being affected by the committee's legislation,'' Mr. Frank said.
 Federal law already prohibits Mr. Roberson from contacting employees on the Financial Services Committee for one year, but Mr. Frank's rebuke went well beyond that. Mr. Roberson was not the only aide to leave the panel, even as lawmakers were confronted with the worst financial crisis since the Depression.
 The panel's deputy staff director, Michael M. Paese, left in August 2008 to be an executive vice president and the top lobbyist for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. He is now a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs.
 Later in 2008, another lawyer, Ricardo R. Delfin, left the committee for the same trade association but moved on after only four months to a position at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He is no longer a lobbyist. Mr. Paese and Mr. Delfin said they could not comment.
 Regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, which have had explosive growth in the past decade, is a major aim of the financial overhaul bill in Congress.
 In 2000 at the urging of Wall Street, Congress eliminated virtually all government regulation of the derivatives market. Brooksley E. Born, the chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1996 to 1999, had urged tighter controls of the market, but was opposed by Alan Greenspan, then the Federal Reserve chairman, and Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, two Treasury secretaries under President Bill Clinton. 
 After one form of derivative, credit-default swaps, toppled the insurance giant A.I.G., requiring a $182 billion taxpayer rescue, Congress stepped in. The House bill adopted in December would give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission regulatory power over swaps and derivatives and would require most types of swaps to be traded through clearinghouses. A similar bill is before the Senate.
 In 2000, IntercontinentalExchange began as an electronic exchange for esoteric energy and natural gas derivatives. Members of Congress have accused it of encouraging speculation. 
 In March 2009, it acquired Clearing Corporation, an independent derivatives clearinghouse, with support from five major Wall Street institutions, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which dominate the derivatives market. The subsidiary was renamed ICE Trust.
 ''I think essentially it is understood that the five big swaps dealers wanted ICE Trust, which is essentially their clearing facility, to take almost a monopoly control of clearing,'' Mr. Greenberger said. The company's closest competitor, CME Group, has only begun to make inroads into derivatives clearing, he said. 
 In 2009, IntercontinentalExchange spent $690,000 on lobbying, including $350,000 with a firm run by two former New York congressmen, Thomas J. Downey and Raymond J. McGrath. Mr. Roberson appears to be the company's first in-house lobbyist.

HEADLINE: Kerry Tries To Nudge Syria To Re-engage With the U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Senator John Kerry met Thursday with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria in Damascus, another indication that the United States is moving to re-engage with Syria as the Obama administration works to resuscitate Middle East peace talks. 
 Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Damascus, Syria's capital, as the Senate takes up the appointment of a new ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford. The United States has not had an ambassador in Damascus since 2005, shortly after the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Syria was blamed for the killing, an accusation that it has denied.
 After his meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Kerry said in a statement that the United States and Syria shared ''a mutual interest in having a very frank exchange on any differences that may exist, but also on the many, many agreements that we have about the possibilities of peace in this region.''
 The United States and its Arab allies are hopeful that re-engagement with Syria may encourage its leaders to distance themselves from Iran, an economic and strategic alliance that Syria has fostered for decades. 
 Mr. Kerry has also expressed concern over Syria's role in providing arms to Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia and a political and social organization deemed a terrorist group by the United States.
 In 2003, Mr. Kerry co-sponsored the Syrian Accountability Act, which imposed sanctions on Damascus. But he has since pushed for renewed dialogue. In a statement last month at the nomination hearing for Mr. Ford, Mr. Kerry said, ''The real challenge is not deciding whether to engage -- it will be in finding a viable path to improved relations.''
 Because Syria is faced with a looming economic crisis as its oil wells run dry, and because it has a growing population of young people who need jobs and housing, Syria has an incentive to re-engage with the West, he said.

HEADLINE: A Cellphone Fine, Billed as Small, Is No Longer That

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
What started as a quest for safer driving could soon turn into a new revenue stream worth tens of millions of dollars to state and local governments. A bill working its way through Sacramento could sharply increase the penalties for driving while using a handheld cellphone, fines that some say are already deceptively higher than had been expected.
 The ban was instituted in July 2008, and six months later, texting while driving was similarly prohibited. Only hands-free talking is now allowed. 
 Senator Joe Simitian, Democrat of Palo Alto, wrote both bills, which include modest fines of $20 for a first offense and $50 for the second. Mr. Simitian said the low penalties made it possible to get the measures passed.
 ''It was easier than it would have been had the fines been higher,'' he said.
 Easy? Even with the low fines, it took six years.
 But as those who stood before Judge Susan J. Greenberg in the San Mateo County courthouse one day last week learned, the fine was never just $20. Additional assessments on behalf of courts, cities and counties multiply the costs of traffic tickets by $26 for every $10 of the base fine. With other fees, the total swells to $114 to $143 for a first offense.
 The California Highway Patrol issued 137,056 cellphone citations in 2009. Analysts say counties and municipalities traditionally issue an equal number, bringing the total to nearly 275,000 -- a possible $31 million collected.
 The new bill increases the base fine to $50 for a first offense and $100 the second time. With the add-ons, the actual costs to drivers would be about $255 and $445.
 At the rate of ticketing in 2009, the cellphone fine increase could mean $70 million a year for government coffers.
 And the courts are remarkably good at collecting that money. In fact, those who complain that government is incapable of operating as efficiently as the private sector have clearly never set foot in Judge Greenberg's chambers. 
 With preternatural patience and charm, Judge Greenberg presides over traffic court. ''Would you like to pay now or in May?'' she cheerily repeated as each person in the full chamber stood before her. 
 Justice is swift -- some cases are dispatched in less than 30 seconds -- with paperwork swooshing down a wooden slide from the judge's bench to her clerk. The atmosphere is so pleasant one might think of those assembled as customers, rather than defendants.
 With the added fees, rare is the fine is less than $100. Ouch. That makes it too much like a business for some.
 ''California takes it to the nth degree as far as piling on these surcharges,'' said Gary Biller, executive director of the National Motorists Association, a nonprofit group that advocates and litigates on behalf of drivers. 
 ''It is a tax,'' Mr. Biller said. ''There's definitely a conflict of interest. It's revenue versus safety versus fairness.''
 Mr. Simitian bristled at that, saying, ''The goal was to save lives, not raise revenue.''
 The ban was responsible for a recent decline in California traffic deaths, Mr. Simitian said, adding that higher fines would further discourage drivers from engaging in a dangerous practice. A Harvard study in 2003 estimated that cellphone distractions caused 2,600 traffic deaths and 330,000 accidents nationwide each year -- and cellphones are far more commonplace today.
 But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has concluded that there is little evidence that hands-free conversations are less distracting than clutching a receiver. And the drop in fatalities could be due to the recession or other factors -- an estimated one million additional Californians have buckled up recently thanks to the state's ''Click It or Ticket'' seat belt enforcement campaign.
 Mr. Simitian conceded that other traffic laws had been misused for revenue purposes, specifically citing red-light cameras known to falsely accuse drivers. He said he was introducing a bill to curb that abuse.
 Skepticism over revenue motives aside, the plan to increase the cellphone fine has also irked bicyclists. The bill would require cyclists to obey the hands-free rules or pay the same penalties as drivers. Mr. Simitian said cyclists had strongly criticized him. 
 While the debate over who should pay, and how much, continues, the business of traffic court continues apace in San Mateo. After hearing a lengthy list of fines, one middle-aged man, asked to make a plea, said, ''I'll have the usual, Your Honor.''

HEADLINE: Financial Reform 101

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Let's face it: Financial reform is a hard issue to follow. It's not like health reform, which was fairly straightforward once you cut through the nonsense. Reasonable people can and do disagree about exactly what we should do to avert another banking crisis.
 So here's a brief guide to the debate -- and an explanation of my own position. 
 Leave on one side those who don't really want any reform at all, a group that includes most Republican members of Congress. Whatever such people may say, they will always find reasons to say no to any actual proposal to rein in runaway bankers.
 Even among those who really do want reform, however, there's a major debate about what's really essential. One side -- exemplified by Paul Volcker, the redoubtable former Federal Reserve chairman -- sees limiting the size and scope of the biggest banks as the core issue in reform. The other side -- a group that includes yours truly -- disagrees, and argues that the important thing is to regulate what banks do, not how big they get.
 It's easy to see where concerns about banks that are ''too big to fail'' come from. In the face of financial crisis, the U.S. government provided cash and guarantees to financial institutions whose failure, it feared, might bring down the whole system. And the rescue operation was mainly focused on a handful of big players: A.I.G., Citigroup, Bank of America, and so on. 
 This rescue was necessary, but it put taxpayers on the hook for potentially large losses. And it also established a dangerous precedent: big financial institutions, we now know, will be bailed out in times of crisis. And this, it's argued, will encourage even riskier behavior in the future, since executives at big banks will know that it's heads they win, tails taxpayers lose.
 The solution, say people like Mr. Volcker, is to break big financial institutions into units that aren't too big to fail, making future bailouts unnecessary and restoring market discipline.
 It's a convincing-sounding argument, but I'm one of those people who doesn't buy it.
 Here's how I see it. Breaking up big banks wouldn't really solve our problems, because it's perfectly possible to have a financial crisis that mainly takes the form of a run on smaller institutions. In fact, that's precisely what happened in the 1930s, when most of the banks that collapsed were relatively small -- small enough that the Federal Reserve believed that it was O.K. to let them fail. As it turned out, the Fed was dead wrong: the wave of small-bank failures was a catastrophe for the wider economy.
 The same would be true today. Breaking up big financial institutions wouldn't prevent future crises, nor would it eliminate the need for bailouts when those crises happen. The next bailout wouldn't be concentrated on a few big companies -- but it would be a bailout all the same. I don't have any love for financial giants, but I just don't believe that breaking them up solves the key problem.
 So what's the alternative to breaking up big financial institutions? The answer, I'd argue, is to update and extend old-fashioned bank regulation. 
 After all, the U.S. banking system had a long period of stability after World War II, based on a combination of deposit insurance, which eliminated the threat of bank runs, and strict regulation of bank balance sheets, including both limits on risky lending and limits on leverage, the extent to which banks were allowed to finance investments with borrowed funds. And Canada -- whose financial system is dominated by a handful of big banks, but which maintained effective regulation -- has weathered the current crisis notably well.
 What ended the era of U.S. stability was the rise of ''shadow banking'': institutions that carried out banking functions but operated without a safety net and with minimal regulation. In particular, many businesses began parking their cash, not in bank deposits, but in ''repo'' -- overnight loans to the likes of Lehman Brothers. Unfortunately, repo wasn't protected and regulated like old-fashioned banking, so it was vulnerable to a pre-1930s-type crisis of confidence. And that, in a nutshell, is what went wrong in 2007-2008.
 So why not update traditional regulation to encompass the shadow banks? We already have an implicit form of deposit insurance: It's clear that creditors of shadow banks will be bailed out in time of crisis. What we need now are two things: (a) regulators need the authority to seize failing shadow banks, the way the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation already has the authority to seize failing conventional banks, and (b) there have to be prudential limits on shadow banks, above all limits on their leverage.
 Does the reform legislation currently on the table do what's needed? Well, it's a step in the right direction -- but it's not a big enough step. I'll explain why in a future column.

HEADLINE: The Ecstasy of Fiscal Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Let's say you're a political consultant. You're sitting there in your West Hollywood bondage-themed strip club with party donors picking up the tab, and, of course, you're thinking about what a great country this is. Swept up in the spirit of gratitude, you decide you'd like to give back. You'd like to solve the country's looming fiscal catastrophe.
 The heart of the problem, you figure, is that unlike yourself, Americans have grown complacent and careless. For 200 years, they lived precarious lives. There were boom and bust economic cycles, devastating epidemics and natural disasters that came without warning. These conditions instilled a sense of prudence. The thought of running up excessive debt filled them with moral horror. 
 But over the past years, life has become secure. This has eroded the fear of debt, private and public. In 1960, the nation's personal debt amounted to 55 percent of national income. By 2007, it had risen to 133 percent of national income.
 In 1960, a politician would have been voted out of office if he had allowed the federal debt to double in a decade. Now politicians are likely to get voted out of office if they try to prevent it.
 These days, voters want low taxes -- about 19 percent of G.D.P. And they want high spending -- over 25 percent of G.D.P. by 2020. As a result, federal debt, which stood at 41 percent of G.D.P. two years ago, is forecast to balloon to 90 percent of G.D.P. in 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By that time, interest payments on the debt alone would be $900 billion a year.
 This whole mess, you repeat to yourself, is caused by democracy and moral decay. What's needed is a moral revival. And who better to lead it than you? God put you on this earth to manipulate voters for the good of the country. 
 First, you need to change social norms. The financial crisis has helped to teach people the dangers of excessive debt, but there's probably going to have to be a public crusade -- like the ones against littering and smoking -- to hammer the point home. Think Warren Buffett TV spots. Think Oprah. Think Tom Hanks. Somebody has to remind the country that excessive debt is selfish.
 Second, the whole deficit hawk brand needs a makeover. Those people are a bunch of schoolmarms: ''You've been bad. Eat your broccoli. Accept a lower standard of living.'' 
 This is still a Billy Mays nation, thank God. The message has to be: ''America can be richer and shinier!'' Debt reduction has to be about renewal and prosperity, not pain and sacrifice.
 That means deficit reduction has to be embedded in policies that produce growth. Michael Graetz of Columbia University has proposed replacing the current awful tax code with a value-added tax of 14 percent, cuts in the corporate tax rate, and a fair income tax with two simple brackets kicking in over $100,000. Many people have ideas to streamline the welfare state. The message has to be: we can afford to have a thick safety net, if it is more efficient.
 Then you have to mobilize the political class. Now some people think their elected officials are so rotten that only an unelected commission can save us. Snobs. The history of commissions is the history of failure. Stuart M. Butler of the Heritage Foundation and Henry J. Aaron of the Brookings Institution argue compellingly that it is simply impossible in a democracy to rewrite the social contract without popular consent. Commissions are fine, but they have to be embedded in a broader democratic process.
 The way to do that is to break free from the polarized committee structure. Invite a dozen handpicked senators and House members and stick them in a room three times a week for six months. 
 After they've come up with a debt-reduction plan, have them send it up in secret to the presidential deficit commission, which President Obama was smart enough to create. 
 Obama hasn't been recklessly brave on this issue, but he's fought against powerful political pressure for a series of mechanisms, which, though riven with loopholes, at least have the potential to control spending -- things like the Medicare payment commission and the pay-as-you-go rules. If he had some support, he'd do the right thing.
 So once the secret Congressional plan is passed to the White House, the deficit commission can unveil the thing as if it were the product of nonpolitical expertise. That would give the legislators some political cover, and all the Johnnies at the editorial pages and the think tanks will go into ecstasy. You'll persuade the Tea Party-types that it will make government less intrusive. You'll persuade business that it will be simple. You'll persuade liberals that the rich will bear the biggest burden. Everybody will pay something, but everybody will see some benefit.
 If you can do that, you will save the country. If not, it's the decline of Rome, and you might as well just stay in the nightclub.

HEADLINE: The Listings: Art

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 Museums
AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'APPROACHING ABSTRACTION,' through Sept. 5. Self-taught artists are noted for producing weird, wacky and otherwise eccentric objects. This exhibition of about 60 works from the museum's permanent collection proposes that the best of them are also adept abstractionists. Few works are nonrepresentational, and most have a vibe of strangeness, but almost every piece is as compelling for its form and technique as for its idiosyncratic imagery. 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20100401 
 ASIA SOCIETY MUSEUM: 'PILGRIMAGE AND BUDDHIST ART,' through June 20. This deftly shaped show, not especially large, spans vast swaths of land and time, from India to Japan, and from the first century A.D. almost to the present. Materially, it's cornucopian, with all manner of painting and sculpture and a camping store's worth of pilgrim travel gear: rucksacks for sutra scrolls, monastic hiking staffs and fanny-pack shrines, not to mention charts and maps, some cosmic, some not. The show traces the life of the Buddha and the circular path his wandering took between his birth and death in northern India. It also looks at the paths of those who followed him through the centuries and to this day. Some have traveled alone and quietly, other in lively packs. The action in a mural-size pilgrimage painting from 18th-century Nepal looks like a raucous scene from ''Canterbury Tales'' set in the Kathmandu Valley. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)20100401
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KIKI SMITH: SOJOURN,' through Sept. 12. Kiki Smith's installation ''Sojourn'' was inspired by an 18th-century needlework, Prudence Punderson's ''First, Second and Last Scene of Mortality.'' There are rich ideas in that work, about the female life cycle and the life of the artist; to these Ms. Smith adds religious, mystical and personal symbolism. The installation's many drawings, peopled with women at various stages of life, can be quite affecting. But Ms. Smith has a tendency to sugarcoat death with craft: flowers, papier-mache, antique glass, gold and silver leaf and glitter everywhere. Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100401
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'TO LIVE FOREVER: ART AND THE AFTERLIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT,' through May 2. Drawing from its own world-class collection of Egyptian art and artifacts, the Brooklyn Museum has assembled an exhibition exploring all facets of the Egyptian funerary industry. It's not a blockbuster, but it is fascinating. It presents more than 100 objects, from massive stone sarcophagus covers and elaborately decorated wooden coffins to little statuettes and elegant ink drawings on sheets of papyrus. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100401
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CONTEMPLATING THE VOID: INTERVENTIONS IN THE GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM,' through April 28. In what it calls ''a self-reflexive folly,'' the museum completes the 50th-birthday festivities for Frank Lloyd Wright's building by inviting more than 200 artists, architects and designers to have their way with the landmark rotunda -- imaginatively speaking, of course. Some 193 responded, usually in digital photographs, depicting it as everything from a place to exhibit their work; to a site for trampolines, forests and aquariums; to a jumping-off point for a redesign. The architects tend to be more Oedipal, but not one really improves upon the space. The list of invitees, while global, is a trifle predictable, overloaded with sculptors and installation artists and noticeably short on painters and photographers, who also have imaginations. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith)20100401
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'TWILIGHT VISIONS: SURREALISM, PHOTOGRAPHY AND PARIS,' through May 9. Considering how revolutionary Surrealist photography was back in the day, it may seem paradoxical that nostalgia would be the mood suffusing this resonant exhibition. But it makes sense. Caught in the throes of sweeping change in the cultural capital of the Western world, photographers like Andre Kerte, Ilse Bing, Man Ray and others were as preoccupied with what was being lost as with what might be gained by modernization, and the images they made are darkly meditative. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERING THE ART OF CHINESE PAINTING: XIE ZHILIU (1910-1997),' through July 25. This philosophically intriguing exhibition presents drawings and paintings by a 20th-century Chinese artist and professor who was trained in traditional artistic methods in his youth. That meant primarily copying and tracing drawings and paintings by past masters. Xie's elegant but unimaginative copies are interesting mainly for what they reveal about how classical artists arrived at works of seemingly effortless perfection: not by observing nature but by repeatedly imitating other artists. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MASTERPIECES OF FRENCH ART DECO,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PLAYING WITH PICTURES: THE ART OF VICTORIAN PHOTOCOLLAGE,' through May 9. This seemingly modest, startlingly reverberant exhibition reveals that upper-class Englishwomen of the 1860s and '70s devised an early form of collage, the supposedly Cubist breakthrough. Adding cutout photographs of family, friends, royals and celebrities to the watercolor albums that were already an acceptable female activity, they created all kinds of witty effects -- drawing-room scenes, trompe l'oeil designs, human-animal hybrids. The effects of Darwinism and the publication of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' register in these amazing works, as does the collective, even osmotic nature of invention. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE DRAWINGS OF BRONZINO,' through April 18. Agnolo Bronzino was the hand to hire for a power portrait in mid-16th-century Florence. He could turn toddlers into potentates and make money-mad Medicis look like decent people. At his peak, in the 1550s, he was the most influential artist in Florence. So why, given his fame, he has had to wait some 500 years for a museum solo is a puzzle. But that solo has now arrived at the Met. Encompassing all but 2 of the 61 works on paper currently attributed to the artist, and justifying each attribution in its gorgeous catalog, the show is scholarly tour de force and a breathtaking demonstration of a sovereign hand at work and at play. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100401
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DEMONS AND DEVOTION: THE HOURS OF CATHERINE OF CLEVES,' through May 2. The need for new bindings creates the rare, maybe one-time chance to see 93 of the 157 surviving miniatures from the extraordinary illuminated book of hours commissioned around 1440 by Catherine of Cleves (1417-1479) in the southern Netherlands. Among the masterpieces of a golden age by an anonymous artist known only as the Master of Catherine of Cleves, it features exquisite, jewel-like miniatures that locate the Holy Family, apostles, and saints in the here and now, among detailed interiors and landscapes and trompe l'oeil borders. The kingdom of God gives way to that of the real. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)20100401
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROME AFTER RAPHAEL,' through May 9. This exhibition of 16th-century Italian drawings from the Morgan's collection covers a lot of ground. It moves, in fits and starts, from the High Renaissance to Mannerism and the nascent Baroque. And it's enlivened by the classic match-up of Raphael versus Michelangelo; drawings by both artists, and their followers, pit Raphael's sprezzatura, or relaxed refinement, against Michelangelo's vein-popping muscularity. Look for drawings by Parmigianino (in Raphael's camp) and the sumptuous Farnese Hours by Giulio Clovio (in Michelangelo's), in addition to splendid Late Mannerist studies by Annibale Carracci. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'BIGGER, BETTER, MORE: THE ART OF VIOLA FREY,' through May 2. Viola Frey's giant ceramic sculptures of men and women are among the underappreciated wonders of late-20th-century art. Rising 11 feet and higher, wearing business suits and ties and nondescript dresses, they have a spookily imposing physical presence and a clunky, cartoonish ugliness. With their blank or seemingly angry expressions, they may remind you of what it was like to be a child among grown-ups troubled by incomprehensible problems. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)20100401
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARINA ABRAMOVIC: THE ARTIST IS PRESENT,' through May 31. The long-building energy wave of performance art hits the Museum of Modern Art with this four-decade survey of work by one of the form's more visible and magnetic figures. And the show's combination of stressed-out bare flesh on film and live bodies, some nude, in the galleries, makes pretty radical fare for the museum. The exhibition is part true endurance-test grit, part pure diva hokum. And it comes with a mission: to demonstrate that it is possible to preserve an ephemeral medium through live re-creations of past work in a museum setting. The demonstration falls flat, but Ms. Abramovic herself is performing a new piece. It consists of her sitting absolutely still and staring straight ahead in MoMA's atrium for almost the entire time the museum is open during the show's run, an estimated 716 hours and 30 minutes, all told. Visitors are invited to participate by taking a seat across from her and meeting her gaze. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20100401
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 7: MIRAGE BY JOAN JONAS,' through May 31. It helps to think of time as cyclical, or at least non-Western and nonlinear, when encountering Joan Jonas's ''Mirage'' at the Museum of Modern Art. The latest installation of a piece conceived in 1976, it suggests that Ms. Jonas's art has a longer-than-usual life span because it's constantly being reborn. In its current form at MoMA, ''Mirage'' consists of six moving-image works arranged in a loose circle and accompanied by a series of props: metal cones, chalkboards, a mask and a wooden hoop, among other objects. Performance, drawing, dance and video combine and recombine in arcane but thrilling ways. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20100401
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: FIVE THEMES,' through May 17. This well-designed exhibition of prints, drawings, films and film installations from the last 30 years showcases the artist's dazzling fusion of charcoal drawing and stop-action animation to excellent effect. The 1990 animations that meditate on the ravages of apartheid remain especially powerful. As the show traces a kind of progression away from, and back to, political subject matter, through a gallery that offers a dreamlike visit to his studio, it also traces his growing role in his own work, first as image, then as actor. And with a forthrightness that is almost touching, the exhibition also confirms that in the contest between still and moving images, moving almost always wins. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20100401
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks.

 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: '185TH ANNUAL: AN INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART,' through June 8. This year the National Academy's Annual has been pared down to 65 artists from the usual 120 or so. Reduced finances are to blame, but happily this juried exhibition doesn't suffer. Quality is high over all, and congestion has been minimized. Painting dominates, as always here, but with everything from photorealism to geometric abstraction, the show still feels rich in variety. The lineup includes the Chelsea habitues Dana Schutz, Ghada Amer and the fast-rising Alison Elizabeth Taylor, whose impressive marquetry work graces a marbled alcove. National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 NEW MUSEUM: 'SKIN FRUIT: SELECTIONS FROM THE DAKIS JOANNOU COLLECTION,' through June 6. This exhibition of works from the collection of a New Museum trustee selected and installed by the art star Jeff Koons might conceivably have pulled a rabbit out of its ethically sticky headgear. Instead it teems with usual suspects, and its overcrowding benefits no one, especially the several larger, more admittedly festivalist works that form its high points. This museum has some rethinking to do, and high on the list should be coming to grips with the size and limitations of its often poorly proportioned galleries. Ultimately the air of complicity is less disturbing than the look of complacency. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20100401
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20100401
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: DANIEL BOZHKOV AND DUKE RILEY, through April 25. Two young and opportunistic artists -- Daniel Bozhkov and Duke Riley -- have found a way to make the most of the Queens Museum's transitional state. (The museum is in the process of expanding.) Egged on by trusting curators and a residency program, Launch Pad, that encourages exploration of the site and the Queens community, they have turned to the surrounding park and its former ice rink for materials and inspiration. Their adjacent solo installations are well worth seeing, if only because they are profoundly at odds with each other: Mr. Bozhkov salvages, while Mr. Riley torches the place in a ''naumachia'' (Roman naval battle). Flushing Meadows-Corona Park , (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7, 2011. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20100401
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'COLLECTING BIENNIALS,' through Nov. 28. Start your Whitney Biennial experience on the fifth floor, with this permanent-collection show of works by artists who were in past Annuals and Biennials. It caps off an extravaganza of brand-new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the fact that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20100401
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: '2010 WHITNEY BIENNIAL,' through May 30. In the spirit of the economically bleak two years it represents, the Whitney has made efforts to under-pitch its 2010 Biennial, and the show lives up -- and down -- to its billing. There are fewer artists than in the past. Its installation is spartan. Spectacle is out. Much of what's in is quiet and hermetic to the point of looking blank. The prevailing aesthetic is the art of the tweak, minute variations on conventional forms and historical styles: abstract paintings stitched like quilts, performance pieces channeling the 1960s, and so. The show feels empty where it reflects the retrenched, art-about-art spirit of the moment. But it also has strong work, particularly in video and photography, that speaks of life beyond the art factory. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20100401
 Galleries: Uptown
 MILTON AVERY: 'INDUSTRIAL REVELATIONS,' through May 1. This knockout exhibition is the first exhaustive look at the artist's depictions of New York City's waterways, bridges and railroad yards from the late 1920s and early '30s, a period most associated with his portraits. But here he is out in the open, already summoning the deft abbreviations of form, space and light that would dominate his mature, far more pastoral landscapes. With more than three dozen works -- one-third of them oils -- this show provides an exciting new view of Avery's development and reminds us that his many-splendored achievement is still not fully visible. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street , (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)20100401
 OTTO DIX, through Aug. 30. The first Dix retrospective in this country provides heady glimpses of the achievement of this ''wild man'' of German art. Few things escaped his remorseless eye -- from the horrors of World War I to the hypocrisies of the Weimar Republic. He made every stop on the itinerary of German modernism (including Realism, Dada, Surrealism, Expressionism, folk, visionary), had a few Cubist moments and, of course, qualified as ''degenerate'' under the Nazis. This exhibition of more than 100 paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings (organized with the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts) doesn't have the scope -- or the space -- to do Dix justice, but it begins to make up for lost time. Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20100401
 'PAINTINGS OF FELIX VALLOTTON,' through April 10. The Swiss artist Felix Vallotton (1865-1925) was and still is much admired for his elegantly simplified, erotic woodcut prints. This show of paintings from 1905 to 1912, all depicting attractive young women in different states of dress and dishabille, is a revelation. Inspired by Ingres, these works offer a weird, frankly lubricious classicism. It would be great to see more. Michael Werner, 4 East 77 Street , (212) 988-1623, michaelwerner.com. (Johnson)20100401
 ED PASCHKE, through April 24. In his toxically glowing paintings of circus freaks, extreme dandies, tattooed ladies and hairy, wingtip shoes from the 1970s and '80s, this Chicago Imagist who died in 2004 explored the dark side of Pop Art. Later paintings look as if broadcast by a television on acid. Jeff Koons, Mr. Paschke's student, assistant and friend, selected the works in this terrific show. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street , (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Johnson)20100401
 Galleries: Chelsea
 R. CRUMB: 'THE BIBLE ILLUMINATED: R. CRUMB'S BOOK OF GENESIS,' through April 17. Loaded with sex, violence, visions and miracles, the stories in the Book of Genesis of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Lot and his daughters, David and Goliath and many others seem custom-made for Mr. Crumb's bawdy sensibility and earthy draftsmanship. His 207 richly hatched, firmly delineated drawings bring to unruly, comical life people and events that often seem puzzlingly abstract in the Bible, from the seven days of creation to the happy death of Joseph at 110 in Egypt. David Zwirner Gallery, 519 West 19th Street , (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com. (Johnson)20100401
 KEN PRICE: 'NEW SCULPTURE,' through April 10. A dozen impressive new ceramic sculptures reflect the continued cultivation of Mr. Price's rich, ever evolving vocabulary of suggestive forms and his radiant palette of layered, exquisitely revealed colors. His biomorphic idiom has encompassed single shapes stretched to extremes and multiple forms fused to bumpy excess. Now combined shapes suggestive of sausage or Mallomars retain their integrity, while broadcasting intimations of the human form: entwined lovers, reclining odalisques and a seated, Matissean blue nude. But, as usual, that is only half the story. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street , (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)20100401
 BANKS VIOLETTE, through April 17. This show has something of a comeback feeling. Its centerpiece is one of the artist's best efforts so far: a big, morose chandelier, made of white fluorescent lights hung low, that resembles a skeletal cabana or giant wind chime, despite the arctic light. Its black wiring spreads like tendrils across the floor to a bank of outlets in a big road case that a rock band might use. Opposite, enormous, rumpled planes of Mr. Violette's signature black fiberglass refract the light of the chandelier. They suggest abstract outcroppings, collapsing billboards and rock arena sets. They're a bit vacuous, but have never been better used. Gladstone Gallery, 530 West 21st Street , (212) 206-7606, gladstonegallery.com. (Smith)20100401
 Galleries: SoHo
 JOSEF ALBERS/KEN PRICE, through June 1. Pairing a German abstract painter and color theorist, Josef Albers (1888-1976), and a ceramic sculptor, Ken Price (born 1935), is a bit of curatorial genius that can make your eyes feel attached to a bigger, better brain. An intricate dovetailing of works spanning several mediums and decades clarifies their individual greatness. The shared passion for strong color juxtapositions is to be expected. Less so are those for Modern architecture, pre-Columbian pyramids, stones, interior spaces (variously erotic, domestic or symbolic) and an oscillation between biomorphic and straight-edged form. Anyone interested in the curatorial arts should see this thrilling show, among the best and most timely to grace a New York commercial gallery. Brooke Alexander Gallery, 59 Wooster Street , (212) 925-4338, baeditions.com. (Smith)20100401
 JOSEF ALBERS: 'FORMULATION: ARTICULATION, 1972,' through May 8. This headlong plunge into all things Josef Albers (1888-1976) presents a portfolio of 127 silk-screens that sums up his art and thought to a remarkable degree -- especially if you read the ''Statements of Content'' explaining each motif. A horizontal installation aids absorption, which can transform your understanding of both Albers in particular and abstraction in general, revealing it to be, unexpectedly, an art of everyday life. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street , (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Smith)20100401
 'THE BRUCENNIAL 2010: MISEDUCATION,' through April 12. This alternative to the Whitney Biennial is the brainchild of the Bruce High Quality Foundation, a five-artist collective that is also in the Whitney show and that is intent on placing some of the art world's more conspicuous functions, like education and the organizing of exhibitions, into artists' hands. The show's fun, but how alternative is it? With its floor-to-ceiling roster of young artists and veteran guest celebrities, it feels like the average Bring-Your-Art festival crossed with a Whitney Biennial of maybe 25 years ago. 350 West Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets , brucennial.com.

 Last Chance
 'BACK TO HAUNT THE HELL OUT OF YOU -- THE SPLENDID AND BRAGADOCIOUS RAVEN CHANTICLEER'; closes on Sunday. The artist Raven Chanticleer invented himself. He was born James Watson in South Carolina in 1928 and claimed to have grown up in Harlem. By his own account, he studied design at the Fashion Institute of Technology, then at the Sorbonne. He opened his own New York shop where, he said, Mahalia Jackson and Big Maybelle Smith were among his clients. He dressed to impress: kente cloth plus plaid. And considering the attention he gave to shaping his persona, it makes sense that he would want to shape others too, which may have been why he opened the African American Wax Museum in his Harlem brownstone. Most of the personalities enshrined there were popular heroes, from Harriet Tubman to Magic Johnson. He molded their figures and arranged their display. If the museum wasn't a blockbuster, it generated buzz. The Amsterdam News wrote it up; so did Italian Vogue. After Chanticleer's death in 2002, his family closed the museum and put the building up for sale. The wax sculptures, it seems, were trashed. But the artist lives on in this modest homage made up largely of personal documents and newspaper clips. Triple Candie, 500 West 148th Street, Hamilton Heights , (212) 368-3333, triplecandie.org. (Cotter)20100401
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN USA: CONTEMPORARY INNOVATION'; closes on Sunday. Less an exhibition than an extra-large design seminar in your head, this dense display presents work by all 78 recipients of the annual National Design Awards, which were established in 2000. Encompassing several generations, it honors individuals and corporations and recognizes historic achievements and some of the latest things. One of these is a specially programmed iPod Touch that serves as an exhibition guide; it puts the show in the palm of your hand and is free. Don't even think about not using it. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20100401
 ANYA KIELAR: 'FACE'; closes on Sunday. In monochrome wall reliefs, a folding-screen and a related sculpture, Ms. Kielar continues her interests in theater, fashion, photography, strong color, early modernism and simple forming methods with a visually amped-up combination of rigor and recklessness. Made of street detritus, the reliefs form giant faces. A possible self-portrait as one of Yves Klein's paint-rolling women accents the undercurrent of gender politics, as do some juvenile titles. A fresh, refreshing effort. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side , (212) 274-0084, racheluffnergallery.com. (Smith)20100401
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SLASH: PAPER UNDER THE KNIFE'; closes on Sunday. The third show in the museum's Materials and Process series, ''Slash'' explores the sometimes violent, always intricate art of paper cutting. The art is impressively detailed and eager to please, though rarely challenging. Among the highlights are 12 site-specific installations that engage the architecture of the museum's year-old home at Columbus Circle in savvy ways. Jane South's ''Wall'' evokes fire escapes, ventilation systems and other elements of the urban-industrial landscape; in Mia Pearlman's ''Inrush,'' whorls of white paper descend on the gallery with gale force from a recessed window. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20100401
 JACCO OLIVIER; closes on Saturday. Mr. Olivier makes films by painting a picture in a loose, representational manner and photographing each stage as he repaints and changes the image. The major attraction here is a mesmerizing, 20-foot-wide wall projection. Colorful, loosely painted images of planets, stars and luminous gases slowly move from left to right against distant fields rendered in Abstract Expressionist-style gestures. It is as if you were seeing the universe through the eyes of God -- or a god -- turning on a central pivot as he surveys his infinite domain.

HEADLINE: Limits Set On Pollution From Autos

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The federal government took its first formal step to regulate global warming pollution on Thursday by issuing final rules for greenhouse gas emissions for automobiles and light trucks.
 The move ends a 30-year battle between regulators and automakers but sets the stage for what may be a bigger fight over climate-altering emissions from stationary sources like power plants, steel mills and refineries.
 The new tailpipe rules, jointly written by the Transportation Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, set emissions and mileage standards that would translate to a combined fuel economy average for new vehicles of 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. Most drivers will see lower mileage figures in actual driving. 
 The rules are expected to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases about 30 percent from 2012 to 2016.
 Officials said the program would save the owner of an average 2016 car about $3,000 in fuel over the life of the vehicle and eliminate emissions of nearly a billion tons of greenhouse gases over the lives of all regulated vehicles.
 Reaching the new efficiency figure will add about $1,000 to the cost of the average new car by 2016, according to industry and government estimates.
 The tailpipe rule reflects a truce between the auto industry and state and federal governments, which have been feuding over emissions and mileage standards since the 1970s. It is the first time the federal Clean Air Act has been applied to carbon dioxide and other global warming pollutants.
 The E.P.A. is now writing greenhouse gas standards for stationary sources, a much larger effort whose impact will be felt across the entire economy. Officials have said those regulations would not go into effect before next year at the earliest, but they are already being fiercely challenged by lawmakers, state governments and an array of industry groups.
 Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said the new vehicle rules would save consumers money and provide an incentive for the development of new automotive technology.
 ''This is a significant step toward cleaner air and energy efficiency and an important example of how our economic and environmental priorities go hand in hand,'' she said.
 The vehicle emissions program traveled a tortuous path through state regulatory agencies, the courts, Congress and the federal government before a groundbreaking agreement announced in May by President Obama, auto executives, labor leaders and environmental advocates.
 The car companies, particularly the domestic makers, had little choice but to accept the deal. Two of the Detroit Big Three, Chrysler and General Motors, were facing bankruptcy and taking federal bailout money. Ford said it was already moving to clean up its fleet and welcomed the certainty of a five-year plan.
 The accord produced a single national standard based on California's tough auto emissions law, enacted in 2004. The automakers have complained of the cost of compliance but welcomed a national plan that does not require them to build different vehicles for different markets to comply with varying state laws.
 ''This is an example of where the federal government has actually done something right,'' said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. ''A year ago, we were facing piecemeal policies set out by E.P.A., D.O.T. and groups of different states. Our auto engineers cannot design vehicles to different standards.''
 But Ms. Bergquist said car companies would need to know what their fuel economy rules would be after 2016, when the program announced Thursday ends. She said California regulators were already working on tough new standards for 2017. 
 Cars, minivans, sport utility vehicles and light trucks will not look or feel markedly different because of the new regulations. Automakers are already improving mileage and reducing emissions with existing technology like smaller, cleaner-burning engines, lighter-weight components, more efficient air-conditioners and seven- and eight-speed automatic transmissions. 
 The rule sets different mileage and emissions standards for different sizes of vehicles, and major manufacturers will have to meet increasingly stringent standards over the 2012-16 period. Vehicles that run exclusively on electricity, like the new Nissan Leaf and the forthcoming Chevrolet Volt for short trips, will be classed as zero-emissions vehicles, although there is a cap on the number of electric vehicles carmakers can claim credit for.
 Small-volume automakers like Porsche, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Lamborghini will not have to meet the new standards immediately but must buy credits from large-volume carmakers who exceed the targets. By 2017, all car companies will have to come into compliance.
 The rule estimates the cost of compliance for the industry at $52 billion over the five years of the program and calculates benefits at $240 billion. Those benefits include fuel savings, pollution reduction and reduced oil imports.
 The government of Canada said Thursday that it was adopting similar regulations for cars and light trucks sold there.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, has pressed for stricter fuel economy standards for years and was a co-author of global warming legislation that passed the House in June.
 ''After three decades of stagnant fuel economy policy and rising gas prices,'' Mr. Markey said, ''these new standards finally put America on the path to making our vehicles more fuel efficient and reducing our dependence on imported oil.''

HEADLINE: Doing the iPad Math: Utility + Price + Desire

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
If the much-promoted iPad is going to be a mainstream consumer hit, Apple is going to have to change the minds of people like Jon Byron.
 Mr. Byron, a 54-year-old banker from Connecticut, emerged from the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan this week with a new business card scanner and serious doubts about the tablet computer trend.
 ''I can do everything on my MacBook Pro, cellphone and BlackBerry,'' Mr. Byron said. ''I don't need any more devices. I already have six phone numbers and enough things to plug in at night.'' 
 For all the exuberance surrounding Apple's new gadget -- and the circuslike atmosphere at Apple stores that is sure to accompany its debut on Saturday -- sentiments like that are, for Apple at least, uncomfortably common. 
 Many consumers do not understand the device's purpose, who would want to pay $500 or more for it and why anyone would need another gadget on top of a computer and smartphone. After all, phones are performing an ever-expanding range of functions, as Apple points out in its many iPhone commercials.
 ''The first five million will be sold in a heartbeat,'' said Guy Kawasaki, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who was a marketing executive at Apple in the 1980s. ''But let's see: you can't make a phone call with it, you can't take a picture with it, and you have to buy content that before now you were not willing to pay for. That seems tough to me.''
 Apple and other technology companies that are introducing a wave of touch-screen tablets face an ambitious challenge. The industry wants to create a market for a new type of device that most people do not really need -- or do not yet know they need. 
 Tablets are intended to allow people to watch video, browse the Web, play video games and read books, magazines and newspapers everywhere they go without the bulky inconveniences of a full-fledged laptop.
 The people who have already ordered an iPad or will show up at the Apple store on Saturday ''are technophiles -- the phrase 'leading-edge technology' sends goosebumps all over their skin,'' said Eitan Muller, a professor of high-tech marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business. 
 But those people make up only 16 percent of the total potential market for the iPad, Professor Muller said. ''The main market is made up of pragmatists, and the same phrase sends them into convulsions.''
 Technology research firms are trying to measure this skepticism ahead of the iPad's introduction. One firm, NPD, found in a study that 18 percent of consumers expressed interest in owning an iPad. 
 Interviews with a range of people over the last week underscored this uncertainty. There was a subtle sense of frustration among some consumers that they were being asked to bring yet another expensive device into lives already cluttered with finger-smudged screens and tangled power cords.
 ''I just want to know, what is this supposed to be used for?'' said Ebony White, 21, a child care worker in San Francisco who has discussed the iPad with her friends, all of whom have decided to pass. ''If I was going to spend that much money to buy something, it would just be a computer, because it costs just as much and it can do more things.''
 She added: ''Where am I supposed to use it? Am I supposed to use it on the bus -- and get robbed?''
 John Morgan, 48, who was visiting New York from Rockville, Md., with his family last week, has already pledged his devotion to Steve Jobs & Company. ''We're a six-iPod family,'' he said. But he vowed they would remain a zero-iPad family: ''It's too expensive.'' 
 His son Alex, 9, added that the family already had an iPod Touch, ''so it's not like we need one.''
 Karla Villarreal, 28, an entertainment and business promoter from Queens, is also an unabashed Apple fan, and dug through her bag for her iPod Nano, iPod Touch and BlackBerry on the New York subway this week. But those devices, she said, leave little room in her technology budget -- or her purse -- for a new tablet computer. ''It's going to be really hard, especially during this recession. So, no more devices for me,'' she said.
 It may be too early to gauge consumer interest in the iPad. Developers have not yet had time to prepare a variety of applications for the device, and Apple has not yet done much of what it perhaps does best: advertise. 
 Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, estimates that Apple will spend $515 million on advertising this year and devote $77 million of that, or 15 percent, to promoting the iPad. If its commercial that first appeared during the Academy Awards broadcast is any guide, those ads will not highlight any one aspect of the device, but will aim to convey a general feeling of exciting possibility.
 ''Apple will position this like they positioned the iPhone: as a fun entertainment machine,'' said Don Norman, a professor at Northwestern University who has predicted the proliferation of multiple screens and devices. ''Their ads will make people feel like using the machine, even if what they're doing with it is beside the point.''
 In some respects, time is on Apple's side. The price of the iPad will inevitably come down, and developers will produce inventive applications for the device, creating new uses for it as they did for the iPhone. 
 The Apple acolytes will perform much of Apple's hardest work for it: toting the iPad into subways and stores, where its presence could have the same head-turning impact that the iPod, with its white ear buds, delivered eight years ago.
 ''It's a want, as opposed to a need,'' said one of those Apple fans, Ryan Kenney, 29, describing his nascent desire for the iPad in New York this week. ''You don't really need it. Between a smartphone and a laptop, that covers all the bases.''
 ''But I'd wear their underwear if they made it.''

HEADLINE: In Pinched Times, a Frugal Winery Builds

BYLINE: By JORDAN MacKAY

 BODY:
As guests of last month's World of Pinot Noir -- California's premier pinot noir conference -- filed off the bus at Foxen Vineyards, the site of afternoon tastings and panel discussions, they were greeted with a surprising sight: a brand new winery complex, almost sparkling in the sun.
 I heard the guy exiting in front of me mutter to his wife, ''How did they manage a new winery in this economy?'' 
The new digs are all the more striking for those familiar with Foxen's old winery and tasting room, just a few feet down the road, which might be more accurately described as a barn and a shack. The old structure's ''ramshackle exterior,'' one publication wrote, ''looks as though it hasn't been painted in 200 years.'' 
 Proudly quoting another prominent wine magazine, Foxen's founding partners -- Dick Dore and his wife, Jenny, who handle sales and marketing; Bill Wathen, the winemaker and vineyard manager, and his wife, Becky, who is a certified public accountant -- once had T-shirts made up saying, ''Rustic, At Best.'' 
 The rickety buildings might have been quaint and even expressed Foxen's laid-back approach to wine, but they had become outdated about 80 years earlier. 
 Yet the question remains: how does a small winery jump from the 19th century to state of the art in the worst economy for California wine since Prohibition? The answer is surprising only in the context of a wine industry whose reputation has been cast by Napa Valley's moneyed ostentation. Foxen's secret was simply a modest farmer's mentality, sound planning and financial discipline. 
 In the 25 years since its first release, Foxen has had a few things going for it. One is that the Santa Barbara County land on which the winery and some of its vineyards sit has been in Mr. Dore's family since 1837. Another is that in its last decade or more, Foxen has been buoyed by a history of high-scoring and popular wines that have perennially left the modest-size winery with more demand than supply. And the business has been run conservatively. Foxen has never had any long-term debt, and its wine prices have always been middle of the road for premium wines. Neither Mr. Dore nor Mr. Wathen took a salary during Foxen's first decade. 
 Nevertheless, plans for a new winery had been in the works since the 1990s, Mr. Dore said. ''In order to grow, we knew we wanted to upgrade.'' Original plans for construction were swallowed up in the three years lost to recovery from the 9/11 induced slump. But by 2005, plans for the new winery complex were pulled from the drawer. 
 Acquiring permits and planning alone required three years and $150,000 of their own money, taking the Foxen team right into the heart of 2008. Part of the excitement of the new winery was a solar array that would essentially take it off the power grid. A Bush-era tax credit for solar energy was due to expire at the end of the year, so the couples emptied their savings accounts to buy in, before they had secured a loan. And then the economy crumbled. 
 The local bank with which Foxen had lined up the loan suddenly had to back out. ''A million and a half into the project and with another million due in a matter of months,'' Mr. Dore said, ''we were informed that we didn't have a bank.'' As every morning seemed to bring news of another financial failing, Mrs. Dore sarcastically remembered her husband's reaction: ''Dick would lay in bed in a fetal position wishing it would all be over.'' 
 Here's where a good track record comes in handy. Because Foxen could show 25 debt-free years of annual profit, Rabobank, based in the Netherlands and a big player in California agricultural loans, stepped forward and agreed to fund the rest of the winery. ''We were almost left with just a half-finished warehouse,'' Mr. Dore said. Loan in hand, construction was finished last year. 
 No Gehry-designed aesthetic wonder as you might find in Napa, the new Foxen complex is 23,000 square feet of airy functionality. The buildings, in Foxen's signature reddish brown, have yet to make their first vintage. But whatever the weather, this harvest will be a good one: no more need for the tarps and bungee cords that used to substitute for a roof over the fermenters. 
 Yet, not only does the old tasting shack still stand, it's also still in use. ''The biggest concern we heard from people throughout all this, was whether we were going to keep the old shack,'' Mrs. Dore said. ''People loved it, despite the fact that there were no flushable toilets, no air-conditioning or heating.'' 
 With characteristic frugality, Foxen has instead turned the shack into a second tasting room, to showcase solely the winery's lesser-known Bordeaux varieties. ''It has its drawbacks,'' Mrs. Dore said, ''but people love that shack.''

HEADLINE: Visit Seen As Signal From China On Currency

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is the number that lurks behind much of modern economic life, a figure that helps shape the fortunes of nations and the price of nearly everything. 
 The number hovers around 6.827. It is the nearly fixed rate of exchange between China's currency, the renminbi, and the United States dollar. And members of Congress say it is proof that Beijing manipulates its currency to keep its exports cheap -- at the expense of American exports and jobs. 
 They want the government to label China a ''currency manipulator,'' which would allow Washington to retaliate against China economically. But the announcement by Chinese authorities on Thursday that President Hu Jintaowill be visiting Washington in two weeks is being seen as the beginning of a possible easing of the friction over the renminbi.
 China experts said it was unlikely that China would have agreed to the visit unless there was at least an informal assurance by the Treasury Department that it would not be named a currency manipulator either on or around April 15 -- the deadline for the Obama administration to submit one of its twice-a-year reports on foreign exchange to Congress. 
 At the same time, economists say the visit, and other Chinese moves, suggest China is finally willing to let the renminbi increase in value. Analysts at HSBC, the Hong Kong-based global bank, declared that ''the latest development should make it more likely for Beijing to start moving away from the renminbi's current de facto peg within the next few months, if not weeks.''
 Before the disclosure of Mr. Hu's trip, Goldman Sachs said that China seemed increasingly likely to allow the renminbi to begin a modest appreciation in the next three months. Helen Qiao, the China economist for Goldman Sachs, and others who have spoken with officials in Beijing said that the currency issue appeared to be under active discussion there.
 But what should be the value of the renminbi? Most Western economists agree that the currency is undervalued, meaning that it would be stronger if it were allowed to float freely in relation to other currencies. But that is about all the economists agree on. Some argue that the currency is undervalued by an astonishing 50 percent or more. Others contend it is about where it should be, economically speaking, saying the currency is undervalued by about 10 percent. Still others say the renminbi may actually be overvalued, because Beijing does not allow its people to trade it freely for other currencies. 
 If that policy were changed, Chinese savers might move money from low-interest-rate domestic accounts into foreign markets, helping drive down the value of the renminbi. 
 ''Every estimate of the appropriate level of the currency is fraught with uncertainty,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, an economist at Cornell University and the former head of the China desk at the International Monetary Fund. ''And it's almost always the case that two methods are going to give you different answers.''
 Much is at stake, both for China and the United States. If Beijing bowed to American demands and let its currency appreciate by, say, 10 percent, the resulting squeeze on exports would shave about 0.86 percentage point off China's annual growth rate, according to a paper by Dani Rodrik, a professor of international political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. A 25 percent increase in the value of the renminbi would trim Chinese growth by 2.15 percentage points. 
 Before the onset of the global economic crisis, Beijing had been allowing the renminbi to appreciate. From 2005 to 2008, the government let the currency rise by about a fifth against the dollar. 
 It is around the dollar-renminbi rate that the economic might of the United States and a rising China converge and, at times, collide. Many economists say it helps explain the gaping trade deficit of the United States with China. The value of the renminbi in relation to the dollar and other currencies influences, to a greater or lesser degree, the price of things as diverse as a pair of Gap jeans and an Apple iPod. 
 Studies of the renminbi usually reflect one of three schools of economic thought about exchange rates. The first is based on trade and financial transfers, known as current-account deficits, of a country or a group of countries. The second is based on worker productivity. And the third is based on the theory of purchasing power parity, which equalizes the purchasing power of different currencies for a given basket of goods.
 Researchers from the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics have created a model based on equilibrium exchange rates. 
 Because China sells so many goods in the United States, it runs a giant current-account surplus. It buys dollars to hold down the value of its currency, and has amassed $2.4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.
 China is running a current-account surplus equal to about 10.5 percent of its annual economic output. But the Peterson Institute scholars estimate that gap should ideally be 4.2 percent. Based on that assumption, they estimate that the renminbi is about 20 percent undervalued against all currencies, and 40 percent against the dollar.
 ''It's a level of intervention in foreign exchange markets we have never seen from any country in history,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.
 Other economists have come to similar conclusions using a different approach -- productivity. From 1998 to 2008, the total cost of labor that goes into producing one unit of output fell 40 percent in China as workers became better at making goods. Had Beijing not intervened in foreign exchange markets, that higher level of output should have led to higher real wages in dollar terms for the Chinese workers as they approached American levels of productivity. But the currency appreciated just 15 percent in those 10 years.
 ''The Chinese government is taxing their own workers,'' said Moritz Schularick, a professor at Freie Universitat Berlin. His co-author is Niall Ferguson, a professor of economic history at Harvard.
 Another group of scholars believes that the concerns about the renminbi have been overplayed. They cite purchasing power parity, a concept often used to compare prices between developed and developing countries. Such models are often used to adjust for the fact that haircuts, meals at McDonald's and other items cost less in poor countries than in rich nations.
 One variation of that model, used by Helmut Reisen, suggested that the renminbi was undervalued by only 12 percent in 2008. He acknowledges that it's probably more undervalued now, but not much more. Mr. Reisen heads research for the development center of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris; his comments do not represent the official view of the O.E.C.D. 
 While he says he is not convinced that China needs a major currency revaluation, Mr. Reisen agrees with many on the other side of the debate that Beijing needs to overhaul many of its economic policies.
 The country, he said, needs to replace its emphasis on exports and investment with a focus on increasing spending by Chinese consumers. 
 ''As long as there is high growth, they can allow the currency to appreciate,'' he said. ''But I would certainly not urge a 20 percent appreciation.''
 Mr. Prasad of Cornell said that one of the most compelling reasons for China to change its currency policy was that it limited Beijing's ability to manage its economy. To maintain the renminbi rate, for instance, the country keeps interest rates very low, which hampers its ability to fight inflation.
 ''Whatkind of constraint is the currency policy putting on its ability to balance its growth? That's ultimately what everybody cares about,'' he said. ''That's what the Chinese care about, and that's what the U.S. should care about.''

HEADLINE: Everybody Wins

 BODY:
The new automobile fuel economy standards formally adopted by the Obama administration on Thursday will yield a trifecta of benefits: reduced dependence on foreign oil, fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and consumer savings at the pump. 
 This was truly a moment to celebrate. But it was tempered by the fact that some in Congress are trying to undo the laws that made the new standards possible. 
 The standards will require automakers to build passenger cars, sport-utility vehicles and minivans that average 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016 -- a 30 percent increase over today's cars, and the biggest single jump in fuel economy since the original standards were adopted in the 1970s. Cars will cost more, but the government estimates that consumers will save an average of $3,000 in fuel over the life of a new vehicle. 
 The standards will also impose the first-ever limits on automobile greenhouse gas emissions, and are expected to reduce fleetwide emissions by 21 percent by 2030 compared with what the output would have been without the standards. Because emissions from passenger vehicles represent about one-fifth of America's greenhouse gases, this is a step forward for the planet. 
 The automakers, who fought the rules until they went bust, have come to accept this as a step forward as well. A single national standard provides regulatory certainty, and they've got to get more efficient to survive.
 Yet some in Congress seemed determined to roll back the laws that got us here. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, and several other senators have mounted a challenge to the federal government's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act -- not just from automobiles but from other sources. The Supreme Court gave the Environmental Protection Agency that authority three years ago, and the new emissions standards would have been impossible without it. 
 There has also been talk in the Senate of eliminating California's special authority under the Clean Air Act to set more aggressive motor vehicle standards than the federal limits. California used that authority to pass a law in 2002 setting greenhouse gas emissions limits for cars sold there. It was the first law of its kind in this country, and it provided the momentum and the foundation for the new nationwide standards. 
 What all of these opponents mean to do is to roll back history and the hard-won environmental protections it has produced. That would be a huge mistake.

HEADLINE: Obama, in Maine, Needles Republicans Over Calls to Repeal Health Care Overhaul

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Me. -- President Obama continued on Thursday what might be called his Go-for-It Tour, traveling to this Northeastern state -- represented by two moderate Republican senators who balked at his health care overhaul -- to dare the opposition party to run against it this fall.
 Mr. Obama ridiculed Republicans for apocalyptic predictions about the health care program and needled them about their campaign platform calling for repeal, repeating the ''Go for it'' challenge he issued in Iowa last week.
 Supporting repeal, the president said, means Republicans would take away tax credits for small businesses and tell some Americans they would have to face a lifetime of debt again. ''If they want to have that fight, I welcome that fight,'' he said to raucous cheers, ''because I don't believe the American people are going to put the insurance industry back in the driver's seat.'' 
 But even before Air Force One had touched down in nearby Portsmouth, the Republican National Committee sent reporters an e-mail message calling Mr. Obama an ''Anti-job Maine-iac'' and dismissing his assertion that the health care program will help small businesses as ''just a bad April Fools' joke.''
 The message went on to ask: ''Why aren't Maine's job creators fooled by Obama's rhetoric?'' and cited news reports quoting business owners in the state expressing concern about the new law's mandates and tax increases.
 Outside the center, protesters made clear their point of view as well with signs like ''Marxist in Chief,'' ''Get Govt Out of Our Private Lives'' and ''Dump Socialism.''
 With supporters inside chanting his 2008 slogan, ''Yes, we can,'' Mr. Obama's campaign-style rally here was to be followed by a pair of campaign fund-raisers in Boston later in the day. The selection of these two New England states put the president right in the face of Republican senators from a more liberal part of the country.
 Maine's two senators, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, are perhaps the most moderate Republicans in the Senate, and at one time the White House harbored hopes of luring one or both into supporting the health care program. In fact, Ms. Snowe voted for a version in committee before opposing the final version on the floor.
 Massachusetts, of course, is home to Senator Scott Brown, the Republican whose election in January sent a warning shot to the White House about public discontent with the health care plan and other Obama initiatives.
 In his speech in Portland, Mr. Obama did not take direct shots at the Republican senators by name, though he did tweak Ms. Snowe by noting that his plan incorporated ideas from both sides of the aisle, ''including some from your senator, Olympia Snowe, who I consider a friend and who spent many hours meeting with me about this bill.''
 The White House said that it invited both Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins to Thursday's speech but that neither could attend. Ms. Snowe's office said she already had a full day of events planned in Maine before learning last Friday of the president's visit. But the senator added in a statement that ''it's always an honor and privilege to have the president of the United States visit our great state.''
 Kevin Kelley, a spokesman for Ms. Collins, said she was on a trip to Qatar and Europe to talk with allies about counterterrorism and offered the same sentiment about the honor of a presidential visit. He added: ''While health care is certainly an important topic, Senator Collins is hopeful that the president will also use this opportunity to talk more about his plans to help create much-needed jobs and address the struggling economy.''
 Mr. Obama said that his health care program would help struggling small businesses through a tax credit for providing insurance. Under the program, small businesses and nonprofit groups can claim a credit for up to 35 percent of the cost of premiums they pay to cover workers, increasing to 50 percent in 2014.
 The president said that Republicans and some pundits had distorted the program with ''a lot of fear mongering, a lot of overheated rhetoric,'' noting that Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, described its passage as ''Armageddon.'' 
 ''So after I signed the bill, I looked around,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I looked up in the sky to see if asteroids were coming. I looked at the ground to see if cracks had opened up in the earth. But you know what? It turned out to be a pretty nice day. Birds were still chirping. Folks were strolling down the street. Nobody had lost their doctor. Nobody had pulled the plug on Granny. Nobody was being dragged away and forced into some government-run health care.''
 Mr. Obama laughed as he continued his sarcasm, noting that headlines since the program passed have described continuing division in the polls. ''Well, yeah,'' he said in mocking tone. ''It's just happened last week. It's only been a week.''
 Egged on by an appreciative crowd, Mr. Obama ad-libbed more: ''Can you imagine if some of these reporters were working on a farm, had planted some seeds and came out the next day and looked, 'Nothing's happened! There's no crop! We're going to starve! Oh no! It's a disaster!'
 ''It's been a week, folks,'' he said. ''So before we find out if people like health care reform, we should wait to see what happens when we actually put it into place.''
 Later in the day, the president made an unscheduled, 15-minute stop at a Massachusetts emergency center to meet with Gov. Deval Patrick and get updated on floods that have been plaguing New England in recent days.
 Mr. Obama diverted his helicopter to the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency in Framington to get a briefing from the governor and state officials.
 ''When these kinds of natural disasters hit, what really matters is the people on the ground,'' he told emergency workers.
 The White House said that Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, will travel to Rhode Island on Friday to look at flood damage there and consult with state officials.
 At the Boston fund-raisers, which drew $2.5 million for Democrats, Mr. Obama repeated his riff and continued his off-the-cuff sarcasm. At one point, in fact, he acknowledged he was indulging himself as he mocked his tormenters in the media and other party. ''I'm starting to have fun, which I should not do,'' he told the Boston donors. He even paraphrased Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s overheard characterization of the health care program, minus the expletive. ''It's a big deal,'' Mr. Obama said to laughter.
 He used the Boston events to crow over the fact that Mr. Brown's election did not stop him on health care after all and to wrap himself again in the mantle of the Democrat whose seat Mr. Brown won, the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ''Massachusetts, you caused quite a bit of excitement around the country,'' he said. ''The sky was falling. You remember that? I'm sure none of you felt that way. But we did what our friend Teddy would have done. We kept up the fight, because it was the right thing to do.''
 Mr. Obama also used the occasion to poke at a Republican rival, former Gov. Mitt Romney, who ushered in his own health care plan in Massachusetts. ''You know you've got a former governor of Massachusetts who's running around saying, 'What's this health reform bill?''' Mr. Obama said to more laughter. ''And I keep on scratching my head and I say, boy, this Massachusetts thing, who designed that?''

HEADLINE: STRAINS EASING, CHINESE LEADER PLANS U.S. VISIT

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ANDREW JACOBS; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Andrew Jacobs from Beijing. Sewell Chan contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tensions between China and the United States have ebbed significantly in recent days, with the countries now working together to deter Iran's nuclear ambitions and with the Obama administration backing off a politically charged clash over China's currency.
 The warming trend was evident in the Chinese government's announcement on Thursday that President Hu Jintao will attend a nuclear security summit meeting in Washington later this month. American officials had feared that Mr. Hu would skip the talks to express China's anger over recent diplomatic clashes, including a White House decision to sell arms to Taiwan and President Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. 
 But this week, the drumbeat of bad news -- and an underlying narrative of a rising China flexing its muscles against a debt-laden United States -- has suddenly given way to talk of collaboration.
 On Thursday night, President Obama spoke with Mr. Hu for about an hour by telephone, a chat that lasted so long that Air Force One had to be held for 10 minutes on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base after landing so that Mr. Obama could finish up the conversation. Chinese television reported that Mr. Hu expressed a desire for healthier ties, while stressing Beijing's sensitivity about Taiwan and Tibet.
 For now, the United States is setting aside potentially the most divisive issue in the relationship, deferring a decision on whether to accuse China of manipulating its currency, the renminbi, until well after Mr. Hu's visit, according to a senior administration official. That decision, the official said, reflects a judgment that threatening China is not the best way to persuade it to allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar.
 Many economists expect China to act on its own to loosen the tight link of the renminbi to the dollar -- a policy that keeps the currency's value depressed and makes China's exports more competitive in global markets.
 Still, the administration's decision not to force the currency issue now could carry political risks at home. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have introduced legislation calling for trade sanctions against China if it does not change its currency policy. And unions and manufacturers cite the undervalued Chinese currency as a major culprit for lost jobs.
 The White House would not comment on the currency issue, but an official said that if China did not take action on its own, the administration could raise the issue again at the Group of 20 summit meeting in June. The White House welcomed Mr. Hu's visit as proof that its policy of engaging with China on strategic issues of common interest had paid off.
 ''We have an important relationship with China, one in which there are many issues of mutual concern that we work on together,'' said a White House spokesman, Bill Burton. ''But there also will be times where we disagree. I think this proves the point that despite those disagreements, we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation.''
 The relationship between the countries was also affected last week when Google, citing Chinese censorship, began redirecting users in China to its uncensored Hong Kong search engine.
 On Wednesday, China appeared to throw its support behind new United Nations sanctions aimed at putting pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. The Security Council has been stymied by China's insistence on diplomacy over sanctions.
 American officials said they expected China to wrangle over the wording of a United Nations resolution, with a goal of watering down the measures against Tehran. Indeed, on Thursday, Iran's nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, arrived in Beijing for talks with China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. The ministry appeared to steer clear from any commitment for sanctions.
 Still, earlier this week, Mr. Obama expressed optimism that the major powers could unite this spring behind a resolution that would apply new pressure on Iran over its nuclear program.
 The administration has engaged in intensive talks with Chinese officials to demonstrate to Beijing the destabilizing effect of a nuclear-armed Iran. A crucial advance, officials said, came in early March when an American delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg and the National Security Council's senior director for Asia, Jeffrey A. Bader, visited Beijing.
 Mr. Hu's visit will take place only two days before the Obama administration faces a deadline to decide whether to label China a ''currency manipulator,'' meaning that it intervenes in currency markets to gives its exporters an artificial advantage. Pressure in the United States has been building to take that step, which could initiate a Congressional process that would lead to slapping tariffs on Chinese imports.
 But given the potential for embarrassing Mr. Hu -- and for sending bilateral relations into another tailspin -- the administration decided not to report on April 15, one of the deadlines set by Congress and the Treasury Department to issue a report on possible currency manipulation.
 Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said the Treasury Department could delay the deadline for weeks. ''As a practical matter, they've got a lot of wiggle room,'' he said. Mr. Lardy added that he thought it was unlikely that China would have agreed to a visit by Mr. Hu unless there was at least an informal assurance by the Treasury that China would not immediately be named a currency manipulator.
 Lawmakers signaled that they would not be easily mollified if the administration gave Beijing a pass on its currency.
 ''The most important issue in the Chinese-American relationship is currency,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who introduced a bill threatening China with trade sanctions. ''It relates to American jobs, American wealth and the future of this country. This issue should not be traded for another.''
 Relations between the countries began to fray in November, soon after Mr. Obama went to China on a state visit that was more circumscribed than American officials would have liked.
 In the months that followed, tensions increased. American officials accused China of thwarting a climate change deal in Copenhagen and Chinese leaders threatened to punish the United States for a $6 billion weapons deal for Taiwan. In February, China's Foreign Ministry called in the American ambassador for a scolding about Mr. Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, whom China calls a separatist.
 But then came a thaw. In recent days, public statements in Beijing and Washington hinted at fading tensions. Mr. Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state, declared that United States did not support independence for Taiwan and Tibet. And Mr. Obama, at an event on Monday for China's new ambassador to Washington, offered generous praise for China.

HEADLINE: The Unpaid Intern, Legal or Not

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With job openings scarce for young people, the number of unpaid internships has climbed in recent years, leading federal and state regulators to worry that more employers are illegally using such internships for free labor.
 Convinced that many unpaid internships violate minimum wage laws, officials in Oregon, California and other states have begun investigations and fined employers. Last year, M. Patricia Smith, then New York's labor commissioner, ordered investigations into several firms' internships. Now, as the federal Labor Department's top law enforcement official, she and the wage and hour division are stepping up enforcement nationwide. 
 Many regulators say that violations are widespread, but that it is unusually hard to mount a major enforcement effort because interns are often afraid to file complaints. Many fear they will become known as troublemakers in their chosen field, endangering their chances with a potential future employer.
 The Labor Department says it is cracking down on firms that fail to pay interns properly and expanding efforts to educate companies, colleges and students on the law regarding internships. 
 ''If you're a for-profit employer or you want to pursue an internship with a for-profit employer, there aren't going to be many circumstances where you can have an internship and not be paid and still be in compliance with the law,'' said Nancy J. Leppink, the acting director of the department's wage and hour division.
 Ms. Leppink said many employers failed to pay even though their internships did not comply with the six federal legal criteria that must be satisfied for internships to be unpaid. Among those criteria are that the internship should be similar to the training given in a vocational school or academic institution, that the intern does not displace regular paid workers and that the employer ''derives no immediate advantage'' from the intern's activities -- in other words, it's largely a benevolent contribution to the intern. 
 No one keeps official count of how many paid and unpaid internships there are, but Lance Choy, director of the Career Development Center at Stanford University, sees definitive evidence that the number of unpaid internships is mushrooming -- fueled by employers' desire to hold down costs and students' eagerness to gain experience for their resumes. Employers posted 643 unpaid internships on Stanford's job board this academic year, more than triple the 174 posted two years ago.
 In 2008, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that 83 percent of graduating students had held internships, up from 9 percent in 1992. This means hundreds of thousands of students hold internships each year; some experts estimate that one-fourth to one-half are unpaid.
 In California, officials have issued guidance letters advising employers whether they are breaking the law, while Oregon regulators have unearthed numerous abuses.
 ''We've had cases where unpaid interns really were displacing workers and where they weren't being supervised in an educational capacity,'' said Bob Estabrook, spokesman for Oregon's labor department. His department recently handled complaints involving two individuals at a solar panel company who received $3,350 in back pay after claiming that they were wrongly treated as unpaid interns.
 Many students said they had held internships that involved noneducational menial work. To be sure, many internships involve some unskilled work, but when the jobs are mostly drudgery, regulators say, it is clearly illegal not to pay interns. 
 One Ivy League student said she spent an unpaid three-month internship at a magazine packaging and shipping 20 or 40 apparel samples a day back to fashion houses that had provided them for photo shoots.
 At Little Airplane, a Manhattan children's film company, an N.Y.U. student who hoped to work in animation during her unpaid internship said she was instead assigned to the facilities department and ordered to wipe the door handles each day to minimize the spread of swine flu. 
 Tone Thyne, a senior producer at Little Airplane, said its internships were usually highly educational and often led to good jobs. 
 Concerned about the effect on their future job prospects, some unpaid interns declined to give their names or to name their employers when they described their experiences in interviews.
 While many colleges are accepting more moderate- and low-income students to increase economic mobility, many students and administrators complain that the growth in unpaid internships undercuts that effort by favoring well-to-do and well-connected students, speeding their climb up the career ladder. 
 Many less affluent students say they cannot afford to spend their summers at unpaid internships, and in any case, they often do not have an uncle or family golf buddy who can connect them to a prestigious internship.
 Brittany Berckes, an Amherst senior who interned at a cable news station that she declined to identify, said her parents were not delighted that she worked a summer unpaid. 
 ''Some of my friends can't take these internships and spend a summer without making any money because they have to help pay for their own tuition or help their families with finances,'' she said. ''That makes them less competitive candidates for jobs after graduation.''
 Of course, many internships -- paid or unpaid -- serve as valuable steppingstones that help young people land future jobs. ''Internships have become the gateway into the white-collar work force,'' said Ross Perlin, a Stanford graduate and onetime unpaid intern who is writing a book on the subject. ''Employers increasingly want experience for entry-level jobs, and many students see the only way to get that is through unpaid internships.'' 
 Trudy Steinfeld, director of N.Y.U.'s Office of Career Services, said she increasingly had to ride herd on employers to make sure their unpaid internships were educational. She recently confronted a midsize law firm that promised one student an educational $10-an-hour internship. The student complained that the firm was not paying him and was requiring him to make coffee and sweep out bathrooms.
 Ms. Steinfeld said some industries, most notably film, were known for unpaid internships, but she said other industries were embracing the practice, seeing its advantages. 
 ''A few famous banks have called and said, 'We'd like to do this,' '' Ms. Steinfeld said. ''I said, 'No way. You will not list on this campus.' ''
 Dana John, an N.Y.U. senior, spent an unpaid summer at a company that books musical talent, spending much of her days photocopying, filing and responding to routine e-mail messages for her boss.
 ''It would have been nice to be paid, but at this point, it's so expected of me to do this for free,'' she said. ''If you want to be in the music industry that's the way it works. If you want to get your foot in the door somehow, this is the easiest way to do it. You suck it up.''
 The rules for unpaid interns are less strict for non-profit groups like charities because people are allowed to do volunteer work for non-profits.
 California and some other states require that interns receive college credit as a condition of being unpaid. But federal regulators say that receiving college credit does not necessarily free companies from paying interns, especially when the internship involves little training and mainly benefits the employer.
 Many employers say the Labor Department's six criteria need updating because they are based on a Supreme Court decision from 1947, when many apprenticeships were for blue-collar production work. 
 Camille A. Olson, a lawyer based in Chicago who represents many employers, said: ''One criterion that is hard to meet and needs updating is that the intern not perform any work to the immediate advantage of the employer. In my experience, many employers agreed to hire interns because there is very strong mutual advantage to both the worker and the employer. There should be a mutual benefit test.''
 Kathyrn Edwards, a researcher at the Economic Policy Institute and co-author of a new study on internships, told of a female intern who brought a sexual harassment complaint that was dismissed because the intern was not an employee.
 ''A serious problem surrounding unpaid interns is they are often not considered employees and therefore are not protected by employment discrimination laws,'' she said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 10, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article last Saturday about the increasing numbers of college students taking unpaid internships, using erroneous information from a report by the Economic Policy Institute, misstated the results of a 2008 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers and also the results of a Northwestern University study in 1992 . The NACE survey found that 50 percent of graduating students had participated in internships, not 83 percent. The university study found that of graduating students in 1992, 17 percent -- not 9 percent -- had held internships.

HEADLINE: Pension Funds Still Waiting for Big Payoff From Private Equity

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Private equity deal-makers, those kings of corporate buyouts, made billions for themselves when times were good. But some of their biggest investors, public pension funds, are still waiting for the hefty rewards they were promised. 
 The nation's 10 largest public pension funds have paid private equity firms more than $17 billion in fees since 2000, according to a new analysis conducted for The New York Times, as the funds flocked to these so-called alternative investments in hopes of reaping market-beating returns. 
 But few big public funds ended up collecting the 20 to 30 percent returns that private equity managers often held out to attract pension money, a review of the funds' performance shows. 
 Many public pension funds are struggling to recover from a collapse in the value of their portfolios, despite large private equity investments that were supposed to help cushion their losses. 
 Fees are at the center of the debate over the divergent fortunes of private equity managers and their investors, because fees often make a big dent in any investment gains.
 That ''raises the question as to why they accept to pay this level of fees,'' said Oliver Gottschalg, a professor at the HEC School of Management in Paris who conducted the study on private equity fees.
 State and local pension assets declined by 27.6 percent from the end of 2007 to the end of 2008, wiping out $900 billion, according to the Government Accountability Office. 
 Those poor returns have rankled some longtime private equity investors like the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers. In September 2009, it ''strongly endorsed'' principles proposed by the Institutional Limited Partners Association, which represents private equity investors, to keep management fees in check and improve disclosure about fund performance. 
 The funds vary in how they report their performance and calculate their returns, allowing a significant number to classify themselves as ''top quartile,'' or the best performers. 
 ''The fees paid to private equity managers has been a source of great frustration,'' Joseph A. Dear, the chief investment officer for Calpers, said in an interview, adding that the managers ''shouldn't be making a profit on the management fee. They should make money when their investors make money.''
 Still, despite the high fees, he said the funds' performance had been good. ''We don't expect 20 percent,'' he said. ''We expect 3 percent more than public markets, net of fees.''
 Private equity executives generally say their fees are justified by their market-beating returns. Reached by e-mail on Friday, Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for the Private Equity Council, the industry's trade association, declined to comment.
 Public funds pay a lot of money to managers of so-called alternative investments like private equity, venture capital, real estate and hedge funds. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System paid $477.5 million in fees -- 20 percent more than it did in 2008 and 283 percent more than in 2000, the earliest year for which data was available. 
 These funds generally charge fees totaling 2 percent of the money they manage and then take 20 percent of the profits they generate. 
 And yet, even after paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, the Pennsylvania fund is ailing. It lost more than a quarter of its value during its latest fiscal year and is now worth less than it was a decade ago, although its performance has improved recently. 
 Private equity owes its explosive growth largely to America's pension funds. Buyout funds raised $200 million in 1980 and $200 billion in 2007. According to Prequin, a financial data provider, public pension funds were the biggest contributors over that period and now have $115.9 billion invested in private equity. 
 But these investments have not worked out as well as many had hoped. According to data from the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service, the median returns for public pension funds with assets greater than $5 billion were negative 18.8 percent over one year, negative 2.8 percent over three years, and 2.4 percent over five years. 
 Indeed, research conducted by several university professors challenge the private equity firms' premise that returns beat the stock market over long periods of time. 
 Two professors, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago and Per Stromberg of the Stockholm School of Economics, contend that, after fees, many private equity investments just about match or even trail the returns of the broad stock market between 1980 and 2001. 
 Additional research by Ludovic Phalippou of the University of Amsterdam and Mr. Gottschalg of the HEC School of Management shows that private equity funds underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 3 percent annually from 1980 to 2003, after accounting for fees.
 To be sure, private equity returns have beaten abysmal stock market returns over the last decade, helping to provide a cushion at some funds. For Pennsylvania's public school workers, the 10-year return for private equity was 9.5 percent, even after deducting for fees, compared to 3.6 percent for all assets, including stocks and bonds. 
 The largest pension fund investors put a significant chunk of their money in private equity during the bubble years, from 2005 to 2008, according to a separate analysis by Mr. Gottschalg. Of the top 10 pension funds, eight invested more than 45 percent of their total capital in private equity during that period. 
 Mr. Kaplan said that the funds started during the boom years, so-called vintage funds, were likely to disappoint investors. 
 ''The deals of 2006 and 2007 will not perform very well,'' Mr. Kaplan said, referring to mergers and acquisitions led by private equity firms that have not yet been cashed out through a sale. 
 Some big funds are doubling down on private equity anyway. In November 2007, the Washington State Investment Board, whose $75 billion fund is among the most heavily invested in private equity, increased its commitment to that asset class to 25 percent, from 15 percent, and its real estate allocation to 13 percent, from 12 percent.
 Others, however, are retrenching. As of last September, the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System, a $24.3 billion fund that is distinct from the school workers' fund, had 23 percent of its pension investments in hedge funds, another 23 percent in private equity and venture capital, and an additional 8.4 percent in real estate -- bringing its total in alternative investments to more than 54 percent. 
 A spokesman for the fund, Robert Gentzel, said it was working to scale back those allocations to 12 percent for private equity and venture capital and 9 percent for hedge funds.

A judge in California dismissed a lawsuit on Thursday that would have barred the American International Group from moving any assets out of that state until an independent audit could verify the company's financial condition. 
 The request for an injunction came from Linda M. Harris, a financial planner in California, and three of her clients, all of whom had bought annuities from an A.I.G. subsidiary, SunAmerica. The four claimed after the government's bailout of A.I.G. in 2008 that they had been deceived about the company's financial strength and wanted to know if their annuities were secure. 
 In some cases, the plaintiffs cashed in their annuities prematurely, surrendering some of their benefits and incurring tax penalties. Others left the contracts in place but argued that their value had fallen because of the uncertainty over A.I.G.'s future. 
 They filed their original complaint in May 2009, under a California statute known as the Unfair Competition Law that offers equitable relief, such as injunctions and restitutions. 
 But Judge Yvette M. Palazuelos of Superior Court in Los Angeles ruled Thursday that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring a suit under that law. She did not discuss the merits of their arguments about A.I.G.'s business practices, saying that her role was ''to test the legal sufficiency of a complaint, but not the truthfulness of the allegations.'' 
 The judge said that before Ms. Harris and her clients could sue, they had to show that they had ''suffered injury in fact'' or had ''lost money or property.'' The plaintiffs who still held A.I.G. annuities had argued that the decline in the value of the contracts constituted such a loss, but the judge found that ''far too speculative and conjectural.'' 
 Those who had pulled their money out of A.I.G. argued that their tax penalties constituted injuries. But Judge Palazuelos noted that tax penalties were imposed on all premature annuity withdrawals, independent of the behavior of the issuer. Even if she granted an injunction, she said, the plaintiffs would still owe tax penalties, so the unfair competition law offered them no relief. 
 The judge also cited the doctrine of equitable abstention, which she said held that ''a court of equity has the discretion to withhold its aid.'' She relied on precedent from a case involving health insurance reimbursements, where the court found that if a case ''would drag a court of equity into an area of complex economic policy,'' the judge should abstain, because economic policy making was better left to legislators than judges.
 In this case, the judge said, assessing the propriety of A.I.G.'s business decisions and fashioning remedies for any wrongs were better left to the state insurance commission. 
 Mark Herr, a spokesman for A.I.G., said the company was ''pleased with the court's decision.''

HEADLINE: Trustees Find Cultural Board Seats Are Still Highly Coveted Luxury Items

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Like Prada handbags and Hermes scarves, a spot on one of New York City's most prestigious cultural boards never goes on sale, even in a recession.
 Looking to join the power set at the Metropolitan Museum of Art? Be ready with a check for as much as $10 million. The price of admission can reach that high at the Museum of Modern Art, and remains roughly $5 million at the New York Public Library, according to people involved in the process.
 ''For those who can, we have an expectation and we try to be very clear about that expectation,'' said Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, whose board members are generally asked to contribute $250,000 upfront and on an annual basis.
 Sometimes the generosity of veteran trustees will exceed expectations. Consider the $30 million gift Ann Ziff made last month to the Metropolitan Opera, which simultaneously announced that she is to become its next chairwoman. 
 The pressure to raise money from volunteer boards has intensified as the economy slumped and broader charitable giving declined.
 Yet even with weakened portfolios, many people of means remain willing to answer the call because a spot on a cultural board is among the most coveted prizes in a city of strivers and mega-achievers. And spots are limited: the New York City Ballet, for example, has 40 voting members; the Museum of Natural History has 56.
 The rewards of service are many: social status, the personal satisfaction of doing good, the chance to rub shoulders with Rockefellers and Lauders, and a say in setting the intellectual course of the nation, if not the world, through a leading museum or performing arts institution.
 ''People want to be part of winners,'' said Sanford I. Weill, Carnegie Hall's chairman and a former chairman of Citigroup. 
 Money alone is not an automatic ticket onto such boards. As one trustee put it, there is no ''cash register at the door.'' Some people with considerable wealth do not make the grade if they cannot demonstrate a significant passion for the arts. Others of more modest means often do, because they can contribute in other ways, perhaps by offering their artistic expertise or legal advice, or their time in serving on a committee that evaluates art or plans an event.
 Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard professor; David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker magazine; and Calvin Trillin, the essayist, all serve on the New York Public Library Board. Carnegie Hall counts several musicians on its board, including Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax and Lang Lang.
 ''We are looking for time, talent and treasure,'' Mr. Levy said. ''A board is the institution's intelligent memory. It is the institution's conscience and it comprises the institution's principal support.''
 But with endowments suffering -- even a heavyweight like the Metropolitan Museum reduced its staff last year by 14 percent -- cultural organizations often depend for their very existence on the kindness, and deep pockets, of their trustees.
 ''Give, get or get off,'' is a motto many in the cultural world know well. Trustees who cannot donate from their personal funds are expected to raise an equivalent amount from others or, in the case of museums, perhaps help the institution acquire art that has long been sought for its collection.
 ''The conversation about give or get is not easy,'' said Peter L. Malkin, the co-chairman of Lincoln Center's nominating committee. ''It's almost like raising money for a candidate. But if you're going to be on the board, you have to be prepared to give and you have to ask people for support.''
 Increasingly, several trustees said, boards are becoming more explicit about their price of admission because they believe the wink-and-a-nod of the past left too many opportunities for misunderstanding.
 Diana DiMenna, who over the last few years has joined the boards of the Noguchi Museum and several others, said she requests that an institution be forthright about its financial expectations. ''If someone doesn't state it, I ask,'' she said. ''I wouldn't want to disappoint. I want to make sure we're both saying yes to the same thing.''
 Boards sometimes adjust their expectations to a person's net worth, with someone on the Forbes 400 often asked to donate more than, say, a real estate lawyer.
 ''We expect people to give what they can give,'' said James R. Houghton, the chairman of the Metropolitan Museum. ''We have people who can give nothing but are good at understanding what makes the museum great. Some people are culturally adept or know people in the city.''
 The Met, one of the most famous museums in the world, is the priciest in New York because it sits at the pinnacle of the city's boards, people in the art world say, with MoMA a close second. ''The touchstone is the Met,'' said Susana Torruella Leval, a Met trustee who formerly served as the director of El Museo del Barrio.
 Performing arts boards are typically less expensive. New Lincoln Center trustees, for example, are generally expected to donate $250,000, although they are also asked to give larger amounts in one-time contributions to its building campaign. (Gifts have ranged from $3 million to $25 million). 
 Trustees who get on boards cannot put away their checkbooks. They are expected to make annual donations for tables at galas, contribute to building campaigns or, in the case of museums, to help with acquisitions. At the Whitney Museum of Art, for example, trustees on acquisition committees -- many of whom have a long history as private collectors -- contribute each year toward the purchase of art, contributions that typically range from $5,000 to $25,000.
 Sometimes trustees give considerably more, like the $100 million the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman gave in 2008 to the library's Fifth Avenue flagship building, which is now named after him.
 And trustees have to be prepared to commit to the less-glamorous business of showing up for meetings to oversee a cultural institution -- approving its programs and budgets, investing its endowments and managing its physical plant. 
 Those trustees who fail to pull their weight are gently urged off or not renominated. Some are moved to emeritus status, where they can attend meetings but not vote. Institutions are not heartless, though, Mr. Levy said.
 ''We are not summer soldiers and sunshine patriots,'' he said. ''These are relationships. If someone is going through a rocky time, we want them to stay on the board in the hopes that their fortunes will turn -- and they often do.''
 The vetting of prospective trustees can be a drawn-out process. ''You try to introduce them to your institution over a period of years,'' said Mr. Schwarzman, who is also on the boards of the Frick Collection and the Asia Society. ''It's not like a blind date where you're going steady in the first evening.''
 Judson C. Linville, the president and chief executive of consumer services for American Express, said he couldn't turn down Lincoln Center when it called. Joining its board, he was told, would mean he would ''live longer and have a certain path to heaven.''
 Occasionally multiple boards approach the same candidate. Lincoln Center successfully sought out David M. Rubenstein, the co-founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms, even though he was based in Washington and already served on the board of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts there.
 Similarly, Annette de la Renta, the philanthropist married to the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, is on the boards of the Metropolitan Museum and of the public library. Joel S. Ehrenkranz, a lawyer, is on the boards of MoMA, Lincoln Center and the Whitney; so is Thomas H. Lee, who runs a private equity firm.
 Many trustees say they resent the depiction of their service as an effort to win stature or fame.
 Ms. DiMenna said she sought an opportunity to collaborate with accomplished people in serving the goals of important institutions for with which she had developed an affinity. ''I get to work on behalf of organizations that I love,'' she said. ''I never want people to think philanthropy is getting your picture taken at a gala.'' 
 Ms. DiMenna said she would consider joining other boards in addition to those she is already involved with. (She is a trustee at the Central Park Conservancy, Jazz at Lincoln Center and the Baryshnikov Arts Center; her husband, Joseph DiMenna, a hedge fund manager, is a trustee at the New York Historical Society and the Orchestra of St. Luke's.) But, she added, ''I don't have a target organization because I haven't met them or they haven't met me.'' 
 Generally, boards seek out trustees -- rather than the other way around -- and sometimes boards appear to be grooming prospects through their young donor circles. Candidates seem to know not to appear too eager. 
 Richard Hurowitz, 35, a founder of Octavian Advisors, an investment firm, and his wife, Sharon, have supported several institutions and has belonged to membership groups at both the Met and MoMA. But they have yet to join -- or to ask to join -- a cultural board.
 ''It is obviously a tremendous honor and privilege to serve on the board of these institutions, and something I would love to do one day,'' Mr. Hurowitz said. ''We've been interested in increasing our involvement.''

HEADLINE: Promises for and From Haiti

 BODY:
This week's donors conference for Haiti at the United Nations was strikingly hopeful, in good part because of what participants pledged not to do.
 The promises of action were important: Nearly 60 nations and organizations said they would give $5.3 billion in the next two years, and almost $10 billion in the next decade, to help Haiti rebuild from the Jan. 12 earthquake. The United States committed $1.15 billion, in addition to the $900 million it has already spent. 
 Along with that generosity, major donor countries promised not to repeat the old failed strategy of poorly coordinated projects that wither through waste and neglect. Nongovernmental agencies, which -- often for sound reasons -- are used to bypassing the Haitian government, pledged to channel their efforts through a redevelopment plan proposed by Haiti and jointly administered by Haitian officials and the largest donors. 
 Haiti's president, Rene Preval, and prime minister, Jean-Max Bellerive, acknowledged the need for their notoriously ineffective and corrupt government to do things very differently. They promised to work with the international community to create, and then abide by, new structures to track the billions being given. 
 The promises are accompanied by an ambitious plan to build new roads, ports, bridges and desperately needed housing outside the shattered capital of Port-au-Prince. It also calls for building the necessities of a functioning society: systems of justice, policing, education. 
 There are still a lot of buts. Pledges need to turn into donations. While billions of dollars are needed for the future, the government needs hundreds of millions now to meet its payroll and other expenses in the coming year. We, too, are leery of handing cash directly to Haiti's government, but the call for budget support has the persuasive endorsement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
 Many excellent-sounding ideas have not yet been fleshed out. One is the plan to create an interim reconstruction committee led by Mr. Bellerive and former President Bill Clinton, a United Nations envoy to Haiti, that would evolve into a Haitian-led Haitian Development Authority -- how will that work? How will the diaspora be able to contribute, beyond sending cash? And, perhaps most important, when and how will the system for following the money and the projects be put in place? 
 The plans are complicated, too, by the deeply inadequate relief effort. More than a million earthquake survivors are homeless. They want to see a new Haiti someday, but right now they need safe shelter, food and water. And they know that the same leaders who are hatching ambitious plans now were also overwhelmed and distressingly absent in the quake's horrific aftermath. 
 Haiti is awash in promises. Haitians need to see results. If dismal history repeats itself, this week would be the high point of optimism, followed by a long slide into disillusionment and failure. That must not happen again.

HEADLINE: Help Paying Mortgages Elicits Anger

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
The angry comments flooded in after the federal government announced it was expanding its program to assist unemployed homeowners, as well as borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are now worth. 
 Why, some asked on The New York Times Web site, should we have to pay for the mistakes of homeowners who lived far beyond their means when credit was easy to get? Shouldn't they pay for their own mistakes?
 A few wrote in to say the government was doing the right thing because helping those in need now would spare many more homeowners pain later. 
 All of the comments, however, went right to the heart of the criticism of all of the government's bailout programs. After all, the aid for homeowners comes in the wake of bailouts for the banks and the American International Group, and then the auto industry. In every case, taxpayer money was on the line. So you can understand all of the anger about paying to fix problems not of their own making. 
 But it made me think about what would be at stake if the government did nothing at all. A government should consider the greater good over the long term, of course, and not just the immediate question of what is fair. 
 Still, the commenters raised a number of valid questions about the mortgage assistance program. Is the government just propping up the real estate market? Shouldn't the market just run its course? And why do renters always fall so low on the economic totem pole?
 Under the government's latest initiative, for instance, some unemployed homeowners will be permitted to make smaller mortgage payments while they get back on their feet -- yet unemployed renters receive nothing. Another part of the program increases the incentives paid to the banks to permanently reduce loan amounts for some homeowners who simply owe more than their homes are worth, as long as they are still current on their payments. No hardship is required.
 Is that fair? Of course not. Will some irresponsible homeowners receive help they don't really deserve? Probably.
 But let's not forget that many distressed homeowners were the victims of bad timing, poor understanding of the loans they were signing up for and a slumping economy. Many families stretched themselves too thin so they could buy into the American dream of home ownership -- an idea supported by both Democrats and Republicans, not to mention the tax code. And some people simply had the misfortune to buy at the top of the market in precisely the wrong area. 
 ''It shouldn't be something people should be punished for,'' said Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist who helped develop Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Index of housing prices. ''It was a national mistake. President Bush, in his weekly radio addresses, was extolling the benefits of homeownership. Implicit in this, he was telling people they were doing the right thing to take these highly leveraged mortgage loans. We can't reasonably think people should be punished for doing that when there is a crisis that is not of their doing.''
 Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com, made much the same argument. ''It isn't completely fair, but we are helping a large number of homeowners who got into this foreclosure nightmare through no fault of their own,'' he said. ''The odds are just too high that if we didn't do something like this, the housing crash would continue on and undermine the recovery.
 ''Nothing in our economy does all that well when house prices are declining,'' he went on, ''because it's still the most important asset in the family balance sheet.'' Beyond that, he said: ''No one will extend credit while home prices are declining. Further declines will push more homeowners underwater, resulting in more foreclosures and more house price declines.''
 There is also the risk that more people will decide that they are so far underwater -- that is, they owe so much more than their homes are worth -- that it makes more sense to just walk away. Experts say people become more likely to walk once their mortgage exceeds their home value by more than 20 percent. 
 As of the third quarter of last year, more than 10 million homeowners -- or about one in eight -- owed more than 120 percent of their homes' worth, according to Moody's Economy.com. Nearly 4.6 million owed 50 percent more than their homes' value. 
 The numbers make it easier to understand why the government is trying to strengthen the program -- earlier efforts have not come close to helping the three million to four million homeowners the Treasury initially hoped. Mr. Zandi said he expected that the federal initiatives would ultimately help a fraction of those troubled borrowers, about 1.45 million. 
 But to truly break the cycle of declining home values, most experts agree that mortgage servicers must reduce the principal of the mortgage. (To be fair, Bank of America recently announced a plan to cut up to $3 billion for a select group of 45,000 borrowers.) As part of the expandedprogram, the Treasury is being paid higher incentives to erase principal. But some experts say they think banks will continue to drag their feet, which will prolong the foreclosure crisis.
 Indeed, Casey Mulligan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, argued that both the Bush and Obama administrations had focused too much on making house payments affordable, based on income levels, and not enough on reducing debt.
 ''What we are really doing is propping up the banks in another way,'' he said. ''They are very powerful politically and they are very good at getting the government to give them money. So I think that's why we don't deal with the real simple problem, which is negative equity. Banks believe, and they are probably right, that there are probably some homeowners they can squeeze the money out of and they don't want to give up the opportunity to squeeze such people.''
 Fred Block, a sociology professor at the University of California, Davis, said that a lot of the anger I saw in the reader comments should have been directed at the banks and the overall lack of regulation. For all those homeowners who may (or may not) have treated their homes as A.T.M.'s, there were lenders who permitted the transaction. And for every lender that permitted the transaction, there were supposed to be some limits.
 ''What people should be angry about is that we've had an economy that has been marked by these bubbles,'' Mr. Block said. ''We all believe that people should be rewarded for hard work and ideas and so forth. But bubbles, by their nature, are capricious in what they reward, and they violate the moral principles that most people believe in. That is why financial reform legislation is so important.''
 So you can blame the guy in Arizona who got in over his head. But that wouldn't be entirely fair.

HEADLINE: Signs of Life in Sand-State Real Estate

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
SAND is not a good foundation for a house, and it certainly wasn't a good foundation for a housing boom. But now home prices are starting to recover in some so-called sand states. 
 During the housing boom early in the last decade, the strongest markets were in the states that could offer sand and sun to lure prospective purchasers, and many came to accept that the aging of the baby boomers meant that such retirement havens would prosper forever.
 But when the boom turned to bust, buyers found that what went up the most was likely to come down the fastest.
 Now, there are signs of life in real estate markets in two of the sand states, California and Arizona. Florida and Nevada, though, continue to suffer.
 The accompanying chart, using seasonally adjusted prices for single-family homes from the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller indexes, shows that in the three California regions measured, there have been recoveries ranging from 8.5 percent in Los Angeles to 14.7 percent in San Francisco.
 In each case, the region incorporates suburban areas that can range far from the city in the center. There is no doubt considerable variation within each market, and often it is the farthest-out markets -- the ones with the longest drives to employment -- that have done the worst.
 In the Phoenix region, the recovery has been 7.4 percent, which exceeds the gain in all but one of the 13 markets covered by the indexes and not in the sand states. Minneapolis has climbed 10.7 percent.
 But the two sand-state markets in Florida (Miami and Tampa) and the one in Nevada (Las Vegas) have shown only the smallest of recoveries, amounting to 1.2 percent or less.
 All of the sand-state markets have a long way to go, and it may be many years or even decades before they set new highs. Phoenix and Las Vegas prices could double from the January levels reported this week and still be below the highs set in 2006.
 All of the sand markets need to rise by more than 50 percent to get back to peak levels. That is true of only one other market, Detroit, a depressed region that largely missed the boom but has taken part in the bust.
 Those figures indicate that the problems of underwater mortgages, which the Obama administration is now starting to address, are likely to endure for some time unless there are many more foreclosures or reductions in principal of outstanding loans.
 The markets that appear to have the smallest problems in that regard are Dallas and Denver, each of which could rise above previous highs with gains of less than 10 percent from January levels. Others that need gains of less than 20 percent are Boston, Cleveland and Charlotte, N.C.
 New York suffered less than many markets, but it is also a market that has not shown any sign of recovery. It was the only one of the 20 markets to set a new low in January. The price level then was about the same as it was almost six years earlier, in the spring of 2004. 

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Getting Warmer: Home prices soared in the so-called sand states of California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada during the housing boom, and then collapsed in the bust. Now markets in California and Arizona are showing signs of recovery, but others are not. All remain far below their mid-decade highs. Among other markets, Minneapolis has recovered the most, and New York has shown no recovery. (Source: Standard & Poor's )

HEADLINE: Health Law Preserves Cobra Plan

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
If you've recently joined the ranks of the unemployed or are worried that you soon will, you may be wondering if the sweeping new health law will help you. Will you, for instance, still be able to get health insurance under the government-mandated Cobra program? If so, for how long? And at what price? 
 ''Basically the version of the health law that passed leaves Cobra coverage the way it always was, no changes,'' said Kathryn L. Bakich, national health care compliance director for the Segal Company, a benefits consultant. But other aspects of the law may provide a little bit of relief for people who can't afford or are no longer eligible for Cobra, she added. 
 Here's where the confusion comes in: coverage under Cobra benefits expires after 18 months. In the House version of the health overhaul, Cobra benefits would have been extended until 2014, when many of the new, state-run health care exchanges, or marketplaces, would be up and running. But the Senate bill, which is the version that was signed into law, included nothing about extending Cobra. 
 For years, Cobra acted as a bridge for people who were laid off or voluntarily left their jobs until they could find another position, and presumably, another employer-sponsored group health plan to join. 
 But with the nation's high unemployment rate, more and more workers are finding themselves out of work long enough for Cobra benefits to expire. 
 That's what's happening to Jan Lipert of Bayonne, N.J. Laid off from her print shop job in February 2008, her Cobra coverage expired on March 31. Soon her unemployment benefits will end as well. Ms. Lipert is 62, so she won't be eligible for Medicare for three more years. She will receive a small payment soon from her former husband's Social Security benefits, and she is looking for part-time work. Now that she has no health insurance, she is hoping she will be eligible for medical care at the community clinics in her area. ''I'm one of those people who is totally in the gap,'' Ms. Lipert said. ''I'm glad health reform passed, believe me, but it doesn't really help someone in my situation at all.'' 
 Another problem for laid-off workers, said Jane Hyatt Thorpe, associate research professor of health policy at George Washington University, is that the Cobra subsidy ended on March 31. The subsidy, which was originally passed as part of the stimulus package, pays 65 percent of laid-off workers' Cobra payments for a total of 15 months. The average price for family coverage under Cobra is $1,100 a month, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit health care advocacy group. With the subsidy, that cost becomes a much more manageable $385. Most experts like Ms. Thorpe and Mr. Pollack said they expected Congress to extend the subsidy again when it returns from its recess. Bills to do so have been introduced in both the House and Senate.
 And people who find themselves at the end of their Cobra eligibility, like Ms. Lipert, will need to look for alternatives in the independent insurance market or state government-sponsored programs. What follows is some advice for doing so. You've probably read some of this before in previous Patient Money columns. For many of you, insurance shopping during this interim period is status quo. But if you're about to become uninsured, the advice bears repeating. Also, there are some aspects of the health care law that go into effect sooner than 2014 that may help. 
 Cobra Ending Soon 
 If you have been insured under Cobra, you are guaranteed coverage in the individual market even if you have a pre-existing condition. That's why it's important to start shopping well before you reach the end of your 18 months of Cobra coverage. If you're young and healthy, chances are you may even find a better deal than an unsubsidized Cobra. If you do have a pre-existing condition, premiums will probably be high, but you cannot be denied coverage. 
 One way to lower the cost of your family's total insurance bill is to cover your child under your state's Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. These programs cover children in families earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private health insurance. CHIPs will continue to be financed until 2015, said Mr. Pollack of Families USA, and will not be affected by the new law. For more information go to insurekidsnow.gov. 
 You're Uninsured
 If your Cobra ended six months ago or you've been uninsured that long for any other reason and you can't afford or don't qualify for private insurance, you could be eligible for your state's high-risk pool by the end of June.
 Traditionally, the risk pool is where people with pre-existing conditions who can't get insurance elsewhere turn for coverage. But premiums can be expensive. Congress has set aside $5 billion to help make the pools more affordable until the health exchanges are up and running. For more information, contact your state's insurance department. 
 Younger Than 26
 Young adults who have lost their jobs, haven't been able to find one or otherwise don't have insurance may be able to get coverage under their parents' health policies. The new law will require insurance companies to provide this coverage starting in September, although the exact eligibility requirements are not yet clear. 
 Of course, this works only if your parents have insurance other than Medicare and are willing and able to pay the extra premium for including you on the policy. The good news, said Mr. Pollack, is that adding a young healthy person to a policy usually entails a relatively small premium increase. 
 Just Laid Off
 Try your best to sign up for Cobra coverage, even without the subsidy. ''Cobra really is the most significant way that laid-off workers can retain health coverage,'' Mr. Pollack said. Remember you have 60 days after your last day of coverage under your employer's plan to sign up for Cobra. In those 60 days, you can look for a more affordable alternative or maybe find a new job. If something works out, you will have avoided paying the premiums, but if something happens and you need care, you'll still be covered. What's more, in 60 days' time, perhaps Congress will extend the subsidy and make it retroactive.

HEADLINE: A Deal at Ground Zero?

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians are celebrating a deal to finally finish the major buildings at the World Trade Center site. Let's hope they are right to break out the confetti. Larry Silverstein, who is developing office towers on the site, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the 16 acres, need to make sure that the agreement does not fall apart yet again, as they fill in the remaining details. 
 No one should be surprised to hear that the latest stalemate -- which has dragged on for more than a year -- was about money. Mr. Silverstein has been insisting that the Port Authority use scarce public funds to help finance his three private office towers. The authority has rightly balked, citing more basic needs like tunnels and bridges and ports. Last week, both sides agreed in principle to go ahead with two skyscrapers, and Mr. Silverstein will pick up more of the bill than he wanted. 
 The Port Authority has pledged to provide $1.2 billion in financing to complete the first tower, which would cost an estimated $1.75 billion. For that tower and the second one, expected to cost almost $2 billion, Mr. Silverstein would commit to using what is left of the huge insurance payout he got after the attack and from tax-free Liberty Bonds. He has also committed to raising $300 million and finding renters for 400,000 square feet (16 percent) of the office space in the second tower before the city, state and authority provide $600 million more in financing.
 Plans for the third tower will be wisely kept on hold, the area preferably turned into a park, until the downtown real estate market is ready for more offices.
 The details still to be worked out include questions about development fees for Mr. Silverstein and the interest rate for the authority's financing. The two sides need to settle those and get things moving. The 10-year anniversary of the attacks is 17 months away. With good faith and a serious effort, the memorial to the victims of Sept. 11, the site's centerpiece, can be ready by then.

HEADLINE: Putin Visits Venezuela to Sign Series of Deals

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia visited Venezuela on Friday to sign a series of military and oil agreements with President Hugo Chavez, who is seeking to expand ties with Russia as a way of countering the influence of the United States in Latin America. 
 Mr. Putin's one-day visit built on a relationship rooted in billions of dollars of Russian arms sales to Venezuela over the past decade. Venezuela has also emerged as one of Russia's most vocal supporters, recognizing two Russian-backed separatist enclaves of Georgia in 2009 and applauding Russian efforts to advance the ambitions of an embryonic group of gas-rich nations.
 Russia's warm ties with Venezuela are also opening the way for it to improve relations with a handful of other countries in Latin America, notably Bolivia. President Evo Morales of Bolivia, a staunch critic of the Obama administration and a major recipient of Venezuelan aid, was also expected to discuss cooperation agreements with Mr. Putin here on Friday night.
 Still, obstacles persist to a more assertive Russian expansion in Venezuela beyond the sphere of weapons sales and political engagement with Mr. Chavez's allies.
 As if to illustrate these challenges, the highlights of Mr. Putin's visit included the sale of 2,250 Russian-built Lada vehicles to Venezuela's government, and the delivery of four MI-17 helicopters to Mr. Chavez's military, even though Mr. Chavez had suggested before Mr. Putin's arrival that the countries could cooperate ambitiously on nuclear energy and a satellite-launching base in Venezuela. 
 Relatively low oil revenues in both Russia and Venezuela may also hamper their plans to build complex and expensive oil projects in southern Venezuela. One oil venture discussed by senior Venezuelan and Russian officials here this week would require at least $18 billion in investments. Still, Mr. Putin signaled seriousness over Russia's oil ambitions here by agreeing to pay $600 million in signing fees.
 Skepticism also lingers over Russia's capacity to expand its influence in the hemisphere after the Soviet Union, with more resources, achieved few tangible results in Central and South America during the cold war.
 ''Russia, whatever its leaders' ambitions, mostly lacks the wherewithal to mount an enduring diplomatic and economic offensive in Latin America,'' said Stephen Kotkin, a Russia specialist at Princeton University.
 Disarray in Venezuela's oil industry has contributed to intensifying electricity blackouts, not to mention undermining its ability to play a more influential role in the gas-exporters group that Russia is supporting. Venezuela still needs to import natural gas from neighboring Colombia and has been unable to increase its own natural gas output to fuel power plants around the country.
 Mr. Chavez insisted in a news conference on Friday that Venezuela and Russia were prepared to work together to build nuclear energy projects here to alleviate the electricity shortages (officials here have also referred to nuclear cooperation with Iran). But the timing of such projects remains vague, and the cost and scientific expertise needed to carry out such plans remain outside of Venezuela's reach, according to studies by independent nuclear specialists.

HEADLINE: Signaling Jobs Recovery, Payrolls Surged in March

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ; Liz Robbins and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The clouds have parted.
 After losing eight million jobs since the recession began in December 2007, payrolls finally surged in March, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Employers added 162,000 nonfarm jobs last month. Nationwide, the unemployment rate held steady at 9.7 percent.
 ''We are beginning to turn the corner,'' said President Obama, speaking in Charlotte, N.C., calling it ''the best news we've seen on the job front in more than two years.'' 
 Though everything seems to be moving in the right direction, he was careful not to raise expectations too high. ''It will take time to achieve the strong and sustained job growth that we need,'' President Obama said.
 The economy needs to add more than 100,000 jobs a month just to absorb new entrants into the labor market, let alone provide a livelihood for the 15 million Americans already looking for work. Without constant, robust growth, the unemployment rate won't budge. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the rate will hover around 10 percent for the rest of the year.
 Still, economists saw signs in the latest report that the economy was poised to make steady, if slow, progress. 
 ''Every major industry, except financial services and information, showed gains in employment,'' John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics, said. ''From manufacturing, to construction, to retail, it really didn't matter. They're all hiring now.''
 Private-sector job growth was again strongest in temporary help services and health care. The nation added 40,000 temporary service jobs last month, indicating that many employers were testing the waters before taking the plunge with a permanent hire. The health care industry, which grew steadily even during the depths of the recession, expanded by 27,000 jobs in March.
 The March report may have been inflated, though, by a rebound from February when many people could not work because of snowstorms. Additionally, nearly a third of the hiring in March was temporary work on the 2010 census.
 Though they know their new jobs are fleeting, many of the 48,000 new census workers are counting their blessings. To them, a job is a job, a closed hole in their resumes and maybe even a bridge to permanent employment elsewhere. 
 Gregory A. Butler, a 41-year-old union carpenter in West Harlem, had been unable to find work since November. Then last month, he got a call from the Census Bureau asking him to work as a supervisor. Unlike most of the department's new hires, who are part-time employees, he expects to work 40-hour weeks for about two months, at $20 an hour.
 ''This is a very good transition opportunity for me, since I'm trying to start a new career as a freelance writer,'' Mr. Butler said. ''I don't mind that it's temporary. It's important work, and it gets me off unemployment.'' 
 The temporary hiring of thousands of census workers will continue through the end of the summer, economists noted, making it more difficult to gauge the underlying strength of the labor market.
 Many of the jobs created last month were part time for people who really wanted full-time work. That caused the broader measure of unemployment along with those who are underemployed to tick up, to 16.9 percent, from 16.8 percent in February. 
 The situation looks worse for the long-term unemployed. The average length of time the jobless have been out of work has reached 31.2 weeks, the longest period since the government began keeping records in 1948.
 Friday's report revised employment upward for the previous two months, and was otherwise largely in line with the expectations of forecasters.
 While the stock market was closed for Good Friday, the bond market reacted favorably to the report. 
 Treasury prices fell, sending their yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.94 percent, from 3.87 percent late Thursday, its highest level since last June. Many types of consumer loans are pegged to the yield on the 10-year note, so an increase could raise the cost of borrowing to buy homes and other goods. 
 The economy has shown signs of renewal in recent months with the help of significant government spending. Analysts generally say they believe the recovery will endure even in the absence of stimulus programs.
 ''Strength effectively feeds itself,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist for MF Global. ''What happens to the labor market is key to perceptions about the sustainability of the recovery.''
 But substantial worries persist. Consumer spending remains tepid, though it has improved modestly in recent months. Real estate markets are still severely depressed, holding back hiring in critical industries like construction. And many state and local governments, facing ballooning deficits, are poised to make severe cutbacks. Last month, they cut 9,000 jobs.
 The long-term unemployed find little comfort in one month of good news, especially with many nearing the end of their government assistance.
 In Roseville, Mich., a suburb of Detroit, Mark R. Hamlin, is nearing his fourth year without work. Mr. Hamlin, 49, was laid off from his position as a sales manager for a copper wire distributor just as the auto industry began to collapse. Though his wife has a job, the Hamlins struggle to keep up with a $900 monthly mortgage payment and $5,000 in credit card debt. To cut costs, they keep the heat at 55 degrees.
 With his latest round of unemployment benefits expiring this week, Mr. Hamlin said he worries that he may not be able to give his 4-year-old daughter Kara a stable upbringing.
 ''I'm hoping, I'm praying, I have my fingers crossed,'' Mr. Hamlin said. ''I've got to find something this year. I've got to find something this year.''

HEADLINE: As Rivals Flee, Others Ask, What's to Fear In Gillibrand?

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- They appeared on the scene with blustery talk and bravado, dismissing her as weak, spineless and out of touch with New Yorkers. Replace her, they said, with me. 
 But one after another, each of them -- the billionaire, the veteran politicians and the other ideological adversaries who boasted that they could take on Kirsten E. Gillibrand in a Senate race -- was scared away, leaving their supporters to wonder: What is so frightening about Ms. Gillibrand?
 After all, her poll numbers are unimpressive, and she has never been elected statewide. But the tough challenge that even her advisers expected this year has not materialized. 
 ''I think Gillibrand either has mystical powers or the best luck I have ever seen in politics,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was initially skeptical of her. ''It is amazing.''
 Vito J. Lopez, the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, who has been open to someone challenging Ms. Gillibrand for the party nomination, sounded vexed after spending many hours meeting with Democrats seeking his endorsement to run against her, only to see them abandon the idea.
 ''It's been extremely frustrating,'' said Mr. Lopez, who has yet to endorse Ms. Gillibrand. ''No one has told me directly why they dropped out.''
 Even former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., who denounced party elders who told him as he mulled a primary fight that it would not be good for Democrats, kept out of the race, basically mouthing the same message.
 Ms. Gillibrand has been under siege almost from the moment Gov. David A. Paterson appointed her to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton in January 2009. Initially, she faced the possibility of challenges from members of her own party, including the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer; Representative Steve Israel of Long Island; and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of Manhattan. They all opted out.
 ''I really did feel like this was the one that got away,'' said Joe Trippi, the political consultant who worked for Ms. Maloney. ''I felt we could have won that seat.''
 Several would-be Republican opponents have also stayed out, including former Gov. George E. Pataki and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the real estate tycoon and publisher of The Daily News.
 At this point, Ms. Gillibrand has only token Republican opposition: Bruce A. Blakeman, who dropped out of the New York mayoral race last year; David Malpass, a former economist at Bear Stearns who worked in the Reagan administration; and Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former member of the House.
 What makes all the potential contenders ultimately duck the race is not clear. But this much is obvious: Running for Senate in New York is a big undertaking. It takes doggedness, a thick skin and a lot of money.
 It has undoubtedly helped Ms. Gillibrand that her powerful allies, like the state's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, and President Obama, have helped ward off potential Democratic challengers.
 But a more likely explanation is that Ms. Gillibrand possesses assets most of the aspiring senators lack. 
 She has a legitimate geographic base, having represented an Albany-area Congressional district in a part of the state where her family is prominent. She has a network of donors, especially women, who are not going to abandon her. She has a commitment to working her tail off to keep the seat, a fact that even her political enemies grudgingly acknowledge. 
 And, perhaps most important, she has $5.1 million in her campaign account. 
 ''She remains vulnerable to a surprising degree at this stage of the game,'' said a senior Republican strategist who tried to recruit a top-tier candidate to run against her. 
 ''But the vulnerability that Gillibrand has is offset by her dominant cash position; that is what has made Democrats blink and it is what has made Republicans blink,'' said the strategist, who spoke anonymously because he did not want to be seen as saying that she had frightened off his party's candidates. 
 A Gillibrand adviser echoed that sentiment, saying that while she is politically vulnerable, no one who opposed her would come out of the race unscathed.
 ''She is weak, but she is no pushover,'' said the adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as acknowledging her problems. ''So there's a lot to lose in running against her. Nobody is willing to take the risk.''
 Mr. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, said he was impressed that Ms. Gillibrand was still standing after a long procession of potential challengers had vowed to topple her.
 ''Who's the parakeet now?'' he said, referring to an insult that Mr. Ford had directed at her.
 ''It was hers to fumble,'' he continued, referring to the Senate seat. ''A lot of people thought she would.''

HEADLINE: We Still Don't Hear Him

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The great man was moving with what seemed like great reluctance. He knew as he climbed from the car in Upper Manhattan that he was stepping into the maelstrom, that there were powerful people who would not react kindly to what he had to say.
 ''I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight,'' said the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ''because my conscience leaves me no other choice.'' 
 This was on the evening of April 4, 1967, almost exactly 43 years ago. Dr. King told the more than 3,000 people who had crowded into Riverside Church that silence in the face of the horror that was taking place in Vietnam amounted to a ''betrayal.''
 He spoke of both the carnage in the war zone and the toll the war was taking here in the United States. The speech comes to mind now for two reasons: A Tavis Smiley documentary currently airing on PBS revisits the controversy set off by Dr. King's indictment of ''the madness of Vietnam.'' And recent news reports show ever-increasing evidence that we have ensnared ourselves in a mad and tragic venture in Afghanistan.
 Dr. King spoke of how, in Vietnam, the United States increased its commitment of troops ''in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support.''
 It's strange, indeed, to read those words more than four decades later as we are increasing our commitment of troops in Afghanistan to fight in support of Hamid Karzai, who remains in power after an election that the world knows was riddled with fraud and whose government is one of the most corrupt and inept on the planet. 
 If Mr. Karzai is at all grateful for this support, he has a very peculiar way of showing it. He has ignored pleas from President Obama and others to take meaningful steps to rein in the rampant corruption. His brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, the kingpin in southern Afghanistan, is believed by top American officials to be engaged in all manner of nefarious activities, including money-laundering and involvement in the flourishing opium trade.
 Hamid Karzai himself pulled off a calculated insult to the U.S. by inviting Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to the presidential palace in Kabul, where Ahmadinejad promptly delivered a fiery anti-American speech. As Dexter Filkins and Mark Landler reported in The Times this week: ''Even as Mr. Obama pours tens of thousands of additional American troops into the country to help defend Mr. Karzai's government, Mr. Karzai now often voices the view that his interests and the United States' no longer coincide.''
 Is this what American service members are dying for in Afghanistan? Can you imagine giving up your life, or your child's life, for that crowd?
 In his speech, Dr. King spoke about the damage the Vietnam War was doing to America's war on poverty, and the way it was undermining other important domestic initiatives. What he wanted from the U.S. was not warfare overseas but a renewed commitment to economic and social justice at home. As he put it: ''A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.''
 The speech set loose a hurricane of criticism. Even the N.A.A.C.P. complained that Dr. King should stick to what it perceived as his area of expertise, civil rights. The New York Times headlined its editorial on the speech, ''Dr. King's Error.''
 Mr. Smiley, in his documentary, noted that ''the already strained relationship between President Johnson and Dr. King became fractured beyond repair.'' And donations to Dr. King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference ''began to dry up.''
 So it took great courage for Dr. King to speak out as he did.
 His bold stand seems all the more striking in today's atmosphere, in which moral courage among the very prominent -- the kind of courage that carries real risk -- seems mostly to have disappeared.
 More than 4,000 Americans have died in Iraq and more than 1,000 in Afghanistan, where the Obama administration has chosen to escalate rather than to begin a careful withdrawal. Those two wars, as the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and his colleague Linda Bilmes have told us, will ultimately cost us more than $3 trillion. 
 And yet the voices in search of peace, in search of an end to the ''madness,'' in search of the nation-building so desperately needed here in the United States, are feeble indeed. 
 Dr. King would be assassinated exactly one year (almost to the hour) after his great speech at Riverside Church. It's the same terrible fate that awaits some of the American forces, most of them very young, that we continue to send into the quagmire in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Asian Markets Close Week With Push Higher

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Asian shares rose on Friday, with South Korean stocks hitting a 21-month high, as upbeat United States manufacturing data and jobless claims raised hopes for a sustainable economic recovery. 
 But trading was light, with many investors in the region as well as in Europe and the United States away for the Good Friday holiday, and gains were limited by caution ahead of more United States job data later in the day. European and American markets reopen Monday.
 Japan's Nikkei average hit an 18-month peak for a fourth day, getting a lift from a rise in technology shares and automakers like Honda Motor and Toyota Motor after a jump in United States auto sales in March.
 Shares of Japanese exporters drew additional support from the yen's fall this week to a seven-month low against the dollar, while expectations for stronger Japanese earnings -- which kick off next week with retailers -- buoyed the overall market.
 An index of American manufacturing activity in March rose to its highest level in over five and a half years, the Institute for Supply Management said on Thursday, while a Labor Department report showed initial weekly claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected. 
 The Nikkei closed up 0.4 percent at 11,286.09, an 18-month closing high.
 Honda and Toyota each rose more than 1 percent on news that American auto sales jumped to a seven-month high last month. 
 South Korea's index touched a high of 1,725.39, its loftiest level since late June 2008, as Hyundai Motor jumped 5.8 percent and Samsung Electronics rose 1.4 percent. The index later pared its gains to 0.3 percent.The dollar hit a seven-month high against the yen Friday, after government data showed the American economy created 162,000 jobs in March, the most in almost three years.
 The unemployment report suggested that the American labor sector was on a gradual but steady recovery and should affirm expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates ahead of the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan.
 ''To the extent that the jobs data reflects continued improvement in the U.S. labor market it fits into our general view that the output gap in the U.S. is closing, albeit slowly,'' said Marc Chandler, global head of FX strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.
 ''This will allow the Fed to raise interest rates before the BoJ, E.C.B, and BoE.,'' Mr. Chandler said. ''We expect this to underpin the dollar on a medium-term perspective.''
 In midday trading, the euro fell 0.7 percent against the dollar to $1.3486. Traders said global macro hedge funds sold euros following the jobs data.
 Despite the euro's weakness on Friday, the single euro zone currency was still up slightly on the week versus the dollar, recovering modestly from losses the last two weeks.
 Against the yen, the dollar rose as high as 94.69 yen, the loftiest since late August, according to Reuters data. It was last at 94.65 yen up 0.9 percent on the day.
 Dealers said there are options-related barriers near 95 yen, which have hindered the dollar/yen's pair upside momentum.

HEADLINE: In N.C., Obama Hails Jobs Report

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- President Obama declared on Friday that ''we are beginning to turn the corner'' after a deep recession that nearly threw the economy into another Great Depression. He hailed a new government report showing stronger job growth and credited his policies with helping businesses rebuild.
 Visiting a plant that received federal money from his economic stimulus package and that is now creating new jobs, Mr. Obama said ''today is an encouraging day'' because the fruits of his programs were becoming visible. But he cautioned that more difficult times were still ahead before the country reclaimed the economic ground lost in the past few years. 
 ''This has been a harrowing time for our country, and it's easy to grow cynical and wonder whether America's best days are behind us, especially after such a crisis,'' Mr. Obama told a crowd of workers in a hangarlike building, surrounded by racks of battery material. ''What we can see here at this plant is, the worst of the storm is over, that brighter days are still ahead.''
 At the same time, Mr. Obama said, ''While we've come a long way, we've still got a ways to go.'' He added: ''Government can't reverse the toll of this recession overnight. And government on its own can't replace the eight million jobs that have been lost.''
 Mr. Obama was responding to a Labor Department report indicating that the economy added 162,000 nonfarm jobs in March, the most in three years. He noted that a year ago, the economy was losing as many as 700,000 jobs a month.
 To an extent, the growth in March was exaggerated by the government's hiring of 48,000 census workers to conduct the once-a-decade national head count, jobs that will mainly last only a few months. Moreover, the unemployment rate remained steady at 9.7 percent in March, and economists expect it to rise later in the year as discouraged workers resume looking for jobs.
 Republicans pointed out that though Mr. Obama was emphasizing the payroll numbers, unemployment still remained significantly higher than the White House initially forecast it would be at this point even if Congress had not enacted the $787 billion stimulus package last year. What then, they asked, had the stimulus actually achieved?
 Still, the new figures provided a political boost for the president less than a week after he signed the final elements of his landmark health care overhaul into law and finished an arms control treaty with Russia. After months on the defensive -- with his poll numbers falling, his legislative program stalled and the economy still fallow -- Mr. Obama now appears to feel reinvigorated.
 To highlight his economic agenda, he flew to Charlotte to visit Celgard, a firm that produces material for lithium batteries and has received $49 million from the stimulus program. The company is expanding its Charlotte plant and building a new facility in nearby Concord. Mr. Obama said the stimulus money was helping Celgard create 300 new jobs directly and as many as 1,000 new jobs for suppliers and contractors.
 But The Charlotte Observer, citing the Energy Department, reported that Celgard had not yet begun spending any of the stimulus money. And at least some residents of the area were not satisfied, as they gathered along Mr. Obama's motorcade route holding up signs like ''You Lie,'' ''Vote Them Out'' and ''Stop Spending My Future.''
 North Carolina is the fourth swing state Mr. Obama has visited in the past week or so, following Iowa, Virginia and Maine. He won all four of them in 2008, but the White House is carefully tending to all of them given the flight of independents from Mr. Obama recorded in recent polls.
 Taking questions from Celgard workers, Mr. Obama fielded mostly friendly inquiries. But when a woman asked why he was raising taxes in the health care program, ''because we're overtaxed as it is,'' Mr. Obama bemoaned what he called ''a whole lot of misinformation'' and talked for a long time about the virtues of the overhaul before actually addressing taxes. 
 When he did respond to her question, he said that the health care program was financed in part by ''some additional taxes that we think are fair,'' and he cited a provision imposing Medicare taxes on capital gains and dividend income, which will affect primarily wealthier Americans.

HEADLINE: Strains Easing, Obama Talks With Chinese Leader

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and MARK LANDLER; Zhang Jing contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Tensions between China and the United States have ebbed significantly in recent days, with an hour-long conversation between their two presidents Thursday night and the countries working together to deter Iran's nuclear ambitions as the Obama administration backs off a politically charged clash over China's currency. 
 In the call Thursday night, President Obama spoke by phone with Mr. Hu for about an hour -- so long that Air Force One had to be held for 10 minutes on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base after landing so that Mr. Obama could finish up the conversation. Chinese television reported that Mr. Hu expressed a desire for healthier ties while stressing Beijing's positions on Taiwan and Tibet, and the White House said Mr. Obama stressed for China press Iran on its nuclear ambitions to ensure the country ''lives up to its international obligations.'' 
 The warming trend that began earlier this week gained momentum on Thursday by the announcement that President Hu Jintao will attend Mr. Obama's nuclear security summit meeting in Washington later this month. American officials had feared that Mr. Hu would skip the talks to convey China's anger over recent diplomatic clashes, including a White House decision to sell arms to Taiwan and President Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. 
 But this week, the drumbeat of bad news -- and an underlying narrative of a rising China flexing its muscles against a debt-laden United States -- has suddenly given way to talk of collaboration. 
 For now, the United States is setting aside the most potentially divisive issue, deferring a decision on whether to accuse China of manipulating its currency, the renminbi, until well after Mr. Hu's visit, according to a senior administration official. That decision, the official said, reflects a judgment that threatening China is not the best way to persuade it to allow the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar. 
 Many economists expect China to act on its own to loosen the tight link between the renminbi and the dollar -- a policy that keeps the currency's value depressed and makes Chinese exports more competitive in global markets. 
 Still, the administration's decision not to force the currency issue now could carry political risks at home. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have introduced legislation calling for trade sanctions against China if it does not change its currency policy. And unions and manufacturers cite the undervalued Chinese currency as a major culprit for lost jobs. 
 The White House would not comment on the currency issue, but an official said that if China did not take action on its own, the administration could raise the issue again at the Group of 20 summit meeting in June. The White House welcomed Mr. Hu's visit as proof that its policy of engaging with China on strategic issues of common interest had paid off. 
 ''We have an important relationship with China, one in which there are many issues of mutual concern that we work on together,'' said a White House spokesman, Bill Burton. ''But there also will be times where we disagree. I think this proves the point that despite those disagreements, we can work together on issues like nuclear proliferation.'' 
 On Wednesday, China appeared to throw its support behind new United Nations sanctions aimed at putting pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. The Security Council has been stymied by China's insistence on diplomacy over sanctions. 
 American officials said they expected China to wrangle over the wording of a United Nations resolution, with a goal of watering down the measures against Tehran. 
 After meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing, Iran's nuclear negotiator on Friday warned the West to back away from ''threats'' and suggested that China was less inclined to support sanctions than many believed. ''Many issues came up in talks on which China accepted Iran's position,'' Saeed Jalili, the negotiator, said during a news conference. ''We jointly emphasized during our talks that these sanctions tools have lost their effectiveness.''
 In its own statements on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry appeared to steer clear from any commitment for sanctions, saying that all parties should ''step up diplomatic efforts, and show flexibility, to create the conditions to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiation.''
 Still, earlier this week, Mr. Obama expressed optimism that the major powers could unite this spring behind a resolution that would apply new pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. 
 The administration has engaged in intensive talks with Chinese officials to demonstrate to Beijing the destabilizing effect of a nuclear-armed Iran. A crucial advance, officials said, came in early March when an American delegation, led by Deputy Secretary of State James B. Steinberg and the National Security Council's senior director for Asia, Jeffrey A. Bader, visited Beijing. 
 Mr. Hu's visit will take place only two days before the Obama administration faces a deadline to decide whether to label China a ''currency manipulator,'' meaning that it intervenes in currency markets to gives its exporters an artificial advantage. Pressure in the United States has been building to take that step, which could initiate a Congressional process that would lead to slapping tariffs on Chinese imports. 
 But given the potential for embarrassing Mr. Hu -- and for sending bilateral relations into another tailspin -- the administration decided not to report on April 15, one of the deadlines set by Congress and the Treasury Department to issue a report on possible currency manipulation. 
 To avoid embarrassing Mr. Hu, the Treasury Department could delay the deadline for weeks. ''As a practical matter, they've got a lot of wiggle room,'' said Nicholas R. Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr. Lardy added that he thought it was unlikely that China would have agreed to a visit by Mr. Hu unless there was at least an informal assurance by the Treasury that China would not immediately be named a currency manipulator. 
 Lawmakers signaled that they would not be easily mollified if the administration gave Beijing a pass on its currency. 
 ''The most important issue in the Chinese-American relationship is currency,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who introduced a bill threatening China with trade sanctions. ''It relates to American jobs, American wealth and the future of this country. This issue should not be traded for another.'' 
 ''President Obama underscored the importance of working together to ensure that Iran lives up to its international obligations,'' the White House said in a statement after the telephone call, on Thursday Washington time, which was Friday in Beijing.
 ''He also emphasized the importance of the United States and China along with other major economies implementing the G20 commitments designed to produce balanced and sustainable growth.''
 Although their telephone conversation did not touch on the issue of the renminbi, Mr. Obama and Mr. Hu reportedly talked about trade, the Iranian nuclear crisis and China's positions on Tibet and Taiwan, which remains a paramount concern to the Chinese. 
 ''The Taiwan and Tibet issues are key to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and relate to China's core interests,'' the state media quoted Mr. Hu as saying. ''Appropriately handling these issues is key to ensuring the healthy and stable development of U.S.-China ties.''
 Relations between the countries began to fray in November, soon after Mr. Obama went to China on a state visit that was more circumscribed than American officials would have liked. 
 In the months that followed, tensions increased. American officials accused China of thwarting a climate change deal in Copenhagen and Chinese leaders threatened to punish the United States for a $6 billion weapons deal for Taiwan. In February, China's Foreign Ministry called in the American ambassador for a scolding about Mr. Obama's meeting with the Dalai Lama, whom China calls a separatist. Google's complaints about government censorship and its decision to move its Internet search service from the mainland did not help.

HEADLINE: Great Expectations

BYLINE: By WALTER KIRN. 
Walter Kirn, a frequent contributor, is the author, most recently, of ''Lost in the Meritocracy.''

 BODY:
When I first told my son, Charlie, about the Easter Bunny and described his duties -- distributing and hiding colored eggs -- my logical 3-year-old would have none of it. ''But rabbits don't have any hands,'' he said. Since I never believed in the Easter Bunny, either, I didn't apply further pressure on the issue. Next to the Crucifixion itself (whose violent details I spared my son and daughter until age 7 or so), the image of a man-size rodent that lurches around people's houses late at night, clutching fragile treats in its curled paws, strikes me as one of the most appalling nightmare visions that adults can inflict on tender minds. 
 As a wavering Christian and occasional rationalist, I've always found Easter (which I sometimes think of as the New Testament's Passover 2.0) a singularly problematic holiday, both in its cheery, secularized aspects and its grisly, credulity-straining religious form. My considerable respect for Easter in theory and my shallow responses to it in practice left me feeling inadequate and frustrated. Year after year I tried and failed to feel the profound sense of renewal and gratitude -- of hitting bottom and coming back -- that the liturgically crucial feast is said to inspire in countless souls that I kept wishing and praying included mine.
 This spring my hunger for an uplifting Easter is especially acute. I doubt that I'm alone. The past year has been a test of faith for Americans of all sorts, even atheists, and on many fronts. Take our long and agonizing vigil at the grave site of what once was termed ''the new economy.'' According to the worldly theologians of finance and commerce, a force known as ''the business cycle'' that governs the rise and fall of markets was supposed to have taken us higher by now, replenishing depleted bank accounts, restoring a sheen of functionality to corroded Rust Belt cities and permitting again the buying and selling of homes. 
 The rock in front of this tomb remains in place, though, and the day of rejoicing still appears far off. This seems true in the realm of politics as well, despite the recent passage of the health care bill and the winding down of the battle for Iraq. Unity and peace, where are ye? Hidden. 
 Ten years ago, during a time of steady churchgoing that followed the birth of my daughter, my first child, I made friends with a gruff old Episcopalian priest to whom I confessed my perennial difficulties with the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, Easter's for-me elusive main event. He listened with a big fist propped under his chin as I listed my doubts and puzzlements, which went back to childhood. More troubling for me than the supposed miracle's scientific implausibility, I said, was its murky dramatic character. In what sort of shape was the Savior's body once it was reanimated? I asked. Pierced and bleeding or intact and shining? And why did Our Lord not fly straight up into the sky rather than hanging around down on the ground? I went on like this for half an hour, until the old man raised his square gray head and stopped me. ''Walter, here's the important thing,'' he said. ''It either happened or it didn't, and if it didn't, if it's all a lie, neither of us should be in church today. But we are,'' he said, ''aren't we? Yes, indeed, we are.''
 I've come to call this thoroughly circular argument for Easter's significance the ''Presence Principle.'' It implies, in a way that my intellect resists but my heart is willing to entertain, that the terrific annual to-do involving lilies, hymns and dexterous rabbits is, just by virtue of its continued existence, not an absurd, unwarranted phenomenon. A celebration, by my old priest's reasoning, means that its celebrants must have something to celebrate, and the bigger the celebration, the bigger the something. Because I suspect that no man will ever succeed in satisfying me further on this matter, I've stopped asking questions; I take Easter as a fact now. And Passover too, for the people who observe it. I've decided that faith is what some facts are made of and that the true meaning of Easter isn't just the escape from sin and death but, in part, the escape from thought itself, one of humanity's direst oppressors and, perhaps, the hardest to shake off.
 This year, when so many more solid-seeming facts have proved to be not entirely satisfying (see the stimulant effects of increased government spending and lowered interest rates), I've decided to celebrate into existence 12 months of optimism and abundance, for America and the whole world. Why not? In economics, it has long been recognized that markets are driven not only by rationality, nor even chiefly by rationality, but also by a non-thought-related energy known to the experts as ''animal spirits.'' Well, I'm raising my animal spirits. I'm raising them high, like a sacred cup of wine.
 The Easter Bunny has no hands, it's true, but my children's enjoyment of the holiday didn't suffer from this realization. In fact, it has grown over the years, perhaps because their expectations for Easter didn't start out particularly high. (As isn't the case with hyped-up Christmas, which hasn't been the same since Santa vanished.) They hunt for eggs, sit peacefully through church, gorge on candy, pretend to eat their lamb, gorge on more candy and, later, drift off to sleep, usually with new stuffed animals tucked tight against their sides. They do all this even though they know, by now, something about the cross, the crown of thorns and various other unsettling grown-up matters, from unemployment to terrorism. It's a wonder that they can forget about these things long enough to dig the sugary chicks from the wads of phony cellophane ''grass'' packing their made-in-China Easter baskets, but it's only one wonder among many -- including the fact that they exist at all, which I'm not sure they properly appreciate. They certainly weren't born of thought, my son and daughter. Nor do they live by thought, when I come to think of it.
 So this Easter I'm vowing not to think at all, and I'm not going to face the facts; I'm making new ones. I'm making them the way I dye the eggs and hide them behind the furniture: humanly yet magically, with nothing but my own two paws.

HEADLINE: Forgotten Florida, Through a Writer's Eyes

BYLINE: By ADAM H. GRAHAM

 BODY:
THINK of Florida and some well-worn images are likely to spring to mind: gaudy seaside hotels, palm-studded avenues, beaches dotted with towels and umbrellas. 
 Then there's Central Florida, a scrubby swath of live oak hammocks and sandy pine woods that defy all the tourist cliches. This is Old Florida, largely ignored by the stream of tourists on I-4, en route to Disney World or the coast. And this is where one of the country's first all-black communities, Eatonville, was incorporated, 123 years ago. 
 The town, once neatly divided by a dirt road, was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, the anthropologist, writer and Harlem Renaissance troubadour best known for her novel ''Their Eyes Were Watching God,'' a 1937 roman a clef about a black woman's search for love in a decidedly untouristy Florida. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Hurston's death, and Eatonville and other towns that Hurston lived in are taking note of the author's vibrant life. 
 Much has been written about Hurston's novels, her ethnographic fieldwork and her contrarian style of politics that railed against conventional race relations. But few have written about her as a traveler. She journeyed extensively in the Caribbean and in the southern United States, and maintained a scrappy hobo spirit, laughing at the Jim Crow laws that were dominant in her day. 
 In her autobiography ''Dust Tracks on a Road'' (1942) Hurston describes the elation of jumping midnight trains, riding paddleboats and roving around as a wardrobe girl for a roaming Gilbert & Sullivan theater troupe. She loved traveling, and nowhere more so than in Florida. Indeed, she created a guide for the state, part of a series produced by the Federal Writer's Project between 1935 and 1943. 
 Though Central Florida has changed radically over the last century, the places Hurston called home during her childhood (before 1914) and later, from 1932 to 1960 -- Eatonville, Fort Pierce, Sanford, Daytona Beach and Jacksonville -- have retained much of their Old Florida charm. Together these towns and cities reveal an evocative slice of Hurston's Florida.
 Hurston's accounts of her childhood are by turns ambiguous and exaggerated. She claimed to have been born in Eatonville in 1901, but her birth date has since been determined to be Jan. 7, 1891, in Notasulga, Ala. She was a preacher's daughter, the fifth of eight children of the Rev. John Hurston, who eventually became mayor of Eatonville, where the family moved in the 1890s, and Lucy Ann Hurston, a former schoolteacher.
 The area became the inspiration for Hurston's fiction and essays, and was also the source of her W.P.A. work (Hurston studied anthropology with Margaret Mead and Franz Boas at Columbia University, and it was her work on an ethnographic project that brought her back to Florida in 1927; in 1932 she returned permanently.) 
 In ''Dust Tracks,'' Hurston regales readers with stories of her ruminative youth, too aspirational to believe at times. ''I used to climb to the top of one of the huge chinaberry trees, which guarded our front gate, and look out over the world. The most interesting thing that I saw was the horizon. It grew upon me that I ought to walk out to the horizon and see what the end of the world was like.'' 
 But the writing in her 1939 guidebook, ''Florida: A Guide to the Southernmost State,'' reveals an honesty that captures the spirit of both her and the town: ''Right in front of Willie Sewel's yellow-painted house, the hard road quits being the hard road for a generous mile and becomes the heart of Eatonville.''
 When Hurston was 13, her mother died, and Zora was sent to boarding school at Florida Baptist Academy in Jacksonville. After being expelled (for nonpayment) in 1905 at age 14, she returned to Eatonville via the City of Jacksonville, a famed side-wheeler that chugged along the St. Johns River to Sanford. In ''Dust Tracks,'' she describes the journey: ''The curtain of trees along the river shut out the world ... the smothering foliage that draped riverbanks, the miles of purple hyacinths, all thrilled me anew.''
 Many of the towns Hurston sailed past and later wrote about have vanished as Florida's railroads, and then highways, replaced the St. Johns River as the major thoroughfare in the region. Today, a few river cruises try to re-create Florida's steamboat era: the M/V Rivership Romance is a retired tug from Chicago, refurbished before beginning a new life as an eco-tour vessel, and USA River Cruises travels between Amelia Island and Sanford.
 Eatonville is where travelers interested in Hurston will want to linger. Hurston returned to Eatonville from an economically depressed New York in 1932 to conduct ethnographic fieldwork and with the hope of teaching at area colleges. On April 27, 1932, a few years into the Great Depression, Hurston wrote a letter from New York to her benefactor, the New York socialite Charlotte Osgood Mason, saying: ''I am going to Eatonville, Fla., and keep in touch with schools from there. Somehow a great weight seems lifted from me.''
 On May 8, 1932, no more than a week back home, she wrote Mrs. Mason, exclaiming: ''I am happy here, happier than I have been for years. The air is sweet, yes, literally sweet. I am renewed like the eagle. The clang and clamor of New York drops away like a last year's dream.'' 
 A WALK down East Kennedy Boulevard, Eatonville's main thoroughfare, passes by Fades to Fro's Barbershop and Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church, where Hurston's father, the mayor in 1897, became the minister in 1902. The Zora Neale Hurston museum on Kennedy Boulevard arranges guided tours and has free maps for self-guided walks.
 Across the street from the museum is Hurston's alma mater, the boxy-looking Hungerford School. At the southern end of town on West Avenue is glassy Lake Belle, where ''the mocking birds sang all night and alligators trumpeted from their stronghold,'' according to a passage in ''Dust Tracks.'' 
 There are more than a dozen churches in town, too, including the gigantic Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church and the smaller St. Lawrence African Methodist Church, the town's first, founded in 1881 and rebuilt in 1974. The modern structure is filled with 1920s-era murals depicting Eatonville residents at worship.
 Today, residents often gather at Gordon's Be-Back Fish House, a modest but clean five-table diner on the corner of East Street and Kennedy Boulevard where the tasty offerings include moist slices of 'tater bread, grits and hush puppies. A fried fish basket is $7.50. On a wall hangs a photograph of President Obama's inaugural ceremony, next to a sign that reads: ''No Wearing Pants Below the Waist in Here.'' A former mayor, Abraham Gordon, runs the place.
 You'll hear the clang of the Amtrak train from the shaded bench outside. That train, which stops in neighboring Winter Park, is the same one that the characters Janie and Joe arrived on after their shotgun wedding in Green Cove Springs in ''Their Eyes Were Watching God.'' In her adult years, Hurston lived in Eatonville on and off for a decade but moved around to places like St. Augustine, Jacksonville, Sanford, Daytona, Eau Gallie and Belle Glade, sometimes venturing farther inland to Cross City and Polk County. She spent her later years in Fort Pierce, which has done more than any other community in the area to honor Hurston's life.
 The small Treasure Coast city has erected eight Dust Track Trail markers. One of them is now placed at her gravesite, which the author Alice Walker unearthed in 1973 when she wrote her now-famous ''Looking for Zora'' article in Ms. Magazine, and which renewed interest in Hurston's work. A three-day Zora Fest, April 16 to 18, will include lectures, discussions, performances and guided trolley tours.
 Fort Pierce's business district snakes down Avenue D and resembles a colorful Caribbean town. Brightly painted storefronts like La Chic Beauty Salon, Shorty's Cold Spot and Soul Fighters for Jesus Ministry, adorned with hand-painted signs, have a jumbled grace about them. At the end of Avenue D sits Granny's Kitchen, which opened in 1975 and churns out hearty mashed lima beans, fried chicken and chitterlings. 
 It's run by Miss Hassie Russ, a former student of Hurston's at the Lincoln Park Academy, where Hurston taught Language Arts in 1958. On a chilly December day, Miss Russ sat down at my table to refill my unsweetened tea and share a few good Hurston yarns.
 When Hurston fell ill around 1959, Miss Russ, then her neighbor, cared for and cooked for her at a sunny shotgun cottage with a garden out back. It was owned by a local doctor, Clem C. Benton, who let Hurston use the house free, and it's now labeled with Dust Track Heritage Marker 3. Dr. Benton's daughters have lovingly restored the house and filled it with orange-crate bookshelves, period furniture and books that Hurston read.
 Hurston spent her last days in the St. Lucie Welfare Home in Fort Pierce. She died on Jan. 28, 1960, and was buried in the weed-choked Genesee Cemetery (renamed the Garden of Heavenly Rest), now marked by Dust Track Heritage Marker 4 and considerably manicured. Her name was misspelled on her gravestone -- it read Zora Neil Hurston -- but it's since been corrected by Alice Walker, and the epitaph reads, ''A Genius of the South.''
 Miss Russ regaled me with stories of the 1950s, while I tucked into my smothered steak and collard greens. ''But what about segregation? All those buses and trains Zora rode? Didn't she ever ride in the back of the bus?'' I asked, still puzzled by the logistics of her intrepid travels with little mention of inequality.
 Miss Russ laughed, and said: ''Oh, no. Zora marched to her own beat. She talked her way up front.''

HEADLINE: Start-Ups, Not Bailouts

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Here's my fun fact for the day, provided courtesy of Robert Litan, who directs research at the Kauffman Foundation, which specializes in promoting innovation in America: ''Between 1980 and 2005, virtually all net new jobs created in the U.S. were created by firms that were 5 years old or less,'' said Litan. ''That is about 40 million jobs. That means the established firms created no new net jobs during that period.''
 Message: If we want to bring down unemployment in a sustainable way, neither rescuing General Motors nor funding more road construction will do it. We need to create a big bushel of new companies -- fast. We've got to get more Americans working again for their own dignity -- and to generate the rising incomes and wealth we need to pay for existing entitlements, as well as all the new investments we'll need to make. It was just reported that Social Security this year will pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes -- a red line we were not expected to cross until at least 2016. 
 But you cannot say this often enough: Good-paying jobs don't come from bailouts. They come from start-ups. And where do start-ups come from? They come from smart, creative, inspired risk-takers. How do we get more of those? There are only two ways: grow more by improving our schools or import more by recruiting talented immigrants. Surely, we need to do both, and we need to start by breaking the deadlock in Congress over immigration, so we can develop a much more strategic approach to attracting more of the world's creative risk-takers. ''Roughly 25 percent of successful high-tech start-ups over the last decade were founded or co-founded by immigrants,'' said Litan. Think Sergey Brin, the Russian-born co-founder of Google, or Vinod Khosla, the India-born co-founder of Sun Microsystems. 
 That is no surprise. After all, Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft, asks: What made America this incredible engine of prosperity? It was immigration, plus free markets. Because we were so open to immigration -- and immigrants are by definition high-aspiring risk-takers, ready to leave their native lands in search of greater opportunities -- ''we as a country accumulated a disproportionate share of the world's high-I.Q. risk-takers.''
 In addition, because of our vibrant and meritocratic university system, the best foreign students who wanted the best education also came here, and many of them also stayed. In its heyday, our unique system also attracted a disproportionate share of high-I.Q. risk-takers to high government service. So when you put all this together, with our free markets and democracy, it made it easy here for creative, high-I.Q. risk-takers to raise capital for their ideas and commercialize them. In short, America had a very powerful, self-reinforcing engine for growing innovative new companies.
 ''When you get this happy coincidence of high-I.Q. risk-takers in government and a society that is biased toward high-I.Q. risk-takers, you get these above-average returns as a country,'' argued Mundie. ''What is common to Singapore, Israel and America? They were all built by high-I.Q. risk-takers and all thrived -- but only in the U.S. did it happen at a large scale and with global diversity, so you had this really rich cross-section.'' 
 What is worrisome about America today is the combination of cutbacks in higher education, restrictions on immigration and a toxic public space that dissuades talented people from going into government. Together, all of these trends are slowly eating away at our differentiated edge in attracting and enabling the world's biggest mass of smart, creative risk-takers.
 It isn't drastic, but it is a decline -- at a time when technology is allowing other countries to leverage and empower more of their own high-I.Q. risk-takers. If we don't reverse this trend, over time, ''we could lose our most important competitive edge -- the only edge from which sustainable advantage accrues'' -- having the world's biggest and most diverse pool of high-I.Q. risk-takers, said Mundie. ''If we don't have that competitive edge, our standard of living will eventually revert to the global mean.''
 Right now we have thousands of foreign students in America and one million engineers, scientists and other highly skilled workers here on H-1B temporary visas, which require them to return home when the visas expire. That's nuts. ''We ought to have a 'job-creators visa' for people already here,'' said Litan. ''And once you've hired, say, 5 or 10 American nonfamily members, you should get a green card.''
 We need health care, financial reform and education reform. But we also need to be thinking just as seriously and urgently about what are the ingredients that foster entrepreneurship -- how new businesses are catalyzed, inspired and enabled and how we enlist more people to do that -- so no one ever says about America what that officer says to Tom Cruise in ''Top Gun'': ''Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash.'' 
 Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

HEADLINE: Rejoice, Muffy and Biff: The Preppy Primer Is Getting an Update

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Just when you thought it was safe to get back in your khakis.
 Three decades after ''The Official Preppy Handbook'' was first unleashed into bookstores, a follow-up called ''True Prep'' is in the works -- hoping to reignite preppy fervor, update the mindset and explain just what it means to be a Chip or a Muffy in a Barack world. 
 The original volume, a slim, plaid-covered paperback that poked fun at the gin-soaked polo-shirt and loafer-wearing set, started out as a piquant bit of mockery but, like ''Liar's Poker,'' a bestseller about bond traders, and ''Wall Street,'' the movie in which Michael Douglas declared greed to be good, it ended up being adopted as a kind of guidebook for those who wanted in. 
 The book sold 1.3 million copies, many to aspiring prepsters who wanted to know where to shop, what to wear and how to fully appreciate what it called ''the virtues of pink and green.'' 
 Among those buyers was Chip Kidd, one of the industry's best-known book designers, who loved the original as a teenager growing up near Reading, Pa., where he attended public high school and adored topsiders. The handbook, he said, ''changed my life.''
 Now he has teamed with the editor and one of the writers of the original volume, Lisa Birnbach, for the follow-up, due out in September. ''As a fan, that is why I kind of instigated this whole thing,'' he said of the new volume. ''I wanted the next book.'' 
 The blogosphere is filled with fans eagerly awaiting the new book. The first handbook ''was like a bible to us,'' said Alice Richardson, 44, who blogs about preppy things at ''Summer Is a Verb'' (summerisaverb.blogspot.com).
 Ms. Birnbach, 52, insists that the first book was intended to gently mock prep-school culture. She says she was surprised by how many people took it so seriously.
 ''I didn't think people wanted to be like us,'' said Ms. Birnbach, who attended Riverdale Country School and Brown University, then went on to enjoy what some might called the Life Well-Prepped: writing college guides and co-writing books about friendship, motherhood and being Jewish, as well as working a stint as a correspondent on CBS's ''Early Show.'' 
 ''And I didn't know that two years after this little paperback book came out that I would still be answering letters seeking advice or be on the lecture circuit telling people how to be more like this,'' she added.
 The first book came as the country was tipping into recession, and it was fun to hate the rich. This one arrives with the country struggling to emerge from the biggest economic downtown since the Great Depression and it's once again fun to hate the rich.
 But even for prepsters, it turns out, the world has changed.
 While the original book dwelled on such themes as the timelessness of preppy culture (''In a true democracy, everyone can be upper class and live in Connecticut''), the secret language of prepsters (''Summer is a verb'') and when it is proper to wear socks with Gucci loafers (Never!), the sequel will include segments on alcohol rehab and newfangled technology (no texting at the table, if you please). Edmund White contributes an essay on the gay preppy scene.
 And while ''True Prep'' dispenses a dollop of the upper-class frugality, many of its featured items are a bit more upmarket than the duck shoes and other L.L. Bean duds that dominated the first volume. Think Tory Burch, E. Goyard bags and the luxury jewelry brand Verdura.
 The new book also includes a section on black preppies, led by President Obama, noting that his wife, Michelle, often appears in J. Crew outfits. The first volume, which has been out of print for nearly 15 years, was not devoid of black faces; there was one on Page 163, a bow-tied lawyer in a crowd at a cocktail party. 
 The idea for the new book was born after Ms. Birnbach and Mr. Kidd became acquainted on Facebook and decided to meet for lunch last May.
 Sonny Mehta, chairman of the Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, said he was intrigued by their partnership, as well as the concept. ''They felt they could do something which really wasn't a sequel, but something wholly original,'' said Mr. Mehta, who is planning a 150,000 first-print run.
 On a recent early spring afternoon, Ms. Birnbach and Mr. Kidd were overseeing a photo shoot at the studio of Geoff Spear, a photographer who has collaborated with Mr. Kidd on numerous book jackets. Though playful, there was a certain earnestness to the project. Mr. Kidd, wearing a Ralph Lauren lavender linen shirt and khaki trousers imprinted with small skull-and-crossbones, often stepped in to show the models how he wanted them to pose. Ms. Birnbach, tall and willowy, stood behind the camera, smiling in encouragement. 
 Since the first book was published, Ms. Birnbach said that she had been asked many times to revisit the preppy topic. 
 A few years ago, Workman, the publisher of the original handbook, asked if she would be interested in collaborating on a sequel. She said she was ready to sign on, but Susan Bolotin, editor in chief at Workman, said the publisher wanted other original participants to agree to the project. Jonathan Roberts, who came up with the original concept for the first book and was one of its writers, didn't want to take part.
 ''The only reason you do something again is if maybe you're going to do it better -- like 'Godfather II,' '' Mr. Roberts, a screenwriter, said in a telephone interview. ''But 'Preppy Handbook?' I mean, come on. The subversive idea behind it was if you can reveal all of the secret systems and totems by which a portion of society keeps its elite status, you kind of pull the rug out from under them.'' He added: ''The only reason to do it is if you're trying to reverse the satire and encourage more people to adopt that kind of camp.''
 Readers who were born after the first book was published are waiting for their generation's edition. Helen ''Hopsy'' Goblirsch, a 25-year-old event planner for a real estate developer in Dallas who blogs at ''Monograms and Manicures'' (kappaprep.com), said she discovered the original handbook when she was a sophomore at the Taft School in Watertown, Conn. 
 ''I guess it's like when you're a doctor you love to watch 'ER' or 'Grey's Anatomy' to see how they portray you,'' Ms. Goblirsch said. And as a sign of the book's power as imprimatur, she said, ''I'm hoping that Taft makes it this time. We did not back in the 1980s.''

HEADLINE: A Bold Vision, Still Ahead Of Its Time

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
IT is perhaps inevitable that we are still catching up with Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who worked practically at the speed of thought and who died of a drug overdose in 1982 at 37, leaving behind more than 40 films. ''World on a Wire,'' an obscure two-part television movie he made in 1973, is a textbook example of a film that was ahead of its time. Head-trip cinema about virtual-reality immersions, it's an analog-age ''Avatar,'' a movie that anticipates ''Blade Runner'' in its meditation on artificial and human intelligence and ''The Matrix'' in its conception of reality as a computer-generated illusion. 
 Since its broadcast on German television in October 1973, ''World on a Wire'' has gone largely unseen. Digitally restored by the Fassbinder Foundation under the supervision of its original cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, a spiffed-up version of the three-and-a-half-hour film had its premiere in February at the Berlin Film Festival. Before that -- according to Juliane Lorenz, Fassbinder's longtime editor and the president of the Fassbinder Foundation -- it had been shown on the big screen only a handful of times, at retrospectives in the '90s. The film is set to receive its first ever theatrical run at the Museum of Modern Art in New York from April 14 through 19. 
 Adapted from ''Simulacron-3,'' a 1964 novel by Daniel F. Galouye, ''World on a Wire'' revolves around a cybernetics corporation that has created a miniature world populated with ''identity units'' unaware that they are being controlled from above. Toggling between dimensions, a researcher (Klaus Lowitsch) learns that what he has always known as the real world may itself be a simulation. This is the brand of existential horror that Philip K. Dick perfected (notably in ''Time Out of Joint'') but that took off cinematically only in the late '90s, in a subgenre that the writer Joshua Clover, in his book on ''The Matrix,'' terms ''edge of the construct.'' (Among the other movies in this cluster are ''The Truman Show'' and ''The Thirteenth Floor,'' another adaptation of ''Simulacron-3,'' for which Mr. Ballhaus was an executive producer.)
 ''We knew almost nothing about computers,'' said Fritz Muller-Scherz, who wrote ''World on a Wire'' with Fassbinder. ''But Rainer and I were fascinated by the question, If there are other artificial worlds, how can a real world even exist?'' 
 The notion of Fassbinder tackling science fiction might seem strange given the extent to which his films are embedded in social and historical realities. More than any other figure of the New German Cinema, he insisted on showing what his countrymen failed to see or refused to remember, whether in a forbidden-love melodrama like ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' (1974) or in his women's pictures set during Germany's postwar economic miracle, like ''The Marriage of Maria Braun'' (1979). But from the start Fassbinder was also taken with the subversive potential of genre filmmaking. ''Love Is Colder Than Death'' (1969) and ''The American Soldier'' (1970) are both gangster-movie riffs. ''Whity'' (1971), about a black slave in 19th-century America, is a pointedly revisionist western. 
 Science fiction is a ready-made sandbox for a filmmaker who never stopped wondering what it means to be human. ''His main themes were all present: power, dependence, exploitation, manipulation,'' Mr. Muller-Scherz said. The difference in ''World on a Wire'' is that the mind games play out not within an interpersonal context but on a cosmic scale.
 Replete with chases and explosions, ''World on a Wire'' was conceived as cerebral entertainment. ''We wanted to make a suspenseful film,'' Mr. Muller-Scherz said, ''but also one that would convey the seriousness of these scary ideas.'' He added that he and Fassbinder had responded strongly to ''the idea that we were remote-controlled in many ways.'' The back cover copy on the original Bantam paperback hypes ''Simulacron-3'' as ''a shattering picture of our world in the very near future, when Madison Avenue and the public opinion pollsters take over!'' While the story predicts the rise of behavioral modeling as a capitalist tool, Fassbinder, born mere weeks after the German surrender in World War II, probably also had in mind the not-so-distant history of fascist social control. 
 While some interiors were filmed in Germany, Fassbinder found his dystopian urban landscapes in Paris. As Jean-Luc Godard had done with ''Alphaville'' (1965), Fassbinder used the city's new architecture -- underground shopping malls, hulking concrete high-rises -- to suggest an ominous future world. 
 With a budget of 900,000 Deutschmarks (more than $300,000 at the time) and a 44-day shoot, ''World on a Wire'' was a large production by Fassbinder's standards, although it was hardly the only project demanding his attention. He would shoot three more films in 1973 (including ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul''). The script was knocked out over six weekends in Paris, Mr. Muller-Scherz recalled, at a ''crummy little bistro'' where he and Fassbinder would take breaks from writing with rounds of pinball. During the week, they were in Bochum, Germany, splitting their time between a stage production with the director Peter Zadek and the set of ''The Tenderness of Wolves,'' a vampire movie directed by Ulli Lommel and written by Kurt Raab, both veterans of the Fassbinder company. 
 ''World on a Wire'' marks an evolutionary leap in the partnership between Fassbinder and Mr. Ballhaus, who shot 15 Fassbinder films before going on to a Hollywood career with Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola. While the Fassbinder films of the early '70s have an almost theatrical flatness, the layered compositions and sinuous camera moves of ''World on a Wire'' anticipate hyperstylized later collaborations like ''Chinese Roulette'' (1976). 
 Mr. Ballhaus worked with Mr. Raab -- who has a small role in ''World on a Wire'' and (as on most early Fassbinder films) handled the art direction -- to outfit the chicly furnished locations with mirrors and glass objects. ''They were important for a story where you never know what's real or what's a reflection,'' Mr. Ballhaus said. Fassbinder's love of mirrors as decor and alienation devices, inherited from his idol Douglas Sirk, reaches a dizzying peak in ''World on a Wire.'' Almost every shot features at least one mirror image; faces and bodies are reflected in tabletops, refracted through lamps, caught between infinity mirrors. 
 The constantly panning and tracking camera, which must often capture an actor's reflection while avoiding its own, suggests painstaking preparation, but Fassbinder worked as he always did. He stayed away from the locations until the last possible moment, according to Mr. Ballhaus. The most byzantine maneuvers were devised on the spot. ''I always had my own ideas,'' Mr. Ballhaus said, ''but he would usually think about it and come up with a better idea.'' 
 By all accounts it was an untroubled shoot. Productivity was never an issue with Fassbinder, but the confusion between on- and off-camera drama could be. ''It was a catastrophe when he let his private life get an upper hand,'' said Mr. Lommel, who plays a snooping journalist in ''World on a Wire.'' ''But I never saw him as disciplined as on this movie.'' 
 Which isn't to say it was all work all the time. The entourage spent most nights at a club called Alcazar, Fassbinder's favorite Paris haunt, which is featured in a few scenes. Mr. Lowitsch (who died in 2002) pulled off an intense, often physical role despite being, as Mr. Lommel put it, ''never not drunk.'' 
 ''It was his way of dealing with the pressure,'' said Mr. Lommel, who was assigned to be Mr. Lowitsch's chaperone and drinking buddy. Mr. Lommel said that he soon grew tired of the nightly benders -- they often went straight from the bars to the set -- but was instructed by Fassbinder to persist for the sake of the film.
 Fassbinder did not rank ''World on a Wire'' among the Top 10 of his own movies (he was a compulsive list maker), but it seemed to be of some significance to him. In his notes for one of his most personal films, ''In a Year of 13 Moons'' (1978), a response to an ex-lover's suicide, Fassbinder describes a scene (which never made it into the movie) in which the protagonist is reduced to tears while reading a novel about parallel realities called ''Worlds on Wires.'' Mr. Lommel said that the last time they spoke, in 1981, Fassbinder mentioned his hope that ''World on a Wire'' would one day be released as a movie. 
 The recent Berlin premiere of the restoration, presided over by Ms. Lorenz, was attended by Mr. Ballhaus, Mr. Muller-Scherz and many of the surviving cast members, including Gunter Lamprecht, Ingrid Caven and Mr. Lommel. The evening felt both like a reunion and a truce, with the various factions of Fassbinder associates that have recently feuded over his legacy setting aside their differences to honor a major rediscovery.
 If anyone could get the old clan back together it would, of course, be the puppet master himself, still controlling his world on a wire. ''You could say the film was a parallel to the Fassbinder universe,'' Mr. Muller-Scherz said. ''We were all collaborators who were emotionally dependent on each other.''

HEADLINE: A Closer Reading of Roman Vishniac

BYLINE: By ALANA NEWHOUSE. 
Alana Newhouse is the editor in chief of Tablet magazine, an online publication devoted to Jewish life and culture. This is her first article for The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
In 1983, Farrar, Straus & Giroux published a book of pictures of prewar Eastern European Jewish life by the photographer Roman Vishniac. Titled ''A Vanished World,'' the book evoked what many have come to imagine as life in the shtetl: elegiac images of small cities and provincial villages, their hunchback rabbis walking cobblestone streets, Talmud prodigies studying by candlelight, men whispering in courtyards -- a vision lighted with authenticity and charged with nostalgia. Through this and other books, Vishniac's body of work has come to be thought of as the last photographic record of a universe on the cusp of being comprehensively and cataclysmically destroyed. His pictures were used in so many influential books about Jewish life before the Holocaust -- as illustrations for books by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Irving Howe and later serving as what Janusz Kaminski called the ''guiding force'' for his Oscar-winning cinematography of ''Schindler's List''-- that Vishniac, who died in 1990, has virtually become, in the words of Leon Wieseltier, the literary editor of The New Republic, ''the official mortuary photographer of Eastern European Jewry.'' 
 If you were to pick up a copy of ''A Vanished World'' in a contemporary American Jewish home and turn to the final spread, you would see two photographs. On the left, a man peers anxiously from a window in a metal door; on the right, a boy of no more than 3 or 4 points a small finger across his eyeline. The caption reads: ''The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1938.'' An index at the front of the book, which features additional commentary on the photographs, fills out the frightening tale: ''The pogromshchiki'' -- a lynch mob -- ''are coming. But the iron door was no protection.''
 It is a poignant scene -- haunting and full of narrative pathos. But it almost certainly did not happen. The pictures in that spread, it turns out, came from different rolls of film, probably shot in different towns -- which means, of course, that its characters were presumably not only unrelated but also most likely did not even know each other.
 Vishniac's archive is being acquired by the International Center of Photography. The collection -- which includes thousands of negatives taken during forays into Jewish communities in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia, along with reams of correspondence and personal documents -- will become part of an elite canon, one of only a handful of archives housed at the museum and research center in Midtown Manhattan. Others belong to Cornell Capa, the institution's founder; his brother, Robert Capa; and Arthur Fellig, a k a Weegee, the 20th-century street photographer. The center will be sharing the Vishniac archive with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
 But the center will not only be acquiring Vishniac's entire life's work; as the father-son spread suggests, it is also inheriting a fascinating set of ambiguities and unanswered questions -- all unexpectedly uncovered by a 34-year-old curator named Maya Benton. As Benton has discovered, Vishniac released, over the course of a five-decade career, an uncommonly small selection of his work for public consumption -- so small, in fact, that it did not include many of his finest images, artistically speaking. Instead the chosen images were, in the main, those that advanced an impression of the shtetl as populated largely by poor, pious, embattled Jews -- an impression aided by cropping and fabulist captioning done by his own hand. Vishniac's curating job was so comprehensive that it would not only limit the appreciation of his talents but also skew the popular conception of pre-Holocaust Jewish life in Europe.
 Sometime in 1989, Maya Benton, then a 14-year-old living in Los Angeles, had an epiphany. The daughter of a single mother, a psychoanalyst who as a child lived for years in a displaced-persons camp in Germany, Benton grew up in a household that was a relative rarity in American Jewish life: Yiddish speaking but cosmopolitan, well off and not Orthodox. As she lolled on the couch of her grandparents' home, Benton started sneaking chocolate rum balls from a sterling silver box -- one of two family heirlooms from, she had assumed, Novogrudek, the historic Jewish town in what is now Belarus from which her grandparents hailed before the Holocaust. As Benton stared at the weighty birthright from the alte heym, or Old World, bafflement struck: she knew, from an interview she conducted with her family members for a history class, that they fled the German invasion, hid in nearby forests, were interned at multiple labor camps and trekked through miles of often snow-covered forest in the east. How on earth, Benton thought as she considered the ornate container, did they manage to schlep this through Siberia? The confusion grew when she considered the second heirloom: a full set of Rosenthal china.
 As it turned out, the box and the china had not been in the family for generations, nor were they from Novogrudek. As Maya's grandmother, Tonia Benton, explained that afternoon, they were among the things that she and her husband bought from impoverished Germans after the war; bartering the chocolate and cigarettes they received in the displaced-persons camp, they were able to buy valuable items that could be used as currency to get the family to America. That day, Maya Benton says, she learned a lesson about people's need for, and uses of, mythical narratives.
 It was a lesson she would be reminded of 11 years later as a graduate student in art history and museum education at Harvard, when she was assigned to research a book of photography. Her mind alighted on Roman Vishniac, whose books had been familiar -- almost familial -- objects of her childhood, filled as they were with the masterful, plaintive portraits for which he was known in Holocaust-survivor circles and beyond. Plus, she said, she thought she was already pretty conversant in his life story.
 Roman Vishniac was born in Russia in 1897 to wealthy, secular Jewish parents. His father, one of Russia's leading manufacturers of umbrellas and parasols, and his mother, the daughter of a diamond dealer, raised him in Moscow. The family lived comfortably, especially in contrast to other Jews, many of whom roamed the city looking for work. ''They had a special kind of face, those people, a special kind of whisper and a special kind of footstep,'' Vishniac told a writer for The New Yorker in 1955. ''They were like hunted animals.''
 In 1918, prompted by post-revolution turmoil, Vishniac's family decided to make their way west. Vishniac at first stayed behind to continue his university studies in biology. But he eventually joined his family in Berlin. In the 1930s, as Hitler's anti-Semitic campaign began in earnest, Vishniac, armed with both a Leica and a Rolleiflex, set out east to document the world from which his people had fled. It is unknown when exactly Vishniac traveled to the Pale of Settlement, but his trips most likely began around 1935 and ended in 1938, a period marked by the increasing poverty of Jewish communities and culminating in the German takeover of Poland and its three million Jews. Vishniac later claimed that he took 16,000 photographs -- many of them, he added, with a hidden camera used to elude the local police and Orthodox authorities who forbade photography as the creation of ''graven images.'' He said he was arrested multiple times.
 ''My friends assured me that Hitler's talk was sheer bombast,'' Vishniac said in 1955. ''But I replied that he would not hesitate to exterminate those people when he got around to it. And who was there to defend them? I knew I could be of little help, but I decided that, as a Jew, it was my duty to my ancestors, who grew up among the very people who were being threatened, to preserve -- in pictures, at least -- a world that might soon cease to exist.''
 This was the accepted biography of Vishniac, told and retold in his own books and others, as well as in numerous newspaper, magazine and radio interviews. But in casting around for academic research, Benton came up short. ''In my Yiddish-speaking, secular environment, Vishniac was essential,'' she says. ''And yet I could find no scholarship.'' Benton decided to begin researching Vishniac's story herself, from the beginning -- starting with a book she had never seen before: his 1947 collection, ''Polish Jews: A Pictorial Record,'' the first published book of Vishniac's Eastern European photography.
 Considering it for the first time, Benton immediately noticed a tottering imbalance: an overabundance of pictures conveying piety and poverty, especially shots of boys in cheder, or religious school. ''Rabbi, rabbi, rabbi, followed by -- my favorite -- the sad shopkeepers with nothing to sell, then cheder, cheder, cheder, followed by one alte frau in a babushka,'' Benton trilled, prattling off an inventory of the book's images in a recent conversation in the Upper West Side apartment she shares with her husband, Daniel Reich, a lawyer. ''I thought to myself, This is a very odd publication. You would think that right after the Holocaust they would choose the images that readers could identify with. But these images are most other.''
 They were also, when taken as a whole, misleading. Jewish life in Eastern Europe, especially in the interwar years, was roiling and diverse. All kinds of people -- secular and religious, urban and rural, wealthy and poor -- consorted freely with one another in all aspects of what many of us would consider the pillars of a modern society: a lively and contentious political culture, a theater scene that rivaled those of most major European cities, a literary tradition comprising not only Yiddish and Hebrew work but also European fiction and a thriving economic trade that successfully linked cities and countrysides (one of Vishniac's unpublished pictures shows a store in a tiny Eastern European town selling oranges imported from Palestine). Even Hasidic life, so easily caricatured as provincial and isolated, was nothing of the sort: yeshivas, like today's universities, often attracted students from all over Eastern and Central Europe. The concentration of poverty and piety in Vishniac's pictures in ''Polish Jews'' created a distinct impression of timelessness, an unchanging, ''authentic society'' captured in amber.
 Benton soon encountered something else that was peculiar. Vishniac claimed that he had gone east on an ''assignment from God,'' as he put it in one interview, implying that his work was undertaken without financial support or an institutional mandate. But in a biographical note in a book published after Vishniac's death, Benton came upon a sentence that suggested otherwise: ''The Joint Distribution Committee representatives in Berlin asked Roman, who was known for his photographic work, to travel to Eastern Europe, in order to document daily life in the shtetls.'' The Joint Distribution Committee was founded in 1914 as a relief organization primarily committed to helping Jews around the world who were threatened by poverty, natural disaster or persecution. It was also, not incidentally, the same organization that fed Benton's grandmother and mother in the displaced-persons camp after the war.
 Within weeks of this discovery, Benton was on a train to the committee's headquarters in New York to investigate Vishniac's relationship with the organization. What she found in its files shocked her. Vishniac had indeed been sent on a very specific assignment: to document not the fullness of Eastern European Jewish life but its most needy, vulnerable corners for a fund-raising project. It was a noble cause, to be sure, but very different from how he later represented his work. The committee had contracts, receipts and telegrams. Benton later heard that the organization may even have produced a donation tin decorated with one of Vishniac's most famous shots, ''Sara, the Only Flowers of Her Youth.'' Recognized for excellence at an international photographic exhibition in Lucerne, Switzerland, in 1952, the picture showed a heart-rending image of an unhappy-looking young girl in bed, with a smattering of flowers painted on the dingy wall behind her. Vishniac explained that its subject, Sara, had to spend the winter in bed because her parents did not have money to buy her shoes. ''The picture of the world I had recreated in my mind -- the world my whole family came from -- was actually from a commission to document only the poor and the Orthodox,'' Benton said.
 In California for winter break not long after making these discoveries, Benton phoned Vishniac's daughter and the executor of his estate, Mara Vishniac Kohn, who was 74 and living in Santa Barbara. Though skeptical of scholars who she feared would pigeonhole her father's work as kitsch, Vishniac Kohn, whom I met not long ago, was moved by the combination of Benton's youthful energy, scholarly ambition and Yiddish kindredness. The day they met, Vishniac Kohn offered to drive with Benton to the mini-storage facility in Goleta, Calif., where she revealed a collection that included hundreds of her father's negatives, as well as a lifetime of correspondence. As Benton started sifting through the materials, it dawned on her that she was looking at work that had not been seen -- including negatives of a young girl with a recognizable smudge on her cheek. It was Sara from ''The Only Flowers of Her Youth,'' still poor but smiling and -- lo and behold -- wearing shoes.
 ''I stood there,'' Benton said, ''and thought, This is the real photographic record of Eastern European Jewish life.''
 Shtetl is the Yiddish word for ''town.'' In the taxonomy of Eastern European Jewish habitats, it fell somewhere between a shtot (a city) and a dorf (a village). According to the Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer, about 30 to 40 percent of the three million Jews in Poland before the Holocaust lived in shtetls. Many other Jews lived in large, cosmopolitan cities like Warsaw and Vilna and Krakow. And yet in the popular imagination, the word shtetl has become nearly synonymous with pre-Holocaust life -- a romantic image characterized by homogeneity and quaintness. This sentimentalization -- driven in part by secularized, often prosperous Jews troubled by the sense that their hard-earned modernity may have come at the price of tradition and authenticity -- began as far back as the 19th century and traveled with Jews from the Pale of Settlement to the shores of America. At the start of the last century, Yiddish newspapers and plays in America treated the shtetl with both love and condescension -- too close a memory not to feel homesick for, yet too obviously backward to reclaim.
 But this delicate balance was upset by the Holocaust, which twisted ambivalent affection into paralytic grief. After the war, it became difficult to view prewar images as anything but a prelude to destruction -- a backshadowing that distilled the complicated, multifaceted reality of prewar Jewish life into a two-dimensional shrine, one that deserved all the mournful appreciation that could be mustered. In January 1945, the rabbi and philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel gave a seminal speech at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York about prewar Eastern European Jewish life. It was not a factual exploration of this historical subject but rather a lyrical interpretation of what Heschel claimed was the essence of Eastern European Jewish life: its soul. ''Heschel argued that though the Eastern European Jews were destroyed, their spiritual legacy lives on,'' explains Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a professor of performance studies at New York University who has done scholarship on Eastern European Jewish culture. ''It is indestructible, unassailable -- something the Germans could never get their hands on.'' In fact, she added, the physical destruction was barely mentioned. At the end of Heschel's speech, the audience broke into a spontaneous recitation of the Kaddish, or mourner's prayer.
 As audience members filed out of the hall, they may have seen an array of prewar photographs by Vishniac, which were on display at the institute at the time. And so it is most likely no accident that an edited version of Heschel's speech would be used two years later as the foreword to a book conceived that year: Vishniac's ''Polish Jews,'' published by Schocken. The lack of detail in Vishniac's captions made his pictures the perfect partner for Heschel's argument. Both men set aside the earthbound conventions of factual detail in service of a more profound takeaway message, one that reached beyond history to elegy. Together they offered a representation of this universe radically slanted toward the poetic -- ''a life abjectly poor in its material condition, and in its spiritual condition, exaltedly religious,'' in the words of the preface to ''Polish Jews.''
 Shortly after the book was published, Vishniac returned in earnest to his first love: photomicroscopy, the photography of specimens as seen through a microscope. A pioneer in the field, Vishniac was known for his expertise in capturing images of live subjects. In 1955, The New Yorker published an extensive two-part profile of Vishniac, focused primarily on his scientific work. ''No one who hasn't tried it can comprehend the careful planning, the diabolical perseverance and the incredible skill it takes to obtain the results he gets,'' the magazine quoted Philippe Halsman, former president of the American Society of Magazine Photographers, as saying of Vishniac. ''The man is a special kind of genius.'' The profile also described Vishniac's domestic life. After arriving in New York in 1940, he and his family settled on the Upper West Side. Six years later the couple divorced, and Vishniac remarried. The story mentioned Vishniac's pride in his son, Wolf, a Ph.D. in microbiology and a professor at Yale, whose accomplishments were detailed in almost a full paragraph. The section ended with only a brief mention of the photographer's other child: ''Vishniac's daughter, Mara, seems to have been less stirred by the world as seen through a microscope; she is married to a mechanical engineer named Otto Schiff, has two children and lives in Ohio.''
 Indeed by that time Mara Vishniac was fairly uninvested in her father's work. For starters, her parents' divorce had not been easy on her. ''My mother lived on 72nd Street, and my father lived on 81st,'' she recalled recently. ''I must have paced a groove on Broadway between those streets.'' Though she avoids discussion of her father's flaws, he was, by the accounts of many others, a difficult man. In addition to his charisma and obvious talents, he was also known to possess what Howard Greenberg, Vishniac's longtime gallerist, identified as ''one of the bigger egos on the planet.''
 But Mara Vishniac's involvement with her father's work would eventually be forced upon her under tragic circumstances. In 1973, Wolf Vishniac, on an expedition to Antarctica, fell off a 500-foot cliff and died. Aside from the pain of losing her only sibling, Mara was left with responsibility for the family's legacy. ''It suddenly hit me, I'm going to have to deal with this,'' she said. ''It was an overwhelming shock. There were literally thousands of items that I knew nothing about.'' In addition to his scientific work and Eastern European photography, her father amassed numerous collections: Far Eastern art, coins, textiles and more than 600 rare books. By the time Benton found her in January 2001, Mara had divorced her first husband, remarried (to Walter Kohn, a 1998 Nobel laureate in chemistry) and moved to Santa Barbara -- all the while heroically caring for her father's vast, unwieldy inheritance.
 As Benton has learned, Vishniac's inheritance is large, with many parts undated or randomly annotated. Strips of negatives have been cut into individual shots, which has made it grueling to reconstruct rolls.
 But the collection is also a gold mine. Not only do the unpublished photographs offer a kaleidoscopic view of prewar Jewish life -- women in modern dress and men without hats, religious people comfortably consorting with secular people, shopkeepers with plenty of wares -- they also convey a fuller sense of the photographer's artistic abilities. The result is surprising: Vishniac, who often strained to present himself as superior to others, in fact never showed the world some of his best work. He shot in a variety of styles, not simply the plaintive perspective for which he became famous. Benton cites a picture of two houses in a Carpathian mountain town. ''No one would look at this and think Vishniac,'' she said. ''There's a compositional acuity about this photo that is just tremendous -- and shocking.'' As far as Benton is concerned, she has stumbled upon an artist who deserves to be in the canon of great 20th-century social-documentary photography, on par with Henri Cartier-Bresson, Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange.
 But not all of her discoveries have been flattering. Benton has also found evidence that Vishniac did not take nearly as many pictures as he claimed, that certain photographs may have been staged and, most difficult for some of Vishniac's ardent fans, that he most likely did not use a hidden camera. Taking a loupe to certain pictures, Benton noticed, in the eyes of the subjects, the reflection of Vishniac standing before them with a camera over his face. Other claims have required only common sense to refute, like Vishniac's assertion that he took moving footage with a camera hidden in a valise. ''Have you seen film cameras from that time?'' Benton notes. ''They're not exactly camcorders you can just stick in your purse.''
 The most extensive falsification, however, is in the captions, the bulk of which Vishniac wrote after the war. Many include incredibly vivid details -- too vivid -- as well as dramatic narratives that either could not have happened or could not have happened the way Vishniac presented them. Even the selection of what Vishniac chose to publish now seems, broadly, like a distortion. ''It's as if we took pictures of homeless people in New York and then the city fell into the sea, and 50 years from now people looked at those photos and thought, That's what New York was,'' Benton says.
 When Benton raised the subject of the falsifications, Vishniac Kohn expressed little surprise. Her father always spun tales, she told me, particularly about his own experiences. Still, Vishniac Kohn had not seen proof that her father's penchant for storytelling extended to his work. And yet, rather than suppressing the coming revision, she encouraged Benton to press on, to construct as accurate an understanding of her father's archive as possible -- no matter the consequences. She knew that Benton was approaching her father's work with the utmost respect. ''The first time Maya came to work here,'' Vishniac Kohn says, ''she found a negative that was partially destroyed. She walked out the door into the garden and cried. It told me everything I needed to know.''
 Benton also began talking with Vishniac Kohn about the archive's future. It seemed to make the most sense to offer it to the International Center of Photography, which already had a substantial number of Vishniac prints -- the result of his long friendship with the institution's founder, Cornell Capa.
 The two men met in 1966 -- at which point, Capa later told The New York Times, he ''discovered how undiscovered'' Vishniac was. Capa, who saw Vishniac's work in the context of his own philosophy of social-action photography, set out to rectify this situation. In 1971, Capa curated an exhibit of Vishniac's work at the Jewish Museum, and a year later he included Vishniac in a volume he edited of work by leading ''concerned photographers,'' including Bruce Davidson, Hiroshi Hamaya, Donald McCullin and W. Eugene Smith.
 Capa's ''rediscovery'' of Vishniac could not have come at a more propitious moment. Two years before the two men met, the atomized Jewish nostalgia for Eastern Europe that was percolating for decades reached a culmination of sorts in ''Fiddler on the Roof,''the wildly successful musical loosely based on a series of short stories by Sholem Aleichem. Over the course of its eight-year run on Broadway, the play solidified the shtetl as an icon in the popular imagination. In 1974, a sales executive at Schocken Books penned a memo supporting a proposal for a new book of Eastern European Jewish photography with Vishniac's work as its core. He couldn't have been clearer about his motivation: ''With a good text . . . we would have an illustrated book of social history that would also appeal to a popular Jewish nostalgia market.''
 A few years later, Michael di Capua, an editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux who worked on Isaac Bashevis Singer's ''Day of Pleasure''-- which was illustrated with 17 Vishniac photographs -- began editing a new volume of Vishniac's work, under the title ''A Vanished World.'' But by the 1980s, the attention Vishniac received in the wake of his friendship with Capa had enhanced the photographer's natural tendency toward self-aggrandizement. When Vishniac gave di Capua his captions, a red light went off. ''In the course of many hours working with Vishniac, it began to seem that he had become a mythmaker of his past -- telling stories that were better than what really happened,'' di Capua told me in January. Since it was assumed that many of the subjects in the pictures had been murdered, di Capua could no more prove that the captions were false than Vishniac could prove they were true. So di Capua came up with a solution: he would feature Vishniac's fantastical commentary in an isolated index at the front of the book. ''If I could keep that baloney away from the pictures, at least that would solve something,'' di Capua said. ''I do believe I managed to get the worst of it out.''
 When I spoke to di Capua, now an award-winning publisher with his own imprint at Scholastic Books, he sounded almost relieved to hear of Benton's discoveries. As we were about to get off the phone, he reached for his copy of ''A Vanished World'' and opened it. ''I'm cringing that I even let this go in,'' he said, referring to a photograph of a man carrying a Torah. The caption asserts that the scroll was needed by a family sitting shiva. ''Well,'' di Capua said, ''it could be true, but really, who the hell knows?''
 Late one Sunday night in January, I met Benton at the International Center of Photography. She desperately wanted me to see a set of vintage Vishniac prints recently lent to her by a man whose father worked at the Joint Distribution Committee in the 1930s and '40s. As she laid them out on a conference table, with the lights of the city flickering behind her, I saw everything in them that she saw. They were luminous and exciting: a shot of a young boy dunking his hand in a bucket overflowing with herring; a female weaver with a modern bob held back with a glowing bobby pin; a pastry-filled bakery that could easily be mistaken for one of Eugene Atget's Paris scenes. At the far end of the table, I recognized something -- or, rather, someone. It was the ''father'' from the father-and-son spread at the end of ''A Vanished World,'' here rescued from the strictures of the crop in which I first encountered him. In the fullness of this original shot, he appeared not as a man crazed with fear but as one simply looking curiously out onto the world beyond the metal door.
 For some, the repositioned Vishniac archive will, when revealed to the public in an exhibition in 2012, be a litmus test of a sort: embracing it requires the abrogation of nostalgia, but in return it offers engagement with the true past and the enrichment this brings to life in the present. ''Jews should be absolutely elated -- and not at all surprised -- to discover that Jewish life in Poland was like human society anywhere, in that it contained all the human types and all of the human experiences,'' Wieseltier, the New Republic literary editor, says. ''Will they resent being deprived by the full historical record of the holy beards and the mystical sparks, or will they have the wisdom to say, 'Good, they were blessedly like all of us'?''
 For Benton, too, the remaining mystery is not about Vishniac but about his audience -- then and now. ''What's interesting to me is less Vishniac's tendency toward mythology than the Jewish need to have those mythologies and the attachment they have to them, even in the face of evidence to the contrary,'' Benton says. ''Why are people so attached to the other story? The real story is so much better.''

 BODY:
HOW IT ENDED: New and Collected Stories, by Jay McInerney (Vintage, $15.95.) The short fiction collected here spans the nearly three decades of McInerney's career, beginning with early stories like ''It's Six A.M. Do You Know Where You Are?,'' which grew into his first novel, ''Bright Lights, Big City.'' This book, his 10th, reminds us ''how impressively broad McInerney's scope has been,'' our reviewer, Sam Tanenhaus, said, adding that McInerney's prose seems ''free of self-consciousness and of mannerism, at once postmodern and naturalistic.'' 
 ANIMAL SPIRITS: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism, by George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller (Princeton University, $16.95.)John Maynard Keynes coined the term ''animal spirits'' to describe the emotions, impulses, enthusiasms and misperceptions that drive economies. Free-market theory has assumed -- disastrously, it turns out -- that economic actors are rational. Akerlof and Shiller, who believe that work in social sciences like psychology can help us understand animal spirits, make a case for government regulation to avoid booms. 
 MY ABANDONMENT, by Peter Rock (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $13.95.) A 13-year-old who lives with her father in Forest Park in Portland, Ore., until they are discovered by a jogger is the narrator of Rock's fifth novel. Based on real events, as well as on the story of Elizabeth Smart, the Utah girl kidnapped and held prisoner by a drifter, the novel is both strange and mesmerizing. 
 TEARS IN THE DARKNESS: The Story of the Bataan Death March and Its Aftermath, by Michael Norman and Elizabeth M. Norman (Picador, $18.) In April 1942, 76,000 American and Filipino soldiers, many already close to death, were forced to walk 66 miles to a Japanese prison camp with little food and almost no water; some 11,000 died along the way. This authoritative history, based on hundreds of interviews with American, Filipino and Japanese combatants, ''seamlessly blends a wide-angle view with the stories of many individual participants,'' Dwight Garner said in The Times. 
 THE AGE OF WONDER: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science, by Richard Holmes (Vintage, $17.95.) Holmes proposes that there is such a thing as Romantic science, and that it emerged in Britain in the late 18th century. It involves, above all, a sense of wonder, which the scientists shared with contemporary poets. The book centers on the lives of William Herschel and Humphry Davy; it begins with the botanist Joseph Banks's trip to Tahiti in 1769 and ends with the voyage of the Beagle in 1831. This superb intellectual history was one of the Book Review's 10 Best Books of 2009. 
 NATURAL ELEMENTS, by Richard Mason (Vintage, $16.95.) A London hedge-fund manager, forced to reassess what is really important in her life, takes her ailing mother on a trip to her childhood home in South Africa. There they discover her grandmother's diary about her experiences during the Boer War. The connections between the characters in this sprawling narrative are ''beautifully rendered,'' our reviewer, Louisa Thomas, said. 
 ONE STATE, TWO STATES: Resolving the Israel/Palestine Conflict, by Benny Morris (Yale University, $17.) Morris, the father of Israel's ''new historians'' and once a man of the left, was convinced by the failed 2000 Camp David summit that Israel could do nothing to make Arab Muslims agree to its existence as a Jewish state. He now sees the two-state solution as a fantasy and rejects the so-called one-state solution as a call for Israel's elimination. 
 PAULINE BONAPARTE: Venus of Empire, by Flora Fraser (Anchor, $16.95.) This ''juicy portrait of Napoleon's most flamboyant and most favored sibling,'' as Alida Becker described it in the Book Review, details the amorous adventures of a woman said to be the most beautiful in Europe. She was ''a terrible role model,'' Fraser confesses. 
 ACEDIA &AMP; ME: A Marriage, Monks, and a Writer's Life, by Kathleen Norris (Riverhead, $16.) Norris intends to understand acedia, or ''paralysis of the soul,'' in all its aspects, and to distinguish between it and depression, which it resembles. Acedia, she says, is a vice, best countered by self-discipline. 
 GRAVE GOODS, by Ariana Franklin (Berkley, $15.) The heroine of this ''indecently thrilling mystery,'' as our reviewer, Marilyn Stasio, put it, is a ''mistress of the art of death,'' a 12th-century version of a forensic pathologist. ''Science and romance vie with superstition and barbarism,'' Stasio said, when Henry II orders the examination of two skeletons said to be the remains of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere. 
 MATCH DAY: One Day and One Dramatic Year in the Lives of Three New Doctors, by Brian Eule (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) Eule follows three young female doctors from the spring of their last year of medical school through the first year of their internships. He is most interested in how the system of training and practice affects doctors' personal lives.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Wall Street?

 BODY:
I was struck by Roger Lowenstein's essay in The Way We Live Now. It is the most measured and keenly perceptive analysis of how Wall Street careered off the tracks from its basic role in our society. Instead of being a vital engine for economic progress, Wall Street has spent the past two decades feathering its own nest at the expense of the entire country and beyond. A mighty pushback is necessary before our economy can right itself, but the concept of a transfer tax on frenetic trading-for-the-sake-of-trading is a weak solution. Such activities, which benefit only a few but have the potential for severe repercussions, must be isolated so only the players themselves take the risks, reap the rewards or take the hits directly. Otherwise they should be tightly regulated or abolished. MICHAEL A. NAYOR Westport, Conn.

HEADLINE: No Need for Hunting

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER BROOKS

 BODY:
DRIVE down almost any of Connecticut's back roads and you are likely to see nearly as many ''Fresh Eggs'' placards as those advertising homes for sale. Seemingly overnight, the availability of farm-fresh eggs has become a sign of the times, an indication that more and more people, having taken the locavore notion to heart, are raising their own eggs -- and raising money by selling off the extras.
 Of the many varieties of chickens bred for egg laying (as distinct from those raised for meat), the average hen produces an egg a day. At that rate, the owners of as few as three or four birds may soon find themselves up to their necks in omelets.
 ''A lot of people who have gotten hens for their backyard discover they've got too many eggs to eat, so they start to sell them,'' said 12-year-old Ethan Coutu, who manages the chicken flock at Maplecrost, his parents' 68-acre farm in Morris. ''You just have to give them open space to move around, plenty of light, feed and water, and they'll lay quite a few eggs,'' he said, although ''they eat a lot more than you would think.'' 
 With his parents' consent (and their credit card), Ethan ordered 25 chicks from a hatchery. When they began laying eggs, after about six months, he marketed them to neighbors and at the local school. Sales were slow at first -- ''We were eating a lot of eggs then,'' he said -- but they have since picked up, thanks to an area bakery that buys most of the eggs.
 Ethan sells his eggs at the bargain price of $2 a dozen, but the going rate at most other farms ranges from $3 to $5. ''In this economy, it's an easy way to pick up an extra few dollars a week,'' said Arthur Hiles, who grew up on a farm in Ohio and started Red Fence Farm in Groton at the end of his naval service. Along with cows, pigs, turkeys and Cornish broilers, Mr. Hiles keeps about 20 egg-laying chickens, which he enjoys watching as they run through the yard. ''They'll chase after you, and depending on how you raised them, you can actually pick some of them up and pet them,'' he said.
 While nutritionists may debate whether there are significant nutritional differences between free-range farm eggs and those produced by the industrial-size plants that supply most grocery stores, there seems to be no argument over which are fresher. Eggs that are rated Grade A by the Department of Agriculture may take one to two weeks to reach the store, and then sit on the shelf for another month or more, Mr. Hiles said. Farm eggs have often been laid the day you buy them, or the night before, he said, ''and if they haven't sold after two and a half weeks, we take them out of the cooler and feed them to the pigs.''
 Another point of difference is their consistency. A free-range chicken typically eats grass and weeds, and whatever bugs and worms it can find, a diet that may be augmented by a mix of grains and legumes, as well as ground oyster shells (for the calcium necessary to make eggshells). The result is a firmer, more richly yellow or orange yolk, and a white that holds together better, rather than a watery egg that runs all over the frying pan.
 Hank Barlow, owner of Barlow Beef at Wike Brothers' Farm, in Sharon, gives his flock of 150 heritage breed chickens free run of four acres, with cattle and pigs pastured elsewhere on the property. ''Everything is done by hand,'' he said. ''We feed them by hand, water them by hand, and collect the eggs by hand.'' The eggs are sold in new cartons that carry the farm's name. (Amateur egg farmers often sell their products in used cartons, Mr. Barlow pointed out, contrary to U.S.D.A. regulations. )
 The yield from Mr. Barlow's flock averages from 40 to 70 eggs a day, all in shades of brown. At White Gate Farm in East Lyme, however, eggs come in a variety of colors, from white to dark brown, speckled to bluish-green. ''It's a real crowd pleaser when we show people a dozen,'' said Nora Painten, the farm manager. ''We're very much about aesthetics here.''
 The variously colored eggs come from a 50-bird flock composed of four to five breeds of chickens, but Ms. Painten, who uses the eggs in omelets, fried rice, pad Thai, and cakes and muffins, hasn't noticed any flavor differences among them.
 White Gate's principal business is growing organic vegetables, yet eggs are an increasingly important part of sales. ''They're extremely popular,'' Ms. Painten said. ''They've become one of our biggest drawing points.''
 Similarly, when the Stietzel Family Farm in West Redding began selling its lettuces, tomatoes, corn, garlic, garlic skates, cucumbers, and hydroponic watercress a few years ago, customers kept asking about eggs. ''We had some chickens of our own, but with everybody wanting eggs, we expanded,'' said Nina Stietzel. The farm now has 150 hens, which yield about 20 dozen brown and white eggs a week. More birds will be added in a few weeks.
 A chicken's period of fertility lasts just two years, which means farmers must regularly restock their flocks. They also have to replace animals that periodically get taken by predators. To protect his hens, Mr. Barlow built a five-foot-high fence along the perimeter of his poultry field, though he still loses an occasional bird. ''We think it's a possum but we haven't caught him yet,'' he said. An electric fence at White Gate Farm keeps coyotes and foxes from the bird pasture, but hawks and owls remain a threat. ''That's part of the process,'' said Mr. Hiles of Red Fence Farm. ''You have to expect to lose a percentage.''

HEADLINE: Can Capitalism Save the Planet?

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
IT may seem quaint to recall this now, but on the eve of the financial crisis, one of the biggest business stories was how large corporations were going to save the planet and make billions of dollars for their shareholders at the same time. 
 USA Today wrote glowingly about Wal-Mart's push to sell environmentally friendly light bulbs. Fortune gushed that Goldman Sachs, Continental Airlines and DuPont had jumped on the ecological bandwagon. 
 The global economic collapse pushed the rise of green capitalism off business magazine covers, but it will surely resurface. After all, Wal-Mart and G.E. are still pushing it. In a recession, they need all the good publicity they can get.
 Now, along comes Heather Rogers, who warns about the dangers of buying into this mind-set with ''Green Gone Wrong: How Our Economy Is Undermining the Environmental Revolution'' (Scribner, 272 pages, $26). She says green capitalism is actually undermining ecological progress. 
 Ms. Rogers is a muckraking investigative reporter who is also the author of ''Gone Tomorrow: the Hidden Life of Garbage.'' She says corporate America has led us into thinking that we can save the earth mainly by buying things like compact fluorescent light bulbs, hybrid gas-electric cars and carbon offsets. 
 ''The new green wave, typified by the phrase 'lazy environmentalism,' is geared toward the masses that aren't willing to sacrifice,'' Ms. Rogers complains. ''This brand of armchair activism actualizes itself most fully in the realm of consumer goods; through buying the right products we can usher our economic system into the environmental age.''
 Ms. Rogers offers plenty of evidence that consumers who load up their shopping carts with organic food, for instance, may be unwittingly subsidizing big farm companies that are eradicating forests and defiling the soil in some developing countries. She says their governments aren't as concerned about the environment, and well-intentioned nongovernmental organizations don't have much clout.
 ''Green Gone Wrong,'' to be released later this month, doesn't just go after easy targets like big corporations that she says are clearly more interested in making money than saving the earth. 
 She is also critical of fashionably green rock bands like Coldplay, whose members fly around the world and think they can erase their sizable carbon footprints by planting trees in developing countries. In Coldplay's case, many of the trees died.
 Indeed, Ms. Rogers is so scornful of the mainstream environmental movement that a lot of her points could be used by its enemies, like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck, who are always looking for ammunition.
 Even if you don't agree with all of Ms. Rogers' assertions -- and I don't -- they are not so easily dismissed. ''Green Gone Wrong'' is well-written and exhaustively reported. The author went to places like Uruguay, Borneo and India to show problems she says the green movement has inadvertently created.
 But some of the most poignant moments come when Ms. Rogers visits organic farmers in upstate New York. She laments that they can't make a living because it is so expensive for them to comply with the federal certification requirements for organic foods. ''What isn't being talked about is that many of the small organic producers who are expected to lead the reinvention of the food system can barely make ends meet,'' she says.
 Like many books that depict a crisis, ''Green Gone Wrong'' falls short when it comes to offering solutions. All too predictably, Ms. Rogers calls for higher taxes and government spending. That sounds like wishful thinking after the Democratic majority on Capitol Hill struggled to pass health care reform. 
 It would have been better had Ms. Rogers delved more deeply into another of her suggestions: instead of buying green, we simply need to buy less stuff. She seems reluctant to push this too hard because it's a truly radical idea that flies in the face of capitalism -- green or not. 
 ''Around the world, many politicians, the conventional energy sector and manufacturers of all kinds oppose any major reduction in consumption,'' Ms. Rogers writes. ''If people start using less, then economies based on consumption -- such as that of the United States, where buying goods and services comprises 70 percent of all economic activity -- will be forced to undergo a colossal transformation.''
 At first, her muted call for a new frugality sounds almost as far-fetched as a carbon tax in the United States anytime soon. But it isn't. This is something individuals could do on their own instead of waiting for reluctant politicians to act. 
 If there was ever a time to ponder the long-term consequences of our spending habits, it's in the wake of the worst economic crisis in decades, which was fueled by rampant consumer borrowing. Is it possible that we could save the planet and restore the economy at the same time?

HEADLINE: The Power Structure

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
Among baseball people it is a reflex to praise the little things. The game's greatest virtues are said to be situational hitting, taking the extra base and, most of all, pitching and defense. To suggest that games are won with power is like saying pizza tastes good. Everybody knows it, but most people would rather say they eat health food.
 ''Relying on power -- it's been that way for quite a while now,'' Cliff Lee of the Seattle Mariners said early in spring training. ''But I think the game's turning back to more pitching and defense.''
 It was a curious statement coming from Lee, who pitched last fall for the Philadelphia Phillies, the team that led the National League in home runs. The Phillies reached the World Series and lost to the Yankees, who led the majors in homers. 
 Home runs still matter. A lot. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, teams had a .332 winning percentage last season in games in which they did not hit a home run. The Yankees were 12-24 when they did not homer. The Mets (30-64) lost at about the same rate.
 The difference was that the Yankees hit home runs in many more games than the Mets. The Mets homered in 68 games, winning 40. The Yankees homered in 126 games, winning 91.
 ''If you see the teams in the World Series, they've got power,'' Mets General Manager Omar Minaya said. ''You've got to be able to break the game open. It's not only home runs, it's slugging. I think the right word is slug. You've got to get the extra bases.''
 There were many reasons for the difference in the New York teams. The Mets were ravaged by injuries, and their new ballpark, Citi Field, is far more spacious than the new Yankee Stadium. Similarly, Citizens Bank Park is comfortable for hitters, leading to better power numbers for the Phillies.
 Home runs showed an uptick across baseball last season. According to Elias, the average game in 2009 included 2.07 home runs, the most since 2006. But it was still well below the record of 2.34 homers per game in 2000, before players were tested for steroids.
 Some teams have concluded that defense and speed are more important now than in the recent past. This may be true, but those commodities are also cheaper. Elite power hitters, like ace starting pitchers, are costly on the open market. 
 The lesson of ''Moneyball,'' Michael Lewis's 2003 best seller about the Oakland Athletics' innovative front office, was that low-payroll teams must find and exploit market inefficiencies to win. Then, it was players with a high on-base percentage. Now, it seems, elite defenders are the bargains.
 ''Defense is priced significantly less than offense,'' said Vince Gennaro, who has worked as a consultant for several major league teams. ''One reason may be that we don't have great confidence in defensive metrics.''
 Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball,'' noted that by one statistical measure, Wins Above Replacement, Seattle Mariners center fielder Franklin Gutierrez makes a greater all-around contribution than St. Louis Cardinals left fielder Matt Holliday.
 Yet Holliday, who mostly helps on offense, earned a seven-year, $120 million contract as a free agent in January. Gutierrez, a premier defender who was not a free agent, is in the first year of a four-year, $20.25 million deal.
 The Mariners present an interesting test case on the importance of home runs. Playing at spacious Safeco Field, they finished last in the league in runs last season but had the league's best earned run average. Instead of seriously pursuing Jason Bay, a power hitter who lives near Seattle, they doubled down on defense and small ball.
 Bay signed with the Mets for four years and $66 million. The Mariners, meanwhile, signed infielder Chone Figgins, an elite defender with speed who draws a lot of walks, for four years and $36 million.
 They shed first baseman Russell Branyan, who led the team in home runs with 31, and replaced him with Casey Kotchman, whose career high in homers is 14. Milton Bradley, who has never hit more than 22 home runs, was added for offensive muscle.
 ''In the grand scheme of things, you either score runs or prevent runs,'' Mariners General Manager Jack Zduriencik said. ''And we did a pretty good job last year of preventing runs.
 ''Our bullpen was really good, and our pitching pitched well a lot because the defense was good. So the fact that we're starting the season with Jack Wilson at shortstop, and we have Casey Kotchman, who also is a terrific defensive player, and added two pretty good offensive guys at the top of the order in Figgy and Milton, it bodes well for a promising year. But you have to be healthy, and players have to have good years.''
 Figgins said the Mariners' athleticism would allow them to score runs in various ways and keep them from relying on homers. With the Angels in 2002, Figgins was part of a team that won the World Series with a relentless offense that fouled off pitch after pitch, frustrating opponents into mistakes.
 The Angels that season hit fewer home runs than the league average, but they punctuated some of their biggest October moments with power. The lesson, perhaps, is that aggregate home runs may not matter as much in getting to the postseason, but to win there, a team must slug.
 ''In a short series, you've got to have that element,'' said center fielder Mike Cameron, an elite defender with power who signed with Boston in December. ''For instance, this year, Seattle's supposed to have that good element of pitching. Let's say we go to Seattle and we strike for a two-run homer in the first, in the playoffs, and we've got Josh Beckett and everybody else on the mound. That's a big difference. Big difference.''
 In last October's American League playoffs, the Yankees' opponents -- the Minnesota Twins and the Angels -- were cast as master practitioners of the finer elements. In reality, the Yankees were well equipped to beat them at their own game.
 According to Baseball Prospectus, the Yankees ranked seventh in the majors -- and first among A.L. playoff teams -- in defensive efficiency, which measures the rate at which balls in play are turned into outs. General Manager Brian Cashman improved his team defense again this off-season, with the speedy Brett Gardner and Curtis Granderson set to patrol left and center field.
 The Yankees can also afford to sign elite power hitters like Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira to lavish contracts. Now that they, too, are paying attention to defense, what inefficiency will be left for smaller-market teams to exploit? 
 ''The great equalizer was, frankly, some of the Yankees' baseball operations moves,'' Gennaro said. ''But now, particularly this off-season, I think a lot of heads are turned by the astuteness of the moves Cashman has made. It's concerning to people, because with the Yankees' resources and first-rate baseball thinking -- like the Red Sox and a couple of other teams -- it's becoming a very, very formidable challenge.''
 The Yankees spent wildly for power hitters in the years after their 2000 championship, without a title to show for it. They lunged for Jason Giambi, ignoring his defensive shortcomings, and for Gary Sheffield, who also had little defensive value.
 In Teixeira, the Yankees found a switch-hitter in his prime with the perfect mix of high-caliber offense and defense. Teixeira tied for the league lead in home runs, helped the Yankees in the field and finished the season with the final out of the World Series in his glove.
 ''You have to have a nice blend,'' Cashman said. ''Basically, you have to be a quality pitching team with quality defense, and Istill think you have to have -- without question -- power.''

HEADLINE: Burden of Paying for Wedding Bells Shifts

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to paying for a wedding while remaining financially afloat, today's rule is all hands on deck.
 Couples are relying not only on the kindness of the bride's parents, who have traditionally borne most of the burden, but also on that of the bridegroom's parents, along with the couple's stepparents and even grandparents, aunts and uncles.
 With the average American wedding running north of $28,000, according to the 2009 Conde Nast American Wedding Survey, and significantly more in major cities, most everybody must now chip in. And even as the nation seeks to shake off a deep recession, this is a trend that's likely to stick long after the employment figures rebound.
 Although her father had given her a budget for about 300 guests, when Nichole Westrom set about planning her wedding in September 2008, she learned that her fiance's family wanted to invite 100 more. 
 ''That's a good chunk of money and obviously way over budget,'' recalled Ms. Westrom, now 26 and an office manger for a security company in Indianapolis. She worried about how to pay, but then her fiance's family offered to absorb the extra costs.
 ''I still hated to ask, but they were offering,'' she said.
 Observers say that this shift away from the bride's family shouldering the bulk of the cost has been quietly under way for a number of years.
 The Association of Bridal Consultants, an organization of 4,000 wedding planners, offered evidence that the trend has accelerated since the beginning of this century.
 David M. Wood III, its president, estimated that only about 10 percent of weddings are now wholly paid for by the bride's parents, down from the 20 percent figure that the association reported from a 2003 survey.
 Mr. Wood also estimated that 33 percent of weddings are now financed by the bride and bridegroom alone, up from 27 percent in the earlier survey. 
 Whereas the bride's parents traditionally covered all but the rehearsal dinner, now the bridegroom's side is also taking care of the open bar, cake and even flowers, said Crista Tharp, a wedding planner in Kokomo, Ind. 
 ''We are hearing of aunts and uncles picking up rehearsal dinner; friends maybe hosting after-wedding brunch or one set of parents take on an entire expense,'' said Millie Martini Bratten, the editor in chief of Brides magazine. ''The rest is paid for by a combination of his and her family.'' 
 But with these shifts in the financial landscape of weddings have come changes in the dynamics of who gets to call the shots. 
 According to Lizzie Post, a great-great-granddaughter of Emily Post and a spokeswoman for the etiquette institute in Burlington, Vt., that bears her ancestor's name, ''Money should never be used as a bargaining or leveraging chip.'' Nor does she think it is ever acceptable for one family to dictate solely what's happening in the wedding -- especially if all parties are paying. ''You should get the two families together in advance and talk very respectfully and candidly about what everyone's wishes and expectations are.''
 Despite this noble and noteworthy sentiment, cracks can and do form. 
 Samantha Goldberg, an event planner in Summit, N.J., recalled a ''groomzilla'' who decided that he wanted a half-million-dollar wedding in his parents' palatial basement. He pressured the bride into the idea but then didn't do his homework on the necessary preparations. 
 At 8 a.m. on the appointed day, Ms. Goldberg said, he called her to tell her that she needed to come to his home at once. 
 ''I thought: Did someone die? Is the wedding off?'' she recalled. ''He said, 'Samantha, there are two tables not in the space we discussed.' I lost it. I was like: 'You know, you woke up my daughter, my husband, me, over two tables. I live an hour and a half from where you are, the wedding is not until tonight, and I'm going back to sleep.' I hung up.''
 Ms. Goldberg, who is a regular on the Style Network show ''Whose Wedding Is It Anyway?'' said that four of the brides whose weddings she was hired to handle called off their events after their fiances displayed controlling, foolish, demanding and cheap behavior.
 To help ensure no surprises crop up, Ms. Tharp now requires that the bride, the bridegroom and both sets of parents (or sometimes more, if stepparents are involved) fill out questionnaires before they even get down to basics. Questions include: Would you like a formal event or a more casual one? Is there anything anyone is against paying for because of religious or cultural reasons? Is there already a budget set for this? 
 ''It helps for everyone to discuss this right off the bat,'' she said, adding that even if the parents aren't involved, she always requires the bridegrooms to attend planning sessions. ''Sometimes you can see the guy doesn't want to be there. And I say, 'If you're not involved in the meetings, you're going to get swept up in this tornado and you're not going to like it.' ''
 Glenna Tooman, the owner of Memory Makers Event Planning in Boise, Idaho, agrees that it is better to bring all parties to the table from the start. ''I encourage my brides to include the groom's mother.'' She added: ''Sometimes you have a person who can be very controlling. But if they have a good relationship with the groom's mother and she is supportive of the bride, it can be a great bonding experience.''
 But as Ms. Goldberg pointed out, these sharing arrangements could easily evolve into competitions. ''Everybody becomes a party planner when they're throwing money around,'' she said.
 Ms. Goldberg pointed to a half-million-dollar wedding she is planning for June in which the bride's and bridegroom's mothers have each offered $125,000.
 The planner said she'd assumed that that was the entire budget, which seemed fine, until she began researching the flowers, which were going to cost $125,000 on their own. ''Both sides are trying to outdo each other,'' she said. ''The groom and his mom want one thing, the bride and her mom want another.''
 In 2006, Stacy Ortiz, now 29, a retail business manager in Manhattan, was engaged. Although both families had agreed to help underwrite the day, with the couple contributing, her fiance wasn't initially interested in helping with the planning. 
 But with time he became more and more involved. ''We would fight about everything from what catering hall to go to, which vendors to use, who would be responsible for what,'' she said. The arguments led to their calling off the wedding and the relationship. 
 A week after the breakup, she said, she became friendly with another man, Charles Bencomo, a computer analyst whom she would regularly see on the commuter bus that both of them took from Livingston, N.J., to Manhattan.
 She and Mr. Bencomo, 39, were married on Saturday before 200 guests at the Villa at Mountain Lakes, in Mountain Lakes, N.J. Her parents took on ''the bulk, and my fiance and I are just filling in the gaps,'' the bride said, adding, ''His parents wanted to help, but financially everyone's struggling.''
 The difference in the case of Ms. Ortiz's family is the long-term planning. Her father, she said, ''has been saving for this since I was a kid.'' 
 ''Dad is one of 10 kids, and I have 55 birth cousins, and there have only been about five weddings. So for him this is a very big deal.''
 Ms. Tharp said that spreading the costs and the planning more evenly is ultimately a good thing. She noted that back when it was the bride's family alone that made all of the decisions, bridegrooms and their families often ''felt like they were being invited to the party as almost an afterthought,'' she said. ''The groom's parents need a little more attention.''

HEADLINE: Tech And Text: The Digital Recession

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Texts Without Context'' by Michiko Kakutani [March 21]:
 This writer's thoroughly thought-provoking commentary validates Neil Postman's forewarnings in his 1992 book, ''Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology,'' in which he cautioned: ''The uncontrolled growth of technology destroys the vital source of our humanity. It creates a culture without moral foundation. It undermines certain mental processes and social relations that make human life worth living.'' 
 While Ms. Kakutani and others point to ''how digital media are reshaping our political and social landscape'' in less than friendly ways -- erasing nuance and context in the process -- we also bear witness to how technology reshaped our economic landscape by greatly facilitating the financial excesses that led to the Great Recession, having bestowed uncontrolled power upon those too-big-to-fail institutions operating within a corporate culture devoid of moral foundation. 
 While fixating on the pseudoworlds of cyberspace, the real world runs amok right before our glazed and unseeing eyes.

HEADLINE: What Happened To the Herd Mentality?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AMID all the market uncertainty of the last two years, investors have had a hard time knowing when to jump in. But once they have, they've at least known that their stocks stood a good chance of moving in the same direction as the broad market -- until the last few months, that is.
 Last year, when the economy was emerging from the financial crisis, more than 90 percent of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index moved higher. Every sector of the market participated in the S.& P.'s gain of 26 percent for the year. 
 The year before that, as the credit crisis was heating up, every sector of the S.& P. 500 lost ground, as did more than 95 percent of the stocks in the index.
 ''You didn't have to get the stocks right,'' said Duncan W. Richardson, chief equity investment officer at Eaton Vance, the asset management firm in Boston. ''You were going to make money in 2009 if you bet on equities, and you were going to lose money in '08.''
 But this year, things have started to change. It's a sign that this rally could be evolving. 
 Although the S.& P. is up since the end of December, its underlying components are much more of a mixed bag. So far this year, 376 stocks in the benchmark are up, but 124 are down. That means a quarter of stocks are bucking the market trend. 
 Strategists say that there is a simple explanation for this shift. Typically, in an extreme market crisis, like the mortgage mess of late 2007, most types of equities tend to lose money in lock step. That's because investors race for the sidelines in the hope of finding safer alternatives -- like bonds -- to ride out the storm.
 Then, when the panic is over, investors rush back into the market in unison to catch the inevitable rebound. 
 Now, equities are entering their next phase -- one traditionally marked by lower stock market correlations, said Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer's equity research group.
 According to Mr. Belski, stocks tend to diverge from one another in the year after a recession ends. And this trend often continues for two additional years thereafter.
 To be sure, the National Bureau of Economic Research (the organization of economists that is considered the official arbiter of economic cycles) has yet to declare the end of this recession, which began in December 2007. But many economists believe that it probably ended sometime last fall.
 And while stocks could start moving in the same direction again if the economy suffers another setback, ''as long as the recovery continues on track, you should expect correlations to continue to settle back into more or less their historic norms,'' said Robert D. Arnott, chairman of Research Affiliates, the asset management firm in Newport Beach, Calif.
 If that's the case, what does it mean for investors?
 At the very least, it means that ''people will have to start worrying about the value of assets, not just volatility in the market,'' said James W. Paulsen, the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.
 More specifically, investors may want to consider tilting their portfolios toward undervalued or beaten-down shares, rather than highflying, growth-oriented stocks.
 Historically, ''value stocks tend to significantly outperform growth stocks in these environments,'' Mr. Belski said. 
 That's certainly been the case this year. Value stocks in the S.& P. 500 have gained 7.4 percent in price since the end of December, versus 4 percent for growth stocks. That's a contrast to last year, when the S.& P. 500 growth index rose 29 percent, versus 17 percent for the S.& P. 500 value index.
 THESE results repeat a historical pattern. In the 12 months after the 2001 recession, for example, value stocks lost less than their growth counterparts. And in the year after the 1981-82 slump was declared over, value stocks trounced growth shares, 23 percent to 16 percent. 
 Even if investors prefer growth stocks, market strategists suggest focusing on shares of fast-growing companies that also happen to be trading at relatively cheap prices -- a strategy that's often called ''growth at a reasonable price.''
 After all, if the market has indeed entered a new phase when its broad behavior won't necessarily dictate the fortunes of individual stocks, it stands to reason that the fundamentals of a stock are likely to matter more. 
 And a fundamental question that investors ought to consider is the price they pay for their shares.

HEADLINE: Factory Food

BYLINE: By HANNAH FAIRFIELD

 BODY:
No country has embraced the movement toward commercialized, prepackaged food as much as the United States.
 Americans eat 31 percent more packaged food than fresh food, and they consume more packaged food per person than their counterparts in nearly all other countries. A sizable part of the American diet is ready-to-eat meals, like frozen pizzas and microwave dinners, and sweet or salty snack foods. 
 ''Americans tend to graze rather than sit down and eat a full meal, so the food is tailored for convenience,'' said Mark Gehlhar, who has studied global food consumer preferences at the Economic Research Service of the Agriculture Department. ''And Americans do not seem to be as discerning about quality.''
 T. Colin Campbell, a nutritionist at Cornell University, said that ''there is a lot of money tied up in the industry because it is profitable for companies to make these foods.'' He added that ''Processed foods contain large amounts of fat, salt and sugar, and Americans have become addicted to them.''
 But epidemiologic studies have shown that diets with higher levels of fat, salt and sugar lead to higher rates of heart disease, diabetes and obesity.
 The Japanese eat a large amount of packaged frozen seafood, but it undergoes very little processing and has few chemical additives. Some Europeans eat a similar amount of packaged food per capita as Americans, but much of it is bakery bread and dairy products, rather than things like frozen toaster pastries and artificial nondairy creamer.

HEADLINE: Hedge Funds Make Hay

 BODY:
Riding high on the bank bailout, hedge fund managers posted record paydays in 2009, according to an annual survey by AR: Absolute Return +Alpha magazine. 
 Leading the pack, David Tepper of Appaloosa Management made $4 billion, in part by betting successfully that the government would bail out the big banks. John Paulson, of Paulson & Company, made $2.3 billion by buying back bank stocks he shorted in 2008. And a year after his fund received $200 million in the bailout of the American International Group, Kenneth Griffin of the Citadel Investment Group made $900 million. 
 In all, the top 25 managers earned $25.3 billion in 2009, including fees and capital gains. 
 Debate is endless about the role of hedge funds, largely unregulated investment pools for institutional and wealthy investors. What is not disputable is that the funds' profits are bound up with a defective financial system that has fostered booms, busts and bailouts.
 The day after the hedge fund results were released, the government reported that unemployment was stuck at 9.7 percent, with 15 million Americans out of work. For most people with a job, average earnings fell by 2 cents an hour in March, to $18.90. To add insult to injury, some hedge fund managers and, more commonly, private equity fund managers are able to pay a much lower rate of tax than the typical working professional. 
 The tax disparity results from an outdated rule that lets a money manager in a private partnership treat a chunk of his fees as if they were long-term capital gains, taxed at a special low rate of 15 percent. Fees for managing someone else's money should be taxed as ordinary income, like wages and salary, at rates as high as 35 percent.
 President Obama has included a provision to end that special treatment in his most recent budget. For three years running, the House has passed a bill to close the loophole. In the Senate both Democrats and Republicans have resisted, all for fear of losing lucrative campaign donations.
 If lawmakers cannot even close this blatant loophole, is there any hope for real reform? The answer, now, appears to be no. In its proposal for overhauling the financial system, the administration has called for necessary, though modest, changes in how private investment groups do business -- mainly giving more power to regulators to examine their books and to compel disclosures to investors. House and Senate reform bills are weaker. 
 What is needed is fair tax treatment and stricter oversight. Lawmakers need to protect the interests of all of their constituents -- not just a handful of billionaires.

HEADLINE: Shooting the Show's Stars

BYLINE: By STEPHEN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
A LUSCIOUS yellow Ferrari sits front and center in the company's display at the auto show, a blond draped over the front fender. It's a natural snapshot for anyone who loves cars, or blonds, or both.
 Except that the car and the model are on a spinning turntable. And spotlights are throwing bright reflections off the paint and glass. People walk in front of the camera, and when the shot finally takes shape -- the model's head tilted just so, the car facing exactly right -- a nudge from a fellow Ferrari lover blurs the picture. Just a little blur, but enough. 
 Photographing cars looks easy. It isn't.
 And the challenge is more pronounced in a cavernous hall like the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where the New York auto show opened to the public on Friday -- and conditions are beyond the control of the snapshooter.
 Ask professional photographers for some guidelines to documenting an auto show and you'll get a diversity of opinions. Some say to always use flash; other say to make the best of existing lighting. One may claim it's best to get a low angle on the car, while another says it's best to shoot from above the car.
 The idea, of course, is to have fun at a car show, and for casual snapshooters using a modern digital camera, perhaps make a print or two as a souvenir. But putting some thought into the effort beforehand -- developing a theme, perhaps, like all Italian models -- makes it easier to organize thoughts, and can produce results that are more satisfying.
 ''The bottom line in shooting an auto show is to make the best of a poor situation,'' said John Rettie, a California-based auto photographer.
 Mr. Rettie should know. He has worked for Ward's Automotive, J. D. Power & Associates and most recently, Rangefinder, a magazine for professionals. A regular at auto shows, he took photographs for autotrader.com during last week's press preview in New York.
 At the top of Mr. Rettie's preshow checklist is choosing the right lens -- or the appropriate focal length if the camera has a zoom lens. He favors a wide-angle lens and uses fast shutter speeds to freeze moving objects. He suggests using a high ISO setting -- 3,200 if the camera offers it -- which increases its capability to shoot in dim light. But higher ISO settings may add ''noise'' -- the electronic equivalent of grain in film -- to an image.
 Mr. Rettie leaves himself open to ideas while on the show floor. For instance, one of his favorite images from the recent Geneva show was a shot of a Mini Countryman hanging on a wall. 
 He added: ''A problem you'll find is that you might be photographing a Volkswagen, but there's a Honda sign right behind it. I made use of that, photographing a Bertone concept car with two incredibly high gullwing doors. Behind it was the stand for Italdesign, a Bertone competitor. I waited for the car to come around and got a shot of the gullwing doors squashing the Italdesign logo.''
 Among the other tricks experts offer is to try different vantage points. Experiment with lying on the ground and shooting upward. You can get a high angle without a stepladder by using a camera with a swing-away LCD monitor for the viewfinder and holding the camera at arm's length above your head for a view over the crowd. 
 Patience, above all, is a trait to be cultivated
 ''If you've got a person or people in a photo and they're not moving, I move around so that they become part of the picture,'' Mr. Rettie said. ''I wanted to get a Peugeot concept car, and two journalists were interviewing the designer inside the car, and I had to live with that. They became part of the picture.''

HEADLINE: The Waning of Private Medical Practice

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''More Doctors Giving Up Private Clinics'' (Business Day, March 26):
 I differ with the assumption that a large health care organization ensures a ''higher quality'' of care. As the article observed, ''the intimacy of longstanding doctor-patient relationships'' is disappearing. In institutional settings, ''people'' become ''patients,'' waiting long hours to see their doctors and, when finally seen, are examined by physicians who barely know their names.
 To ''patients,'' quality means being seen and heard as a person. It's when a doctor sits down and listens to their complaints, and has time to palpate a tender belly, to listen to a heart, to check the pallor under the eyelids and, only then, refer them for tests. 
 As a midwife who provides home birth services, I see women who want to feel respected in health care. Many have had birth experiences in hospitals managed by physicians in large groups, who use a by-the-clock approach to labor management, leading to labor inductions and frequent Caesarean sections.
 Our health care innovators need to find a way to support a system that is financially viable without resorting to an assembly-line approach. People who feel respected are less apt to sue. Keep ''the human'' in the equation, and I believe that malpractice suits will decline, reducing the fear-based style of health care.
 Marcy Tardio Brooklyn, March 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 ''More Doctors Giving Up Private Clinics'' is a sad commentary on the state of medicine in 21st-century America. While it's true that there can be great economies of scale when physicians merge their private practices into large hospitals and health systems, many of my colleagues have had quite negative experiences in such systems.
 The primary-care physician is often the ''low man on the totem pole.'' His or her practice needs are frequently left to languish as administrators cater to the highly paid specialists who bring their reputations, not to mention highly reimbursed procedures. This is despite numerous studies that demonstrate that those patients who are cared for by a primary-care physician have lower health care costs, fewer hospitalizations and a healthier life.
 Rather than sublimate the very ''primacy'' of primary care by selling ourselves to a large health maintenance organization or hospital system, my partners and I have charted another course by forming the pediatrician-owned and pediatrician-run Allied Pediatrics of New York. Most of us continue to operate in our original 18 neighborhood offices. Now a group of 75 pediatricians, we have been able to use our size to lower our costs for claims processing and medical and office supplies.
 We've done this in order to preserve our physician-owned, private practice of medicine.
 Gary S. Mirkin Chief Executive Allied Pediatrics of New York Great Neck, N.Y., March 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As a practicing physician in central Vermont, I work in a small practice owned by the local community hospital. I enjoy the benefits that come with the use of a hospital system; being on call is restricted to out-of-hospital telephone consultation.
 In no way does this compromise the quality of health care I provide. I provide individualized care and even make house calls on a regular basis.
 While big is often not better, the distinction between private and hospital-owned practices misses the point. Quality care is provided, or avoided, within either setting.
 Bob Schwartz Chester, Vt., March 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In ''More Doctors Giving Up Private Clinics,'' the chairman of the board of trustees of the Indiana State Medical Association is quoted as saying: ''When I was young, you didn't blink an eye at being on call all the time, going to the hospital, being up all night. But the young people coming out of training now don't want to do much call and don't want the risk of buying into a practice, but they still want a good lifestyle and a big salary. You can't have it both ways.''
 It is unfair to publicly question the ethics and expectations of resident trainees without acknowledging the dynamics of medical training today: the huge loan burden of recent medical graduates, the exponential increase in hours spent on medical administration over actual medical care, and the ever-shrinking payments that have forced private practitioners to close shop out of necessity rather than choice.
 And besides, the simple lack of desire to work 80 hours a week -- many of those hours on 30-hour shifts without days off -- for barely more than minimum wage is reasonable enough in and of itself.
 After all, medical residents -- just like patients -- are people, too.
 If the association's chairman were starting over as a resident today, these modern complications would undoubtedly make him ''blink,'' if not reconsider his career altogether.

HEADLINE: As Clattering Vestige Of Maine Goes Quiet, Workers' Anxiety Grows

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
PROSPECT HARBOR, Me. -- The women in their smudged aprons here at the sardine cannery work together in mesmerizing synchronization. Their hands flying, they fill the empty tins that clatter along the conveyer belt, packing in pieces of cut herring like, well, so many sardines.
 On April 18, the clanking will cease. The bells and buzzers that regulate the pace of packing will fall silent. The old plant, the last sardine cannery in the United States, is shutting down. 
 Once a thriving national industry -- and the backdrop of John Steinbeck's gritty ''Cannery Row'' -- sardine canneries have been dwindling for the last half-century. They have fallen victim to global competition, corporate consolidations and a general lack of appetite, at least in the United States, for sardines, despite their nutritional value and attempts by chefs to give them an image makeover.
 Bumble Bee Foods, which has owned the plant here since 2004, attributed the closing to federal regulations that have reduced the amount of Atlantic herring, sardines before processing, that can be hauled from the sea. (Although Bumble Bee is the owner, the cannery is still known as the Stinson plant, after the founding family.)
 Maine was once a frenetic hub of the sardine business, starting in the 1870s. The industry reached its peak in the early 1950s, when it employed thousands of workers at more than 50 canneries. 
 This plant, identifiable by its giant slicker-clad seafarer holding a tin of Beach Cliff sardines, is by far the biggest employer in this pocket of peninsulas more than halfway up the coastline. When its doors close, 128 people will lose their jobs, and the ripple will be felt throughout the local economy. Unemployment in Hancock County, where the plant is located, was above 12 percent in January, already higher than the state average.
 State officials have tried to lure other companies to buy the factory, and Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, has said he was optimistic that a buyer would be found and that some workers would be rehired. But many are still anxious about their futures.
 ''Everybody here is in limbo,'' said Peter Colson, the plant manager, who has worked here for 38 years. While the state is offering to help workers learn another trade and is making it easier to sign up for unemployment, he said that many would not accept an unemployment check -- himself among them. ''I've never been unemployed since I was old enough to walk,'' he said.
 The packers, all of whom are women, are the heart of the processing plant, largely because they still work the fish with their hands. They are paid by the number of cans they pack and can earn up to $18 or $19 an hour.
 In the break room off the packing floor, Nancy Harrington, 70, who has worked here for 44 years, said she did not want to retire. ''I could work another 10 years,'' she said. Her three daughters have worked here, too, and so has her sister.
 ''I don't know how to do anything else,'' Ms. Harrington said. But she is not interested in training for another job because she is convinced it would mean working with computers. ''I don't want nothing to do with computers,'' she declared. ''I don't have one, I don't want to learn. No, sir. I'm going to do my scrapbooking and quilting.''
 Dawn Lamoureux, 41, said that the closing was ''devastating'' and that she was ''still trying to deal with it.'' 
 Lela Anderson, 78, has been at the cannery for 54 years, starting back when workers used scissors to cut the herring before machines did that work.
 ''I enjoy being here,'' said Ms. Anderson, a tiny woman, adding that she had expected to celebrate her 80th birthday at the plant with friends. ''I thought this would be here for generations to come.''
 The cannery is one of the last vestiges of Maine's industrial past, and in these final days, various archivists have been granted access to document its inner workings. 
 Ben Fuller, curator of the Penobscot Marine Museum, was working with a film crew on Monday, gathering material for a historical record intended for the Library of Congress.
 ''You're bringing to a close 135 years of sardine packaging on the coast,'' he said over the whoosh of water that cleansed the frozen herring before machines sliced off their heads and tails. ''This really built up a lot of the towns here.''
 He said several factors played into the closing, beyond limits on the haul. Catching techniques are changing, he said, and the new methods can reduce the quality of herring needed for canning. There is also competition from lobstermen, who are willing to pay for the lower quality herring because they use it for bait.
 Sardine workers in Maine saw their heyday during World War II, when large orders for American troops kept their canneries clattering.
 ''After the war, we saw a rise in tuna canning,'' Mr. Fuller said. ''People could do more with tuna. There are a limited amount of things you can do with sardines.''
 Workers here do not express much interest in eating the catch. Ernie Beach, 55, who operates one of the plant's large pressure-cooker machines, which sterilize the sardines, said that few workers took advantage of company policy allowing them two free cans a day; he takes one home for his cat.
 But like the others, Mr. Beach is proud of his work. ''I'm not just the operator, I'm the maintenance man, the mechanic, I make all the adjustments, the calibrations,'' he said. ''I'm saving lives here.''
 When their break was over, the women pulled on new rubber gloves, adjusted their hair nets and returned to the assembly line. They all worked fast, as the job demands, but Mr. Colson, the manager, said with some amazement, as he looked over the daily report, that two of the women, Lulu Orozco and Alma Rodriguez had packed 5,228 cans in 195 minutes, a dizzying rate. It was an extraordinary display of dexterity and focus, if not a little sardine showmanship at the end of the line.

HEADLINE: Amid Signs of Spring, Hints of Green

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
FOR decades, the crowds expected flashy supercars and futuristic design studies from any self-respecting auto show. But between the still-shabby economy and the specter of new fuel economy and carbon-dioxide regulations, the 2010 New York International Auto Show is the biggest eat-your-peas auto affair of recent memory, offering next to nothing in high-zoot style, speed or concept cars that hadn't already been seen elsewhere.
 Yet, to the relief of everyone during two days of media previews last week, the survival-mode depression that had settled over last year's show lifted somewhat.
 Still, the overarching message of the show, which runs through April 11 at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, seemed to be this: lower your expectations. Like mothers who push healthy food at skeptical children, carmakers insisted that despite the mushy-veggies taste of smaller engines and hybrid everything, Americans will learn to love gas sippers and drive them without shame. 
 Scalebacks are an especially tricky act -- in both sheet metal and semantics -- for luxury carmakers, who suppressed their usual come-ons for decadence and performance, replacing them with assurances of social responsibility. 
 Lexus set the sober tone with the CT 200h, its first small hybrid. A hybrid version of the Cayenne will seek to give green cover to Porsche's uber-guzzling S.U.V: it can run on a V-6 gas engine, electricity or both, and do it at speeds up to 150 miles per hour with highway economy of 25 or 26 m.p.g. 
 At a show with enough subcompact sprites to make you wonder whether this was New York or Beijing, Scion showed the iQ, a 10-foot-long 100-horsepower microcar that goes on sale next year. In July, the Euro-handsome Mazda 2 will also test Americans' appetite for a snack-size 100-horsepower hatchback. Mini, already the eminence grise of tiny cars in America, showed an only mildly expanded Countryman with four doors and all-wheel-drive.
 Chevrolet will look to halt its long losing streak in compact cars with the Cruze, a sedan that replaces the Cobalt in September. An Eco version capable of 40 m.p.g. will come soon after.
 The show also provided an 11th-hour promotional opportunity for Chevrolet and Nissan to promote the green models they plan to sell by year-end. 
 Chevy let reporters take short drives in its plug-in hybrid, the Volt, while Nissan announced a $32,780 base price for its Leaf, which will be the first mass-market electric car within reach of many consumers. The Volt is expected to be close to $40,000. 
 Despite the dose of reality this year -- and the absence of exotic marques like Ferrari and Lamborghini -- showgoers can still treat themselves to eye candy like the 202-m.p.h. Bentley Supersports convertible and the GT3 racing version of Mercedes's gullwing SLS.
 The financial climate that has chilled some brands and killed others has been a long sunny vacation for Hyundai and its Korean sister brand, Kia. Sales are booming for both, including a 184 percent jump in March for the redesigned Hyundai Sonata; the company introduced hybrid and turbocharged versions of that midsize sedan. 
 Hyundai also played its value card in the high-stakes luxury market by introducing the Equus, a Korean-built full-size sedan with a base price above $50,000. Kia, its styling confidence bolstered by the hiring of Peter Schreyer, formerly of Audi, showed a striking new Optima midsize sedan and an appealing Sportage crossover. 
 The no-nonsense vibe is also driven home by a glaring lack of concept cars on the floor. Instead, the focus is almost exclusively on showroom production cars, including these: 
 VOLVO S60 The Swedish automaker showed this handsomely redesigned sedan just days after Ford agreed to sell Volvo to Geely of China. In addition to its new swagger, the S60 can detect pedestrians in its path and automatically brake itself to avoid them. A 300-horsepower in-line 6 will power the midsize S60 when it goes on sale in the fall. 
 LEXUS CT 200H In the wake of the brand's first hybrid-only model, the HS 250h midsize sedan, the compact CT 200h hatchback goes on sale early next year. The front-drive Lexus pairs a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine with dual electric motors and a nickel-metal-hydride battery. Pricing and mileage figures aren't available, but 40 m.p.g. seems a reasonable estimate.
 MAZDA 2 This subcompact hatchback, which goes on sale in July for about $15,000, impressed onlookers with its cute-and-cuddly styling. Mazda also said it would offer its Sky diesel engine in 2012 in a new midsize sedan. 
 HYUNDAI EQUUS Larger than a Lexus LS, the large, full-of-frills sedan will test whether Americans are ready for a roughly $60,000 Hyundai -- albeit one with a 385-horsepower V-8, a decadent back seat and special pampering by dealers. Buyers will also get an Apple iPad in place of an owner's manual, with applications that will let them schedule service appointments.
 HYUNDAI SONATA TURBO AND SONATA HYBRID These yin-yang variants of the standard sedan -- one fast, the other green -- will reach showrooms late this year. Hyundai says its direct-injection twin-scroll turbo 4 will have 274 horsepower and a 34 m.p.g. highway rating. The hybrid's 2.4-liter 169-horse engine, paired with a 40-horsepower electric motor, is said to be capable of 37 city m.p.g. and 39 on the highway.
 SCION IQ Already on the road in Japan, the iQ will become the second microcar on sale in the United States -- after the two-passenger Smart Fortwo -- when it goes on sale early next year for around $12,000. The iQ theoretically seats three or four people, though its back seat is especially ill-suited to long legs. 
 SCION TC Toyota's youth division seeks to repeat the success of the original coupe with a redesigned model that arrives in the fall with a price around $17,500. A 2.5-liter 4-cylinder produces 180 horsepower, and the overachieving interior has a racy flat-bottom steering wheel and thickly bolstered seats. 
 PORSCHE CAYENNE S HYBRID Porsche's first hybrid goes on sale late this year for $67,700. The powertrain will produce a total of 380 horsepower from a supercharged 3-liter V-6 and a 47-horsepower electric motor; the transmission is an 8-speed automatic. Porsche says the Cayenne can run on electricity alone up to 35 m.p.h. and can shut off its gas engine to ''sail'' on electricity at up to 97 m.p.h. Mileage is estimated at 25 m.p.g. 
 NISSAN JUKE Wags at the press previews were already substituting an ''o'' for the vowel in the vehicle's name, though some applauded the tiny crossover's bravura oddness. The Juke has a 1.6-liter turbo 4, making 180 horsepower, and a continuously variable transmission. A manual transmission and all-wheel drive will also be available. 
 KIA OPTIMA The sister sedan to the Hyundai Sonata flaunted its welcome new style while mimicking the Sonata's 4-cylinder-only strategy with a direct-injection 2.4-liter engine. The Kia goes on sale in fall, including a 274-horse turbo version; a hybrid is due next year.
 KIA SPORTAGE Chunky and appealing, the redesigned crossover substitutes a 176-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine for the previous V-6. A turbocharged version will also join the line.
 BENTLEY SUPERSPORTS CONVERTIBLE Serving crumpets and cucumber sandwiches at its show stand, Bentley kept the House of Lords fantasy going with this superquick ultra-ritzy convertible. Bentley says the 621-horsepower car, capable of 202 m.p.h., is the world's fastest four-seat convertible. At $250,000, it is also among the most expensive.
 BMW 335IS Slotted between the standard 335i and the top-performing M3, the 335is features a 320-horsepower twin-turbo in-line 6 and a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Prices start at $50,525 for the coupe.
 BMW ALPINA B7 XDRIVE With 21-inch Alpina wheels bulging from its understated body, this ferocious all-wheel-drive version of the 7 Series sedan has a 500-horsepower version of BMW's already mighty twin-turbo V-8. 
 MINI COUNTRYMAN Don't worry, fans: Mini's crossover model is still relatively pocket-size despite having four genuine doors and four seats, along with all-wheel drive. Two 1.6-liter engines -- including a 183-horse turbo -- will be available when the Countryman reaches dealerships early next year. 
 CHEVROLET CRUZE ECO Chevy boasts that this high-efficiency version of its new compact will achieve hybrid-level economy -- 40 m.p.g. on the highway -- when it reaches showrooms late this year. The Eco's fuel-sipping talents spring from a turbocharged 1.4-liter Ecotec engine, aerodynamic add-ons and lightweight wheels with fuel-saving tires with low rolling resistance.
 ACURA TSX SPORT WAGON Ignoring the odds against any station wagon succeeding in America, Acura will try this fall to convince families to choose its traditional hauler (sold as the Honda Accord Tourer in Europe) rather than a crossover. The TSX wagon will pair a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with a 5-speed sequential automatic transmission. 
 INFINITI QX56 Floating among all the sheetmetal guppies, Infiniti's whale-size prow-nose luxury S.U.V. seemed to have missed the memo saying that the New York show was going green this year. 
 MITSUBISHI OUTLANDER SPORT This small, inexpensive crossover is 15 inches shorter than the regular Outlander. Mileage is expected to be 31 m.p.g. on the highway thanks to a 148-horsepower 2-liter engine, a wind-cheating body and an alternator that can decouple from the engine to save energy.

HEADLINE: Ska Revivalists Enjoy a Revival

BYLINE: By DAVID J. PRINCE

 BODY:
LONDON
 AS a montage of clips from his youth was projected on a screen above the stage at Brixton Academy here in February, Terry Hall, the lead singer of the late-1970s British ska band the Specials, kept his eyes cast downward. Dressed in a suit that looked half a size too large, his face even more world-weary than the one gazing coldly out of the 1981 music video for ''Ghost Town'' playing above, he awaited an outstanding contribution to music award from the weekly music magazine NME.
 Several generations of British musicians, including the Clash's Mick Jones and Lily Allen, rose to applaud as Damon Albarn of Gorillaz called Mr. Hall and his recently reunited band mates to the stage. After accepting the trophy, a bronzed middle finger that Mr. Hall dryly noted was ''gross,'' the Specials performed ''Gangsters,'' the urgent 31-year-old single that began its run on the British pop charts. 
 ''All I wanted to do was rekindle our friendships, because we spent such a long period together and an intense period, and then it disappeared,'' Mr. Hall, 51, said later of the long-estranged band's reunion, which was spurred, in part, by his suicide attempt in 2004. ''That was the issue really for me: one by one gather those friends back in. That's been better than any gig, just that they're there again.''
 From the release of their first single until their bitter breakup two years later, the Specials helped ska music dominate British pop and fashion. Their blend of black and white musical styles and black-and-white-checkered graphics were a multicultural response to punk's safety pin nihilism. But just as quickly as it spread, ska slipped off the radar, supplanted by the new wave and the synth-pop that would come to define the '80s, only to be revived yet again by American bands like No Doubt a decade later. 
 Now, a year after a successful 30th-anniversary tour in which six of the seven original Specials barnstormed across Britain for the first time since 1980, the band is coming to the United States for one of its highest-profile gigs yet, a featured spot on April 16 at the influential Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. That gig, a handful of club dates (the group plays two sold-out shows at Terminal 5 in New York on April 20 and 21), an appearance on ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' and a free Aug. 22 show at Summerstage are the Specials' first American shows since two grueling tours here in 1980 and 1981 exposed personal and musical rifts that continue to this day. For instance, Jerry Dammers, the band's founder, chief songwriter and organ wiz, has not joined the reunion, leading to controversy about the project's legitimacy.
 While the Specials helped kick off an American ska scene thanks to a six -week tour in early 1980 that included several arena dates opening for the Police, an appearance on ''Saturday Night Live'' later that year and a celebrity following that included John Belushi and Debbie Harry of Blondie, they remain relatively obscure in the United States today.
 ''We've always wanted Terry Hall and the Specials,'' said Paul Tollett, president of Goldenvoice, the promoter of Coachella, which has a reputation for presenting influential but overlooked bands to a new generation of fans. Mr. Tollett got his start in the music business in the '80s by promoting ska shows by bands like the Untouchables, the Targets and No Doubt. ''We'd heard that they weren't going to come to America for whatever reason, but I said, 'Please, even if it's just for one show, you've got to play Coachella.' '' 
 The Specials formed in 1977 just as the punk revolution was waning, their rise coinciding with the start of Margaret Thatcher's reign and a deepening recession. Based in the depressed auto manufacturing town of Coventry, the multiracial group that Mr. Dammers plucked from the city's small scene of soul and rock bands offered a fast, danceable and politically charged version of ska, the Jamaican- and R&B-influenced sound that was popular in Britain in the early '60s. (Two members, the guitarist Lynval Golding and the vocalist Neville Staple, emigrated from Jamaica.) 
 The Specials' self-titled 1979 debut album (2 Tone/Chrysalis), produced by Elvis Costello, spoke of the dead-end lives of the country's young unemployed and addressed issues like racism (''Doesn't Make It Alright'') and urban violence (''Concrete Jungle'') from a street-level point of view. The band had seven consecutive Top 10 singles on the British charts, but Mr. Golding, 58, said ''that wasn't the goal -- it was literally about being the voice of the people, and that was far more important than anything else.''
 As the '80s dawned, ska dominated the radio, music magazine covers and television shows like ''Top of the Pops.'' 2 Tone, the record label started by Mr. Dammers, released early music from other influential ska groups like Madness, the Beat (called the English Beat in America) and the Selecter, and the Specials' visual style -- a thrift-store mix of mod, skinhead and Jamaican ''rude boy'' styles (slim-cut, two-tone fabric suits, porkpie hats and Fred Perry shirts) -- became a street fashion staple. ''I always thought the look is as important as the music, because that's what draws you in,'' Mr. Hall said in an interview at a coffee shop near his home, where even in a black peacoat and a scarf he turned heads, approached by an awestruck older patron. But the band's tour of the United States in 1980 sowed the seeds of its demise. The outing, which began in January at New York's post-punk hotspot Hurrah, exhausted the band, which had already been on the road for nearly two years straight. ''America broke us,'' said Horace Panter, 56, the bassist, who pinpoints the beginning of the end to a four-night, eight-show run at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. ''We were so knackered that pharmaceuticals took over. We definitely came back to England a different group than went out.'' 
 Back home, creative differences emerged. Mr. Dammers had tired of ska and was fascinated by the Muzak he'd encountered in American elevators; he pushed the band's sound in a lower-key, more experimental direction. The recording of ''More Specials'' (2 Tone/Chrysalis), the band's second and last studio album, from 1981, was contentious, and the release failed to generate the same enthusiasm as its predecessor. But the Specials' final single, a slow-burning reggae track called ''Ghost Town,'' shot to No. 1 on the British singles chart for three weeks just as riots over unemployment shuttered cities across Britain. The group split that summer when Mr. Hall, Mr. Staple and Mr. Golding departed to form a new group, Fun Boy Three. 
 Afterward Mr. Dammers worked with members of various groups on 2 Tone, releasing an album as the Special A K A; the group's hit song ''Free Nelson Mandela'' became a global anti-apartheid anthem in 1984. Mr. Hall remained a presence in British pop music, recording eight albums and dozens of singles with a wide variety of musicians and producers. (He also wrote ''Our Lips Are Sealed'' with Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's.) But he refused to entertain the possibility of a Specials reunion and for the most part declined to discuss his time in the group. In 1996, four of the original members toured together, but without Mr. Hall, Mr. Dammers and the drummer John Bradbury, they failed to ignite much excitement.
 Mr. Hall's suicide attempt, which led to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and an intense treatment program, found him re-evaluating his position. He reached out firstto Mr. Bradbury, and then Mr. Golding, who now lives in Seattle; eventually the seven Specials rehearsed together in early 2008. But by the time the band made its first appearance, as the surprise guests at the Bestival festival later that summer, Mr. Dammers was not on the stage but instead watching in the audience. After a dispute about the use of the Specials name for the reunion shows, according to several members, Mr. Dammers issued a lengthy statement against his former band mates, which was covered in the newspaper The Guardian.
 In an e-mail message, Mr. Dammers, 54, said: ''Given the fact that the Specials is essentially a historical item, which this outfit are attempting to reproduce, and knowing the huge amount I contributed to the real Specials, I believe it is simply historically incorrect to refer to this as 'the Specials' without me. No one has the right, after this much time, to use any band's name without reaching the agreement of such a creatively central figure to what that name represents.''
 Mr. Golding said he spent five years going ''back and forth'' with Mr. Dammers. ''I feel disappointed that I didn't get him on board, but it wasn't for lack of trying,'' he said.
 Six other Specials concur that it's Mr. Hall, not Mr. Dammers, who is essential for the shows to resonate with fans. ''I would never join a band called the Specials without Terry in it, simple as that,'' said Mr. Bradbury, 54. 
 The first two reunion shows at Brixton Academy here last May seemed to be a triumph, considering all the older male fans brought to tears after the first few songs. The music, recreated with precision timing by a group of more experienced, and sober, musicians played through technologically advanced sound systems, sounds better than early concert recordings. And the socio-economic issues that Mr. Dammers wanted to address with the band in the first place are as salient as ever. 
 ''The ironic thing is that we can do it without Jerry,'' Mr. Hall said. ''It reminds me a bit of Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd or Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. You get this person who's immersed in what he does but can't really work with the rest of the band.'' 
 ''Every time I walk onstage with this band now,'' he added, ''I still don't know what I'm onstage for, apart from it feels important to us and it feel important to the people who are there. That's the only reason.''

HEADLINE: Motels Boost the Thread Count

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
PLATFORM beds with crisp white sheets and taupe coverlets; 32-inch flat-screen TVs; bright colors on the walls and mod furnishings that maximize space. No, it's not the latest boutique hotel. It's the new look of Motel 6.
 That's right. Over the last year or so, motel chains like Super 8 and Red Roof Inn have been getting a makeover. Not unlike the bedding wars initiated by Starwood Hotels & Resorts in the late '90s, motels have been upgrading their interiors, doing away with those dreadful floral bedspreads and in many cases adding amenities that rival those of more upscale properties. 
 Red Roof Inn, based in Columbus, Ohio, is adding spa-inspired walk-in showers with rain-flow shower heads and pillow-top mattress pads as part of what it's calling a Next Generation redesign. Wyndham Hotel Group's Super 8 chain, which added curved shower rods, granite countertops and hair dryers to its previously bare-bones bathrooms a couple of years ago, is taking it up a notch by replacing bedding and adding nicer vanities in the bathrooms. 
 Holiday Inn is updating everything from its lobbies to its logo (formerly written out in cursive, it has been edited down to a cleaner, modern ''H''). It even has created a piped-in signature scent that isn't a byproduct of a highly chlorinated pool. The smell: citrus and white tea, with subtle undercurrents of perilla leaf, woods and herbs. 
 The budget hotel segment was due for a design overhaul as the discrepancy between economy hotels still stuck in the floral bedspread mode and more upscale, fashion-forward newcomers like NYLO Hotels and Starwood's Aloft brand grew. And though none of the upgrades are plush by any means, the extent of the renovations and redesigns, which focus on minimalist chic, has been surprising guests and style arbiters alike. In February, for example, Motel 6, which hired the design firm Priestmangoode of London to facilitate its transformation, took Travel & Leisure magazine's 2010 design award for Best Large Hotel for its ''smart, hip, and of the moment'' Phoenix design, as the chain calls the new look. 
 Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express, owned by InterContinental Hotels Group, is investing $1 billion across more than 3,200 hotels to refresh the brands and is the farthest along in its overhaul. Roughly 2,000 hotels have been renovated since October 2007 when the company first announced the initiative, decluttering reception desks of the usual solicitations, adding powerful shower heads, curved shower rods and upgraded bedding. Motel 6, operated by Accor Worldwide, which unveiled its Phoenix design last May, has revamped more than 50 of its 1,000 North American locations. Red Roof Inn, which has 350 locations across the country and 50 hotels in the pipeline, plans to build 17 or so based on the Next Generation prototype. For now, it's available in two locations: Beaumont, Tex., and Locust Grove, Ga. 
 The economic recession has created additional pressure for the motel segment to upgrade as rates plummeted across the board and travelers were able to trade up to hotels they normally couldn't afford. ''Because rates have fallen so far, people who were on a budget suddenly can get into a full service hotel for the same amount,'' said Jan Freitag, vice president of global development at STR, which tracks the hotel industry. The resulting effect, he said: ''Everyone needing to do more'' to attract and retain guests.
 Using Starwood's Better Tomorrows promotion, which cuts the price of the second night in half, a two-night stay at the trendy Aloft Houston by the Galleria in Texas with nine-foot ceilings, walk-in showers, Bliss Spa toiletries and lobby lounge is $178 in late April compared with $215 for the Holiday Inn less than two miles away. One advantage: The Holiday Inn has a restaurant. 
 But once rates start to turn around, as they inevitably will, trading back down to the roadside motel will be an easier transition given the upgrades. And even now there are some amazing deals to be had -- the key being finding a renovated property to stay at. 
 How does $40 a night sound for the updated Motel 6 Houston Reliant Park, which a recent Web search turned up for late March? Motel 6 conveniently flags revamped hotels on its booking site as ''re-modeled'' in any given search result list. But you can also call the reservation line and simply ask if there are any renovated hotels in the vicinity of where you want to stay. While you're at it, be sure to ask about any special discounts including AAA rates if you have a membership, which often yield even more savings. 
 Red Roof Inn has been playing up its low prices with an ''It's chic to be frugal'' message that emphasizes its free morning coffee and low room rates. Click on Red Hot Deals on its home page for specials. 
 Of course, major renovations never come cheap. And it's ultimately the guest who ends up paying for the upgrades. ''The Holiday Inn relaunch is about enhancing the guest's experience in the areas that they value (great beds, great showers, etc.)'' Natasha Gullett, a spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message. ''In such a way they don't mind paying a small premium for a better experience.'' 
 Indeed, fans of the new designs say it is worth it. Philip Pursley, a project manager for an energy performance contract company in Indiana, has spent time at the Holiday Inn at the University of Memphis for a job while away from home, practically every week for the last year. In doing so he also saw the transformation of the hotel as it upgraded its bathrooms, bedding and lobby. 
 ''I just watched it go from a 5 or 6 up to a 9 or 10,'' Mr. Pursley said. Before the renovation he added, ''it was going to a motel.'' Now, he said, ''it's very pleasant to the eye. It just makes you feel comfortable.'' 
 So comfortable, Mr. Pursley has been willing to pay more than at other motels. He estimates that on some trips he has paid about $35 a night more than he would have at a competitor. He has also taken his wife, Jannie, to the hotel. She has since reminded him that soon his job will end and he will have to come home, to Glasgow, Ky., where the bed is perhaps not so cushy and the staff not so accommodating. ''She said, 'Your good life is getting ready to be over with,' '' Mr. Pursley said. '' 'You've got to come back home.' ''

HEADLINE: Thinking Smaller, but Not Lower

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
CEILINGS that soar to 9, 10 or even 15 feet, a hallmark of the construction boom in the last decade, have managed to survive the recession even as home builders and buyers are moving toward smaller living spaces.
 The reasons are simple, several developers and architects in New Jersey said: It costs less to build up than to build out. And the aesthetic impact of a little extra headroom -- a touch of grandeur, larger windows and more light -- continues to attract buyers. 
 ''People are more cost-conscious these days,'' said Paul Schneier, the president of the New York/New Jersey division of Pulte Homes. ''But they still prefer to have the additional space overhead, even if it costs somewhat more to purchase, and to heat and cool.'' 
 The heating and cooling costs have been somewhat mitigated, however, by new technologies and building materials, architects and builders say.
 Mr. Schneier said all three of Pulte's residential projects under construction in New Jersey -- a single-family house development in East Windsor, town house condominiums in Highland Park and a three-story condo in Garfield -- had been redesigned in midconstruction to introduce smaller units into the mix.
 But the company's ''nine-foot rule'' remains firmly in place, Mr. Schneier said. Pulte and its subsidiaries Centex and Del Webb provide ceilings at least that height on the first floor of every single-family house and in all condo apartments, he said. 
 Sterling Properties, meanwhile, is building condominiums in South Orange in which ceilings start at 9 feet, and reach 15 feet for top-floor lofts, said Rosanne Brooks, the company's marketing director.
 ''We do not see people walking away from that desire for a dramatic look,'' Ms. Brooks said. ''If they are downsizing after having lived in a larger single-family home, or if they are first-time buyers who may have had to adjust their expectations in some way due to the economy, they still want the feel of a light and airy space.'' 
 With buyers' purchasing power and demand for new housing both down sharply -- there were just 7,000 new homes sold in New Jersey in 2009 compared with 13,000 the previous year -- builders are looking for ways to add amenities without increasing costs. 
 ''Certainly, everyone -- buyers, builders, everyone -- has had to reposition themselves given all that has happened, economically speaking,'' said Bill Feinberg, an architect and planner in Voorhees.
 Mr. Feinberg said that during the building boom as houses swelled to ''McMansion'' size, 9-foot ceilings became the standard, and ''10-foot ceilings often came into play'' in designs for more luxurious developments. Through the recession and the housing crisis, most developers have held the line at 9 feet, he said. Eight-feet ceilings had been the industry standard for many decades, he noted.
 ''Higher ceilings have maybe even more value today, though,'' Mr. Feinberg said. ''Even if a room is smaller, it feels more generous if the ceiling is elevated. You don't have to tell that to somebody who isn't an architect. It is obvious.'' 
 He said his firm, Feinberg & Associates, was working on revisions to plans for an age-restricted development in Barnegat Township in which the builders decided to add 15-foot ceilings in the ''great rooms'' of the single-family houses in the planned complex. Earlier plans had called for 9-foot ceilings.
 The extra heating and cooling costs to residents would not be significant, Mr. Feinberg said. ''With the high-efficiency heaters, thermal-pane windows and air-circulation systems you have today, it just doesn't cost that much to keep the temperature at an appropriate level in high-ceilinged spaces,'' he said.
 Johnny Cruz, an architect with Robert A. M. Stern in Manhattan who recently bought a condo at Canco Lofts in Jersey Citywith his wife, Lizza, said his heating bill had fallen by about half although the couple more than doubled their living space -- and also went to 14-foot-high ceilings from 11-foot ones.
 ''We had a 500-square-foot place in downtown New York City, with a sleeping loft,'' of prewar vintage, Mr. Cruz said. ''Those old single-pane windows are really leaky.''
 At Canco, a development of converted industrial buildings in the former American Can Company complex, the windows are double-paned and have a reflective coating, Mr. Cruz said. 
 After looking at properties for a year, the couple moved into their 1,233-square-foot one-bedroom in January, paying $440,000. 
 ''The ceilings and the really tall windows did it for me,'' he said. ''This place is just really, really charming, and other places with more normal dimensions felt flat and dull by comparison.''

HEADLINE: Lenders Loosen Reins On Jumbos

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
IT may be too early to announce a thaw of the mortgage market, but some early signs have emerged, at least in one important category: jumbo loans.
 Mortgage industry executives say conditions are improving for those borrowing more than $729,750, the threshold for jumbo mortgages in the tristate region. Not only is it starting to get easier to qualify for these loans, they say, but rates are also coming down.
 Real estate brokers are hopeful. ''I'm cautiously optimistic,'' said Dottie Herman, the chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman. While Ms. Herman has not yet seen the effects of an improved jumbo-lending environment on overall property sales, ''as credit loosens up, it will help that higher-end market move up,'' she said. 
 Frederick Wohlfarth, the president of Wohlfarth & Associates, a real estate broker in Manhattan, said he has already seen a 40 percent rise in sales requiring jumbo loans over last year.
 At the same time, Prudential's mortgage affiliate, DE Capital Mortgage, has had a spike in activity in jumbo loans over the last few months, according to Jan William Scheck, a branch manager. ''So we'll only start to see these transactions close in the next couple of weeks,'' he said.
 David Adamo, the chief executive of the Luxury Mortgage Corporation, a broker and banker in Stamford, Conn., said his company was offering jumbo loans on behalf of more lenders now than late last year. ''It's an indicator that the high end of the market is beginning to recover,'' he said.
 On jumbo loans Luxury Mortgage makes directly, he said, the most highly qualified borrowers can secure a 4.5 percent adjustable-rate mortgage, which is about half of a percentage point lower than the prevailing rate late last year. (The average rate for a 30-year fixed jumbo loan is 5.125 percent.)
 These borrowers can also obtain that loan with a 20 percent down payment -- or refinance as long as they maintain 20 percent equity in the home -- compared with a 30 percent down payment needed at the end of 2009.
 One element of the mortgage equation has not changed as sharply: borrowers must still have excellent credit to qualify for the loans. And that means credit scores of at least 700, along with enough cash in the bank to cover at least six months of payments, according to Mr. Adamo. On bigger loans of $1.5 million or more, borrowers will need a credit score of at least 740 to secure the best rates, industry experts say.
 Alan Rosenbaum, the chief executive of the Guardhill Financial Corporation, a Manhattan mortgage broker, said, ''Lenders are still focused on credit scores, but they're actually analyzing the full picture now rather than just relying on computer-generated credit scores.''
 Mr. Rosenbaum said he had also seen a relaxation in lending standards compared with a year ago. ''And we have witnessed more lenders appearing recently, as they should,'' he said. ''A jumbo loan is one of the safest loans if standard underwriting guidelines are adhered to.''
 This bit of good news for high-end borrowers is in lockstep with the improving risk profile for borrowers in general, said Dennis R. Capozza, a principal of University Financial Associates in Ann Arbor, Mich.
 Dr. Capozza, who is also a finance professor at the University of Michigan, compiles an index that gauges the default risk for borrowers in every ZIP code in the nation. The latest index, which Dr. Capozza released in March, reached 158, less than half its peak of 330 in early 2007. 
 So a typical loan taken out today is less than half as likely to end up in default as one taken out in early 2007. Dr. Capozza said that shift should translate to improving loan terms.
 In the greater New York area, loans made in Connecticut pose the lowest risk, Dr. Capozza said, scoring a 146 on the index, compared with 225 in New Jersey and 206 in New York State.
 New York City, meanwhile, scored 410, which is down from a peak of 540 in 2007. In an era where some regions scored higher than 1,000, Dr. Capozza said New York City's current figure was not alarming. But with its ''overpriced real estate, falling house prices, high unemployment'' and other factors, he said, ''it is not a good time to be a mortgage lender in New York City.''
 Dr. Capozza said jumbo borrowers could be the first to recognize improvements in the overall mortgage market, partly because they have not had the benefits of a government-subsidized mortgage market, which include historically low rates. 
 Mr. Adamo of Luxury Mortgage said the city's economic picture did not necessarily suggest more lending risk. But because of Manhattan's high concentration of co-ops and condominiums, borrowers are more likely to face higher interest rates. Buyers in co-ops or condominiums less than 70 percent sold, he said, will often face rates three-quarters of a percentage point higher than those seeking loans in more fully occupied buildings.
 Some lenders, too, may not offer a loan on a condo or co-op apartment unless the development sets aside 10 percent of its annual reserves for building improvements, added Mr. Scheck of DE Capital Mortgage, a practice he called uncommon in New York.
 ''In some situations,'' Mr. Scheck said, ''it's about having conversations with the board to try to meet those guidelines.''

HEADLINE: Coming To Terms With My Sabbatical

BYLINE: By MICHELE MENDELSSOHN. 
Michele Mendelssohn is writing a book on Oscar Wilde's visit to the United States. E-mail: preoccupations@ nytimes.com

 BODY:
''I NEED a sabbatical from my sabbatical,'' I recently confided to a friend. I wasn't joking. For some time, I had been feeling exhausted from being on work-leave. And this got me to thinking: if the word ''sabbatical'' derives from ''Sabbath,'' meaning ''rest,'' why was I so restless and worn out?
 These days, sabbaticals are often considered the pampered preserve of the independently wealthy, or a restful period for academic idlers. In this economic climate, few people are inclined to feel much empathy for either camp. 
 Now on sabbatical at the University of Utah, I fall squarely into the ''academic'' camp -- though I'm clearly not in ''idle'' mode. 
 In 2009, when I took a permanent lectureship in English literature at Oxford University in England, I had been in the work force for six years without interruption. I had, until then, been on an accelerated course, moving swiftly from a three-year Ph.D. to a full-time teaching job at Boston University, followed by a permanent lectureship at Edinburgh University in Scotland. I had also published my first book, as well as quite a few articles and papers. 
 But somewhere along the way, I began to feel the wear and tear. The shine had begun to rub off of teaching. I had less and less time to pursue my research, but the pressure to publish persisted. 
 When I marked my students' essays, I found my mind wandering back longingly to the halcyon days when I could spend an afternoon pondering, say, the meaning of sight in Henry James. Instead, I sat in departmental meetings which often stretched into the early evening and tried to content myself with scratching out a few half-baked research ideas in the agenda's margins. 
 When I found out that I had won a sabbatical research fellowship, I was elated. I would enjoy the first sabbatical of my career. In academic circles, where research time is such a precious commodity, I felt that I had been blessed with a golden ticket.
 With a view to making the most of this windfall, I formulated a lofty plan. During my sabbatical, I would research and write my second academic book, move from Britain to Utah, spend more time with my family in Canada, write a novel, learn Spanish, read for pleasure, rediscover skiing and swimming, go cycling in South America and generally have a good time. To filch a phrase from Thoreau, the plan was to live deep and suck the marrow out of this sabbatical.
 Eight months into it, I am still profoundly grateful but far more pragmatic. My original plan now looks like a delusional fantasy. Though I have done many things on my list, I have not done most of them. 
 Why had I expected that my sabbatical year would be so drastically different from all the other years of my working life? We rather conveniently forget that paid sabbaticals come with serious (and legitimate) expectations on the part of employers. In that respect, my remit is to produce a book, and I doubt that my improved skiing technique will matter much to anyone but me. 
 Researching and writing an academic book full time comes with its own perils. One is great intellectual freedom; the other is the freedom to overwork. For me, the sabbatical most closely resembles an erratic sequence of Monday mornings and Friday afternoons: intense labor laced with moments when you persuade yourself that updating your Netflix queue really is a good use of your time. Even on sabbatical, I find myself putting in 50-hour workweeks. 
 I've come to recognize that a sabbatical is not a panacea. It will not make life's challenges disappear. In fact, a sabbatical comes with its own set of challenges, as I rapidly discovered. 
 First came the drastic change in geography that transplanted me to scenic Salt Lake City. Then, the cultural adjustment: for the first months, I felt like ''a gentile in the New Jerusalem,'' as Wallace Stegner put it, referring to the dominance of Mormon culture. Then, another big shift: no family or friends nearby, no students, no teaching, no meetings in which to daydream. Almost everything was new, from my friends and colleagues, to the walk to work through a cemetery dotted with 19th-century polygamists' tombstones. 
 THE one thing that has not changed during my sabbatical is work. For one thing, there still seems to be tons of it, and I often feel overwhelmed by the breadth of my research. For another, the drive that marked the early years of my career has shown no signs of abating. 
 Perhaps the greatest piece of wisdom to come from this experience has been that so much of work life amounts to managing expectations -- others', as well as our own. Most of all, I need to manage my expectations of myself. So when I found myself accomplishing fewer and fewer of the things on my sabbatical wish list, I had to acknowledge that there was only one person to blame. And, as it turns out, to praise. I have had a great time. Apart from the book, I really think that that is the most important thing on the list.

HEADLINE: THE LOVE THAT DARE NOT SQUAWK ITS NAME

BYLINE: By JON MOOALLEM. 
Jon Mooallem, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about synthetic biology.

 BODY:
The Laysan albatross is a downy seabird with a seven-foot wingspan and a notched, pale yellow beak. Every November, a small colony of albatrosses assembles at a place called Kaena Point, overlooking the Pacific at the foot of a volcanic range, on the northwestern tip of Oahu, Hawaii. Each bird has spent the past six months in solitude, ranging over open water as far north as Alaska, and has come back to the breeding ground to reunite with its mate. Albatrosses can live to be 60 or 70 years old and typically mate with the same bird every year, for life. Their ''divorce rate,'' as biologists term it, is among the lowest of any bird.
 When I visited Kaena Point in November, the first birds were just returning, and they spent a lot of their time gliding and jackknifing in the wind a few feet overhead or plopped like cushions in the sand. There are about 120 breeding albatrosses in the colony, and gradually, each will arrive and feel out the crowd for the one other particular albatross it has been waiting to have sex with again. At any given moment in the days before Thanksgiving, some birds may be just turning up while others sit there killing time. It feels like an airport baggage-claim area. 
 Once together, pairs will copulate and collaboratively incubate a single egg for 65 days. They take shifts: one bird has to sit at the nest while the other flaps off to fish and eat for weeks at a time. Couples preen each other's feathers and engage in elaborate mating behaviors and displays. ''Like when you're in a couple,'' Marlene Zuk, a biologist who has visited the colony, explained to me. ''All those sickening things that couples do that gross out everyone else but the two people in the couple? . . . Birds have the same thing.'' I often saw pairs sitting belly to belly, arching their necks and nuzzling together their heads to form a kind of heart shape. Speaking on Oahu a few years ago as first lady, Laura Bush praised Laysan albatross couples for making lifelong commitments to one another. Lindsay C. Young, a biologist who studies the Kaena Point colony, told me: ''They were supposed to be icons of monogamy: one male and one female. But I wouldn't assume that what you're looking at is a male and a female.''
 Young has been researching the albatrosses on Oahu since 2003; the colony was the focus of her doctoral dissertation at the University of Hawaii, Manoa, which she completed last spring. (She now works on conservation projects as a biologist for hire.) In the course of her doctoral work, Young and a colleague discovered, almost incidentally, that a third of the pairs at Kaena Point actually consisted of two female birds, not one male and one female. Laysan albatrosses are one of countless species in which the two sexes look basically identical. It turned out that many of the female-female pairs, at Kaena Point and at a colony that Young's colleague studied on Kauai, had been together for 4, 8 or even 19 years -- as far back as the biologists' data went, in some cases. The female-female pairs had been incubating eggs together, rearing chicks and just generally passing under everybody's nose for what you might call ''straight'' couples.
 Young would never use the phrase ''straight couples.'' And she is adamantly against calling the other birds ''lesbians'' too. For one thing, the same-sex pairs appear to do everything male-female pairs do except have sex, and Young isn't really sure, or comfortable judging, whether that technically qualifies them as lesbians or not. But moreover, the whole question is meaningless to her; it has nothing to do with her research. '' 'Lesbian,' '' she told me, ''is a human term,'' and Young -- a diligent and cautious scientist, just beginning to make a name in her field -- is devoted to using the most aseptic language possible and resisting any tinge of anthropomorphism. ''The study is about albatross,'' she told me firmly. ''The study is not about humans.'' Often, she seemed to be mentally peer-reviewing her words before speaking.
 A discovery like Young's can disorient a wildlife biologist in the most thrilling way -- if he or she takes it seriously, which has traditionally not been the case. Various forms of same-sex sexual activity have been recorded in more than 450 different species of animals by now, from flamingos to bison to beetles to guppies to warthogs. A female koala might force another female against a tree and mount her, while throwing back her head and releasing what one scientist described as ''exhalated belchlike sounds.'' Male Amazon River dolphins have been known to penetrate each other in the blowhole. Within most species, homosexual sex has been documented only sporadically, and there appear to be few cases of individual animals who engage in it exclusively. For more than a century, this kind of observation was usually tacked onto scientific papers as a curiosity, if it was reported at all, and not pursued as a legitimate research subject. Biologists tried to explain away what they'd seen, or dismissed it as theoretically meaningless -- an isolated glitch in an otherwise elegant Darwinian universe where every facet of an animal's behavior is geared toward reproducing. One primatologist speculated that the real reason two male orangutans were fellating each other was nutritional.
 In recent years though, more biologists have been looking objectively at same-sex sexuality in animals -- approaching it as real science. For Young, the existence of so many female-female albatross pairs disproved assumptions that she didn't even realize she'd been making and, in the process, raised a chain of progressively more complicated questions. One of the prickliest, it seemed, was how a scientist is even supposed to talk about any of this, given how eager the rest of us have been to twist the sex lives of animals into allegories of our own. ''This colony is literally the largest proportion of -- I don't know what the correct term is: 'homosexual animals'? -- in the world,'' Young told me. ''Which I'm sure some people think is a great thing, and others might think is not.''
 It was a guarded understatement. Two years ago, Young decided to write a short paper with two colleagues on the female-female albatross pairs. ''We were pretty careful in the original article to plainly and simply report what we found,'' she said. ''It's definitely a little bit of a tricky subject, and one you want to be gentle on.'' But the journal that published the paper, Biology Letters, sent out a press release a few days after the California Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. At 6 the next morning, a Fox News reporter called Young on her cellphone. The resulting story joined others, including one in this paper, and as the news ricocheted around the Internet, a stampede of online commenters alternately celebrated Young's findings as a clear call for equality or denigrated them as ''pure propaganda and selective science at its dumbest'' and ''an effort to humanize animals or devolve humans to the level of animals or to further an agenda.'' Many pointed out that animals also rape or eat their young; was America going to tolerate that too, just because it's ''natural''?
 A Denver-based publication for gay parents welcomed any and all new readers from ''the extensive lesbian albatross parent community.'' The conservative Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn highlighted Young's paper on his Web site, under the heading ''Your Tax Dollars at Work,'' even though her study of the female-female pairs was not actually federally financed. Stephen Colbert warned on Comedy Central that ''albatresbians'' were threatening American family values with their ''Sappho-avian agenda.'' A gay rights advocate e-mailed Young, asking her to fly a rainbow flag above each female-female nest, to identify them and show solidarity. Even now, the first thing everyone wants to know from Young -- sometimes the only thing -- is, what do these lesbian albatrosses say about us?
 ''I don't answer that question,'' she told me.
 A FEMALE LAYSAN albatross is physically capable of laying only one egg per year -- that's just how it's built. Nevertheless, since as early as 1919, biologists have periodically found nests of albatrosses (and similar species of birds) with two eggs inside them, or with a second egg just outside, as if it had rolled out. (This will inevitably happen; there's simply not enough room in the nest for two eggs and one Laysan albatross.) Scientists have a term for the phenomenon of extra eggs in a nest: a ''supernormal clutch.'' But in the case of the albatross, they never had a watertight explanation.
 In the early 1960s, one ornithologist tried to put the whole cumbersome mystery to rest by asserting that some of those female birds must simply be able to lay multiple eggs. The claim was apparently based on sketchy data, but supernormal clutches were so rare that it was hard to rack up enough observations to disprove the hypothesis. Real progress was finally made in 1968, when Harvey Fisher, a dean of midcentury albatross science, reported on seven years of daily observations made at 3,440 different nests on the Midway atoll in the middle of the Pacific. Fisher concluded that ''two eggs in a nest are an indication that two females used the nest, although at different times.'' He was describing ''egg dumping,'' whereby, for example, an inexperienced female accidentally lays her egg in the wrong nest. From then on, egg dumping was a default explanation for supernormal clutches in albatrosses. After all, Fisher had also declared that ''promiscuity, polygamy and polyandry are unknown in this species.'' Lesbianism apparently never occurred to anyone -- even enough to be cursorily dismissed. As Brenda Zaun recently told me, ''It never dawned on anyone to sex the birds.''
 Zaun, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, was studying a Laysan colony on Kauai 40 years after Fisher's publication. She realized that certain nests there seemed to wind up with two eggs in them year after year; the distribution of the supernormal clutches wasn't random, as it would presumably be if it were caused exclusively by egg dumping. On a hunch, Zaun pulled feathers from a sample of the breeding pairs associated with two-egg nests and sent them to Lindsay Young, asking her to draw DNA from the feathers and genetically determine the sexes of those birds in her lab. When the results showed that every bird was female, Young figured she'd messed up. So she did it again -- and got the same result. Then she genetically sexed every bird at Kaena Point. ''Where it wasn't totally clear, or I worried that maybe I mixed up the sample, I actually went back into the field and took new blood samples to do it again,'' Young told me. In the end, she genetically sexed the birds in her lab four times, just to be sure. She found that 39 of the 125 nests at Kaena Point since 2004 belonged to female-female pairs, including more than 20 nests in which she'd never noticed a supernormal clutch. It seemed that certain females were somehow finding opportunities to quickly copulate with males but incubating their eggs -- and doing everything else an albatross does while at the colony -- with other females.
 Young gave a talk about these findings at an international meeting of Pacific-seabird researchers. ''There was a lot of murmuring in the room,'' she remembers. ''Then, afterward, people were coming up to me and saying: 'We see supernormal clutches all the time. We assumed it was a male and a female.' And I'd say: 'Yeah? Well, you might want to look into that.' '' Recently, journals have asked her to confidentially peer-review new papers about other species, describing similar discoveries. ''I can't say which species,'' she explains, ''but my guess is, in the next year, we're going to see a lot more examples of this.''
 It may seem surprising that scientists sometimes don't know the true sexes of the animals they spend their careers studying -- that they can be tripped up in some ''Tootsie'' -like farce for so long. But it's easy to underestimate the pandemonium that they're struggling to interpret in the wild. Often, biologists are forced to assign sexes to animals by watching what they do when they mate. When one albatross or boar or cricket rears up and mounts a second, it would seem to be advertising the genders of both. Unless, of course, that's not the situation at all.
 ''There is still an overall presumption of heterosexuality,'' the biologist Bruce Bagemihl told me. ''Individuals, populations or species are considered to be entirely heterosexual until proven otherwise.'' While this may sound like a reasonable starting point, Bagemihl calls it a ''heterosexist bias'' and has shown it to be a significant roadblock to understanding the diversity of what animals actually do. In 1999, Baghemihl published ''Biological Exuberance,'' a book that pulled together a colossal amount of previous piecemeal research and showed how biologists' biases had marginalized animal homosexuality for the last 150 years -- sometimes innocently enough, sometimes in an eruption of anthropomorphic disgust. Courtship behaviors between two animals of the same sex were persistently described in the literature as ''mock'' or ''pseudo'' courtship -- or just ''practice.'' Homosexual sex between ostriches was interpreted by one scientist as ''a nuisance'' that ''goes on and on.'' One man, studying Mazarine Blue butterflies in Morocco in 1987, regretted having to report ''the lurid details of declining moral standards and of horrific sexual offenses'' which are ''all too often packed'' into national newspapers. And a bighorn-sheep biologist confessed in his memoir, ''I still cringe at the memory of seeing old D-ram mount S-ram repeatedly.'' To think, he wrote, ''of those magnificent beasts as 'queers' -- Oh, God!''
 ''What Bagemihl's book really did,'' the Canadian primatologist and evolutionary psychologist Paul Vasey says, ''is raise people's awareness around the fact that this occurs in quote-unquote nature -- in animals. And that it can be studied in a serious, scholarly way.'' But studying it seriously means resolving a conundrum. At the heart of evolutionary biology, since Darwin, has been the idea that any genetic traits and behaviors that outfit an animal with an advantage -- that help the animal make lots of offspring -- will remain in a species, while ones that don't will vanish. In short, evolution gradually optimizes every animal toward a single goal: passing on its genes. The Yale ornithologist Richard Prum told me: ''Our field is a lot like economics: we have a core of theory, like free-market theory, where we have the invisible hand of the market creating order -- all commodities attain exactly the price they're worth. Homosexuality is a tough case, because it appears to violate that central tenet, that all of sexual behavior is about reproduction. The question is, why would anyone invest in sexual behavior that isn't reproductive?'' -- much less a behavior that looks to be starkly counterproductive. Moreover, if animals carrying the genes associated with it are less likely to reproduce, how has that behavior managed to stick around?
 Given this big umbrella of theory, the very existence of homosexual behavior in animals can feel a little like impenetrable nonsense, something a researcher could spend years banging his or her head against the wall deliberating. The difficulty of that challenge, more than any implicit or explicit homophobia, may be why past biologists skirted the subject.
 IN THE LAST DECADE, however, Paul Vasey and others have begun developing new hypotheses based on actual, prolonged observation of different animals, deciphering the ways given homosexual behaviors may have evolved and the evolutionary role they might play within the context of individual species. Different ideas are emerging about how these behaviors could fit within that traditional Darwinian framework, including seeing them as conferring reproductive advantages in roundabout ways. Male dung flies, for example, appear to mount other males to tire them out, knocking them out of competition for available females. Researchers speculate that young male bottlenose dolphins mount one another simply to establish trust and form bonds -- but those bonds actually turn out to be critical to reproduction, since when males mature, they work in groups to cooperatively gain access to females.
 These ideas generally aim to explain only particular behaviors in a particular species. So far, the only real conclusion this relatively small body of literature seems to point to, collectively, is a kind of deflating, meta-conclusion: a single explanation of homosexual behavior in animals may not be possible, because thinking of ''homosexual behavior in animals'' as a single scientific subject might not make much sense. ''Biologists want to build these unified theories to explain everything they see,'' Vasey told me. So do journalists, he added -- all people, really. ''But none of this lends itself to a linear story. My take on it is that homosexual behavior is not a uniform phenomenon. Having one unifying body of theory that explains why it's happening in all these different species might be a chimera.''
 The point of heterosexual sex, Vasey said, no matter what kind of animal is doing it, is primarily reproduction. But that shouldn't trick us into thinking that homosexual behavior has some equivalent, organizing purpose -- that the two are tidy opposites. ''All this homosexual behavior isn't tied together by that sort of primary function,'' Vasey said. Even what the same-sex animals are doing varies tremendously from species to species. But we're quick to conceive of that great range of activities in the way it most handily tracks to our anthropomorphic point of view: put crassly, all those different animals just seem to be doing gay sex stuff with one another. As the biologist Marlene Zuk explains, we are hard-wired to read all animal behavior as ''some version of the way people do things'' and animals as ''blurred, imperfect copies of humans.''
 When I visited Zuk at her lab at the University of California at Riverside last December, an online video clip of an octopus carrying a coconut shell around the seafloor, and periodically hiding under it, was starting to go viral. For a few days, people everywhere were flipping out about how intelligent and wily this octopus was. Not Zuk, though. ''Oh, spare me,'' she said. To us, Zuk explained, that octopus's behavior reads as proof that ''octopuses are at one with humans'' because it just happens to look like something we do -- how a toddler plays peekaboo under a blanket, say, or a bandit ducks into an alleyway dumpster to avoid the cops. But the octopus doesn't know that. Nor is it doing something so uncommon in the animal world. Zuk explained that caddis-fly larvae collect rocks and loom them together into intricate shelters. ''But for some reason we don't think that's cool,'' she said, ''because the caddis-fly larvae don't have big eyes like us.''
 Something similar may be happening with what we perceive to be homosexual sex in an array of animal species: we may be grouping together a big grab bag of behaviors based on only a superficial similarity. Within the logic of each species, or group of species, many of these behaviors appear to have their own causes and consequences -- their own evolutionary meanings, so to speak. The Stanford biologist Joan Roughgarden told me to think of all these animals as ''multitasking'' with their private parts.
 It's also possible that some homosexual behaviors don't provide a conventional evolutionary advantage; but neither do they upend everything we know about biology. For the last 15 years, for example, Paul Vasey has been studying Japanese macaques, a species of two-and-a-half-foot-tall, pink-faced monkey. He has looked almost exclusively at why female macaques mount one another during the mating season. Vasey now says he is on to the answer: ''It isn't functional,'' he told me; the behavior has no discernible purpose, adaptationally speaking. Instead, it's a byproduct of a behavior that does, and the supposedly streamlining force of evolution just never flushed that byproduct from the gene pool. Female macaques regularly mount males too, Vasey explained, probably to focus their attention and reinforce their bond as mates. The females are physically capable of mounting any gender of macaque. They've just never developed an instinct to limit themselves to one. ''Evolution doesn't create perfect adaptations,'' Vasey said. As Zuk put it, ''There's a lot of slop in the system -- which,'' she was sure to add, ''is not the same as saying homosexuality is a mistake.''
 ABOUT TWO DOZEN birds were knocking around when Lindsay Young and I arrived at Kaena Point one afternoon. Young dished about a few of them -- ''Her mate didn't show up last year''; ''God, this one's annoying'' -- as they waddled by. Laysan albatrosses are not nearly as graceful on land as they are in the air; even they seem surprised by the size of their feet. (Later that week, at a nearby resort, I would recognize their gait while watching an out-of-shape snorkeler toddle back to his beach towel in rented flippers.) ''I'm just writing down who's here,'' Young said, reading the numbers on the birds' leg bands and marking them on her clipboard. After trying and failing to get a clear view of one bird's leg with binoculars, she finally just walked to within a few feet of the animal and leaned over to look.
 This is the luxury of studying Laysan albatrosses. Having evolved with no natural predators, the birds have no fight-or-flight instinct -- you can basically go right up to one and grab it. In fact, Young did just this a short while later, slinking up to a male on all fours, sweeping it in by its flank and, in one expert motion, straightjacketing the wings under one arm and clamping the beak shut in her other hand. Then, she walked over and handed the thing to me; she needed to take an expensive tracking device off the bird's ankle. ''Sorry, but it's like watching a thousand-dollar bill fly around,'' she said. She took some pliers from her backpack to twist off the anklet and, as I stood bear-hugging the albatross, she added: ''They have a nice smell. It's a little musty.''
 Young and Marlene Zuk are now applying for a 10-year National Science Foundation grant to continue studying the female albatross pairs. One of the first questions they want to answer is how these birds are winding up with fertilized eggs. Typically, albatrosses fend off birds who aren't their mates. So Young has been trying to determine if males who arrive back at the colony before their own partners do are forcing themselves on these females or whether these females are somehow ''soliciting'' the males for sex. She was staking out Kaena Point on a daily basis, trying to watch these illicit copulations unfold for herself. This was Young's third year; so far, she'd only managed to see it happen twice.
 Young and I ambled around for half an hour, maybe more. Then she pointed and, in a monotone, said, ''So, that's a female-female pair.'' We crouched and watched the two birds, numbers 169 and 983. They sat under a spindly, native Hawaiian naio bush. They made baa sounds at each other. After a while, Young and I got up.
 Another hour passed. (Usually, Young brings along a camping chair.) Occasionally, albatrosses danced in groups of two or three, raising their necks, groaning like vibrating cellphones, clacking their beaks or stomping. But most of the time, they didn't do much at all. ''I've spent a lot of my career watching animals not have sex,'' Zuk later told me.
 Homosexual activity is often observed in animal populations with a shortage of one sex -- in the wild but more frequently at zoos. Some biologists anthropomorphically call this ''the prisoner effect.'' That's basically the situation at Kaena Point: there are fewer male albatrosses than females (although not every male albatross has a mate). Because it takes two albatrosses to incubate an egg, switching on and off at the nest, a female that can't find a male (or maybe, Young says, who can't find ''a good-enough male'') has no chance of producing a chick and passing on her genes. Quickly mating with an otherwise-committed male, then pairing with another single female to incubate the egg, is a way to raise those odds.
 Still, pairing off with another female creates its own problems: nearly every female lays an egg in November whether she has managed to get it fertilized or not, and the small, craterlike nests that albatross pairs build in the dirt can accommodate only one egg and one bird. So Young was also trying to figure out how a female-female pair decides which of its two eggs to incubate and which to chuck out of the nest -- if the birds are deciding at all, and not just knocking one egg out accidentally. From a strict Darwinian perspective, Young told me, ''it doesn't pay for one bird to incubate the other's egg unless her partner is going to let her egg be incubated the following year.'' But presumably, neither female bird knows whether an egg is hers or the other bird's, much less whether it's fertilized or not. A Laysan albatross just knows to sit on whatever's under it. ''They'll incubate anything -- I have a photo of one incubating a volleyball,'' Young said.
 And these were only preambles to more questions. With the male of an albatross pair replaced by another female, every step of the species' normal, well-honed process for fledging a chick seemed suddenly to present a fresh dilemma. Ultimately, either the rules of albatrossdom were breaking down and the lesbian couples were booting up some alternate suite of behaviors, governed by its own set of rules, or else science had never thoroughly understood the rules of albatrossdom to begin with. And that's the whole point, for Young: it's the complexity and apparent flexibility of the species that fascinates her -- the puzzle those female-female pairs create at Kaena Point just by existing. She's not trying to explain homosexual behavior. She's trying to explain the albatross. And that's why the rest of the world's politicized reaction to her work caught her by surprise.
 Many people who contacted Young after the publication of her first albatross paper assumed she was a lesbian. She is not. Young's husband, a biological consultant, was actually an author of the paper, along with Brenda Zaun (who is also not gay, for what it's worth). Young found the assumption offensive -- not because she was being mistaken for gay, but because she was being mistaken for a bad scientist; these people seemed to presume that her research was compromised by a personal agenda. Still, some of the biologists doing the most incisive work on animal homosexuality are in fact gay. Several people I spoke to told me their own sexual identities either helped spur or maintain their interest in the topic; Bruce Bagemihl argued that gay and lesbian people are ''often better equipped to detect heterosexist bias when investigating the subject simply because we encounter it so frequently in our everyday lives.'' With a laugh, Paul Vasey told me, ''People automatically assume I'm gay.'' He is gay, he added, but that fact didn't seem to detract from his amusement.
 IN RETROSPECT, the big, sloshing stew of anthropomorphic analyses that Young's paper provoked in the culture couldn't have been less surprising. For whatever reason, we're prone to seeing animals -- especially animals that appear to be gay -- as reflections, models and foils of ourselves; we're extraordinarily, and sometimes irrationally, invested in them.
 Only a few months before I visited Kaena Point, two penguins at the San Francisco Zoo became the latest in a tradition of captive same-sex penguin couples making global headlines. After six years together -- in which the two birds even fostered a son, named Chuck Norris -- the penguins split up when one of the males ran off with a female named Linda. The zoo's penguin keeper, Anthony Brown, told me he received angry e-mail, accusing him of separating the pair for political reasons. ''Penguins make their own decisions here at the San Francisco Zoo,'' Brown assured me. And while he stressed that there is no scientific way of determining if animals are ''gay,'' because the word connotes a sexual orientation, not just a behavior, he also noted that, being the San Francisco Zoo, ''there's definitely a lot of opinion here, internally, that we give in and call the penguins gay.'' Another male-male penguin couple who fostered a chick at the Central Park Zoo was subsequently immortalized in 2005 in the illustrated children's book ''And Tango Makes Three.'' According to the American Library Association, there have been more requests for libraries to ban ''And Tango Makes Three'' every year than any other book in the country, three years running.
 What animals do -- what's perceived to be ''natural'' -- seems to carry a strange moral potency: it's out there, irrefutably, as either a validation or a denunciation of our own behavior, depending on how you happen to feel about homosexuality and about nature. During the Victorian era, observations of same-sex behavior in swans and insects were held up as evidence against the morality of homosexuality in humans, since at the dawn of industrialism and Darwinism, people were invested in seeing themselves as more civilized than the ''lower animals.'' Robert Mugabe and the Nazis have employed the same reasoning, as did the 1970s anti-gay crusader Anita Bryant, who, Bruce Bagemihl notes, claimed in an interview that ''even barnyard animals don't do what homosexuals do'' and was unmoved when the interviewer pointed out what actually happens in barnyards. On the other hand, an Australian drag queen known as Dr. Gertrude Glossip has used Bagemihl's book to create a celebratory, interpretive gay animal tour of the Adelaide zoo, marketed to gay and lesbian tourists. The book has also been cited in a 2003 Supreme Court case that overturned a Texas state ban on sodomy and, similarly, in a legislative debate on the floor of the British Parliament.
 James Essex, director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, told me he has never incorporated facts about animal behavior into a legal argument about the rights of human beings. It's totally beside the point, he said; people should not be discriminated against regardless of what animals do. (In her book, ''Sexual Selections,'' Marlene Zuk writes, ''People need to be able to make decisions about their lives without worrying about keeping up with the bonobos.'') That being said, Essex told me, polls show that Americans are more likely to discriminate against gays and lesbians if they think homosexuality is ''a choice.'' ''It shouldn't be the basis of a moral judgment,'' he said. But sometimes it is, and gay animals are compelling evidence that being gay isn't a choice at all. In fact, Essex remembers reading a brief mention of animal homosexual behavior during an anthropology class in college in the mid-'80s. ''And as a closeted guy, it made a difference to me,'' he told me. He remembers thinking: ''Oh, hey, this is quote-unquote natural. This is normal. This is part of the normal spectrum of humanity -- or life.''
 But later in our conversation, Essex paused and stayed silent for a while. He was thinking like a lawyer again now, and found a hole in that line of reasoning. ''I guess, some of these animals could actually be quote-unquote making a choice,'' he said. How could we, as humans, ever know? ''Huh,'' he said. ''I'm just stopping to think that through. I'm not quite sure what to do with that.'' Essex had stumbled right back into what he originally identified as the underlying problem. Those wanting to discriminate against gays and lesbians may have roped the rest of us into an argument over what's ''natural'' just by asserting for so long that homosexuality is not. But affixing any importance to the question of whether something is natural or unnatural is a red herring; it's impossible to pin down what those words mean even in a purely scientific context. (Zuk notes that animals don't drive cars or watch movies, and no one calls those activities ''unnatural.'') In the end, there's just no coherent debate there to have. Animal research demonstrating the supposed ''naturalness'' of homosexuality has typically been embraced by gay rights activists and has put their opponents on the defensive. At the same time, research interpreted -- or, maybe more often, misinterpreted -- to be close to pinpointing that naturalness in a specific ''gay gene'' can make people on both sides anxious in a totally different way.
 In 2007, for instance, the University of Illinois neurobiologist David Featherstone and several colleagues, while searching for new drug treatments for Lou Gehrig's disease, happened upon a discovery: a specific protein mutation in the brain of male fruit flies made the flies try to have sex with other males. What the mutation did, more specifically, was tweak the fruit flies' sense of smell, making them attracted to male pheromones -- mounting other males was the end result. To Featherstone, how fruit flies smell doesn't seem to have anything to do with human sexuality. ''We didn't think about the societal implications -- we're just a bunch of dorky biologists,'' he told me recently. Still, after publishing a paper describing this mutation, he received a flood of phone calls and e-mail messages presuming that he could, and would, translate this new knowledge into a way of changing people's sexual orientations. One e-mail message compared him with Dr. Josef Mengele, noting ''the direct line that leads from studies like this to compulsory eradication of gay sexuality . . . whether [by] burnings at the stake or injections with chemical suppressants. You,'' the writer added, ''just placed a log on the pyre.'' (Earlier that year, PETA and the former tennis star Martina Navratilova, among others, were waging similar attacks on a scientific study of gay sheep, presuming it was a precursor to developing a ''treatment'' for shutting off homosexuality in human fetuses.)
 Still, many people who contacted Featherstone were actually grateful -- for the same, baseless prospect. Some confessed struggling with feelings for members of the same sex and explained to him, very disarmingly, the anguish they'd been living with and the hope his fruit-fly study finally offered them. There were poignant phone calls from parents, concerned about their gay children. ''I felt bad in a way,'' Featherstone told me. It was hard not to be moved, and he would try to explain the implications of his research, or lack thereof, politely. ''But there's also this liberal, modern side of me that's like: 'Take it easy, lady. Let your son be your son.' ''
 Not long ago, more than two years after the publication of the fruit-fly paper, a woman wrote to Featherstone about her college-aged daughter. The daughter couldn't shake an attraction to other girls but honestly felt she'd never be able to bring herself to accept it either. She was now contemplating suicide. ''She feels that she is losing herself,'' the mother wrote, ''that sweet, innocent light that is within her.'' Like many who reached out to Featherstone, the woman and her daughter seemed to take for granted that homosexuality was inborn -- natural. Otherwise, the situation wouldn't feel so torturously unfair. The mother begged Featherstone to rethink his unwillingness to turn his fruit-fly research into a treatment. ''We all deserve a choice,'' she wrote.
 GRASPING FOR PARALLELS with animals can create emotional truths, though it usually results in slushy logic. It's naive to slap conclusions about a given species directly onto humans.
 But it's disingenuous to ignore the possibility of any connection. ''A lot of zoologists are suspicious, I think, of applying the same evolutionary principles to humans that they apply to animals,'' Paul Vasey, the Japanese-macaque researcher, told me. There's an understandable tendency among some scientists to play down those links to stave off ideological misreading and controversy. ''But broadly speaking, research on animals can inform research on humans,'' Vasey says. What we learn about one species can expand or reorient our approach to others; a well-supported finding about one animal's behavior can generate new hypotheses worth testing in another. ''My research on Japanese macaques might influence how someone conducts their research on octopus, or their research on moose. Or their research on humans,'' he said. In fact, it has influenced Vasey's own research on humans.
 Since 2003, in addition to his investigation of female-female macaque sex, Vasey has also been studying a particular group of men in Samoa. ''Westerners would consider them the equivalent of gay guys, I guess,'' he told me -- they're attracted exclusively to other men. But they're not considered gay in Samoa. Instead, these men make up a third gender in Samoan culture, not men or women, called fa'afafine. (Vasey warned me that mislabeling the fa'afafine ''gay'' or ''homosexual'' in this article would jeopardize his ability to work with them in the future: while there's no stigma attached to being fa'afafine in Samoan culture, homosexuality is seen as different and often repugnant, even by some fa'afafine.)
 In a paper published earlier this year, Vasey and one of his graduate students at the University of Lethbridge, Doug P. VanderLaan, report that fa'afafine are markedly more willing to help raise their nieces and nephews than typical Samoan uncles: they're more willing to baby-sit, help pay school and medical expenses and so on. Furthermore, this heightened altruism and affection is focused only on the fa'afafine's nieces and nephews. They don't just love kids in general. They are a kind of superuncle. This offers support for a hypothesis that has been toyed around with speculatively since the '70s, when E. O. Wilson raised it: If a key perspective of evolutionary biology urges us to understand homosexuality in any species as a beneficial adaptation -- if the point of life is to pass on one's genes -- then maybe the role of gay individuals is to somehow help their family members generate more offspring. Those family members will, after all, share a lot of the same genes.
 Vasey and VanderLaan have also shown that mothers of fa'afafine have more kids than other Samoan women. And this fact supports a separate, existing hypothesis: maybe there's a collection of genes that, when expressed in a male, make him gay but when expressed in a woman, make her more fertile. Like Wilson's theory, this idea was also meant to explain how homosexuality is maintained in a species and not pushed out by the invisible hand of Darwinian evolution. But unlike Wilson's hypothesis, it doesn't try to find a sneaky way to explain homosexuality as an evolutionary adaptation; instead, it imagines homosexuality as a byproduct of an adaptation. It's not too different from how Vasey explains why his female macaques insistently mount one another.
 ''What we're finding in Samoa now,'' Vasey told me, ''is that it's not an either-or.'' Neither of the two hypotheses, on its own, can neatly explain the existence, or evolutionary contribution, of fa'afafine. ''But when you put the two together,'' he said, ''the situation becomes a whole lot more nuanced.'' It's significant that Vasey began his work in Samoa only after he'd gotten to the crux of the macaque situation. ''The Japanese macaques,'' he told me, ''in terms of my personal development, they raised my awareness of the possibility that homosexual behavior might not be an adaptation. I was more likely to put the two hypotheses together because I was just more sensitive, I guess, to the reality that the world . . . is organized so that adaptations and byproducts of adaptations coexist and hinge and impinge on each other. Humans are just another species.''
 Vasey and VanderLaan's work in Samoa doesn't come close to settling theoretical questions about homosexuality. But unlike many biologists I spoke to, Vasey still seemed at ease discussing the speculative and even philosophical ties between animal and human sexuality. He's not concerned with how foolishly or maliciously his work might be misread. ''If somebody wanted to make something out of it, they could,'' Vasey told me, ''but they'd just look like some kind of misinformed hillbilly.''
 Thus far, interpretations of his latest paper on the fa'afafine have been wildly contradictory but all equally overconfident. ''New Gay Study Will Make Anti-Gay Activists Cry Uncle,'' one blog headline read. Another claimed, ''Darwinian Fundamentalists Desperate to Rationalize Homosexuality,'' and cleared the way for a commenter to somehow bemoan Vasey's findings as ''justification'' for gay men ''to sexually abuse their nephews.''
 ''THERE'S TWO mating right there,'' Lindsay Young called out.
 They were right below her, 10 yards away on a flat, vegetated ridge. It was late afternoon. One albatross lay on its stomach, wobbling with its wings pulled back -- the way penguins slide over ice -- while a second stood upright behind it, fat rippling down its telescoping neck, as it pumped its pelvis. ''That looks pretty standard,'' Young said.
 The birds carried on for a while. Then the male shivered and retracted. The female came to her feet and walked off. Young read the female's leg band with her binoculars. ''You just hit the jackpot,'' she told me. The bird was part of a female-female pair. The male had another mate.
 Young started scribbling notes, and we sat there rapidly rehashing the details. The sex didn't seem forced at all. In a rape, Young said -- which, for all the talk of albatross monogamy, is not uncommon in the species -- a male will pin a female's neck to the ground, or back her into a bush to tangle her up. (One study observed four different gangs of males forcing themselves on a single female, which lost an eye in the process.) But these two birds hardly seemed in a rush. Young made more notes. Then, with the male bird frozen right where he'd been left, the female slapped her rubbery feet on the ground, caught an updraft and disappeared over the ocean.
 The next morning, Young still seemed to be assuring herself that her interpretation of what we'd seen was reasonable. ''We didn't see how it started, but how it ended looked . . . '' -- she searched for a precise, nonanthropomorphic phrase. She couldn't really find one, and let out a self-effacing laugh. ''Mutually beneficial?'' she said. ''I don't know!''
 Dave Leonard, a friend of Young's, was tagging along. Leonard -- tall, lanky and tan, with a ponytail and a few days of scruff -- is an ornithologist but works a desk job now for a state wildlife agency and seemed to be enjoying a morning outside. He brandished a gigantic telephoto lens in all directions and had trouble recovering after realizing he'd forgotten to pack his binoculars. Leonard knows his birds, but he was here as a bird lover, not a bird researcher, and wasn't overly concerned with scientific detachment. When Young pointed out a male albatross whinnying at every female that passed overhead, Leonard shook his head and joked, ''I feel your pain, dude.''
 Eventually, Young spotted a female from one of the female-female pairs calling to a male about 15 feet away. The female was standing right where the male and his partner usually build their nest. Her head was straight up in the air, and she clapped her beak animatedly. In Young's experience, it was rare for a bird to call so determinedly to another that's not her partner; this would definitely count as ''solicitation,'' she said, if the two birds wound up copulating. ''Pull up a rock,'' she told me and Leonard.
 We sat on the ground expectantly for a while. Eventually, the male albatross took a few steps toward the calling female. Then it stopped and looked around. It was comical, given the circumstances.
 '' 'Will anyone see me if I cheat?' '' Young said. ''I'm not sure if he's taking her up on it, or just going, 'Why are you in my spot?' '' She was doing the bird's interior monologue, narrating for one blameless, anthropomorphic moment.
 The male stopped again and tucked his beak into the feathers behind his neck. Then he turned around and retreated. The taut sexual anticipation -- at least as felt by us three humans -- seemed to let up. ''Well, his partner should be very proud of the self-control,'' Young said. Then she said, ''I know when to cut my losses,'' gathered up her backpack and clipboard full of hard-earned data and trudged off to watch some other birds.
 MORE THAN 4,000 miles across the Pacific, at a place called Taiaroa Head in southeastern New Zealand, two female Royal albatrosses (a related species) were building their nest. Later that winter, those two birds would become one of only a few known female-female pairs to successfully fledge a chick at Taiaroa Head in more than 60 years of continuous observation of the colony. (Two years before, the same two birds had engaged in a threesome, presiding over a single nest with the help of one male -- just another ''alternative mating strategy'' albatrosses sometimes engage in, it turns out.)
 The tourism board of Dunedin, a gay-friendly region of New Zealand, held a publicity-grabbing contest to name the ''lesbian albatross'' couple's chick. For months, as the paired females incubated their egg, a press officer at Tourism Dunedin issued releases, and news organizations around the world, from England to India, ran with the story. The P.R. woman also tried to interest me in a story about a flightless kakapo bird in the region named Sirocco who'd recently made a memorable appearance on the BBC -- ''He actually started to shag the presenter, Mark Carwardine!'' she wrote to me -- and ''has avid followers on Facebook and Twitter!''
 A biologist working with the albatrosses at Taiaroa Head, Lyndon Perriman, seemed to bristle at the idea of naming any albatrosses -- ''They are wild birds,'' he wrote to me in an e-mail message. He noted that the female-female pair made for an inconvenient tourist attraction because their nest was not visible from any of the public viewing areas. It seemed fitting: people's ideas about the couple were riveting enough; it wasn't necessary to see the actual birds. The chick hatched on Feb. 1. Tourism Dunedin named it Lola. The shortlist also included Rainbow, Lady Gagabatross and Ellen.

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 4 about same-sex pairings in animals misspelled the surname of a director at the American Civil Liberties Union who works on gay issues and who commented about animal behavior as it appliesto the rights of humans. He is James Esseks, not Essex. The article also referred imprecisely to the referencing of a book about the subject in a 2003 Supreme Court case that overturned a Texas sodomy law. While the book, ''Biological Exuberance,'' by Bruce Bagemihl, was cited in a brief filed for the case, it was not cited in the decision itself. Also, the educational affiliation of a biologist mentioned in the article, David Featherstone, who discovered a protein mutation in the brain of male fruit flies that made them try to have sex with other males, was incomplete. It is the University of Illinois at Chicago, not simply the University of Illinois.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Haiti: Getting It Right This Time

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your March 28 editorial ''Making Haiti Whole'' is right on target about the challenges. Unfortunately, it inevitably raises a sense that we have seen this all before, reminding us of the expensive efforts at bringing former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide back to power in 1994 to embark on a process of democratization and economic reconstruction. At the time, a multiagency needs assessment mission took place, and donors contributed generously. This raised high expectations. Nevertheless, reconstruction failed, lack of productive alternatives made corruption and illegal activities thrive, and the well-being of the population did not improve. 
 To succeed this time, things need to be fundamentally different. The new strategy for reconstruction of Haiti should aim at nothing less than changing the political economy of the country. Employment creation will require basic infrastructure and the reactivation of investment, production and exports. This will happen only if Haiti establishes an adequate policy and institutional framework, and if donors create a more effective and accountable aid system and open up their markets to Haitian exports.
 Graciana del Castillo New York, March 29, 2010
 The writer, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, was senior economist in the office of the United Nations secretary general in the 1990s.
 To the Editor:
 While agreeing with the themes of your editorial, I believe that you have underestimated both the contributions that faith-based and other humanitarian organizations will make in the Haitian recovery as well as the short-term challenges facing the government and international donors. For example, Catholic Relief Services has been supporting effective Haitian self-help efforts, strengthening Haitian civil society and coordinating with institutions of the Haitian government for more than 50 years. Our efforts are anything but small-bore. In fact, we expect to invest up to $200 million in the Haitian recovery effort.
 We are, however, extremely concerned about the short term -- especially the need for the government of Haiti, the United Nations and the United States to move the thousands of displaced Haitians in vulnerable temporary camps to locations more protected from the imminent rains. It would be a terrible shame if the hopes we all share for helping Haiti overcome ''its tragic history'' were washed away in a second disaster.

HEADLINE: Contesting Jobless Claims Becomes a Boom Industry

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With a client list that reads like a roster of Fortune 500 firms, a little-known company with an odd name, the Talx Corporation, has come to dominate a thriving industry: helping employers process -- and fight -- unemployment claims.
 Talx, which emerged from obscurity over the last eight years, says it handles more than 30 percent of the nation's requests for jobless benefits. Pledging to save employers money in part by contesting claims, Talx helps them decide which applications to resist and how to mount effective appeals.
 The work has made Talx a boom business in a bust economy, but critics say the company has undermined a crucial safety net. Officials in a number of states have called Talx a chronic source of error and delay. Advocates for the unemployed say the company seeks to keep jobless workers from collecting benefits.
 ''Talx often files appeals regardless of merits,'' said Jonathan P. Baird, a lawyer at New Hampshire Legal Assistance. ''It's sort of a war of attrition. If you appeal a certain percentage of cases, there are going to be those workers who give up.'' 
 When fewer former workers get aid, a company pays lower unemployment taxes.
 Wisconsin and Iowa passed laws to curtail procedural abuses that officials said were common in cases handled by Talx. Connecticut fined Talx (pronounced talks) and demanded an end to baseless appeals. New York, without naming Talx, instructed the Labor Department staff to side with workers in cases that simply pit their word against those of agents for employers. 
 Talx officials say they have been unfairly blamed for situations caused by tight deadlines, confusing state rules or uncooperative employers. Talx cannot submit information about idled workers, they say, until clients give it to them. They say Talx improves the system's efficiency by mastering the complexities of 50 state programs, allowing employers to focus on their businesses.
 ''We can speed the whole process, rather than bog it down,'' said Michael E. Smith, a senior Talx executive. ''The whole idea is to protect those employees who have lost their job through no fault of their own and make sure they get unemployment insurance.''
 Mr. Smith said employers, not Talx, controlled decisions about which cases to contest. ''We just do what the client asks us to do and leave it to the state to decide,'' he said.
 Advocates for the unemployed cite cases like that of Gerald Grenier, 47, who spent four years as a night janitor at a New Hampshire Wal-Mart and was fired for pocketing several dollars in coins from a vending machine. Mr. Grenier, who is mentally disabled, told Wal-Mart he forgot to turn in the change. Talx, representing Wal-Mart, accused him of misconduct and fought his unemployment claim.
 After Mr. Grenier waited three months for a hearing, Wal-Mart did not appear. A Talx agent joined by phone, then seemingly hung up as Mr. Grenier testified. The hearing officer redialed and left an unanswered message on the agent's voice mail. The officer called Mr. Grenier ''completely credible'' and granted him benefits.
 Talx appealed, claiming that the officer had denied the agent's request to let Wal-Mart testify by phone. (A recording of the hearing contains no such request.) Mr. Grenier won the appeal, but by then he had lost his apartment and moved in with his sister.
 ''That was a nightmare,'' he said. 
 In the case of Dina Griess, Talx and its client, the subprime lender Countrywide Financial, were involved in what a judge deemed an outright fraud. Ms. Griess worked for Countrywide outside Boston and quit as it collapsed in 2008, saying she was distressed by internal investigations of lending practices. People can receive unemployment benefits if they quit for ''good cause,'' like unsafe working conditions, but Talx argued that Ms. Griess's reason did not meet the legal standard.
 She won benefits at a hearing that Talx and Countrywide skipped, but Talx successfully appealed, saying the Countrywide witness had missed the hearing because of a family death. Later asked under oath if that was true, the witness said, ''No, it's not.''
 A Massachusetts judge reviewing the case, Robert A. Cornetta of Salem District Court, denounced the deceit and gave Ms. Griess benefits. ''The court will not be party to a fraud,'' he said. 
 Despite the large role that Talx and other agents play in a program that spent $120 billion last year, the federal Department of Labor has done little to measure their impact. 
 Talx, which is based in St. Louis, declined to make clients available for interviews, citing pledges of confidentiality, and none of those contacted chose to comment. Other major employers that have used Talx include Aetna, AT&T, Best Buy, FedEx, Home Depot, Marriott, McDonald's and the United States Postal Service. (The New York Times uses Talx for a different service, to answer inquiries from lenders about its employees' earnings.)
 Talx entered the field brashly, buying the industry's two largest companies on a single day in 2002. In the next few years, it bought five more. Until then, Talx had never handled an unemployment claim, and skeptics wondered how well it could blend seven companies in an unfamiliar industry.
 The Federal Trade Commission argued in a 2008 antitrust complaint that the acquisitions, which cost $230 million, had allowed Talx to ''raise prices unilaterally'' and ''decrease the quality of services.'' Talx modified some contracts to settle the case, but admitted no legal violations.
 Financially, the gamble paid off: Talx was acquired three years ago by Equifax, the credit-rating giant, for $1.4 billion. But work once done locally became centralized -- at a loss, critics say, of responsiveness and expertise. 
 Wisconsin officials were among the first to complain, passing a law in 2005 to prevent what they called a common Talx practice: failing to respond to requests for information, only to appeal when workers got benefits. That clogged the appeals docket and drained the benefits fund, since money sent to ineligible workers was hard to get back.
 While the law brought about quicker participation, said Hal Bergan, the state's unemployment insurance administrator, the company's overall speed and accuracy ''still leaves something to be desired.''
 Indeed, years of e-mail messages, obtained through an open records law, show a continually exasperated Wisconsin staff. While a few cited improved performance, others complained that Talx ''returned half-empty questionnaires,'' sent back ''minimal or 'junk' info,'' reported in error that applicants were dead, filed ''frivolous protests'' and caused ''the holdup of many claims.'' 
 ''Same problems as always,'' wrote Amy Banicki, a senior manager, in a 2008 e-mail message. ''Talx is Talx.'' 
 Iowa passed a similar law in 2008 to curtail unnecessary appeals. Of the 10 employers who most often appealed after failing to respond to data requests, officials said nine were represented by Talx, including Cargill, Target, Tyson Foods, Wal-Mart and Wells Fargo. 
 Connecticut cited ''frivolous motions'' and ''unnecessary delays'' in filing a complaint against Talx under a law that regulates employer agents. Without admitting fault, Talx paid a $12,000 fine and agreed to tell clients in writing that it would not file baseless appeals.
 While there is no comprehensive research, the Labor Department did an internal study of 2,000 cases in 2007 and found Talx significantly slower and less complete in answering auditors' questions than employers who handled their own claims. Officials said they did not release the study, which drew on seven states, because they could not ensure it was representative. The New York Times obtained it under the Freedom of Information Act.
 Talx supporters say the program's tight deadlines often give Talx just a few days to answer requests. They emphasize that Talx is working with states to develop a common computer format that will help provide the data more rapidly. They also say scrutiny of claims by companies like Talx helps deter fraud.
 ''Increased vigilance is an appropriate thing,'' said Douglas J. Holmes, president of UWC, a Washington group that represents employers on unemployment issues. ''Integrity is important.''
 But others say that Talx, by promising to save clients money, has an incentive to fight even legitimate claims. In marketing materials, it warns employers that ''a single claim can result in a higher tax rate'' and makes the promise that ''we deliver increased winning percentages.'' 
 Joseph Walsh, deputy director of Iowa's employment security agency, said, ''We are more likely to see a claim of misconduct that is completely unsupported by the factual record'' when agents are involved.
 Officials in the New York State Department of Labor were so concerned last year about the credibility of agents that they warned staff members against taking their word over that of jobless workers. Absent other evidence, the officials wrote, ''give greater weight to the claimant's statement.''
 That guidance was relevant in the case of Genssy Frias, a Bronx woman who took a maternity leave from a sales job at Lord & Taylor. Ms. Frias said that she tried to return but that her supervisor told her she had been laid off. A Talx agent said Ms. Frias quit because she lacked child care. 
 ''We did not hear from her again,'' the agent wrote. 
 New York canceled Ms. Frias's benefits and accused her of lying.
 In an interview, Ms. Frias said the agent's response to the state was not only inaccurate but also deceitful, because she did not disclose that she worked for Talx and implied first-hand knowledge by using the pronoun ''we.'' Had she identified herself as an agent, officials would have given her statement less weight.
 A Talx spokeswoman said the agent made a clerical error in writing ''we'' and called it an isolated incident. Lord & Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.
 Ms. Frias appealed and presented a baby sitter's note, which vouched that she had arranged for child care. Neither Talx nor Lord & Taylor appeared at the hearing, and Ms. Frias won.
 ''I was thinking, how can they lie like that when they know I didn't quit?'' Ms. Frias said.

HEADLINE: I Saw the Crisis Coming. Why Didn't the Fed?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. BURRY. 
Michael J. Burry ran the hedge fund Scion Capital from 2000 until 2008.

DATELINE: Cupertino, Calif. 

 BODY:
 ALAN GREENSPAN, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, proclaimed last month that no one could have predicted the housing bubble. ''Everybody missed it,'' he said, ''academia, the Federal Reserve, all regulators.'' 
 But that is not how I remember it. Back in 2005 and 2006, I argued as forcefully as I could, in letters to clients of my investment firm, Scion Capital, that the mortgage market would melt down in the second half of 2007, causing substantial damage to the economy. My prediction was based on my research into the residential mortgage market and mortgage-backed securities. After studying the regulatory filings related to those securities, I waited for the lenders to offer the most risky mortgages conceivable to the least qualified buyers. I knew that would mark the beginning of the end of the housing bubble; it would mean that prices had risen -- with the expansion of easy mortgage lending -- as high as they could go. 
 I had begun to worry about the housing market back in 2003, when lenders first resurrected interest-only mortgages, loosening their credit standards to generate a greater volume of loans. Throughout 2004, I had watched as these mortgages were offered to more and more subprime borrowers -- those with the weakest credit. The lenders generally then sold these risky loans to Wall Street to be packaged into mortgage-backed securities, thus passing along most of the risk. Increasingly, lenders concerned themselves more with the quantity of mortgages they sold than with their quality. 
 Meanwhile, home buyers, convinced by recent history that real estate prices would always rise, readily signed onto whatever mortgage would get them the biggest house. The incentive for fraud was great: the F.B.I. reported that its mortgage fraud caseload increased fivefold from 2001 to 2004.
 At the same time, I also watched how ratings agencies vouched for subprime mortgage-backed securities. To me, these agencies seemed not to be paying much attention. 
 By mid-2005, I had so much confidence in my analysis that I staked my reputation on it. That is, I purchased credit default swaps -- a type of insurance -- on billions of dollars worth of both subprime mortgage-backed securities and the bonds of many of the financial companies that would be devastated when the real estate bubble burst. As the value of the bonds fell, the value of the credit default swaps would rise. Our swaps covered many of the firms that failed or nearly failed, including the insurer American International Group and the mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 I entered these trades carefully. Suspecting that my Wall Street counterparties might not be able or willing to pay up when the time came, I used six counterparties to minimize my exposure to any one of them. I also specifically avoided using Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns as counterparties, as I viewed both to be mortally exposed to the crisis I foresaw. 
 What's more, I demanded daily collateral settlement -- if positions moved in our favor, I wanted cash posted to our account the next day. This was something I knew that Goldman Sachs and other derivatives dealers did not demand of AAA-rated A.I.G. 
 I believed that the collapse of the subprime mortgage market would ultimately lead to huge failures among the largest financial institutions. But at the time almost no one else thought these trades would work out in my favor. 
 During 2007, under constant pressure from my investors, I liquidated most of our credit default swaps at a substantial profit. By early 2008, I feared the effects of government intervention and exited all our remaining credit default positions -- by auctioning them to the many Wall Street banks that were themselves by then desperate to buy protection against default. This was well in advance of the government bailouts. Because I had been operating in the face of strong opposition from both my investors and the Wall Street community, it took everything I had to see these trades through to completion. Disheartened on many fronts, I shut down Scion Capital in 2008. 
 Since then, I have often wondered why nobody in Washington showed any interest in hearing exactly how I arrived at my conclusions that the housing bubble would burst when it did and that it could cripple the big financial institutions. A week ago I learned the answer when Al Hunt of Bloomberg Television, who had read Michael Lewis's book, ''The Big Short,'' which includes the story of my predictions, asked Mr. Greenspan directly. The former Fed chairman responded that my insights had been a ''statistical illusion.'' Perhaps, he suggested, I was just a supremely lucky flipper of coins.
 Mr. Greenspan said that he sat through innumerable meetings at the Fed with crack economists, and not one of them warned of the problems that were to come. By Mr. Greenspan's logic, anyone who might have foreseen the housing bubble would have been invited into the ivory tower, so if all those who were there did not hear it, then no one could have said it. 
 As a nation, we cannot afford to live with Mr. Greenspan's way of thinking. The truth is, he should have seen what was coming and offered a sober, apolitical warning. Everyone would have listened; when he talked about the economy, the world hung on every single word. 
 Unfortunately, he did not give good advice. In February 2004, a few months before the Fed formally ended a remarkable streak of interest-rate cuts, Mr. Greenspan told Americans that they would be missing out if they failed to take advantage of cost-saving adjustable-rate mortgages. And he suggested to the banks that ''American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed-rate mortgage.'' 
 Within a year lenders made interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages readily available to subprime borrowers. And within 18 months lenders offered subprime borrowers so-called pay-option adjustable-rate mortgages, which allowed borrowers to make partial monthly payments and have the remainder added to the loan balance (much like payments on a credit card). 
 Observing these trends in April 2005, Mr. Greenspan trumpeted the expansion of the subprime mortgage market. ''Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit,'' he said, ''lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately.'' 
 Yet the tide was about to turn. By December 2005, subprime mortgages that had been issued just six months earlier were already showing atypically high delinquency rates. (It's worth noting that even though most of these mortgages had a low two-year teaser rate, the borrowers still had early difficulty making payments.)
 The market for subprime mortgages and the derivatives thereof would not begin its spectacular collapse until roughly two years after Mr. Greenspan's speech. But the signs were all there in 2005, when a bursting of the bubble would have had far less dire consequences, and when the government could have acted to minimize the fallout.
 Instead, our leaders in Washington either willfully or ignorantly aided and abetted the bubble. And even when the full extent of the financial crisis became painfully clear early in 2007, the Federal Reserve chairman, the Treasury secretary, the president and senior members of Congress repeatedly underestimated the severity of the problem, ultimately leaving themselves with only one policy tool -- the epic and unfair taxpayer-financed bailouts. Now, in exchange for that extra year or two of consumer bliss we all enjoyed, our children and our children's children will suffer terrible financial consequences. 
 It did not have to be this way. And at this point there is no reason to reflexively dismiss the analysis of those who foresaw the crisis. Mr. Greenspan should use his substantial intellect and unsurpassed knowledge of government to ascertain and explain exactly how he and other officials missed the boat. If the mistakes were properly outlined, that might both inform Congress's efforts to improve financial regulation and help keep future Fed chairmen from making the same errors again.

HEADLINE: The Familiar Comforts of Conspiracies

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS

 BODY:
Conspiratorial thinking has been a staple of American political discourse since the founding of the Republic. But lately the rhetoric of sinister plots and endangered liberty has reached new heights, or depths, whether it is Glenn Beck using a whiteboard to explain how the Progressive Era reforms of Theodore Roosevelt put the nation on to the path of totalitarianism, or Tea Party activists deploring the impending loss of constitutional liberty. 
 Effective conspiracy theories depend, to a considerable extent, on the presence of actual dangers that seem to demand immediate and even extreme responses. As the dangers grow more familiar, the urgency fades. A good case study is the Fox television series ''24.'' First broadcast in the aftermath of 9/11, the show, with its tense air of moment-to-moment exigency, once reflected the psychology of its time. In those years it was a small step from legitimate fear of further attacks to imagined conspiracies planned at the pinnacles of power. When its hero, Jack Bauer, administered inventively brutal counterterrorism tactics, including torture, he was in effect punishing two sets of enemies -- jihadists who had pledged to destroy America and bureaucrats at home who seemed more devoted to following the rules than to neutralizing the terrorist threat. Yet in an acknowledgment, perhaps, that the anxieties of the Bush years have receded, Fox executives have announced the show's cancellation in May, after eight seasons (though there may be a movie). 
 Today, as new anxieties mount, many of them the result of a ravaged economy, different formulations have been devised to meet them. But they feel oddly sterile, cloaked in outmoded dogma. When Representative John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, warned that passage of the health-care reform bill portended ''Armageddon'' and would ''ruin our country,'' the words conveyed none of the Isaiah-like fervor of Thomas Jefferson's claim that the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1789 would ''drive these states into revolution and blood,'' or of Senator Joseph McCarthy's declaration that the Truman administration's failure to check the rise of global communism was proof of ''a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.'' 
 Such fervor is also missing from a book like ''American Conspiracies,'' by Jesse Ventura (with Dick Russell), the former governor of Minnesota and current host of the reality show ''Conspiracy Theory,'' with its dutiful rehashes of more than a dozen alleged cover-ups, ranging from assassinations (of John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others) through ''The Stolen Elections of 2000, 2004 (and Almost 2008)'' and ''The Secret Plans to End American Democracy'' during the Bush years. 
 But conspiracy theories demand more than recitations of evidence. They demand true conviction. The classic case is ''Hamlet,'' in some respects the original modern conspiracy narrative. The clammy atmosphere is established in the opening scene, in which the fearful night watchmen seek to calm themselves as they uneasily await ''the dreaded sight'' of Hamlet's dead father. When the ghost at last materializes, ''the preternatural appearance has all the effect of abruptness, and the reader is totally divested of the notion that the figure is a vision of a highly wrought imagination,'' as Samuel Taylor Coleridge noted in his celebrated lecture on the play. Shakespeare is able to conjure this implausible world, Coleridge observed, because ''he adapts himself so admirably to the situation -- in other words so puts himself into it.'' 
 The same can be said of films like ''The Parallax View,''Oliver Stone's ''JFK'' and ''Arlington Road.'' All are in some ways crude and heavy-handed, their formulations absurd, even outrageous. But they mean to be. How else to jolt us out of our complacent understanding of the world we think we know?
 It is just this passionate intensity that is missing from two current conspiratorial films, ''The Ghost Writer,'' a thriller directed by Roman Polanski, and ''Green Zone,'' Paul Greengrass's action film about the first days of the Iraq war. 
 ''The Ghost Writer'' begins promisingly: Adam Lang, a Tony Blair-like former prime minister, loathed for his complicity in advancing the American-driven war on terror, is living in a kind of wounded but prideful exile on Martha's Vineyard, surrounded by retainers. His main business, completing a memoir that will restore his reputation, is stalled when his ghostwriter dies mysteriously, so a new one is rushed in. 
 Mr. Polanski translates all this into sumptuous entertainment. There are satisfying star turns (Pierce Brosnan as Lang, narcissistic and acerbic; Olivia Williams as his chilly, cerebral wife; Ewan McGregor as the out-of-his-depth replacement hack). There is also pleasing camerawork: painterly images of strained light and oppressive gloom. But the cumulative effect is to create a well-upholstered world as immune to disorder as a country manor in a Miss Marple ''cozy.'' 
 And once the conspiracy finally emerges, it is solved with soothing ease. When Mr. McGregor, sensing a secret behind his predecessor's death, stumbles onto the marvels of a GPS system and clinches a connection through an elementary Google search, the crisis that has been conjured, dark though it is meant to seem, feels not chillingly alien but sadly archaic -- rather as if Mr. Polanski, at age 76, had bumped into the conspiracy of 21st-century household technology. 
 More time-locked still is the film's political revelation, involving Lang's concealed ties with the C.I.A. and its global torture policies. Mr. Polanski, all too faithful to his source text, Robert Harris's 2007 thriller ''The Ghost,'' seems unaware of the well-documented truth about the C.I.A., that it ceased long ago to be the ''rogue elephant'' unmasked in Congressional hearings in the 1970s. On the contrary, since 9/11 the agency has been accused less often of sinister misdeeds than of incompetence and bureaucratic inaction. That was the reason the Iraq war planners organized their own clandestine intelligence group -- its members sardonically labeled themselves ''the Cabal'' -- who collected their own intelligence and used it to defy C.I.A. analysts and help drive the policies ''The Ghost Writer'' leaves curiously unexamined. 
 To some extent, ''Green Zone'' pursues the theme missed by ''The Ghost Writer.'' Mr. Greengrass and his star, Matt Damon -- collaborators on the last two ''Bourne'' movies -- have reunited in a hyperkinetic action film set during the first phase of the Iraq war, when American troops failed to uncover the caches of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons that had provided the casus belli. 
 ''Green Zone'' evokes that period with a cast of holographs who replay the well-publicized sins of the Bush presidency: its arrogance (a neatly groomed Defense Department ideologue posted in Iraq who smirks, as chaos descends, that ''democracy is messy'') and its cluelessness (Americans lounging poolside in their country-club-like compound, feasting on Domino's pizza). Lest we miss the point, there is also footage of Mr. Bush himself, declaring victory. 
 This editorial commentary is accurate enough. But we've heard it all before -- in fact, heard much of it at the time, or shortly after. So too with the big conspiratorial payoff, which more or less duplicates information known since the first months of the war, when Seymour Hersh, among others, reported that the Bush administration was relying on shabby intelligence furnished, or invented, by the opportunistic exile Ahmad Chalabi. (A Chalabi figure appears in ''Green Zone,'' flown into Baghdad to assert his nonexistent authority.) 
 In the end Mr. Greengrass makes no effort to divest his audience of its assumptions. Like Mr. Polanski, he flatters rather than unsettles, replacing one familiar narrative with another. 
 Fittingly, crucial discoveries in both ''The Ghost Writer'' and ''Green Zone'' turn on coded messages -- Lang's memoir, with its embedded clues, and a notebook Mr. Damon's character struggles to keep from the hands of his rivals. The motif seems yet another relic of the Bush years, of a piece with the administration's ''torture memos.'' 
 Contrast those shadowy texts with the most controversial document of the moment: the 2,300-plus pages of ''H.R. 3200 -- America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009,'' every word available online for public inspection. 
 In other words, the drama of the Bush presidency, with its fetish for secrecy, has given way to the open spectacle of the first Obama term. Its main events occur in real time, just as they do in ''24,'' but it is the slow drip of deliberation, suspenseful in its own way -- most memorably in the House vote on the health-care bill, a daylong marathon of rants and orations, parliamentary feints and offstage horse trading. This is not to say the conspiratorial narrative is exhausted as a form, only that its subjects have changed, for this is a moment when the likeliest source of threats are to be found not within the government but among those who seem to be nursing a deep-seated hatred of it -- whether they are protesters vandalizing the offices of elected officials or the militia members indicted last week in Michigan on sedition and weapons charges.
 The days ahead should provide ample material for conspiracy-minded storytellers. But they will have to exit their bunkers if they are to locate the places where fresh plots are being hatched.

HEADLINE: How Washington Abetted the Bank Job

BYLINE: By SUSAN P. KONIAK, GEORGE M. COHEN, DAVID A. DANA and THOMAS ROSS. 
Susan P. Koniak is a law professor at Boston University. George M. Cohen is a law professor at the University of Virginia. David A. Dana is a law professor at Northwestern University. Thomas Ross is a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh.

 BODY:
A FEW weeks ago, two Republican House members asked Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, whether the Fed knew -- before Lehman's bankruptcy examiner revealed it -- about the bookkeeping scam at Lehman known as ''Repo 105.'' This scam allowed Lehman to disguise how much debt it was carrying, right up until it collapsed. Lehman got new loans to pay off old loans, pretended the new loans were ''sales,'' and through a complicated series of steps made both the old and new loans disappear just in time for its quarterly reports. 
 Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had known nothing about this. After all, he explained, the Fed wasn't Lehman's regulator -- the Securities and Exchange Commission was. The Fed had placed some people at Lehman -- not as many as the S.E.C. had -- but they were there only to ensure that Lehman paid back money it was borrowing from the government. Can't lay this on him. 
 Meanwhile, the S.E.C. insists that it could not have known what Lehman was up to because it was ''understaffed'' and ''ill-suited'' to run a voluntary oversight program. But, the commission says, since the Lehman bankruptcy examiner's report it has sprung into action, investigating whether other banks might also have cooked the books. 
 Any minute now, expect to hear that the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- our other federal bank regulators -- were just as shocked that Lehman used make-believe sales to hide its ocean of red ink. 
 Well, the truth is this: The collapse of Enron back in 2001 revealed that the biggest financial institutions, here and abroad, were busy creating products whose sole purpose was to help companies magically transform their debt into capital or revenue. At the time, there were news reports about Merrill Lynch pretending to buy Nigerian barges from Enron, JPMorgan Chase dressing up its loans to Enron as commodity trades and Citigroup disguising Enron debt as profits from Treasury-bill swaps. 
 This went well beyond Enron. Our banks had gone into the business of creating ''products'' to help companies, cities and whole countries hide their true financial condition. Consider the recent revelations about how Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan helped Greece hide its debt. Now we discover that our banks not only were raking in huge profits helping others hide debt, they also drank their own Kool-Aid. As a chief executive of Citibank said in 2007 about financing dangerously leveraged deals, ''As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.'' 
 Our bank regulators were not, as they would like us to believe, outside the disco, deaf and blind to the revelry going on within. They were bouncing to the same beat. In 2006, the agencies jointly published something called the ''Interagency Statement on Sound Practices Concerning Elevated Risk Complex Structured Finance Activities.'' It became official policy the following year. 
 What are ''complex structured finance'' transactions? As defined by the regulators, these include deals that ''lack economic or business purpose'' and are ''designed or used primarily for questionable accounting, regulatory or tax objectives, particularly when the transactions are executed at year end or at the end of a reporting period.'' 
 How does one propose ''sound practices'' for practices that are inherently unsound? Yet that is what our regulatory guardians did. The statement is powerful evidence of the permissive approach bank regulators took toward the debt-dissolving financial products that our banks had been developing, hawking and using themselves for years. And it's good reason for Americans to be outraged by the ''who me, what, where?'' reaction of Mr. Bernanke and the S.E.C. to the revelation of Lehman's Repo 105 scam. 
 Since the financial crisis struck in 2008, many have bemoaned the supposed inability of bank regulators to coordinate their efforts. That assumes a joint effort would somehow have helped. In fact, our regulators could coordinate, and did, and thereby contributed to the crisis. 
 Their cooperation began in the early 2000s, when the regulators decided they had to say something about how our banks helped Enron conceal its debt through complex transactions and how financial institutions were devising ever more complex instruments. In 2004, the agencies issued their first proposed statement on these practices.
 This proposal was not quite ''regulation'' (in the sense of a set of new binding rules), but rather more like a position paper that set forth safeguards the regulators thought the banks should adopt. Mild really, given what Enron had exposed. 
 Still, the plan included significant hurdles that the regulators wanted banks to clear before selling or using potentially dangerous financial instruments. The focus of the 2004 proposal was complexity itself; it would have applied to all new complex products developed by banks. 
 That focus was right. Complexity was what made it possible to hide debt, avoid capital requirements and evade taxes. Thus the statement said that banks should document their reasons for concluding that each complex instrument developed and sold would be used for a legitimate purpose and not to evade the law. It also said that financial institutions should ensure that the buyers of complex instruments understood how they worked and what risks they entailed. 
 The financial industry would have none of that. It bombarded the agencies with comments denouncing the proposal. Banks did not want the responsibility of explaining to customers the risks inherent in these instruments. And, while banks couldn't say it directly, how they could document that products that were valuable specifically because they could get around laws were not being bought for that purpose? 
 MOREOVER, the banks understood that the statement threatened the virtually regulation-free zone they had won for other forms of complex structured finance, particularly collateralized debt obligations. So the industry condemned the 2004 proposal, and the regulators caved. They agreed to think it over -- for two more years.
 Hence the interagency statement on ''sound practices'' of 2006 we described earlier, which was greeted with effusive praise from bankers, their lawyers and accountants. Gone was the requirement to ensure that customers understood these instruments and that the banks document that they would not be used to phony-up a company's books. 
 The focus on complexity was also gone, as was the concern over transactions ''with significant leverage'' -- that is, deals with little real cash underneath, another unfortunate deletion because attending to excessive leverage would have served us well. 
 Instead, the only products that the banks were asked to handle with special care were so narrowly defined and so obviously fraudulent that suggesting that they could be sold at all was outrageous. These included ''circular transfers of risk ... that lack economic substance'' and transactions that ''involve oral or undocumented agreements that ... would have a material impact on regulatory, tax or accounting treatment.'' 
 Just as troubling, atleast in retrospect, the new statement specifically exempted C.D.O.'s from the need for any special care because they were akin to other ''plain vanilla'' derivatives, in that they were ''familiar to participants in the financial markets'' and had ''well-established track records'' (yes, the same C.D.O.'s backed by bundled mortgages that financial firms and the government are now stuck trying to value and absorb, the infamous ''toxic assets''). 
 Only two years later, these same regulators were explaining that the complexity and opaqueness of instruments like C.D.O.'s had contributed significantly to the economic collapse. And it is now common wisdom that many of the bankers themselves did not understand the risks of these ''familiar'' instruments. 
 Moreover, the collapse was characterized by institutions supposedly healthy one day and on the verge of collapse the next, due in no small part to their extraordinary debt burdens -- debt burdens that complex instruments magically removed from the books. 
 To this day, that final interagency statement (which was adopted in 2007) has not been repealed or replaced. It can still be found on the S.E.C. Web site, along with the letters from industry representatives praising the 2006 draft. 
 The site also has a single letter begging the agencies not to adopt that draft statement -- a letter the four of us wrote. Our position was simple: products having no economic purpose except to achieve questionable accounting, tax or regulatory goals; or that raise serious concerns that customers will use them to issue materially misleading financial statements; or that meet any of the other bullet points in the 2006 statement's list, should, at a minimum, be labeled presumptively prohibited.
 The final statement notes and rejects our plea, saying that if any firm determined that its participation in a complex financial transaction ''would create significant legal or reputational risks for the institution,'' it could ''take appropriate steps to manage and address these risks.'' 
 As Congress now considers reforming the financial industry, it needs to take into account how abysmally our regulators performed when they coordinated their efforts and how insular their decision-making has been on matters that affect the entire economy. Congress needs to recognize that ''regulatory capture,'' in which an agency becomes a pawn of the industry it is supposed to oversee, is real. 
 Ideas like the proposal by Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, to prohibit traditional banks from trading on their own accounts, will do little to improve the situation so long as enforcement is left up to regulators' discretion. Passing piecemeal fixes to outlaw each fraud-inviting instrument -- like the provision slipped into the recent jobs bill that outlaws a derivative that had been designed by the industry to allow individuals to evade paying taxes on their stock dividends -- will never be a substitute for restoring civil liability for abetting securities fraud. Innovation can too easily outstrip specific rules. 
 Yes, we can lay Lehman's Repo 105 and the proliferation of dangerously complex instruments at the feet of the Fed, the S.E.C. and the other signatories to the watered-down interagency statement. Years earlier, after Enron collapsed, they learned all they needed to know about the bogus structures banks developed to conceal financial instability. Yet by backing down and giving in, the regulators encouraged them. We are paying for those mistakes today.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Delay Report on Chinese Currency, While Urging an End to Intervention

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Obama administration said Saturday that it would delay a decision on whether to declare China a currency manipulator, but it vowed to press Chinese leaders on the politically charged issue of its currency valuation during a series of meetings through June. 
 The Treasury's action seemed intended to send a reassuring message both to China and to Congress. It signaled to China that the administration prefers to resolve the dispute diplomatically, rather than force a showdown, but also pressed the case for a change in China's policy, a position advocated by many United States lawmakers in both parties. 
 ''China's inflexible exchange rate has made it difficult for other emerging market economies to let their currencies appreciate,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement. ''A move by China to a more market-oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing.''
 In his statement, Mr. Geithner said he had decided to delay the semiannual exchange rate report to Congress, which was to be due on April 15 and which many members of Congress had hoped would officially cite China as a currency manipulator. 
 But he made it clear that the United States believed that China has artificially undervalued its currency, the renminbi, which is also called the yuan. China had allowed the renminbi to appreciate from 2005 to 2008, but then resumed the practice of pegging its currency to a nearly fixed rate to bolster its export-oriented economy during the financial crisis. 
 ''China's continued maintenance of a currency peg has required increasingly large volumes of currency intervention,'' Mr. Geithner said.
 Mr. Geithner pledged to raise the issue at a series of forums: a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 nations later this month; the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue between the two countries in China in May; and a meeting of G-20 leaders and finance ministers in June. Mr. Geithner called these meetings ''the best avenue for advancing U.S. interests at this time.'' 
 Tensions between the nations have been easing, and China said on Thursday that President Hu Jintao would attend a nuclear security summit meeting in Washington this month. 
 Many economists believe the renminbi is now undervalued by as much as 40 percent. Some economists expect China to move on its own to adjust the value of the renminbi; by delaying the report the administration may be trying to give the Chinese some breathing room to do so. 
 Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and an authority on the Chinese economy, said the delay made sense given China's recent steps on other American priorities, including tougher sanctions against Iran and pressure on North Korea over nuclear weapons. ''Delaying the currency report is a small price to pay for what we've gotten so far,'' he said.
 He said the statement ''reflects the administration's desire to address this on a multilateral basis rather than a bilateral basis.'' 
 The United States has not found China to be a currency manipulator since 1994. Under successive administrations, officials have tried to persuade China that letting the renminbi appreciate would stimulate domestic demand and reduce reliance on exports. An appreciation would also stimulate private savings in the United States by making imports more expensive and exports less expensive. 
 Within the Chinese government there has been debate over the issue. The central bank has signaled that a gradual appreciation is in order, but the Commerce Ministry, which represents the interests of the country's powerful exporters and manufacturers, has argued for maintaining the currency peg. 
 Last month, 130 House members urged the Obama administration to impose tariffs and other punitive measures on China in retaliation for the undervalued renminbi, and a handful of senators proposed legislation that would effectively threaten China with trade sanctions. Both efforts had bipartisan support. 
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, also criticized the delay. 
 ''Everyone knows China is manipulating the value of its currency to gain an unfair advantage in international trade,'' he said. ''If we want the Chinese to take us seriously, we need to be willing to say so in public.''
 However, another influential lawmaker, Representative Sander M. Levin, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, endorsed the Treasury's approach. ''The announced delay is for a definite period and for a defined purpose,'' Mr. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in a statement. But he added that if a multilateral effort did not result in China's making significant changes, ''the administration and Congress will have no choice but to take appropriate action.''
 Similarly, Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, one of the largest manufacturing unions, said he was comforted by the Treasury stance.
 ''Those are very positive statements,'' he said. ''We have an administration that's finally talking about this issue. I'm not so bothered with the postponement if it's going to bring about a positive direction and change in America.''

HEADLINE: It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Obama!

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
NOT since Clark Kent changed in a phone booth has there been an instant image makeover to match Barack Obama's in the aftermath of his health care victory. ''He went from Jimmy Carter to F.D.R. in just a fortnight,'' said one of the ''Game Change'' authors, Mark Halperin, on MSNBC. ''Look at the steam in the man's stride!'' exclaimed Chris Matthews. ''Is it just me, or does Barack Obama seem different since health care passed?'' wrote Peter Beinart in The Daily Beast, which, like The Financial Times, ran an illustration portraying the gangly president as a newly bulked-up Superman.
 What a difference winning makes -- especially in America. Whatever did (or didn't) get into Obama's Wheaties, this much is certain: No one is talking about the clout of Scott Brown or Rahm Emanuel any more. 
 But has the man really changed -- or is it just us? Fifteen months after arriving at the White House, Obama remains by far the most popular national politician in the country, even with a sub-50 percent approval rating. And yet he's also the most enigmatic. While he is in our face more than any other figure in the world, we still aren't entirely sure what to make of him.
 Depending on where you stand -- or the given day -- he is either an overintellectual, professorial wuss or a ruthless Chicago machine pol rivaling the original Boss Daley. He is either a socialist redistributing wealth to the undeserving poor or a tool of Wall Street's Goldman Sachs elite. He is a terrorist-coddling, A.C.L.U.-tilting lawyer or a closet Cheneyite upholding the worst excesses of the Bush administration's end run on the Constitution. He is a lightweight celebrity who's clueless without a teleprompter or a Machiavellian mastermind who has ingeniously forged his Hawaiian birth certificate, covered up his ties to Islamic radicals and bamboozled the entire mainstream press. He is the reincarnation of J.F.K., L.B.J., F.D.R., Reagan, Hitler, Stalin, Adlai Stevenson or Nelson Mandela. (Funny how few people compared George W. Bush to anyone but Hitler and his parents.)
 No wonder that eight major new Obama books are arriving in the coming months, as Howard Kurtz reported in The Washington Post last week. And that's just counting those by real authors, like Bob Woodward and Jonathan Alter, not the countless anti-Obama diatribes. There's a bottomless market for these volumes not just because their protagonist remains popular but also because we keep hoping that the Obama puzzle might be cracked once and for all, like the Da Vinci Code. 
 The first of these books, out this week, is full of intriguing clues. Titled ''The Bridge'' and written by David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, it portrays Obama as fairly steady in his blend of liberal and centrist views, however much they (like everyone else's) may have evolved over decades. Even his cultural tastes combined the progressive with the cautious. In the apartment he shared with a roommate at Occidental College, the playlist at late-night parties ran the gamut from Bob Marley and the Talking Heads to ''that not-so-great soft Grover Washington stuff,'' a friend recalls with some disdain. 
 If Obama's belief system was fairly consistent, his public persona was not. Remnick returns repeatedly to the notion that Obama is a ''shape-shifter,'' with a remarkable ability to come across differently to disparate constituencies. Some of that reflects his agility at shifting rhetorical gears when, say, speaking to a living-room gathering on Chicago's Near North Side or at a black church -- a talent not unknown to some white politicians, starting with Bill Clinton. But much of this has less to do with Obama's performance style than with how various audiences respond to his complex, hard-to-pigeonhole poly-racial-cultural-geographical identity. As far back as 2004 -- when Obama was still in the Illinois Senate -- a writer at The Chicago Tribune, Don Terry, framed what remains the prevailing Obama takeaway to this day. ''He's a Rorschach test,'' Terry wrote. ''What you see is what you want to see.''
 Last week, after I wrote about the role race plays in some of the apocalyptic right-wing hysteria about the health care bill, a friend who is a prominent liberal Obama supporter sent me an e-mail flipping my point. He theorized that race also plays a role in ''the often angry and intemperate talk'' he has been hearing from ''left-liberal friends for the past many months about what a failure and a disappointment'' the president has been. In his view, ''Obama never said anything, while running, to give anyone the idea'' that he was other than a ''deliberate, compromise-seeking bipartisan moderate.'' My friend wondered if white liberals who voted for Obama expected a ''sweeping Republicans-be-damned kind of agenda'' in part -- and he emphasized ''in part!'' -- because ''they expect a black guy to be intemperate, impetuous, impatient'' rather than ''measured, deliberate, patient.'' 
 That was one provocative expansion of Obama-as-Rorschach test I hadn't encountered before, and I guess anything is possible, particularly when it involves race in America. But what is unquestionably true is my friend's underlying premise -- that the Obama we see now is generally consistent with the one he presented in the 2008 campaign. Many, if not all, of the positions that have angered liberals since he entered the White House line up with his positions then, including his stubborn and futile faith in the prospect of bipartisanship in Washington. 
 When the 2008 Obama called Afghanistan an essential war and vowed to take out terrorist havens in Pakistan, he wasn't just posturing to prove he was as hawkish as Hillary Clinton -- which is what some chose to hear. Though he nominally supported a public option as a plank of health care reform, it was not a high priority and he rarely mentioned it, according to a review of his campaign speeches, interviews and debates by Sam Stein of The Huffington Post. Obama never said anything to suggest that he was interested in economic interventionism as bold as, say, the potential nationalization of failing banks. He was unambiguous in his professed opposition to same-sex marriage and largely silent on gun control. And as Jake Tapper of ABC News chronicled last week, Obama had even opened the door to offshore oil drilling in the weeks before Election Day.
 It's not just the Tea Party right or some on the liberal left who see only the Obama they want to see. This phenomenon extends to moderate Republicans who refuse to believe that Obama agrees with them even when he does. Susan Collins, the senator from Maine, reacted to the news of the Christmas Day bomber with an over-the-top outburst accusing Obama of being soft on terrorism. Though Obama's education reforms have increased Pell grants and nettled one liberal constituency, teachers' unions, Lamar Alexander, the supposedly temperate senator from Tennessee, has characterized the president as pushing ''a Soviet-style, European, and even Asian higher-education model where the government manages everything.'' Mitt Romney has now started a full-tilt campaign to angrily challenge the indisputable reality that ''Obamacare'' resembles his own health care reform package in Massachusetts.
 What's clear is that Obama largely remains a fixed point even while the rest of us keep wildly revising our judgments, whether looking at him through the prism of partisan politics, race, media melodrama or any other we choose. It's our recession-tossed country, not his presidency, that is rocked by violent mood swings. 
 That doesn't mean his presidency will be successful. Being consistent is not the same as being a forceful leader. If there's been an overarching, nonideological failing so far in Obama, it's been his execution of the levers of power. Whether in articulating his health care bottom line, or closing Guantanamo Bay, or moving forward on repealing ''don't ask, don't tell,'' he has often seemed tardy or unfocused, at times missing deadlines he has set himself. The narrative that might link his presidential policies into a clear, mobilizing vision for the country remains murky, which in turn facilitates the caricature of his views from all sides.
 But in the immediate aftermath of his health care victory, at least, there does seem to be real, not imagined, change in Obama's management modus operandi. Whether challenging Karzaiand Bibi, or pushing through 15 recess appointments, or taunting those who would repeal the health care law to ''go for it,'' this is a far more energized executive than the sometimes tentative technocrat we've often seen thus far. The pace has picked up -- if not to faster-than-a-speeding-bullet Superman velocity, then at least as much as the inherent sclerosis of Washington will allow.
 And not a moment too soon. The speed with which Obama navigates out of the recession, as measured by new jobs and serious financial reform, remains by far the most determinative factor in how he, his party and, most of all, the country will fare in the fractious year of 2010. If he succeeds in that all-important challenge -- or, for that matter, if he fails -- the enigmatic, Rorschach-test phase of Obama's still young relationship to the American people may rapidly draw to a close. It will be the moment of clarity that allows us to at last judge him, as we should all presidents, on what he's actually done rather than on who we imagine he is.

HEADLINE: Bargains In the Boardroom?

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

 BODY:
LAST year may have been unnerving for chief executives accustomed to all of the familiar ornaments of corporate life: eight-figure pay packages, corporate jets, memberships in select clubs, and on and on. 
 As the country settled into the worst recession in decades, the government became unusually involved in corporate pay practices. The Obama administration appointed Kenneth Feinberg -- a k a the pay czar -- to scrutinize compensation at corporate behemoths like Citigroup, the American International Group, Bank of America, General Motors and Chrysler, all of which taxpayers propped up with billions upon billions of dollars in bailouts.
 Mr. Feinberg came up with his own blueprint for compensation boundaries -- and noted that its strictures could be applied not only to corporate wards of the state under the Troubled Asset Relief Program but also in myriad other boardrooms. 
 So if you were the typical American C.E.O., you may have found some of the pay czar's prescriptions startling. For instance, he thinks you should pay golf club dues out of your own pocket. He also would like you to take less of your pay in cash and more of it in stock. In fact, the White House set a limit on how much cash top executives of the biggest TARP companies could get as part of their annual compensation: $500,000 a year. That sum that may seem princely to the average American worker but, alas, doesn't buy much for a crowd used to Fifth Avenue triplexes, third and fourth homes, top-drawer health care and lavish private schools for their children.
 Mr. Feinberg's proposed remedies weren't the only compensation-related issues that might have disturbed an executive's sleep. The Securities and Exchange Commission ordered companies to disclose more information about compensation, which invariably stirs up shareholders. And the Federal Reserve also announced its own sweeping review of banker pay.
 On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Democratic allies of the White House are mulling reforms that would require public companies to give shareholders an annual ''say on pay'' vote. While the measure, if enacted, would be nonbinding, it would still force C.E.O.'s to publicly debate at annual meetings all aspects of sumptuous pay packages. 
 In short, the long-running feud between shareholder advocates and corporations over executive pay will offer an emotional flashpoint as President Obama turns his attention from health care to financial reform.
 Business representatives in Washington are pushing back. ''We are not taking issue with the pay master's approach to those companies that are still receiving TARP funds,'' says John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives whose board includes highly paid C.E.O.'s. ''But to apply that to every public company, we think, is not advisable and out of bounds.'' 
 Even so, shareholder advocates say they see some companies recrafting pay policies to please the government and to get in front of any coming changes. 
 ''Boardrooms correctly read the pay czar's action as a real signal to corporate America of public dismay over excessive pay,'' says Stephen M. Davis, a senior fellow at the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at Yale. ''It was a warning that if they didn't get their act together that further intervention by the government was perhaps inevitable.''
 But it's probably more accurate to say that companies are sending a mixed message about compensation: we will follow some of Washington's pay recommendations, but not all of them. At least, that's the trend in the data in this season's raft of corporate proxy filings.
 Equilar, a compensation research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif., recently prepared a report for The New York Times analyzing the pay of 200 chief executives at 199 public companies with revenue of at least $5.78 billion that filed their proxies by March 26. (Only 199 companies are on the list because Motorola has two co-C.E.O.'s.)
 Equilar says the median pay package -- the midpoint where half of the compensation packages on that list are lower and half are higher -- declined by 13 percent last year, to $7.7 million. The average total pay tumbled by 15 percent, to $9.5 million.
 It was the second consecutive year that C.E.O. pay slipped, sending the median compensation package back to about where it was in 2004 and shaving off much of the increase that occurred when the economy went into overdrive and executive pay soared along with it.
 Two years ago, C.E.O. compensation dropped because cash bonuses were decimated by the financial crisis. The decline last year can be largely attributed to the hammering of stock and option awards granted early in 2009, when stock prices were at their nadir. As a result, Equilar says, the median values of C.E.O. stock and option awards were down by 19 percent and 28 percent.
 Of course, some chief executives have seen the value of their equity grants soar along with the stock market. This angers some shareholder advocates who say that these C.E.O.'s did little to earn their paper wealth. Still, it may be years before executives are able to actually reap the proceeds of those grants, because of vesting requirements. 
 Mr. Feinberg has made it more than clear that he finds perks like private jets and private clubs to be particularly noxious -- and companies have apparently read that memo. According to Equilar, companies collectively cut the median annual perk award by 19 percent, to $170,487. The average fell by 14 percent, to $261,801.
 At the same time, companies in the Equilar survey were reluctant to increase the cash component of their compensation packages. Equilar says the median cash payout rose slightly, by 1 percent, to $3.1 million. The average fell by 5 percent, to $3.8 million. ''We've seen some companies that switched over to cash because equity was too volatile,'' says Aaron Boyd, the research manager of Equilar. 
 FOR all of these signs that a real reordering of executive compensation may be under way, some analysts wonder whether the Obama administration will abandon its pay crusade. 
 ''We have a long history of episodes like this in depressions and recessions where everybody talks about reform,'' says Kevin J. Murphy, a business professor at the University of Southern California. A few years go by, he says, and then you wonder, ''What were those reforms again?''
 Mr. Murphy says he's not only skeptical that reforms will be enacted, he is also skeptical that they do any good at all.
 But Mr. Feinberg cautions that companies banking on the public's short attention span do so at their own peril. ''There is a tremendous amount of populist outrage and frustration in this,'' he warns. 
 Indeed, there have been fierce exchanges between activist investors and business supporters over a provision in both the House and Senate financial reform bills that could make it easier for shareholders to vote their own directors onto boards. 
 In February, conservative groups including the Christian Coalition warned Congress that the proposed measures would enable union operatives and animal-rights activists to win board seats.
 Shareholder advocates, however, are hopeful that they will prevail. ''It looks like the Democrats are holding firm on that,'' says Mr. Davis of Yale. ''If that's traded away, there will be enormous disappointment in the investment community.''
 IF ever a C.E.O. would have seemed impervious to the administration's calls for pay reform, it is Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, the highest-paid chief executive in the Equilar survey. He made $85 million last year -- more than the combined pay of the second- and third-ranked C.E.O.'s, J. Raymond Elliott of Boston Scientific, with $33 million, and Ray R. Irani of Occidental Petroleum, with $31 million. Mr. Ellison took all but $6 million of his pay in stock options. 
 A billionaire many times over, Mr. Ellison has never been afraid to flaunt his wealth. Yet he made a sacrificial gesture last year that is a sign of the times: this year he plans to decline his $1 million base salary and take just $1 instead. (Oracle declined to comment on Mr. Ellison's pay.)
 Few of the other top-10 C.E.O.'s on the Equilar list are apparently willing to make such concessions. Many of them saw the cash portion of their pay decrease as their bonuses shrank, thanks to the recession. 
 Mark V. Hurd of Hewlett-Packard, the fourth-highest-paid C.E.O. on the Equilar chart, made $24 million in 2009 -- $18 million of which came in cash. William C. Weldon of Johnson & Johnson made $23 million -- $15 million of it in cash. Robert A. Iger of Walt Disney made $22 million -- $12 million in cash. 
 As usual, some C.E.O.'s in the Equilar survey seemed to have done more to earn their pay than others. For instance, Samuel J. Palmisano of I.B.M. made $21 million after he delivered a 9 percent net profit increase and helped oversee total shareholder returns of 58 percent. Jeffrey L. Bewkes of Time Warner made $19 million last year as he undid the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger by spinning AOL off as a separate public company. Mr. Bewkes got $14 million of his pay in cash. He might wish he had received more Time Warner shares, though. The total return on his company's stock was 21 percent in 2009.
 There also was a crop of C.E.O.'s who relinquished their cash bonuses or took voluntary pay cuts because of a recession that devastated many customers, employees and shareholders. 
 Some of those who gave up their pay, however, didn't seem to have any qualms about taking it later in the year after their boards had a change of heart.
 Howard Schultz of Starbucks requested last year that his base salary be reduced from $1.19 million to $6,900 as ''a personal contribution to cost-control efforts,'' according to a company statement. However, the company later gave him a $1 million ''discretionary bonus'' that nearly made up for his sacrifice.
 ''Mr. Schultz's performance greatly exceeded the board of directors' expectations,'' the company said in a statement.
 At Hewlett-Packard, Mr. Hurd took a 20 percent salary cut early last year. But H.P. ended up giving him a $1.18 million discretionary bonus that restored the pay cut, a sum that also included extra cash the board approved to enhance Mr. Hurd's regular bonus plan.
 That left some analysts wondering whether H.P. had weakened the link between bonuses and performance. 
 ''If they didn't feel the incentive plans they had in place were rewarding this executive well enough, isn't it about time they redesigned the bonus plan?'' asked Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm. ''This is the third year in a row that H.P. gave its C.E.O. a discretionary bonus. Maybe it's time for a new compensation committee.''
 Gina Giamanco Tyler, an H.P. spokeswoman, said the company had ''an effective pay-for-performance compensation model.''
 U.S. Bancorp's C.E.O., Richard K. Davis, who made $7 million last year, was also the beneficiary of corporate largess. He initially declined his $1 million cash bonus because of his company's poor results in 2008, the ''depressed level'' of its stock price and ''the general economic performance,'' according to a U.S. Bancorp filing.
 However, Mr. Davis would not go without the money for long. The bank's board ended up reversing itself and paying him the bonus after all. Jennifer Wendt, a U.S. Bancorp spokeswoman, said that the directors thought he deserved the money because the bank had a good year and paid back its TARP aid.
 AMONG the C.E.O.'s of TARP recipients last year, 12 are on the Equilar list, including Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America, Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, John G. Stumpf of Wells Fargo, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Jamie L. Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express.
 According to Equilar, the median pay for this group was $6 million in 2009, a 34 percent decrease from 2008. The median stock and options portion of their pay plummeted 94 percent and 92 percent, respectively. But the median cash payout for the group rose 20 percent. 
 Mr. Lewis, who has stepped down, was the second-lowest-paid C.E.O. on the Equilar list, with $32,171 in cash. The only chief executive who made less was Steven P. Jobs of Apple, who collects a $1 salary and nothing more. (Mr. Jobs, of course, also owns more than a $1 billion worth of Apple stock.)
 Mr. Pandit of Citigroup was the third-lowest-paid of the Equilar 200, at $128,751. He announced partway through the year that he would take just a $1 salary for the remainder of the year and no bonus until his bank returned to profitability, which it did not do in 2009. His pay last year was entirely in cash.
 Mr. Blankfein, meanwhile, was the survey's seventh-lowest-paid chief executive. He made $862,657 in cash, which includes $262,657 in perks for things like car expenses and financial counseling.
 The highest-paid banker on the list, Mr. Stumpf of Wells Fargo, was paid nearly $19 million. He vaulted past his better-known peers last year by closely following the Obama administration's compensation blueprint. 
 Last June, the Treasury Department appointed Mr. Feinberg and issued interim rules for compensation at TARP companies. It mandated a $500,000 salary cap for executives at the largest TARP recipients, saying any additional pay be awarded as long-term restricted stock.
 Wells Fargo, which received TARP aid, layered $4.7 million worth of stock on top of Mr. Stumpf's $900,000 cash base salary, bringing his total salary up to $5.6 million.
 ''If you want an almost perfect example of unintended consequences, this is it,'' says Mr. Hodgson of the Corporate Library. 
 Wells awarded Mr. Stumpf an additional $13 million in stock, making his total compensation $19 million. 
 A Wells spokeswoman said Mr. Stumpf deserved his raise, in part because he now presided over a bank that was twice as big as it was the previous year after acquiring Wachovia. Wells repaid its TARP aid in December.
 Goldman Sachs, which returned its TARP aid last summer, said late last year that it would pay a ''vast majority'' of its senior managers' pay in stock that cannot be sold for five years. The bank can force employees to return pay if they engage in ''materially improper risk analysis or failed sufficiently to raise concerns about risks'' -- a policy known as a clawback. Goldman also said it would have a nonbinding say-on-pay vote at its 2010 annual meeting. 
 Analysts say that other companies are making similar moves, though some more tepidly than others. Equilar says that the percentage of Fortune 100 firms that disclosed clawbacks last year rose to 73 percent from 64 percent. Some of the largest companies in the nation have also adopted similar say-on-pay provisions.
 Few of these initiatives, however, go as far as those at Goldman. Equilar says that most clawbacks occur only if top executives engage in unethical conduct or misdeeds that result in financial misstatements. Some of these recently unveiled say-on-pay initiatives are also weaker than one would expect. Prudential, for example, allows say-on-pay votes only every other year. ''We talked to a lot of our institutional investors and pension funds,'' said a Prudential spokesman. ''They said every year would be a lot of work for them. They said every other year would be adequate.''
 Microsoft's say-on-pay ballots are cast only once every three years. ''Our compensation program is designed to induce and reward performance over a multiyear period,'' Microsoft wrote online last year. ''Say-on-pay votes should occur over similar timeframe.''
 CHARLES M. ELSON, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, says such limited measures are just window dressing corporations deploy to keep regulators from imposing tougher reforms. ''I've always supported clawbacks, but they are almost impossible to enforce,'' he says. ''Unfortunately, I think say-on-pay is pointless.''
 Both the House and the Senate financial reform bills could require public companies to have annual say-on-pay votes. The bills include a ''proxy access'' rule to make it easier for shareholders to get their own candidates elected to boards.
 ''We are looking at the first time across the American marketplace at an environment where shareholders will have real authority to hire and fire directors,'' says Mr. Davis of Yale. ''If companies ignore a vote on say-on-pay, a shareholder majority would have the right to remove the directors who failed to listen.''
 Corporate America is dead set against this. The United States Chamber of Commerce says that proxy access would give extreme groups the ability to meddle in broad corporate decisions.
 ''This is something that isn't about better corporate governance,'' says Thomas Quaadman, the executive director of the chamber's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. ''This is about activists being put at the head of the line.''
 Even if enhanced proxy access is eliminated from the bills, the Senate version also includes an amendment sponsored by Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, that would offer a revealing compensation barometer: a requirement that public companies disclose median wage for their workers along with their chief executive's compensation.
 Asked why he thought this was important, Mr. Menendez quoted the Supreme Court justice Louis D. Brandeis: ''Sunlight is the best disinfectant.''

HEADLINE: Cars Starved (or Stuffed) for Attention

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
THE Tango electric commuter car is a conversation piece wherever it appears, including the Detroit auto show in January, and last fall Jay Leno took one for a highly publicized test drive. 
 The Tango is a yard-wide one-seater -- the State of California classifies it as a motorcycle -- that got a lift a few years ago from early adopters like the actor George Clooney and Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google.
 The oh-so-narrow Tango may seem radically different, but it follows the precedent of other very thin cars. For instance, Volkswagen showed its skinny L1 diesel-electric hybrid -- said to be capable of 160 miles per gallon -- at the Frankfurt auto show last fall. At the 2009 Tokyo auto show, Nissan showed the Land Glider, a narrow concept car that leans on turns like a motorcycle. 
 Another slimmed-down car -- a piece of art -- was recently seen at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Called ''La DS,'' it was included in a retrospective of works by the Mexican artist Gabriel Orozco. The exhibition has moved from New York to Switzerland, where it opens on April 18 at the Kunstmuseum in Basel. The show will later move to the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the Tate Modern in London.
 The artwork is a highly modified Citroen DS, a car that the French nicknamed La Deesse -- or ''the goddess.'' Roland Barthes, the French theorist and semiologist, once praised the iconic Citroen as a contemporary cathedral. 
 In 1993, Mr. Orozco took a silver DS, removed the engine and sliced two feet out of the middle. The result is a ''car'' not quite 45 inches wide. (The VW L1's width is 49 inches, the Land Glider's 43 and the Tango's just 39.)
 The Citroen DS is a symbol of national pride in France, and Mr. Orozco's manipulation of it is a commentary -- a bit of wry blasphemy against the goddess, like pasting a mustache on the Statue of Liberty. Like the Tango, ''La DS'' is so skinny it seems to trick the eye.
 A news release for the MoMA show said Mr. Orozco ''deliberately blurs the boundaries between the art object and the everyday environment.'' He had previously said that in making the piece his idea was ''to deconstruct a cultural icon that is not just an icon, because it is also a machine that has a function, and to remake it on its own logic.'' 
 While thin is in, for automobiles as well as fashion models, an Austrian artist seems to demonstrate that cars are so full of themselves that they are about to burst out of their skins.
 The artist, Erwin Wurm, made his Fat Cars as puffy, obese, life-size sculptures that bulge like overfilled sacks. Like the thin cars, they undercut the iconic qualities of certain cars -- to transform a svelte Porsche into a pudgy roadster, as he has done, is a joke in itself. 
 The Fat Cars seem to poke fun at pomposity. Mr. Wurm has also done Fat Houses, mocking oversize homes. In 2002, he persuaded curators to put pillows inside their clothing and walk about art galleries -- literally making fun of stuffed shirts.
 Born in 1954, Mr. Wurm has a history of unusual artworks. His One Minute Sculptures was a bit of performance art created by museum visitors who agreed to serve as models for 60 seconds. 
 The Fat Cars have been shown around the world, including stops in Moscow, San Francisco and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.
 Mr. Wurm exhibits at the Aurel Scheibler gallery in Berlin, the Galerie Krinzinger in Vienna and the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in New York, where a Wurm show is planned for the fall.
 For his first Fat Car, Mr. Wurm worked with Opel designers, but found the result less than satisfactory. He told an interviewer in Austria, Peter Zuspan, that his idea was to combine something like a biological system with a mechanical one. But Opel's computerized design equipment could not produce the kind of ''natural'' rounded shapes that he wanted, he said. Instead, Mr. Wurm ended up using only the chassis of an actual car. The ''fat'' was polyurethane foam and Styrofoam covered with lacquer. The ''Fat Convertible'' came in 2004 and a car with no wheels, ''UFO,'' in 2006.
 Just as cars may be on the cusp of fundamental change -- with batteries perhaps supplanting the internal-combustion engine -- artists seem to be rethinking the automobile as a symbol.
 And Mr. Wurm's corpulent creations may symbolize something more to automotive engineers who can't sleep at night because of looming fuel economy standards. For those sweating to shave a milligram here and a quarter-ounce there from coming models, Fat Cars could be their worst nightmare.

KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -- In less time than it might take to accompany her 2-year-old daughter to the playground, Kim Clijsters was dominant in her other job Saturday, dismissing Venus Williams in less than an hour to win the Sony Ericsson Open.
 Since her return to professional tennis last summer, Clijsters has been far more economical with her time on the court, and she was again in beating Williams, 6-2, 6-1, in 58 minutes to win her second title here. It was Clijsters's third tournament championship since she began her highly successful comeback last year. 
 ''Now I have to make sure I still get enough time to focus when I'm playing matches and working on my weaknesses and everything,'' she said. ''But I also need my time at home or in the hotel, or wherever we are, to be with Jada.''
 Clijsters's comeback began last August after two and a half years off to start a family with her husband, Brian Lynch. By September, she had won the United States Open, defeating Venus and Serena Williams along the way. In January, she won the Brisbane tuneup for the Australian Open, and now she has won here for the first time since 2005. 
 Williams, seeming out of sorts and uncomfortable all match, was looking to win in Key Biscayne for the fourth time and for the first time since 2001, which was her last appearance in a final at this premier tour stop.
 But early on, it was clear she was struggling to stay in the match. After the first game of the match, she had extra tape applied to her left knee and her right thigh. 
 She was broken at 1-1 and was never able to refocus her energy and resolve, making numerous errors and appearingunsettled. 
 She had more unforced errors (30) than points won (29), and she never had a break point. 
 ''Today wasn't my best day physically,'' she said. ''To fight errors and not feel your best, it's really a mental battle.'' 
 Serena Williams, who sat out the tournament with a knee injury, watched from the photographers' pit, but she could offer only words of encouragement to her struggling sister, who seemed resigned to the eventual result. 
 She said it was just not her day. 
 ''Sometimes when you hit a few bad shots, it's not as easy to reel it in, and things start to go a little bit quicker,'' said Williams, who came into the final on a 15-match winning streak, including consecutive titles in Dubai and Acapulco. 
 ''Every now and then, it happens to the best of us.''
 Clijsters, too, has had days like that since her return. She won the three tournaments, but she also lost in the early rounds in Luxembourg last fall, at the Australian Open in January and at Indian Wells, Calif., just before arriving here two weeks ago.
 It seems she is holding up a trophy or leaving after the second round, a function perhaps of playing a limited schedule because of her responsibilities as a mother. At the same time, she said she was striking the ball with as much authority as ever.
 With Saturday's victory, Clijsters will jump to No. 10 from No. 16 in the world rankings. But reaching No. 1 will be difficult because the rankings system favors players who compete in more tournaments.
 As she shifts her focus back home to Belgium and the clay-court season in Europe, Clijsters will continue to play a limited schedule. 
 Clay has not been her best surface, but she said she was looking forward to that challenge, as well as something else.
 ''I look forward to going home and being the house mom,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Striking Gold in Stock Options

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
WERE they smart, or just lucky? 
 As the stock market dived in late 2008 and early 2009, chief executives of the biggest American companies received their annual grants of stock and options, and the timing couldn't have been better.
 The subsequent rally has benefited nearly all investors, but for a select group of C.E.O.'s who were fortunate enough to get options, it has created a windfall. And while much of the attention has focused on the pay for executives at banks, a sector that enjoyed a back-from-the-dead performance last year, many of the biggest winners from options were C.E.O.'s at nonfinancial companies.
 Some executives on the top rungs of corporate America, including Alan Mulally of Ford Motor, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, have seen the value of their 2009 options packages double, triple and quadruple -- and, in Mr. Mulally's case, jump nearly 10 times in value, to more than $50 million.
 In most cases, they can't cash in now: options typically take three to four years to fully vest. But the gains have set off renewed criticism that C.E.O. compensation is out of control, especially in a year plagued by the recession and high unemployment. 
 ''You're going to see big numbers and people are going to squawk about it, as they should,'' said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. ''There was concern at the time about unjustified returns, and that's what happened. They clearly took advantage of the timing.''
 Not so fast, say other pay experts, who argue that the first quarter, and occasionally the fourth quarter, are typically the time when stock and option grants are made, regardless of how the stock market is performing.
 ''They had no way to know the market would begin to recover in March,'' said Carol Bowie, head of the governance institute at the RiskMetrics Group, a financial analytics company. ''The fact of the matter is that many, many companies grant awards at the beginning of the year. It turned out to be an opportune time, but it's not necessarily untoward.''
 Nevertheless, the outsize gains from stock and options last year are likely to fuel what's already a fierce debate about executive pay levels. 
 What's more, companies like Ford, Starbucks, Dow, Whirlpool and American Express were making deep job cuts even as they showered options on their chief executives.
 ''It reinforces the view that the rules of the game are rigged and that no matter what these guys do, they always come out ahead,'' said Sarah Anderson, who tracks executive pay at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group in Washington. ''In a time of national crisis, it wasn't appropriate to be giving out boatloads of new stock options.''
 For all the criticism of the options windfall, it's worth noting that some pay experts have argued for years that chief executives should receive more options and stock, rather than cash, in order to link their pay to long-term corporate performance.
 But in a twist, the options packages have proved incredibly lucrative in the short term. The gains, Mr. Elson said, weren't based on corporate performance but simply reflect the broad market rebound.
 AMONG 200 C.E.O.'s of companies tracked by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm that analyzed data for The New York Times, the biggest beneficiary of an options grant and subsequent stock market rally was Mr. Mulally at Ford.
 On March 11, 2009, two days after the Dow Jones industrial average hit a 12-year low of 6,547, Mr. Mulally received options to buy five million shares of Ford at $1.96, which the company estimated would be worth just over $5 million, using a complicated formula to predict their eventual value. The company usually grants options in March. 
 A year later, the market is up more than 60 percent, but Ford shares are worth nearly 10 times what they were then, making Mr. Mulally's options worth an estimated $53.3 million, according to Equilar. Mr. Mulally was eligible to receive the first batch on March 27 -- worth more than $17 million -- and is set to receive the rest within two years.
 Defenders of Mr. Mulally argue that Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers not to file for bankruptcy last year; it actually earned a profit for the full year. But critics say an award of that size is still inappropriate, especially given the huge job cuts at Ford over the last few years.
 ''The sector is going through hard times,'' Ms. Anderson said. ''For workers, it's demoralizing to see that kind of money going into executives' pockets when jobs are being cut.''
 A spokesman for Ford, Mark Truby, said Mr. Mulally's options award was based on Ford's long-term performance. ''The ultimate value of these options will depend on how Ford's stock performs over the next two years,'' he said. Mr. Mulally, he added, took a 30 percent cut in salary in 2009 and 2010, and did not receive a cash bonus for 2008 and 2009. 
 ''The vast majority of his compensation is at risk and tied directly to the performance of the company and the stock,'' Mr. Truby said. 
 A corporate comeback and great timing also drove gains of the second-biggest options winner among the executives in the survey: Mr. Schultz of Starbucks. 
 Mr. Schultz built his company into a nationwide brand and oversaw its explosive growth in the 1990s but stepped down as chief executive in 2000. In early 2008, he returned to the top amid flagging earnings and complaints that Starbucks had lost its way.
 On Nov. 17, 2008, as Starbucks shares neared lows not seen since the beginning of the decade, he received options to buy 2.7 million shares at $8.64 as part of his 2009 compensation, in an award the company estimated would eventually be worth $12.4 million.
 It was a painful period for the company -- in early 2009, Starbucks announced it would cut thousands of jobs and close 300 stores -- but the fortunes of the chain and Mr. Schultz have improved greatly since then. Thanks to more traffic in the stores and renewed earnings growth, shares of Starbucks have risen above $24 a share, making his options package worth $42.3 million.
 It's a venti-size gain, though he will have to wait four years for the options to fully vest. In a statement, the company defended the award. 
 ''Mr. Schultz led the company in numerous initiatives that resulted in permanent improvements throughout the business,'' Starbucks said. ''Starbucks' stock price has increased significantly to the benefit of all Starbucks shareholders.'' The company also said the timing of Mr. Schultz's award was set long before Starbucks' shares reached new lows.
 It wasn't just the surging stock prices that created huge paydays for some executives. As share prices declined, said Mr. Elson of the Center for Corporate Governance, many companies pumped up the number of options they doled out to make up for any possible loss in value. 
 For example, James M. Cracchiolo, the C.E.O. of Ameriprise Financial, received an options package worth $9.1 million in 2009, nearly identical to the value of his options award in 2008. But instead of giving him options on 656,535 shares as it did in 2008, the board gave him options on more than a million shares last year. (The company's stock had declined to $21.34 from $52.86.)
 ''Everything fell dramatically, but to make up for the fall, they loaded up in stock,'' said Mr. Elson. ''They ended up benefiting from the bear market.'' 
 Indeed, the projected value of Mr. Cracchiolo's 2009 options package has nearly tripled, and now totals more than$25 million. A spokesman for Ameriprise declined to comment.
 Some options packages had a lower price tag than in past years, but the executives were still getting a raise: the number of shares soared, setting up outsize paydays. Although the estimated value of the options package awarded to Craig A. Dubow, the C.E.O. of Gannett, declined to $585,000 in 2009 from $817,800 in 2008, the number of underlying shares more than doubled, to 500,000 from 235,000.
 It was a worthwhile trade-off. Like many media companies, Gannett has been hit by the recession and migration of ad dollars from newspapers to the Internet. But its stock has rallied from lows of last year after cost cuts aided profitability. With its shares trading at $16.70-- up from $3.75 when the options were granted in February 2009 -- Mr. Dubow's options package is worth $6.5 million, more than 10 times the initial valuation. 
 For Richard K. Templeton, the C.E.O. of Texas Instruments, total compensation of $9.9 million in 2009 barely budged from his overall pay in 2008. But he, too, benefited from a big increase in the number of options doled out. 
 The estimated value of his 2009 options award -- $3.6 million -- was one-third more than the one in 2008, but the number of underlying shares jumped from 270,000 to 664,461. That package is now worth $6.4 million. 
 A spokeswoman for Texas Instruments responded that the increase in value came from a rise in the stock price, not simply more shares, and that all employees with options grants benefited from that, not just Mr. Templeton.
 Unlike past market rallies, when technology and financial companies soared but industrial names languished, this one has had big winners among old-economy names like Dow Chemical and Whirlpool. And the bigger the stock bounce, the faster the value of the options appreciated.
 For Mr. Liveris of Dow Chemical, that meant an options package that has jumped nearly eight times in value, to nearly $19 million from $2.4 million in February 2009. The options grant for Jeff M. Fettig of Whirlpool has risen in value to $16.8 million from $1.9 million. 
 These gains came on the heels of big job cuts, though, with Dow and Whirlpool each eliminating roughly 5,000 jobs in 2009. The companies declined to comment.
 AMERICAN EXPRESS doled out another rich options package, even as it cut 4,000 jobs last year and got financial help from the government in the financial crisis. The 2009 options of its C.E.O., Kenneth I. Chenault, are now worth $29.9 million, up from $3.9 million when awarded in January 2009.
 A spokeswoman for American Express declined to comment but cited its proxy, which notes that it was the single best performer last year among the Dow Jones industrials, delivering a 125 percent return to shareholders.
 American Express was also among the first financial firms to repay the federal aid, the proxy said, with the Treasury winding up with a 26 percent gain.
 Given the stock market's rapid run-up since March 2009, it's unlikely that future options awards will prove as lucrative as they were last year. But the options packages of 2009 will most likely be a gift that keeps on giving as they vest between now and 2013.
 ''C.E.O.'s are looking at big gains,'' said Aaron Boyd, head of research at Equilar. ''Even if stock prices stay level for the next couple of years, some of these executives are still going to get a large payout.''

HEADLINE: A White House Handoff

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For years, Bill Clinton tried to negotiate an arms control treaty for the post-cold-war era. He and Boris Yeltsin even agreed on a framework for a new Start treaty in Helsinki. But it never came to be. So when President Obama flies to Prague this week to sign a New Start treaty with Russia, it will culminate Mr. Clinton's unfulfilled aspiration.
 Nine years after Mr. Clinton left office, Mr. Obama has in some ways picked up his Democratic predecessor's mantle. While they are very different presidents and not personally close, at least some of the unfinished agenda items left from the Clinton administration have found their way to the top of the Obama priority list. And the 44th president is arguably profiting from the work, and the setbacks, of the 42nd president. 
 The treaty to be signed this week and the health care overhaul signed into law last month represent the most obvious examples. But Mr. Obama also pushed through an economic stimulus package last year, which Mr. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to do in his first year. Mr. Obama has drawn bipartisan support for lifting the ban on gay men and lesbians' serving openly in the military, an idea that backfired on Mr. Clinton. And where Mr. Clinton never submitted the Kyoto treaty to a hostile Senate, Mr. Obama is pushing forward with climate change legislation that has a shot at passing.
 Other presidents have built on the policy agendas of predecessors. George W. Bush fashioned his presidency as an extension of Ronald Reagan's, especially in cutting taxes. And Franklin D. Roosevelt completed the legacy of Woodrow Wilson, particularly in building a lasting international organization with American participation.
 ''Every great progressive era, if you look at history, begins with somebody hitting the barricades first and the other person establishing that progressive agenda and coalition,'' said Rahm Emanuel, who was a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton and is now Mr. Obama's White House chief of staff.
 Such was the case with health care, 16 years after Mr. Clinton's effort collapsed, he said. ''Without '94 creating some space and some knowledge, the truth is 2010 could not have happened.'' Of course, the comparisons are imprecise and the times in which the two men governed are radically different. In the calm after the cold war, Mr. Clinton was trying to pull his party back to the political center after years in the wilderness, while Mr. Obama campaigned as a more liberal figure in a time of war, terrorism and economic crisis. And there are areas where Mr. Clinton's agenda has no need for continuation. Mr. Clinton's success in reshaping welfare, pushing through free trade policies and enacting a tougher approach to crime arguably took those issues off the table for Mr. Obama.
 ''Clinton's problem was trying to change the system during a time of peace and prosperity,'' said H. W. Brands, a presidential historian who has written books on Wilson and F.D.R. ''Americans are status quo friendly; if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Obama's opportunity was to arrive when the status quo had been jolted and, in the eyes of many, discredited.''
 Still, Republicans are confident that Mr. Obama has learned the wrong lessons from Mr. Clinton, and that he will ultimately see his party suffer at the polls as well.
 ''Certainly he achieved a legislative success that Clinton was unable to reach and that has given them confidence and momentum,'' said Robert Walker, a former Republican representative from Pennsylvania. ''But the problem they've got is the only momentum is with their own base. For independents, the real issues are the debt and deficit. And some of the programs he's putting forward are exacerbating the problem.''
 As he pursues initiatives that echo the Clinton era, Mr. Obama is benefiting from a changed society.
 Attitudes toward gays in the military have shifted since Mr. Clinton's time. Then, the chairman of the joint chiefs, Gen. Colin L. Powell, opposed lifting the ban. Now, the chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, supports lifting the ban. And so does General Powell, who has changed his mind, not to mention former Vice President Dick Cheney.
 But by paving the way on some of these issues, Mr. Clinton provided a roadmap for Mr. Obama. On gays in the military, for instance, Mr. Obama was careful not to tackle the issue from the start, as Mr. Clinton did much to his regret because it blew up in his face and he was forced to accept the compromise known as don't ask, don't tell.
 ''Rather than rushing into top-down change, the Obama White House has carefully mobilized support within the military leadership and has created a process of consultation designed to mute complaints that change is being rammed through,'' said William A. Galston, a former Clinton adviser now at the Brookings Institution.
 On health care, some like Mr. Galston argued that Mr. Obama took the Clinton lesson too far by giving Congress too much free reign. But Mr. Obama succeeded in part because Democratic lawmakers saw what happened when Mr. Clinton failed and they lost their majorities.
 ''The lesson many Democrats took from the Clinton experience 1993 and 1994 is that failure to lead guarantees election losses,'' said Steve Elmendorf, a longtime Democratic strategist.
 And Democrats learned, perhaps, to be bold. The later Clinton years showed ''that even the most worthwhile incremental changes, like expansion of children's health insurance, can't get at the root economic dysfunctionality of the current system,'' said John D. Podesta, who was Mr. Clinton's last chief of staff and later led Mr. Obama's transition after the 2008 election.
 That applies overseas as well. Strobe Talbott, who was Mr. Clinton's deputy secretary of state and main interlocutor with Russia, noted the different contexts the two presidents faced. ''That said, there's no question that the main themes and exertions of the Clinton foreign policy did lay a groundwork for what Obama's trying to do,'' he said, citing arms control, nonproliferation, strengthening international institutions ''and, for that matter, climate change.''
 The danger, naturally, is to draw too much from the Clinton experience.
 ''You have to be careful not to overlearn old lessons,'' said Joel P. Johnson, a former senior adviser to Mr. Clinton. ''The times and circumstances have changed dramatically. But certain fundamentals remain the same, and past mistakes provide present insights. It's the rough equivalent of studying game films in the N.F.L.''

HEADLINE: Censored in Singapore

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
LAST month, on the same day The New York Times praised Google for standing up to censorship in China, a sister newspaper, The International Herald Tribune, apologized to Singapore's rulers and agreed to pay damages because it broke a 1994 legal agreement and referred to them in a way they did not like.
 The rulers had sued for defamation 16 years ago, saying a Herald Tribune Op-Ed column had implied that they got their jobs through nepotism. The paper wound up paying $678,000 and promising not to do it again. But in February, it named Lee Kuan Yew, the founding prime minister, and his son, Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister now, in an Op-Ed article about Asian political dynasties.
 After the Lees objected, the paper said its language ''may have been understood by readers to infer that the younger Mr. Lee did not achieve his position through merit. We wish to state clearly that this inference was not intended.'' The Herald Tribune, wholly owned by The New York Times Company, apologized for ''any distress or embarrassment'' suffered by the Lees. The statement was published in the paper and on the Web site it shares with The Times. 
 Some readers were astonished that a news organization with a long history of standing up for First Amendment values would appear to bow obsequiously to an authoritarian regime that makes no secret of its determination to cow critics, including Western news organizations, through aggressive libel actions. Singapore's leaders use a local court system in which, according to Stuart Karle, a former general counsel of The Wall Street Journal, they have never lost a libel suit.
 The notion that it could be defamatory to call a political family a dynasty seems ludicrous in the United States, where The Times has routinely applied the label to the Kennedys, the Bushes and the Clintons. But Singapore is a different story.
 Lee Kuan Yew once testified, according to The Times, that he designed the draconian press laws to make sure that ''journalists will not appear to be all-wise, all-powerful, omnipotent figures.'' Four years ago, The Times quoted his son as saying, ''If you don't have the law of defamation, you would be like America, where people say terrible things about the president and it can't be proved.''
 Steven Brostoff of Arlington, Va., wondered whether The Times had other agreements like the one with the Lees, and asked, ''What conclusions should we draw about how news coverage from these countries is slanted?'' Zeb Raft of the University of Alberta, Edmonton, asked if The Times was admitting that certain world leaders ''deserve to be treated with deference. This is the implication of the apology.''
 George Freeman, a Times Company lawyer, said the 1994 agreement was the only one he knew about and that it applied only to The Herald Tribune. Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, said, ''Nobody in this company has ever told me what our reporters can write -- or not write -- about Singapore.'' He said the Times newsroom has no agreements with any government about what can be reported. ''We don't work that way.''
 Andrew Rosenthal, the editor of the editorial page, said, ''If we have something that needs to be said on the editorial or Op-Ed pages, on any subject, we will say it, clearly and honestly.'' 
 That is what the late William Safire did on the Op-Ed page in 2002, when he criticizedBloomberg News for ''kowtowing to the Lee family'' by apologizing for an article about the elevation of the younger Lee's wife to run a state-owned investment company. Bloomberg, he said, had ''just demeaned itself and undermined the cause of a free online press.''
 Safire wrote that he took ''loud exception'' in 1994 when The Herald Tribune, then owned jointly by the Times Company and The Washington Post Company, ''cravenly caved'' over an article by Philip Bowring -- the same Hong Kong-based columnist who sparked last month's dust-up. ''I doubt such a sellout of principle will happen again.'' 
 Richard Simmons was the president of The Herald Tribune in 1994 and authorized the agreement that was broken last month -- an ''undertaking'' by the company's lawyers to prevent a repetition of the language that offended the Lees. ''We had, in my view, no choice,'' he said. ''What the American media absolutely refuse to recognize is Singapore operates on a different set of legal rules than does the United States.'' He said Western news organizations can accept the legal system there or leave.
 For The Herald Tribune and all the other news organizations that have paid damages to Singapore's rulers (The Wall Street Journal, The Economist, Bloomberg) or had their circulation limited there (Time, The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Economist), the choice has been to stay. 
 Singapore is tiny, with a population of around five million, but it has outsized economic power as a financial hub, making it an important source of news. For The Herald Tribune, the economic stakes are large: more than 10 percent of its Asian circulation is in Singapore. It prints papers there that are distributed throughout the region. It sells advertising to companies throughout Asia that want to reach readers in Singapore. 
 ''If you want to be a global paper, it has lots of banks, lots of commerce, a highly educated, English-speaking population,'' said Karle. ''It's hard to turn your back on that.''
 Faced with this predicament when the Lees objected to the article last month, The Herald Tribune apologized and paid up -- $114,000 -- before it was even sued. Karle said the paper could have spent a million dollars for a worse result in court: forced to pay higher damages and make a more humiliating apology.
 But settling the way it did has its own price. Roby Alampay, the executive director of the Southeast Asian Press Alliance, told Agence France-Presse, ''This continuing line of major media organizations too quick to offer contrition and money is a sad sight and a persisting insult on legitimate journalism, fair commentary, free speech and the rights that Singaporeans deserve.''
 Safire toldThe American Journalism Review in 1995 that the world's free press should unite and pull out of Singapore in the face of any new libel action. I think that is what should happen too, but it never has.
 That leaves the Times Company with its own choice if another challenge arises. ''Singapore is an important market for The International Herald Tribune,'' the company told me in a statement. ''There are more than 12,000 I.H.T. readers who shouldn't be deprived of the right to read the paper in print or online. In addition, getting kicked out of Singapore would also make it more difficult for others in the region to get the I.H.T. since we print in Singapore for distribution there and in the neighboring areas.''
 Google faced a similar painful dilemma in China. With potentially billions of dollars at risk, it stuck to its principles, and The Times applauded editorially. I think Google set an example for everyone who believes in the free flow of information.

HEADLINE: City Endorses New Policy For Treatment of H.I.V.

BYLINE: By SABIN RUSSELL

 BODY:
In a major shift of H.I.V. treatment policy, San Francisco public health doctors have begun to advise patients to start taking antiviral medicines as soon as they are found to be infected, rather than waiting -- sometimes years -- for signs that their immune systems have started to fail.
 The new, controversial city guidelines, to be announced next week by the Department of Public Health, may be the most forceful anywhere in their endorsement of early treatment against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
Ever since combinations of antiviral drugs were found to slow progression of the disease in the mid-1990s, doctors and patients have wrestled with the question of when to begin a lifetime regimen of costly and sometimes toxic medicines. The answer remains in dispute, but public health leaders here are now making a case for a change. 
 Behind the policy switch is mounting evidence that patients who start early are more likely to live longer, and less likely to suffer a variety of ailments -- including heart disease, kidney failure and cancer -- that plague long-term survivors. Studies suggest that in the early years of infection, when a patient may show few signs of immune system failure, the virus is in fact causing permanent damage that becomes evident later. 
 For instance, in older patients who finally start taking the drugs, the effects of chronic inflammation take their toll.
 ''The impact on health risk is comparable to that of diabetes,'' said Dr. Steven G. Deeks, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. ''Their immune system may look like that of someone 30 years older.''
 Dr. Diane V. Havlir, chief of the H.I.V./AIDS division at San Francisco General Hospital, said the new policy was already in effect for her patients. Although a decision whether or not to take the medicine rests with the patient, all those testing positive for H.I.V. will be offered combination therapy, with advice to pursue it.
 ''The history of H.I.V. disease has always been about change,'' she said. ''We pride ourselves on working quickly with new data.''
 At the public hospital's H.I.V. clinic, a 30-year-old man is mulling advice from Dr. C. Bradley Hare to start on antiviral drugs. He was infected four years ago, but his T-cell count, a measure of infection-fighting white blood cells, is 735, comparable to that of an uninfected, healthy adult. He is buff and athletic and feels good. 
 The man has decided to keep waiting. ''Once you start the drugs, you can't stop,'' he said. ''You know how they say, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it?' ''
 Dr. Hare has been following research on early treatment, and for the last several years he has asked his patients to think about it. Now, he is recommending it outright. He said most of his patients did not have serious problems with drug side effects.
 ''A lot of times they have a sense of relief when they start the meds,'' he said.
 The turning point in San Francisco's thinking may have been a study in The New England Journal of Medicine on April 1, 2009, that compared death rates among thousands of North American H.I.V. patients. Dr. Mari Kitahata, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, and her team of researchers found that patients who put off therapy until their immune system showed signs of damage had a nearly twofold greater risk of dying -- from any cause -- than those who started treatment when their T-cell counts were above 500.
 There is another motivation prompting the change. Reducing the level of virus in the population of infected people may reduce the spread of the disease.
 ''I do anticipate it will drive down the rates of new infections,'' Dr. Mitchell H. Katz, San Francisco director of public health, said. ''It's a nice, secondary benefit of this new policy.''
 Dr. Katz said that despite cuts in health budgets, a policy to add to the number of H.I.V. patients taking expensive drugs made economic sense. ''H.I.V. medications have been continually proven to be cost effective,'' he said, ''and in this case, it is also the right thing to do.'' 
 The program is being carried out without a clear picture of its cost to city and state health agencies. Antiviral drugs can cost $12,000 a year, consuming $350 million of the budget of California AIDS Drug Assistance Plan.
 Dr. Michelle Roland, chief of the state's Office of AIDS, said she and her counterparts across the country were working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to estimate the added cost of early treatment. 
 In San Francisco, up to 2,000 people know they are H.I.V. positive, have healthy T-cell counts and are not yet on treatment, according to the city. Cost estimates are complicated by unknowns, like the number of patients choosing to participate, how close they were to needing treatment under the previous system and whether they had private insurance. 
 When the first combinations of AIDS drugs came out in 1996, the thinking was ''hit early, and hit hard.'' But as patients battled nasty side effects, like diarrhea and disfiguring shifts in body fat, therapy was deferred until T-cell counts fell as low as 200.
 Today, with safer drugs, quick viral suppression is back in fashion.
 ''The field is moving, inexorably, to earlier and earlier therapy,'' said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He called San Francisco's decision ''an important step in that direction.'' 
 But the proposal is highly controversial, even in San Francisco.
 ''It's just too risky,'' said Dr. Jay Levy, the U.C.S.F. virologist who was among the first to identify the cause of AIDS. The new drugs may be less toxic, Dr. Levy said, but no one knows the effects of taking them for decades.
 San Francisco's decision follows a split vote in December by a 38-member federal panel on treatment guidelines. Only half of the H.I.V. experts gathered by the Department of Health and Human Services favored starting drugs in patients with healthy levels of more than 500 T-cells.
 One panel member, James D. Neaton of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, contends that a rigorous, randomized clinical trial is needed to show whether early intervention works. The risks of early treatment -- giving powerful drugs to people at low risk of disease -- - could outweigh the ''modest predicted benefit,'' Dr. Neaton wrote in an e-mail message. ''That is why we do randomized trials.'' 
 In 2009, the University of Minnesota began a study to find that proof. Results are expected in 2015.
 Dr. Lisa C. Capaldini, who runs an AIDS practice in the Castro district, also has strong reservations. ''H.I.V. behaves differently in different people,'' she said. 
 Although Dr. Capaldini recognizes that today's drugs are a vast improvement over earlier therapies, the program, she said ''is not ready for prime time.''
 But the changes make sense to Dr. Stephen Follansbee, director of H.I.V. Services for Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco, who oversees a program that covers 2,100 people with the virus. 
 ''The idea of living in happy symbiosis with this virus is delusional,'' Dr. Follansbee said. ''If you have a fire in one part of the house, but not in the living room, you don't wait for it to reach the living room before you call the fire department.''

HEADLINE: Richmond's New Priority: Taking Health Seriously

BYLINE: By DANIEL WEINTRAUB. 
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.

 BODY:
Daniel Weintraub has reported on California politics and policy for more than 20 years.
 Richmond has widespread poverty, a high crime rate and a reputation as a tough, gritty city. In a region that has been moving steadily from heavy industry to an economy dominated by information and services, Richmond remains home to a major oil refinery.
So it might come as a surprise that the city is leading the Bay Area into the future of urban planning. Richmond is close to adopting a new vision for itself that makes the health of its residents a top priority. 
 And this is not just some abstract document that will be circulated proudly among planning geeks at conferences while having no real effect on people's lives. It comes with a plan of action that promises to change life on the streets of Richmond and shape development for years to come.
 ''We definitely believe we are on the cutting edge of showing how a city can work on this level, in terms of its thinking, its planning, changing its policies to focus on the basic health needs of the community,'' Mayor Gayle McLaughlin said in a recent interview. ''We want to really turn around the years of pollution and neglect.''
 The plan lays out 10 goals that will be considered as part of nearly every city policy and be used to evaluate proposed housing, commercial and industrial developments.
 The broad hope is to create a walkable city where residents of all income levels have access to fresh fruits and vegetables, parks and open space, and good housing; where people strolling the sidewalks are safe from criminals and cars alike, and where the elderly and the disabled have access to public transportation that will take them to their medical appointments.
 These changes, city officials believe, will help reduce disparities between the health of Richmond's residents and those who live nearby under better conditions, and will even reduce the differences among Richmond's own neighborhoods.
 Richmond's poverty rate is double the average in Contra Costa County, and the city's residents have the county's highest death rate from diabetes, a higher-than-average rate of children with serious asthma, and the second-highest rates for hospitalizations resulting from mental illness and drug abuse. A resident of Richmond is three times more likely to be murdered than someone living across the bay in San Francisco.
 Much of this social dysfunction is concentrated in just a handful of the city's 35 neighborhoods. And two of those troubled neighborhoods -- the Northern Iron Triangle and Belding Woods -- are already part of a pilot project through which the city hopes to demonstrate how its new strategy will work in practice.
 Already, the city is making plans to improve parks, plant more trees along streets, enforce traffic rules more strictly and improve street lighting. Community gardens are popping up along a city greenbelt, the planning department is working on expanding farmers markets, and the city is cooperating with the county to ensure that every resident who is eligible for food stamps gets them.
 And when developers apply to build new projects in the city, the review will include an assessment of whether the proposals are consistent with the new goals, which will be part of the city's general plan.
 Mike Ghielmetti, president of Signature Properties and chairman of the Home Builders Association of Northern California, said he did not believe that science had shown a clear connection between housing and afflictions like obesity and asthma.
 Suburban neighborhoods of the 1950s were even less walkable than today's are, Mr. Ghielmetti said, but their residents were fitter.
 ''Why is new housing being tasked with something that is perceived to be a community burden?'' he asked.
 Mr. Ghielmetti suggested that cars, fast food, television shows and video games had more to do with obesity than housing and neighborhood design.
 ''They're going after the wrong party,'' he said, referring to Richmond officials.
 But Mayor McLaughlin said builders and others were going to have to get used to a new way of doing business in the city. ''We are moving away from depending on fossil fuels,'' she said.
 Some day, she said, that Chevron oil refinery on the waterfront will be obsolete. She would love to see it converted to supplying renewable fuels to the region. If not, it would be a ''very valuable piece'' of real estate. For a park, perhaps. Or a walkable neighborhood, with great views.
 ''We have come from a hundred years of planning decisions based on a massive and complex freeway system and heavy industry,'' the mayor said, ''and now we are planning for developments that are livable, walkable, bike-friendly, communities.''

 BODY:
When to Deregulate
 A Rent-Stabilized Unit
 QI live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Manhattan. My landlord has applied to the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to deregulate my apartment because my household adjusted gross income and my monthly rent exceeded mandated thresholds. But I was unemployed in 2009 and my household income dropped well below the threshold. Can the agency take this into consideration in determining whether to deregulate my apartment?
 A Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer in Manhattan who represents property owners, said that the Rent Stabilization Law requires the D.H.C.R. to issue an order of deregulation if, in each of the two calendar years before the petition, the household income exceeds $175,000 and the rent is more than $2,000. ''If the state's Department of Taxation and Finance verifies that the tenant's federal adjusted gross income exceeded the threshold, the order of deregulation must be issued, notwithstanding the tenant's subsequent unemployment,'' Mr. Belkin said. He noted, however, that the deregulation order was not effective until the tenant's current lease expires, and that at the end of the lease the landlord must offer the tenant a new lease at a rent the landlord could expect for the unregulated apartment on the open market. 
 Why Co-op Owners
 Need Insurance 
 QCan a co-op set mandatory requirements for insurance on co-op apartments? My co-op now requires all shareholders to have minimum personal liability coverage of $300,000 and personal property coverage of $30,000.
 A ''Co-op boards may require individual shareholders to carry their own liability and property insurance coverage for minimum amounts set by the co-op board,'' said Robert Kaplan, a co-op lawyer in Forest Hills, Queens. Mr. Kaplan noted that if the writer is questioning the soundness of the requirement, he should be aware that if disaster strikes, the co-op's insurance policy may not cover damage to the shareholder's apartment. Moreover, he said, the building's policy also will not cover damage to another apartment -- or the building -- caused by a shareholder's negligence. Insurance for the limits indicated by the writer can be bought for as little as $175 to $350 a year, Mr. Kaplan said. 
 Claiming Interest 
 On Security Deposits
 QI rent a Westchester condominium apartment and have never received a notice of interest earned on my two months' security deposit held by the owner. Are condo renters entitled to interest on their security deposits?
 A ''The state's General Obligations Law requires that a tenant's security deposit be placed in an interest-bearing account whenever the deposit is for a rental in a building that contains six or more dwelling units,'' said Glenn H. Spiegel, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan. He said the law did not differentiate between rental buildings and condo buildings. 
 So if the writer's apartment is in a building with six or more units, he is entitled to interest on the security deposit and to know the name and address of the bank where the account is maintained. He added that when a security deposit is placed in an interest-bearing account, the landlord -- here, the apartment owner -- is entitled to an annual administration fee equal to 1 percent of the deposit.

HEADLINE: Grants Nurture Arts Spaces and Their Communities

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
As part of an effort to increase the impact of its giving, the Ford Foundation is to announce a plan on Monday to dedicate $100 million to the development of arts spaces nationwide over the next decade. The plan is by far the largest commitment the foundation has ever made to the construction, maintenance and enhancement of arts facilities.
 The plan, called the Supporting Diverse Art Spaces Initiative, is one of several large financing projects that have resulted from a strategic overhaul of the foundation's operations since its president, Luis A. Ubinas, took over in 2008. He has moved the foundation in the direction of bundling its hundreds of millions of dollars in grants -- which have traditionally varied widely in their focus -- into large programs oriented toward specific issues. Other recent commitments include $80 million to bolster public programs for the unemployed and underpaid, $100 million for secondary education in seven cities and $50 million to help cities buy foreclosed properties. 
 In addition to helping arts groups build new spaces and renovate and expand old ones, the latest initiative aims to encourage the construction of affordable housing for artists in or around some of these spaces and to spur economic development in their surrounding areas. Mr. Ubinas said that during his travels around the country he had been astonished when he would visit an arts organization and find that ''all around it have developed whole neighborhoods -- of artists and their families, of businesses that cater to them, of diverse people who want to live in a thriving community.''
 He offered the example of the Boston Center for the Arts, organized in 1970 to provide artists with affordable studios while injecting life into the run-down South End neighborhood. ''Then the Boston Ballet was added,'' Mr. Ubinas, ''and performance space for other kinds of arts organizations, and what was a struggling neighborhood characterized by housing projects is a bustling community.''
 This notion of the economic benefits of the arts has become increasingly popular lately among arts financers and administrators, who are keenly aware that in times of economic paucity spending on the arts is sometimes seen as frivolous. Rocco Landesman, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, has been on the road frequently in recent months for a project that involves collecting information and anecdotes to help make the case to Congress and the public that the arts pay. (''Art Works'' is the official slogan of the endowment's project.) 
 ''From the foot traffic of people coming to studios and rehearsals to the influx of people looking for a place to eat or drink after an art opening or before a show,'' Mr. Landesman said in an e-mail message, ''these buildings attract new people and often expendable income to neighborhoods.'' 
 Even before its announcement the Ford Foundation had awarded a first grant under the initiative to a Minneapolis nonprofit group that builds mixed-use developments centered on moderately priced housing for artists. That group, Artspace Projects, has received more than $1 million toward, among other things, transforming an abandoned public school in East Harlem into such a development, in partnership with El Barrio's Operation Fightback, a New York community organization. 
 The project is to include 72 units of housing for artists and their families and a large space that can be used for art exhibitions, cultural events, conferences and gatherings of community groups.
 The initiative is also intended to help arts organizations improve or develop the management skills needed to maintain their spaces and, ideally, to turn them into revenue generators. Some of the money has been allocated for a series of seminars on marketing, planning, fund-raising and other topics related to sustaining arts centers. The seminars will be presented over two years by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
 ''Physical structure is not sufficient to keep an arts organization alive,'' said Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center and an expert on turning around troubled arts institutions. Mr. Kaiser has been on a 50-state tour of the United States, offering free seminars on financial management to arts groups coping with the economic crisis. 
 ''Many organizations put up buildings without thinking about how they will pay for all those not-very-glamorous costs like lighting and air-conditioning,'' he said.
 Grant applications seeking money to explore and plan for construction and development will be solicited in a request-for-proposal process to be managed by Leveraging Investments in Creativity, known as LINC, an organization that works to find living and work spaces for artists, among other things, and that keeps a database of arts centers. Members of the Ford Foundation's staff will vet proposals along with a panel of experts in economic development and urban design and planning, and award grants of up to $100,000. 
 Judilee Reed, executive director of LINC, said the foundation's initiative is particularly well timed. 
 ''I think people are beginning to understand that spaces for artists and art are more than just buildings, structures,'' she said. ''The way these spaces animate their communities and the relationships they have to their communities is ripe for development.''

HEADLINE: For Haitian-American Doctors and Nurses, a Call to Return Home

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD

 BODY:
As she struggled with junior high algebra at SS. Joachim and Anne School in Queens, Marie-Dominique Toussaint knew where it was all supposed to lead: she would be a doctor, an ambition inspired by her father, a physician she rarely saw, and fueled by her mother, a nurse who immigrated from Haiti.
 Ms. Toussaint, now 34, arrived in New York at the age of 4, in time to start climbing the American educational ladder to medical school. There were setbacks; she had yet to finish college when her mother died, forcing her to support herself. But she pushed on, scaling back her tuition costs and becoming a nurse instead -- for now. 
 Ms. Toussaint's path is one followed by countless Haitian-Americans -- who, in this respect, are not so different from other immigrant groups who see nursing as a foothold in the middle class and doctoring as the ultimate ambition for their children. 
 ''You have to be a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer. That's, like, it,'' Ms. Toussaint said. ''It's ingrained.''
 For Haiti, those dreams have been bittersweet. The country's global diaspora, rich in doctors and other professionals who are scarce back home, is evidence of a devastating brain drain. And from Boston to Miami, so many Haitians staff the best American hospitals, from surgeon down to health aide -- often sending remittances to struggling relatives in their homeland -- that Americans of Haitian descent are torn between pride and pain at the contrast with Haiti's own dysfunctional health care system.
 But now, in a way that no one could have foreseen, Haiti is benefiting from ambitions blown to the winds by the country's decades of unrest. Since the Jan. 12 earthquake killed an estimated 250,000 people there and left hospitals, which were subpar, in shambles, thousands of Haitian-American medical professionals have volunteered to help. At least hundreds -- and probably several thousand -- have already traveled there to work. 
 Volunteers have come away galvanized with a new commitment not only to meet Haiti's emergency needs, but also to help rebuild the entire health system. Yet many are also frustrated. The task is overwhelming; Haitian authorities seem passive. There is no well-established pipeline to link the linguistic and cultural skills of Haitian-Americans with major relief groups, which often require disaster-zone experience.
 Those who make it to Haiti often worry that with no central clearinghouse matching supplies and staff to needs, their efforts may not be having the greatest impact. And they worry that their new dedication will get lost in the shuffle in a multibillion-dollar reconstruction effort dominated by non-Haitian agencies and governments.
 Ms. Toussaint is among those ambivalent volunteers. After a frantic struggle to find a way to volunteer -- and several false starts when large relief organizations did not return her calls -- she traveled south with a team of doctors and nurses from the Association of Haitian Physicians Abroad, known by its French acronym, A.M.H.E., and paramedics from the Bedford-Stuyvesant Volunteer Ambulance Corps.
 A pediatric nurse used to working with sophisticated neonatal intensive-care equipment at Harlem Hospital Center, she found herself in the ruins of Haiti's general university hospital, trying to treat children with crushed limbs and breathing trouble, but lacking adequate anesthetics, sterile equipment or clear lines of hospital authority. 
 ''What we were doing, it's not enough, it wasn't enough,'' she said recently, in a restaurant across from Harlem Hospital Center. She wonders how Haitians will get enough food and shelter, let alone reform health care. ''It's a mess -- you don't know who's going to take the lead.'' 
 The difficulties only renewed Dr. Pierre Nelson's devotion to a country he had given up on. After the quake, he banded together with fellow Haitian-American medical-school alumni from Tampico University in Mexico to organize doctors and nurses to take weekly aid trips to Haiti.
 Dr. Nelson, who is in his 50s, had long dreamed of saving up to open twin medical clinics in Haiti, one for paying customers, one for the poor. (He never got his United States medical license, starting a home health care business instead.) But in recent years he had given up on the idea, and went to Haiti only for the occasional funeral. 
 ''Every time you go, you come back so full of despair,'' he said. ''You think it can't go back any further, but every time it's worse.'' 
 But after his recent trip, he may move back after all: ''I can smell and taste that this time we can make a difference.'' 
 Such frustrations and enthusiasms echo across the city and the country. They are on display in the parish of SS. Joachim and Anne in Queens Village, where Ms. Toussaint grew up and where Dr. Nelson worships, and in the adjacent neighborhoods of Elmont, N.Y., and Cambria Heights, Queens, the hub of the Haitian community in the borough, which has the nation's third largest concentration of Haitian-Americans after Brooklyn and Miami. 
 Most volunteers in the area found ad-hoc ways to help: Hardy Vieux, whose father, Vanes, is head of the parish council, talked his way onto a trip with Family Health Ministries, a North Carolina group that runs a health clinic there. (He had to work as a Creole translator, since, he admits sheepishly, he is a lawyer, not a doctor.) Another church member, Brittany Germain, a fourth grader, organized a fund-raiser at North Side School in Bayside, Queens, for the Haitian physicians' group that Ms. Toussaint traveled with. The school -- 55 children in all -- raised $338.89. 
 Jennifer Vassor, a nurse whose children attend the parish school, is on deck to go to Haiti as a volunteer as soon as she settles in relatives who fled from Haiti after the quake. And Gina Faustin, from nearby Sacred Heart Church, turned her birthday trip to the Dominican Republic into a medical mission, pulling into a Dominican hospital full of Haitian earthquake victims with a busload of her friends -- many of them nurses who got straight to work. 
 The Haitian government has tracked at least 1,400 Haitian diaspora professionals, mostly in medical fields, who have cycled through the country since the quake. The Association of Haitian Physicians Abroad, just one of many Haitian-American medical groups volunteering, has sent more than 500 volunteers; Dr. Nelson's has sent more than 200. And the Haitian-American Nurses Association has sent more than 100. 
 Haitian-Americans also seem to be disproportionately volunteering for larger organizations. Of more than 7,000 people who volunteered through the Web site of Partners in Health, which runs nine hospitals in Haiti, more than 1,000 listed themselves as Creole speakers, according to the Boston-based group. Partners in Health is recruiting Haitian-American mental health professionals through a new Web site, Rebati.org, aiming to treat psychological problems in the wake of the earthquake and build a lasting mental health network. 
 But some Haitian-American doctors resent what they see as efforts by the large organizations -- some of which have been providing significant chunks of Haiti's health care for decades -- to keep control.
 ''They should be asking us, How can we help you? Not the other way around,'' Dr. Karl Latortue, a Long Island internist, told a meeting of a coalition of Haitian medical groups that includes Dr. Nelson's Tampico group, the Aesclepius Medical Society and Docs' Tee Time.
 Part of his concern is a lost opportunity to recruit the cultural competenceof Haitian-Americans: ''Medicine is 75 percent communication,'' he said. ''Someone of another nationality might think that person's crazy. With Haitians, everything is gas. If it's a headache, they might say, 'I have gas in my head.' '' 
 And part of it is simply a sense that Haitians' medical tradition is being slighted. 
 Medicine is ingrained even in the biographies of Haiti's heroes and antiheroes. Toussaint L'Ouverture, who led the world's only successful overthrow of a white colonial regime by slaves and catapulted Haiti to its turbulent independence in 1804, rose to a privileged plantation job through knowledge of herbal medicine passed down from his African father. The dictator Francois Duvalier got his nickname, Papa Doc, and early acclaim as a public-health physician fighting malaria before becoming known for murdering political opponents. 
 Some Haitians go into medicine for the prestige in a country where only half the population can read. Others say it appeals to the warm, caring side of a traditionally hospitable culture. But mainly, medical jobs bring stability.
 ''You'll always have a job,'' Ms. Toussaint said. ''You may not be wealthy, but you'll be able to live.''
 Dr. Lambros D. George Angus, a prominent Long Island surgeon and a member of the Association of Haitian Physicians Abroad who traveled with Ms. Toussaint, recalled his mother's reaction when he told her as a boy that he wanted to be a firefighter. She said, ''Oh, Jesus!'' 
 At a meeting of the Aesclepius group in a sunlit clinic in Elmont, the doctors decided to take their share of the rebuilding in their own hands. Among their plans: build a hospital on land they already own in Haiti; get New York medical schools to take in Haitian students whose schools were destroyed; build a database to link volunteers to needy areas. 
 More than 200 doctors and nurses have gone to Haiti with the group, paying for their own tickets. Dr. Max Noel, who hosted the meeting, said ''Every single one has said they would go again.''

HEADLINE: A Store Kept Afloat by the Generosity of Customers

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
POINT LOOKOUT, N.Y.
 The problem was as clear as the empty shelves in the town market, but it was not until the e-mail message spread around town that everyone was forced to take notice. 
 ''Merola's, our anchor since before the time of the grandparents, needs us,'' it read. ''They have been serving us for more than 80 years, and we need to help them.''
 The market that Nicholas and Carmela Merola opened in 1930 in this tiny Long Island hamlet, at the east end of the barrier island that includes Long Beach, isn't the only business these days depending on the generosity of its customers to stay afloat. And chances are residents would have done what they could to keep alive the only grocery in town no matter when the crisis arose. 
 But still, in the glorious sunlight at the end of this long, punishing winter, after the economic storms of the past year, in the celebration of rebirth on Easter weekend, there was something larger than this 11-block-long, 0.2-square-mile community in the ad-hoc rescue plan that will keep Merola's in business.
 We are all looking for signs that there's a way forward and a way back -- forward into something better than the past few years, back toward some semblance of the old economic normal. And in Point Lookout, that sign was the way customers wrote checks and rallied around Merola's so that this long, hard winter would not be its last.
 ''I see it as a miracle from God, and there's not one person that can shake me on that,'' said Catherine Carrazo, part of the third generation of family owners of the store. ''At first I felt embarrassed, but now I feel loved.''
 Merola's, which has been at the same location on Lido Boulevard since 1957, is something of a throwback, like Point Lookout itself. The village, surrounded on three sides by water, is a seaside Wobegon within commuting distance of New York City. The speed limit is 15 mph. You have to pick up your own mail at the post office. And celebrity residents have been more on the order of Charles Atlas or Marlene Dietrich than Madonna or Lady Gaga. 
 ''This is the anti-Hamptons,'' said Brendan Cahill, whose family has been in town since 1895. ''There is no scene here.''
 And Merola's is where the retirees and volunteer firefighters go to pick up the morning paper and hang out, where you get all the town gossip along with your loaf of bread, where kids begin to feel grown up when their parents let them walk or bicycle down to Merola's to pick up something for dinner. When someone dies in town, Merola's is where you get the tray of food to send to the family, and the store usually sends one (or more) on its own.
 But then, there's probably a Wal-Mart in Lake Wobegon by now. Over time, Point Lookout has become marginally wealthier, so more people eat out or go away for a weekend rather than eat at home. And if people love Merola's, they are more likely to do much of their shopping at the BJ's in Freeport or the Waldbaum's in Merrick. 
 With the recession dragging on, Merola's found itself falling further and further behind. Its biggest supplier cut it off. Vincent Merola, grandson of the founders, resorted to shopping at BJ's or at competing groceries for sales to stock his own store. The family met with a bankruptcy lawyer and contemplated closing the doors.
 Finally, a native and customer, Dana Conklin, confronted the family members. Did they want to survive? she asked. And would they accept help to do it? She suggested a one-time fund-raising drive so that customers could help pay the bills and keep the store going until business picked up in the spring and summer. And one by one, customers trooped in with checks or mailed them in -- at last notice, more than 150 of them covering almost half of the store's $100,000 debt to the supplier.
 The family knows it will have to operate smarter and tougher -- probably fewer jobs for local kids, employees paying for part of their health care, and the market aggressively seeking new niches, like, say, delivering food to people on the beach. 
 It's tough for small businesses all over. Most of them do not live on an island of neighbors and friends. But there was sun beyond Point Lookout over the weekend. Maybe the economy is inching back. It's not just Merola's and Point Lookout that would like to think there's life beyond hard times and this long, cold winter.

HEADLINE: Protesters Defy State In the Heart Of Bangkok

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER

 BODY:
BANGKOK -- Dancing jubilantly in the streets to the beats of blaring pop and country music, anti-government demonstrators on Sunday defied calls by the government to disperse from Bangkok's affluent commercial hub in a major escalation of three weeks of mass demonstrations.
 ''There's not a jail big enough to fit us all,'' said Nitipong, a protester who stood beside one of hundreds of pickup trucks blocking one of the country's busiest intersections. 
 On Saturday, the protesters surrounded the national police headquarters, the Four Seasons, Hyatt, Intercontinental and other hotels and six major shopping malls, which are connected by an elevated ''skywalk'' and together have five times the floor space of the Mall of America, the famed shopping center outside of Minneapolis.
 The provocative move to shut down the area infuriated many Bangkok residents and elevated what was major annoyance for the Thai government to a full-blown national crisis.
 The protesters, known as the red shirts, are demanding that the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva call new elections.
 But some of the protesters, who are largely from Thailand's rural hinterland, also said they were trying to prove a point by blocking such an economically important part of Bangkok: 15 months ago, their archrivals, the generally more well-heeled protesters known as the yellow shirts, blockaded Bangkok's two international airports for a week, stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers. None of the yellow shirts have been convicted for shutting down the airport, including Kasit Piromya, the current foreign minister who took part and reportedly said the protest was ''a lot of fun.''
 After four years of political turmoil in Thailand, including a military coup and three other changes of government, political movements are engaging in a kind of street-protest brinkmanship, each staging their own variations of publicity-seeking mass demonstration.
 Analysts say the demonstrations are a reflection of the failure of the parliamentary system to repair the fractures in Thai society since the administration of Thaksin Shinawatra, the former prime minister removed in the 2006 military coup.
 Red-shirted protesters on Sunday said they were on the street because their voices had been squelched by the coup and two court decisions that removed prime ministers that represented their interests. One former prime minister, the late Samak Sundaravej, an ally of Mr. Thaksin, was removed from office two years ago because he received income from a cooking show, which judges ruled violated the Constitution.
 Among the protesters Sunday was Samai Suporn, a 50-year-old rice farmer from northeastern Thailand, who said she had come to Bangkok for the protest because she remained upset at the coup.
 ''We're here for a long time,'' she said of the protest. ''Until they dissolve Parliament.''
 She came with 10 other people in a pickup truck still caked with the red dirt of rural Thailand and has never been inside the shopping malls that surrounded her.
 Protest leaders have portrayed the current political troubles in Thailand as rich versus poor, but Mrs. Samai, who clears the equivalent of only $300 a year from her small rice farm and fruit orchard, said she had nothing against the rich.
 ''There are good and bad people among the rich and the poor,'' she said. ''I'm not jealous of the rich.''
 She says she is upset at the government, especially because news reports on government television stations play down the strength of the red-shirt movement.
 Although many people at the rally appeared to be from rural areas, there was also a sizable contingent of Bangkok residents.
 Mr. Nitipong sells computer equipment and is a graduate of Thammasat, a prestigious university in Bangkok. Another woman, Nan, is a chemist who has a master's degree from Chulalongkorn, another prestigious university. Both declined to give their full names, underlining the fear by some protesters, despite their defiant words, that the government could follow through with its threat to arrest them.
 Mr. Abhisit, who is under pressure to end the protests, said Sunday that he would proceed cautiously. ''I want to tell those people who suggest that the government deal with the demonstrators decisively that, supposing we do, a riot could take place, and there would be losses.''
 Mr. Abhisit vowed ''legal proceedings and prosecution'' for anyone who broke the law. The government over the weekend said that anyone who did not leave the area would be subject to a year's imprisonment, but it did not detail how it would force the protesters to leave.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Drilling Plan May Buoy Efforts on Energy Policy

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Ever since he ran Bill Clinton's ''It's the Economy, Stupid'' presidential campaign in 1992, James Carville has held a reputation for common-sense Democratic strategy.
 In recent years, Mr. Carville has seized on the transformation of America's energy system, which simultaneously touches voter concerns about the economy, national security and the environment. But he acknowledges that ''energy independence'' has lately lost political altitude.
 Relatively low gas prices have drained away urgency, and the recession has heightened fears of economic dislocation. Republican charges that President Obama favors what they call a ''cap and tax'' plan that would destroy jobs while limiting carbon emissions have further damaged prospects for comprehensive energy legislation in Congress - just seven months before midterm elections. 
 But Mr. Carville, a Louisiana-bred campaign veteran, found encouragement in Mr. Obama's new plan to expand domestic oil drilling. The plan makes it easier for Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat from Mr. Carville's home state, to back the president's goals; it also increases pressure to cooperate on pro-drilling Republicans.
 Having prevailed on health care and made progress on new Wall Street regulations, Mr. Obama and his Congressional allies ''are starting to move the chains a little bit,'' Mr. Carville noted. On energy, ''They're setting the table for something that's inevitable.''
 The springtime 2010 question is: inevitable when?
 A Senate Plan
 Energy legislation has always been the most challenging item on Mr. Obama's agenda. It lacks health care's 70-year pedigree as a Democratic priority. Indeed, it divides Democrats while triggering intense Republican opposition.
 Liberal environmentalists echo former Vice President Al Gore in demanding action to embrace alternative energy and move away from fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Democrats from oil states, like Ms. Landrieu, or from coal states, like Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, remain wary.
 Thus some White House strategists have long assumed that ''cap and trade'' could not clear Congress before the 2010 elections.
 Yet the idea has proved surprisingly resilient. House Democrats, led by Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, offered enough concessions to affected interests to pass cap and trade in their comprehensive energy bill last year. Now an ideologically divergent Senate triad - a liberal Democrat, John Kerry of Massachusetts; an independent, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut; and a conservative Republican, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - are preparing to unveil their version.
 Like the House bill, their work in progress would reduce carbon emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels over a 10-year period. That matches the goal Mr. Obama specified at global climate talks in December.
 The three senators eschew the politically tainted term ''cap and trade,'' but not the concept. They would begin by capping carbon emissions for utilities, and in later years extend caps to manufacturers.
 For the oil industry, they would impose a fee on refiners. To lure conservative Democrats and swing-vote Republicans, they would expand oil drilling and incentives for nuclear power.
 Senators Kerry, Lieberman and Graham hope for passage by July 4, then negotiations with the House. But mustering the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster represents a huge hurdle.
 The Right Time?
 Even advocates agree that after the exhausting health care push, it is an uphill fight. In fact, Tim Wirth, a former Democratic senator from Colorado who now leads the United Nations Foundation, warns that the debate could turn into an effort by Mr. Obama simply to prevent Congress from blocking his regulatory authority to limit carbon emissions. That authority represents the administration's backup plan if legislation fails.
 But the administration and its allies have not given up, insisting that only a carbon cap will create incentives for the American renewable energy industry to flourish and compete with economic rivals, notably China. The Senate negotiators have actively wooed support from business, including oil companies.
 Within the 59-member Senate Democratic caucus, the conservative Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Ben Nelson of Nebraska appear out of reach. But as Mr. Graham prods his party to respond to younger voters' environmental concerns, there is a chance of offsetting Democratic defections.
 ''There's a path to five or six Republicans,'' said Carol M. Browner, Mr. Obama's coordinator of energy and climate policy. Among the prospects: moderate Senators Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine; Mr. Kerry's Massachusetts colleague, Scott Brown; and George LeMieux of Florida, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, and Judd Gregg of New Hampshire.
 If time runs out before the election, the administration holds out the option of finishing negotiations in a lame-duck session of Congress. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama may have to choose between insisting on a comprehensive bill or setting aside the carbon cap for a narrower approach focused on new energy sources.
 Mr. Carville concedes that this may not prove the right moment for a more aggressive approach. But as other nations move to curb fossil fuels, he calls it only a matter of time.
 ''It's about 2010,'' Mr. Carville concluded, ''and it's about 2014, too.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Plan for Offshore Drilling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama to Open Offshore Areas to Oil Drilling'' (front page, March 31):
 President Obama deserves credit for his proposal to open a portion of the American coastline to oil and natural gas drilling. It is about time!
 This action, though not sufficiently extensive, will provide a boost to the economy, create good jobs and bring new energy supplies to the market at a time when we continue to foolishly allow repressive Middle Eastern regimes to dictate the supply and price of oil, thereby inadvertently helping to finance terrorist activity. 
 The president's action is small and late, but it was not an easy one for him to take, as any such plan places him in hot water with his liberal, environmentalist base, which is convinced that any drilling will destroy the coastline and be bad for the environment.
 The president is correct that expanded drilling is but a small piece of the energy independence picture, but it is a necessary one, as he now acknowledges. May he follow through with his stated plan, and may it be so popular and productive that it is quickly expanded. Much depends on its success.
 Oren M. Spiegler Upper St. Clair, Pa., March 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The president, not known as a hard bargainer except with his own supporters, has announced another ''Obama compromise'' by ending the moratorium on offshore oil and gas drilling in new areas and receiving nothing in return. He is giving the ''drill here, drill now'' partisans what they want and then hoping for a few votes in the future for the already fatally compromised climate legislation that the Senate may take up.
 The pursuit of Pyrrhic victories comes to mind.
 Doug Karo Durham, N.H., March 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Just as he did with health care reform for the better part of last year, President Obama is now courting Congressional Republicans with his new energy proposals. This, too, is likely to be a futile exercise, especially when Republicans have vowed not to cooperate with anything that Democrats propose. 
 But far more important than the political capital and time wasted, the president's proposals are a Faustian bargain. They call for more nuclear power when there is still no good plan for what to do with the long-lived, lethal radioactive wastes. They call for more offshore drilling when we should be burning less, not more, oil; when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated so clearly the risks to offshore oil rigs; and when coastal marine ecosystems are already under such severe threat. They call for ''clean coal'' when anyone who has looked seriously at the environmental and public health disaster of mountaintop coal mining knows there is no such thing. 
 We must applaud the president's small-scale initiatives for renewable energy generation -- solar, wind, some forms of biomass, and geothermal -- and for promoting energy efficiency and mass transit. These are the real healthy, sustainable, job-creating solutions to our climate and energy crises that we must expand exponentially, starting now. China is doing so, and is rapidly cornering the world market. Why aren't we?
 Eric Chivian Boston, March 31, 2010
 The writer, a physician, is director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School.
 To the Editor:
 Before President Obama starts mining the seas for fossil fuels, why not make a higher priority of mining the brains of America for alternative energy ideas? This is not a time to play politics with our seascape.
 Alice Smith Palo Alto, Calif., March 31, 2010
 To the Editor:
 We need energy, and in principle we should drill for oil wherever it is. Unfortunately, our historical practice of extraction is but a giveaway to the shareholders of the oil companies. I would oppose such drilling.
 But suppose the federal government sets up an agency to recover the oil on public lands, for instance offshore. This agency would contract with technically savvy companies for the exploration and extraction. The contracted entity would be paid a generous fee, but the oil would remain public property. We could add the oil to the strategic reserve, or use it right away, whatever is deemed to be in the national interest.
 Such a scheme would directly benefit every American. If Norway and Brazil are able to go such a route, why couldn't we? Under these circumstances I would support drilling in currently excluded areas.

HEADLINE: Throw Out Skybox Tax Subsidies

BYLINE: By RICHARD SCHMALBECK and JAY SOLED. 
Richard Schmalbeck is a law professor at Duke. Jay Soled is a professor at the Rutgers Business School.

 BODY:
UNTIL the 1970s, Major League Baseball was a populist sport. Bleacher seats cost as little as a dollar, meaning middle- or even working-class fans could afford to take their families to a game a few times each season. 
 But in the years since, tickets to baseball games -- along with other professional sports events -- have skyrocketed in cost. Over the last two decades, the average ticket price for a Chicago Cubs game has increased 265 percent, more than four times the inflation rate. Add in parking, concessions and souvenirs, and a family trip to one of this week's opening day games could easily cost a few hundred dollars.
 There are many reasons for the price explosion, but a critical factor has been the ability of businesses to write off tickets as entertainment expenses -- essentially a huge, and wholly unnecessary, government subsidy. 
 These deductions have led to higher ticket prices in two ways. On the demand side, they have fueled competition for scarce seats, with business taxpayers bidding in part with dollars they save through the deductions. 
 On the supply side, the large number of businesses bidding for expensive seats has driven the expansion of luxury skyboxes and a reduction in overall seats in new ballparks. 
 While baseball parks built in the 1960s and before held as many as 56,000 seats, the modern trend is toward smaller-capacity parks, with a higher percentage of total space dedicated to skyboxes. The new Yankee Stadium, the only major-league park built since 2000 with more than 44,000 seats, has 3,000 fewer seats than its 1923 predecessor but almost three times as many skybox suites.
 Congress has occasionally expressed concern about deductions for business entertainment, including tickets to sporting events. In 1962, it placed limits on the deductibility of business entertainment generally. In 1986 it restricted the deductibility of luxury skybox tickets to the face value of non-luxury premium tickets, like center-court seats at a basketball game or behind-the-plate seats at a baseball game. For example, if a ticket to a skybox suite cost $500 and a seat behind the plate cost $100, a business could deduct only $100, subject to other limitations on deductibility.
 That made sense when there was still a substantial price disparity between skybox seats and tickets for even the choicest non-luxury seats. But the price for non-luxury premium tickets has grown significantly in recent years -- thanks in part to endless demand from businesses and the use of more sophisticated, Web-based pricing tools by the teams -- rendering the skybox rule meaningless. 
 Ideally, Congress would get rid of business-entertainment deductions altogether -- after all, they are little more than an excuse for corporate executives to consume luxury items at a discount, distorting markets and cheating the public out of substantial tax revenue. 
 Given corporate America's passionate attachment to sports-related perks, a blanket elimination may be unrealistic, though. A more feasible but still effective approach would be to limit deductions for luxury skybox tickets to a low, fixed amount -- say, $50 per seat, per game.
 Such a limit would be fair, unambiguous and easy to enforce. But above all, it would help baseball return to its roots, when average folks -- not corporate entertainers -- were the ones filling the seats.

HEADLINE: Anxious App Developers Are in a Scramble to Strike iPad Gold

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
After getting their hands on an AppleiPad on Saturday morning, Igor Pusenjak and his brother Marko rushed back to Igor's apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, weaving around languid dogs and seafood deliverymen. 
 ''Careful,'' Igor called out. ''This is our most prized possession in the world.'' 
 He was only half-joking.
 As the creators of a best-selling iPhone game called Doodle Jump, the Pusenjaks were well aware of the financial opportunity that the iPad represented. So over the weekend they joined perhaps thousands of other software developers in an unusual scramble that drew people from as far away as Australia. 
 While many developers have spent weeks working on applications for Apple's newest toy, only a handful were given iPads on which to test their software. The rest had to wait until the device went on sale Saturday for the moment of truth: How well does our app work on the iPad? Does it look and feel right? Or do we have a lot more work to do? 
 For small developers, the stakes are high. Having an app accepted for a highly coveted Apple product means reaching a passionate group of consumers who have demonstrated their willingness to spend over and over again on applications for mobile devices like the iPhone and iPod Touch. The potential revenue is huge; the apps market for those two devices alone is already worth a billion dollars a year in sales.
 Adding to the urgency was the knowledge that many of the earliest apps for the iPhone ended up being among the most successful. A slow start with an iPad app could mean getting lost in the clutter of Apple's crowded online store.
 ''A lot of developers may have suffered the pain of trying to rise to the top of the 150,000 apps that are already out there,'' said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''They don't want to repeat that experience.''
 Doodle Jump for the iPhone, which involves catapulting a four-legged creature up a series of platforms, is near the top of that pile, having sold more than 3.5 million copies at 99 cents apiece in a little over a year (Apple pays developers 70 percent of the revenue from app sales). The challenge for the Pusenjaks will be to recreate that success on a new device that, if it sells well, could significantly expand the market for apps. 
 Apple provided simulation software to developers that allowed them to mimic the look and functions of an iPad on a Mac, and it began inviting them to submit iPad applications to its App Store last month. But the Pusenjaks and many other developers were apprehensive about submitting programs without first testing them on a real iPad. 
 The brothers were among many developers eager to get their hands on the new device. 
 Alexandra Peters, community manager at a developer company called Firemint, flew to New York from Australia to pick up several devices, which at the moment are on sale only in the United States. She planned to hand-deliver them early this week to the company's headquarters in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne.
 Although Firemint's flagship titles, Flight Control and Real Racing, are already available for download on the iPad, Ms. Peters said the company would use the devices for additional testing and future development. 
 Ms. Peters said her colleagues at home were hoping her return flight would be on time. ''They can't wait to see it,'' she said with a laugh. 
 As for Doodle Jump, it needed extra attention because of its heavy use of the iPad's touch screen and motion detector. 
 ''We wanted to wait until we had it in hand so we could see the game mechanics in action and make sure they worked perfectly,'' Igor Pusenjak said. 
 The brothers' original plan for Saturday was for Igor to wait for the delivery of two iPads in the afternoon and then consult via video chat with his brother, who would be at his home in Croatia, where both brothers grew up.
 But they changed their strategy after seeing that the competition for iPad applications would be stiffer than they had thought.
 ''Once we saw how many apps were already available for the iPad, we realized we needed to jump on it right away,'' said Igor, who is 34 and also teaches at Parsons The New School for Design. 
 Marko, 33, got on a plane and arrived in New York late on Friday night. The brothers spent some time working on designs for the new version of Doodle Jump, then got some sleep before lining up at the Apple store in the meatpacking district at 8 a.m.
 Two hours later, iPad in hand, the lanky pair hurried up two flights of stairs to the airy apartment Igor shares with his wife. ''This is the big moment,'' Igor said as Marko unwrapped the iPad and connected it to a laptop. 
 The pair took a minute to check out the competitive landscape, flipping through the iPad apps that Apple was highlighting in the store. ''Wow,'' Igor said, looking at a list of best sellers for the iPad. ''People are buying apps already.'' 
 Soon they had loaded up the work-in-progress version of Doodle Jump and were both grinning ear to ear as the game's whimsical characters leapt to life. ''This is going to be huge,'' Marko breathed. Igor nodded in agreement. 
 A few hours later, the scene was less jovial. Biting a knuckle while he guided the main character around the game, Marko glanced up and said, ''There are a lot more technical problems than we anticipated.'' 
 ''It's harder to control the shooting,'' Marko murmured. 
 ''People will be used to holding it with one hand and shooting with the other,'' Igor said. ''We may have to rethink that.'' 
 While playing around with the size of elements in the game, the brothers created a version with small characters in a giant-size landscape. ''Hey, maybe we have an idea for a sequel,'' Igor said.
 They also found that BubbleWrap, a less complex iPhone app that they had already adapted for the iPad, didn't work properly. There were odd glitches in its graphics, and the display didn't scroll smoothly. 
 ''This seemed simple enough to do on a simulator, but I guess not,'' Igor said. ''It's definitely going to need to be fixed.'' 
 If anything, the brothers said, the problems were an additional validation that they had made the right move to wait, rather than submit Doodle Jump early. 
 ''Plenty of people will see a nice spike in downloads today, but we're more concerned with the long-term stability of our application,'' Igor said. The brothers estimate that it could take a few days before they were satisfied with the game. 
 When the app is finally ready, there is likely to be a substantial iPad audience in place. Although as of Sunday evening Apple had not released sales figures for the weekend, some analysts were saying that the iPad's debut was stronger than they had expected. 
 Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, wrote in a research note that Apple might have sold as many as 700,000 iPads on Saturday alone, double what he had predicted. 
 By comparison, when Apple released the two most recent iPhone models, it took the company three days to sell a million phones.
 That bodes well for the Pusenjaks and their competitors in the iPad app race.
 ''When the iPhone came out, no one realized how big of a deal the App Store was going to be,'' Mr. Munster said in an interview. ''But it's a proven business model. As far as the platform goes, there is the potential for a second gold rush.''

HEADLINE: Making Financial Reform Fool-Resistant

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The White House is confident that a financial regulatory reform bill will soon pass the Senate. I'm not so sure, given the opposition of Republican leaders to any real reform. But in any case, how good is the legislation on the table, the bill put together by Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut?
 Not good enough. It's a good-faith effort to do what needs to be done, but it would create a system highly dependent on the wisdom and good intentions of government officials. And as the history of the last decade demonstrates, trusting in the quality of officials can be dangerous to the economy's health. 
 Now, it's impossible to devise a truly foolproof regulatory regime -- anyone who believes otherwise is underestimating the power of foolishness. But you can try to create a system that's relatively fool-resistant. Unfortunately, the Dodd bill doesn't do that.
 As I argued in my last column, while the problem of ''too big to fail'' has gotten most of the attention -- and while big banks deserve all the opprobrium they're getting -- the core problem with our financial system isn't the size of the largest financial institutions. It is, instead, the fact that the current system doesn't limit risky behavior by ''shadow banks,'' institutions -- like Lehman Brothers -- that carry out banking functions, that are perfectly capable of creating a banking crisis, but, because they issue debt rather than taking deposits, face minimal oversight. 
 The Dodd bill tries to fill this gaping hole in the system by letting federal regulators impose ''strict rules for capital, leverage, liquidity, risk management and other requirements as companies grow in size and complexity.'' It also gives regulators the power to seize troubled financial firms -- and it requires that large, complex firms submit ''funeral plans'' that make it relatively easy to shut them down.
 That's all good. In effect, it gives shadow banking something like the regulatory regime we already have for conventional banking.
 But what will actually be in those ''strict rules'' for capital, liquidity, and so on? The bill doesn't say. Instead, everything is left at the discretion of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a sort of interagency task force including the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury secretary, the comptroller of the currency and the heads of five other federal agencies. 
 Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute, whose blog has become essential reading for anyone interested in financial reform, has pointed out what's wrong with this: just consider who would have been on that council in 2005, which was probably the peak year for irresponsible lending.
 Well, in 2005 the chairman of the Fed was Alan Greenspan, who dismissed warnings about the housing bubble -- and who asserted in October 2005 that ''increasingly complex financial instruments have contributed to the development of a far more flexible, efficient, and hence resilient financial system.''
 Meanwhile, the secretary of the Treasury was John Snow, who ... actually, I don't think anyone remembers anything about Mr. Snow, other than the fact that Karl Rove treated him like an errand boy.
 The comptroller of the currency was John Dugan, who still holds the office. He was recently the subject of a profilein The Times, which noted his habit of blocking efforts by states to crack down on abusive consumer lending, on the grounds that he, not the states, has authority over national banks -- except that he himself almost never acts to protect consumers. 
 Oh, and on the subject of consumer protection: the Dodd bill creates a more or less independent agency to protect consumers against abusive lending, albeit one housed at the Fed. That's a good thing. But it gives the oversight council the ability to override the agency's recommendations.
 The point is that the Dodd bill would give an administration determined to rein in runaway finance the tools it needs to do the job. But it wouldn't do much to stiffen the spine of a less determined administration. On the contrary, it would make it easy for future regulators to look the other way as another bubble inflated.
 So what the legislation needs are explicit rules, rules that would force action even by regulators who don't especially want to do their jobs. There should, for example, be a preset maximum level of allowable leverage -- the financial reform that has already passed the House sets this at 15 to 1, and the Senate should follow suit. There should be hard rules determining when regulators have to seize a troubled financial firm. There should be no-exception rules requiring that complex financial derivatives be traded transparently. And so on.
 I know that getting such things into the bill would be hard politically: as financial reform legislation moves to the floor of the Senate, there will be pressure to make it weaker, not stronger, in the hope of attracting Republican votes. But I would urge Senate leaders and the Obama administration not to settle for a weak bill, just so that they can claim to have passed financial reform. We need reform with a fighting chance of actually working.

HEADLINE: Sales of U.S. Homes Rose Significantly in February

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The wobbly housing market showed a rare sign of strength in February: pending home sales were up significantly, a report released on Monday said, suggesting that Americans took advantage of a tax credit for home buyers.
 Sales rose 8.2 percent, the National Association of Realtors said. Analysts had expected sales to stay flat.
 Economists said the data released on Monday suggested that buyers were re-entering the market as the expiration deadline approached for a government tax credit. Qualified home buyers have until April 30 to take advantage of a tax credit of up to $8,000. The credit drove up sales rapidly in the fall, when it was originally set to expire, but it has been slow to propel the market this spring. 
 Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the association, said the report ''may signal the early stages of a second surge of home sales.''
 ''We need a second surge to meaningfully draw down inventory and definitively stabilize home values,'' Mr. Yun said in a statement.
 An influx of foreclosed homes, which are often offered at bargain prices, has added another reason for prospective home buyers to enter the market. The agents' association said it expected the upward trend to continue in the March data.
 The report showed that sales rose even in areas hit hard by stormy weather. Sales climbed 9 percent in the Northeast and South, which were blanketed by snow in February. The data is based on signed contracts, which usually take one or two months to translate into final sales.
 The jump in sales was a rare bit of good news for the housing market, which remains in a deep rut. Home prices have barely budged from extraordinarily low levels, sales are at record lows and foreclosures are rising as Americans fall behind on mortgage payments.
 ''I don't think we're in for a further slump, but I think the recovery is going to be slow and painful,'' said Michael Carliner, a visiting fellow at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. ''The risk that the bottom is going to come even further out of the market is easing.''
 Sales will probably suffer when the tax credit expires in April. But as unemployment recedes and the broader recovery gains steam, economists believe sales will slowly pick up and move decisively higher in 2011.
 Exactly how quickly overall economic conditions will improve remains unclear. On Monday, there were signs that the service sector, which includes most of the United States economy, was beginning to improve. 
 The Institute for Supply Management's report on the service sector rose to 55.4 in March from 53 in February -- its second consecutive monthly gain. Much of the momentum came from a surge in new orders and business activity.
 The recovery has been driven by sectors like manufacturing, which has consistently outpaced the rate of growth for the broader economy. But the institute's report released on Monday indicated that services were beginning to catch up, and that employment in the sector was strengthening. Consumer spending has risen modestly in recent months, translating into stronger earnings and a slight increase in hiring.
 It was the highest reading for the survey since May 2006, and it exceeded analysts' expectations. The employment barometer was short of the break-even point, signaling that the service sector was still losing jobs, even though employment had gradually improved. 
 Exports rose significantly as American companies tapped into fast-paced growth in places like China and Canada. The backlog of orders also increased, reaching the highest level since 2007, suggesting growth might be robust in the months ahead.

HEADLINE: A Successful Bond Program in These Economic Times

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Build America Bonds Will Save $12.3 Billion, Analysis Says'' (Business Day, April 2) rightly recognizes one of the true benefits that Build America Bonds provide to issuers. 
 As we fight to curb unacceptable rates of unemployment, these bonds permit our mayors and governors to engage in strategic borrowing, investing and bonding to repair our highways, bridges, electrical grid, ports, airports, levees and dams. And the time to do this is now.
 Smart investments through Build America Bonds will ensure that our public safety, quality of life and economic competitiveness improve in the coming years. Investing in infrastructure would be a boon to our manufacturers, and for every billion dollars we can create 18,000 well-paying jobs that cannot be outsourced. It would also provide a great shot in the arm for American manufacturing, especially concrete, asphalt and steel. 
 Build America Bonds give us access to capital with lower borrowing costs. The Obama administration created Build America Bonds to unfreeze our access to the bond market and attract new investors. 
 And it is working. Nearly $90 billion of these bonds have been issued in 48 states, creating jobs and improving our public assets. And at the same time, they lowered the borrowing cost to our taxpayers. 
 Bold, smart investments are needed now. Once we emerge from these difficult times, investments made with Build America Bonds will be one reason that communities that are now suffering will once again be thriving. Extending the life of this innovative bonding program will ensure that growth continues and that our country will remain competitive.
 Ed Rendell Harrisburg, Pa., April 2, 2010

HEADLINE: For Weight Watchers, Jennifer Hudson Wins a Losing Battle

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THE previous campaign for Weight Watchers featured a furry critter that tempted dieters with high-calorie foods. Now, the company has decided to get real: its new campaign will star the actress and singer Jennifer Hudson, who will talk about what she has experienced in her quest to lose weight.
 Ms. Hudson, 28, who won an Academy Award in 2007 for her role as the singer Effie in ''Dreamgirls,'' followed a Weight Watchers program for several months, tracking what she ate, intensifying her exercise routine and meeting weekly with a diet coach. The Grammy-winning singer dropped a noticeable, but undisclosed, number of pounds -- a topic of celebrity gossip sites and blogs -- in the months since she gave birth to her first child, a boy, last August. 
 The results of the weight loss -- Ms. Hudson says in one television spot that ''I've never been this size in my adult life'' -- are on display in three 30-second and one 15-second commercials, which make up the Weight Watchers campaign that began Sunday. Weight Watchers, which holds more than 30,000 weekly meetings in the United States for people trying to lose weight, spends about $90 million a year on advertising campaigns.
 The commercials show a slimmed-down Ms. Hudson, who competed on ''American Idol'' in 2004, and are meant to convey that she is a ''regular woman who has struggled with her weight, but has found a winning formula that works for her life,'' said Cheryl Callan, director for marketing at Weight Watchers North America.
 Although the percentage of American women who say they are dieting is declining -- 25 percent today compared with 36 percent in 1991, according to a weekly diet survey by the NPD Group, a research company -- consumers still spend billions of dollars annually on diet pills and meals, gym memberships and other related products. 
 Weight Watchers is one of the country's top weight loss programs, but it had a nearly 10 percent drop in revenue last year, according to industry research firm Hoover's. 
 Although competitors have also felt the economy's pinch, Weight Watchers is not ceding an inch of the market. In January, the company took its main rival, Jenny Craig, to court. Weight Watchers demanded that Jenny Craig, a division of Nestle, stop broadcasting a commercial, featuring the actress Valerie Bertinelli, which claimed that a major clinical trial had concluded that Jenny Craig clients, who eat packaged meals, lost about twice as much weight as clients of the ''largest weight-loss program'' -- which would be Weight Watchers. 
 The United States District Court in Manhattan last month temporarily blocked the commercial after Weight Watchers, which uses a points-based food assessment system, argued that the television spot was deceptive and that no such study existed. 
 The same month, the court temporarily barred Curves International from showing a commercial that Weight Watchers argued had unfairly used its trademarks to attract viewers. 
 Last fall, Weight Watchers brought a separate action against Nestle, claiming that its Skinny Cow brand of Dreyer's ice cream wrongly used the Weight Watchers symbol on its products. 
 Weight Watchers has long used star power in its campaigns. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, was its spokeswoman in the United States from 1997 to 2007, and the actress Jenny McCarthy did a stint last year. 
 Jenny Craig followed suit with the actress Kirstie Alley, and now Ms. Bertinelli. Ms. Callan said that the relationship with Ms. Hudson ''was made in heaven because Jennifer was looking for something long-term and sustainable.''
 ''She is very relatable and accessible,'' Ms. Callan said ''And she's interested in being a role mode.'' 
 The partnership has a significant online component, reflecting the near doubling of the company's online subscribers from 2005 to 2009. Subscribers, who pay $17.95 a month, totaled 763,000 in 2009, up from 399,000 in 2005, said Hoover's industry editor, Linnea Kirgan.
 Ms. Hudson's Weight Watchers role began with a live Facebook chat, and she has started to blog about her weight loss on weightwatchers.com. The blog will include commentary on what she likes to eat, recipes and exercise tips, Ms. Callan said. Later this spring, the blog will include her experiences making a film in South Africa about Winnie Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela.
 The four Weight Watchers commercials were filmed at the same time, with Ms. Hudson dressed casually in pants, a striped shirt and a cardigan, in a music studio setting. The look and setting were chosen ''because we wanted people to be able to see her body, with clothing that shows her new shape,'' said Joyce King Thomas, chief creative officer for McCann Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which handled the campaign.
 ''She struggles with her weight, just like many people, so she is relatable and inspirational,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''We want her to inspire other people that if she can do it, they can do it.'' 
 ''We also tried to catch her pride in how she looks and feels, and her happiness,'' Ms. Thomas said.
 The commercials will appear on prime-time shows, including ''Dancing With the Stars,'' ''Extreme Home Makeover,'' ''How I Met Your Mother'' and on all three national morning shows as well as on ''Ellen,'' ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ''The View'' and ''Live With Regis and Kelly.'' Print ads will appear in O, Ms. Winfrey's magazine, and in the Weight Watchers magazine.

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis Inquiry Wrestles With Setbacks

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ERIC DASH; Sewell Chan reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The panel established by Congress to investigate the causes of the financial crisis has been hobbled by delays and internal disagreements and a lack of focus, according to interviews with a majority of its members and government officials briefed on its work.
 In recent months, a top investigator resigned, frustrated by delays in assembling a staff. Behind closed doors the panel's chairman and vice chairman have had heated disagreements over whether to make public preliminary findings or revelatory documents. Entities like Citigroup and the Treasury have complained that the panel's requests for information have been vague and voluminous. 
 The people appointed to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last July, six by Democrats and four by Republicans, say they hope to publish, by the Dec. 15 deadline, a volume much like the 9/11 Commission report, which was acclaimed for its narrative sweep and became a surprise best seller.
 But that goal seems increasingly out of reach, given what the commissioners themselves acknowledge has been a haphazard approach and a lack of time and resources. Given the delays, the commission's impact on policy could be modest; the House has already voted on a sweeping financial reform bill, and the Senate could vote on it by summer.
 The commission has been set back not so much by partisan bickering but by the size of its task: examining and explaining a crisis whose complex and often technical causes continue to befuddle ordinary Americans. 
 In an interview, the commission's chairman, Phil Angelides, said the panel was struggling to satisfy a broad mandate to examine the role of 22 factors in bringing about the crisis. He pointed out that the panel had a budget of just $8 million, compared with the $38 million spent by a federal bankruptcy trustee who dissected the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 
 Even though the panel is backward-looking and will not issue formal recommendations, Mr. Angelides said he hoped its findings would be authoritative and useful for future policy makers. 
 But Bill Thomas, the Republican vice chairman of the panel and a former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged, ''We are limited by time.''
 In interviews, nearly all of the 10 commissioners agreed to discuss the panel's work, though most declined to be quoted by name. Several urged patience and said the disagreements were a sign of healthy debate. ''The proof will be in the outcome,'' said Heather H. Murren, a political independent who was named to the commission by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. 
 But a few commissioners said they were concerned that Mr. Angelides was more interested in holding prominent hearings than in selecting a few targets for deep examination. For example, the chief executives of four Wall Street banks testified in January, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, will testify on Wednesday. The commission has issued no subpoenas even though it has the power to do so.
 The hearings this week will ostensibly focus on how subprime loans were packaged and originated, with a focus on Citigroup. Mr. Thomas acknowledged that the hearings were somewhat wide-ranging, likening them to a ''Whitman's Sampler'' that will give a taste of the topics the final report will cover.
 The commission's executive director, J. Thomas Greene, was named in September but took several months to assemble a staff of 49, leading one investigator, Martin T. Biegelman, an expert on corporate fraud, to resign during the winter. Twelve staff members are on loan from agencies like the Federal Reserve. The commission struggled to hire researchers and investigators with expertise in areas like structured finance or accounting.
 ''We lost a fair amount of time on the front end,'' said one commissioner, Keith Hennessey, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. ''Part of it was negotiations between Angelides and Thomas on the senior staff, but I don't know why it took so long to assemble a full staff.'' 
 Commissioners also said that Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas recently clashed over whether to release preliminary staff reports or some of the 500,000 pages of materials that had been gathered so far. When Mr. Angelides floated the idea of releasing some of the materials to reporters, Republicans threatened to look into the panel's work if they took control of the House, a person briefed on the dispute said. A spokesman for the panel denied that the exchange had occurred.
 Ms. Murren said that it made sense to release some early findings. ''A large part of our responsibility is to allow the American people to see this process as transparent and understandable,'' she said. ''Most people see finance as incredibly obscure. I think it would be helpful to put out a set of facts that we can all agree upon. Put them in the public domain.''
 Tensions were exacerbated, two members said, after Mr. Angelides was linked last month to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into donations by a JPMorgan Chase executive to his 2002 re-election campaign for California treasurer. Mr. Angelides was not accused of wrongdoing.
 In August 2002, the S.E.C. found, David A. Coulter, a vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase, sent the bank's executive committee ''a handwritten note stating that the California treasurer is an important client and soliciting their help in raising $10,000'' for a fund-raiser in New York. 
 Mr. Coulter and other executives gave $9,000, and the bank later won work underwriting more than 50 bond sales, for which it was paid $37 million. Though Mr. Coulter did not work for JPMorgan Chase's bond-underwriting subsidiary, the donation broke a rule that bans a broker-dealer from underwriting bonds within two years of making a political contribution to the issuer, the S.E.C. found.
 Mr. Coulter, who now works at Warburg Pincus, declined to comment. Cathy Calfo, who managed Mr. Angelides's campaign, said it ''would have returned the contribution'' had it known it was improper.

HEADLINE: Surprisingly, Family Time Has Grown

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE

 BODY:
Working parents perpetually agonize that they don't see enough of their children. But a surprising new study finds that mothers and fathers alike are doing a better job than they think, spending far more time with their families than did parents of earlier generations.
 The study, by two economists at the University of California, San Diego, analyzes a dozen surveys of how Americans say they use their time, taken at different periods from 1965 to 2007. It reports that the amount of child care time spent by parents at all income levels - and especially those with a college education - has risen ''dramatically'' since the mid-1990s. (The findings by the husband-and-wife economist team of Garey Ramey and Valerie A. Ramey appear in a discussion paper presented in March at a Brookings Institution conference in Washington.) 
 Before 1995, mothers spent an average of about 12 hours a week attending to the needs of their children. By 2007, that number had risen to 21.2 hours a week for college-educated women and 15.9 hours for those with less education.
 Although mothers still do most of the parenting, fathers also registered striking gains: to 9.6 hours a week for college-educated men, more than double the pre-1995 rate of 4.5 hours; and to 6.8 hours for other men, up from 3.7, according to an additional analysis by Betsey Stevenson and Dan Sacks, economists at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 Family researchers say the news should offer relief to guilt-stricken working parents.
 ''Parents are feeling like they don't have enough time with their children,'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute in New York, which conducts research on the work force. ''It's a function of people working so hard, and they are worried they're shortchanging their children. I've never found a group of parents who believe they are spending enough time with their kids.''
 Although previous studies have shown increases in parenting time starting in the 1990s, the study by the Rameys is important because it links so many time-use surveys and also breaks the data down by age of the child and education level.
 The rise in child-centered time is just one of the ways the American family is changing. Couples are typically waiting longer to get married and begin having children. Divorce rates are dropping with each generation.
 And notably, children are no longer so widely viewed as essential to a happy marriage. In 1990, 65 percent of Americans said that children were ''very important'' to a successful marriage, but by 2007, the number of adults who agreed with that statement had dropped to 41 percent, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center.
 In fact, the surge in parenting time may say more about modern marriage than about modern child care practices, Dr. Stevenson said. She notes that among college-educated parents, two- to two-and-a-half hours of the increased time takes place when both parents are together. ''Everybody gets in the car,'' she said, ''and mom and dad both cheer on the kid.''
 That may reflect a rise in what Dr. Stevenson calls the ''hedonic marriage,'' in which couples share home and work responsibilities so they can spend more time together.
 By contrast, couples from earlier generations typically had ''specialized'' roles that tended to keep them apart - the husband working at a job to support the family, the wife staying home to raise the children.
 ''We're seeing a rise in marriages where we're picking people we like to do activities with,'' Dr. Stevenson said. ''So it's not surprising we're going to see that some of the activities we want do together involve our children.''
 So where is the extra time coming from? Women, in particular, are spending less time cooking and cleaning their homes, while men are putting in fewer hours at the office. A 2007 report in The Quarterly Journal of Economics showed that leisure time among men and women surged four to eight hours a week from 1965 to 2003.
 Notably, the data in the Ramey study do not count the hours mothers and fathers spend ''around'' their children - at the dinner table, for example, or in solitary play. Instead, the survey tracks specific activities in which the parent is directly involved in the child's care.
 ''It's taking them to school, helping with homework, bathing them, playing catch with them in the back yard,'' said a co-author of the leisure-time paper, Erik Hurst, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''Those are the activities that have increased over the last 15 to 20 years.''
 Dr. Galinsky notes that although working parents typically feel guilty for not spending more time at home, children often have a different reaction. In a landmark study published as ''Ask the Children'' (Harper, 2000), she asked more than 1,000 children about their ''one wish'' for their parents. Although parents expected their children would wish for more family time, the children wanted something different.
 ''Kids were more likely to wish that their parents were less tired and less stressed,'' Dr. Galinsky said.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Renewal, Without Sanctuary

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For New York sports fans, the last few months have embodied lyrics from a well-worn Beatles song: Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter.
 The Giants -- O.K., they actually play in New Jersey but cling to the New York name -- were a thorough disappointment, and by season's end didn't even seem to be trying. The Jets -- they, too, make their home in New Jersey while appropriating New York's name -- offered wisps of hope but then, as ever, disappointed. The Knicks are laughable, and the future Brooklyn Nets unspeakable.
 But now it is early spring, and here comes the sun. Here comes baseball. A new season has begun. 
 It is our game, the American game, to borrow words ascribed to Walt Whitman, though perhaps Whitman overstated his case by predicting that baseball will ''tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic set.'' With or without baseball, the denizens of this city are likely to always be a nervous, dyspeptic bunch.
 But for New Yorkers who care about such things, the sport brings a promise of renewal and redemption. The Yankees entered the season in their accustomed place as champions, and have reason to believe they will end the year the same way. The Mets, schooled in the Charlie Brown ''good grief'' version of the game, can hope that for them this is, at last, next year.
 Baseball, however, is no sanctuary from the real world. It never has been. But, more than usual, outside forces are buffeting aspects of the game in New York.
 The Mets' season began on Monday in a Queens ballpark whose very name is a reminder of so much that went wrong on Wall Street and sent the economy into a free fall. Citi Field pays homage to Citigroup, which was forced to go on taxpayer-financed life support. Yet despite being a welfare case, the company is allowed to spend something like $400 million over 20 years to indulge its vanity. A more appropriate name for the ballpark, some New Yorkers would say, is Debits Field.
 Any mention of the team's principal owners, the Wilpon family, invariably evokes the Bernard L. Madoff scandal. The Wilpons were among Mr. Madoff's more prominent clients, with investments large enough to make anyone nervous and dyspeptic.
 If you buy Yankee tickets, assuming you can afford the nosebleed-inducing prices, you are reminded of the scandal that continues to threaten the governorship of David A. Paterson.
 Mr. Paterson has been accused by a state ethics commission of falsely testifying about getting free tickets to a World Series game at Yankee Stadium last fall. No doubt, many people wonder what the big deal is. We're talking, after all, about a few seats at a baseball game. Unfortunately for the governor, lying under oath is what people in the district attorney's office call a crime. The matter remains under investigation. A criminal charge might well find Mr. Paterson packing his bags.
 BASEBALL also incorporates issues of God and Mammon.
 Some New York ballplayers, like athletes elsewhere, make a show of thanking the Deity when they perform well. Typically, a batter who hits a home run raises an index finger skyward as he crosses the plate. A pitcher who gets out of a tight jam does the same thing as he leaves the mound.
 The gesture is one of gratitude. Some may view it as admirable piety. It does, however, raise questions about what we are to make of it.
 Did God drop everything else to smile on that batter? If he did, what terrible deed had been committed by the pitcher who served up the home run to earn such celestial wrath (aside from playing for the wrong team)? Theologians may want to weigh in.
 More down to earth is the future of real estate in the corner of the Bronx where the Yankees make a living. Their old stadium is finally being dismantled. Disputes flourish over whether residents of that neighborhood will get replacement parkland comparable to what they gave up for the new stadium. City officials say yes. Watchdog groups like NYC Park Advocates say no.
 No matter who is correct, one thing is certain: By now, three replacement ball fields were supposed to have occupied the site of the old stadium. Instead, there are bulldozers and mud.
 The good news is that there is almost no distress, including lost fields, that the game itself cannot soothe in the course of time. As Whitman said, baseball will ''repair these losses and be a blessing to us.''

HEADLINE: Strong Ties With India Goal of Trip By Geithner

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS and VIKAS BAJAJ; Heather Timmons reported from New Delhi and Vikas Bajaj from Mumbai, India.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, arrives in New Delhi on Tuesday for a two-day trip to inaugurate a new economic and financial partnership between two of the world's largest and oldest democracies. 
 It is a return of sorts for Mr. Geithner, who lived for five years in New Delhi as a child. 
 Mr. Geithner has his work cut out for him, economists and policy analysts in both India and the United States say. Reaching economic agreements between the two countries has traditionally been an arduous task. 
 ''On principle, they both agree on everything,'' said Jahangir Aziz, chief India economist at J. P. Morgan in Mumbai. ''It always comes down to the nitty-gritty and that's where things get stuck. Part of the problem is neither of them wants to give the other side an inch.'' 
 It took nearly 20 years for the United States to lift a ban on imports of Indian mangoes, for example, and a deal to allow energy-strapped India access to American nuclear technology, agreed to in principle four years ago, still has not cleared all the legal hurdles that would let American companies sign contracts here. The two countries remain far apart on American farm subsidies and India's unwillingness to open its markets to foreign farmers, because they both want to protect their agricultural sectors. The countries' disagreements there helped to scuttle global trade negotiations in 2008. 
 Indian officials expressed cautious optimism about Mr. Geithner's visit. 
 ''There is good reason to believe that there will be real economic outcomes to match the avowed ambition of such engagement,'' Rahul Khullar, India's commerce secretary, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions. 
 This should, in theory, be a fertile time for India and the United States to forge a new economic relationship. American companies, facing moribund sales at home, continue to flock to India, where the economy is projected to grow 8.5 percent this year. 
 United States businesses also remain the largest customers for India's marquee information technology industry. India, for its part, needs billions of dollars in infrastructure, and could benefit from American technology. 
 Some companies like Google and Facebook, which have either left or been banned from China, have captured huge audiences in India. 
 ''This doesn't mean everything is perfect in India, but the challenges firms are facing in China are certainly causing companies to take a second look -- with the benefit accruing to India,'' said Ron Somers, president of the United States-India Business Council, a group based in Washington that promotes business ties between the two countries. 
 Those ties have grown significantly since India began to open its economy in the early 1990s. Bilateral trade has tripled in the last 10 years, to $37.6 billion. American private investment in India is worth $16.1 billion, about 10 times what it was in the late 1990s. 
 But India still lags far behind the United States' most important economic partnerships. 
 Moreover, political leaders in Washington and New Delhi have often struggled to establish trust with each other. The Bush administration won over many Indian leaders because it championed the nuclear deal and was seen as tough on terrorism. But many Indian politicians and newspapers have a less favorable view of President Obama because they think that his administration is pushing India to open negotiations with Pakistan prematurely. 
 ''This issue has generated doubts in Indians' minds that makes it a lot more difficult to reach the comfort levels we achieved during the Bush administration,'' said C. Raja Mohan, an Indian academic who is the Henry Alfred Kissinger scholar at the Library of Congress. 
 India and the United States need to have a ''total tectonic shift'' in the way they look at each other, suggested Amit Mitra, the secretary general of Ficci, India's main chamber of commerce. From a business point of view, that means removing India from a list of countries that cannot be sold numerous American-made technologies, among other things, he said. 
 ''Americans aren't in the big picture in the big projects in India,'' he said. Japanese and Korean companies, for example, are collaborating to build a nearly 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) freight corridor between Delhi and Mumbai. 
 Some of that work should be going to companies from the United States, he added. 
 During a briefing last week, Treasury officials said trade would not be high on the agenda during Mr. Geithner's visit. But he is expected to discuss infrastructure financing. 
 He is also expected to encourage Indian officials to raise the limits they have placed on foreign banks and insurance companies, but New Delhi seems reluctant to allow more foreign banks into the country unless the Federal Reserve allows more Indian banks to set up branches in the United States. 
 Any argument Mr. Geithner makes for a greater opening of financial markets is likely to be quickly shot down by Indian officials, who have said that the country's conservative regulations helped it avoid the worst elements of the recent crisis that started on Wall Street and engulfed many Western financial markets. 
 ''He should not publicly press India to open its financial sector,'' Arvind Subramanian, of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, wrote on the institute's Web site. ''India will open up its financial sector but at its own pace,'' he said. 
 One executive in Mumbai said policy makers in both countries needed to open up their economies. While India limits foreign investments in several industries, American immigration policy restricts the free flow of people. ''Policy makers in both countries will need to combat internal barriers and expedite action on pending reforms to open up new sectors,'' said Harshal Shah, chief executive of Reliance Venture Asset Management, an investment firm based in Mumbai.
 Recently, the Indian authorities have given new banking licenses to Credit Suisse and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. But India has not allowed most American and European banks to open many new branches in the country. 
 Mr. Geithner appears to understand the nuances of the Indian-American relationship. 
 Speaking to Indian reporters in Washington before he left, he praised Indian policy makers for their management of the economy. He also said the United States could help the country set up a corporate bond market. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that India needs a well-functioning bond market to help finance $1 trillion in infrastructure investment.

HEADLINE: Airlines, Masters of Overbooking, Are Looking to Limit Bumping

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD and MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
Ryan Kingsbury is the rare flier who's actually looking to be bumped from a flight.
 ''If I see a big weather system, I see big dollar signs,'' said Mr. Kingsbury, an aeronautical engineer from Boston who claims he has earned about $6,700 in flight vouchers over the last three years. His latest coup was picking up $600 in flight vouchers and a hotel room after giving up his seat on an overbooked red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Washington in bad weather in January. 
 But savvy travelers like Mr. Kingsbury are having to work harder than ever to exploit loopholes in the travel system. Even as airlines have substantially cut capacity -- meaning fewer but more crowded flights -- they have so refined their computer tools over the last decade that they can pretty much predict which passengers will show up for a flight and which ones won't. In the process, they have gotten better at the science of overbooking a flight. 
 Last year, 13 out of every 10,000 passengers were bumped on domestic flights -- or 762,422 out of a total of 582 million. That was down from over 20 per 10,000 passengers in 1999, according to the Department of Transportation. In over 90 percent of cases, airlines found volunteers to give up their seats in exchange for some compensation. 
 The airlines argue that they must overbook to make up for passengers who fail to show up. For an industry desperate to return to profitability after losing $60 billion in the last decade, an empty seat at takeoff equals one thing: lost revenue. 
 ''A seat is a perishable item,'' said Leon Kinloch, the senior vice president for pricing and revenue management at Continental Airlines. ''It's like a fruit that spoils. The moment the door is closed, that item has perished.''
 So the airlines are imposing more restrictive booking policies. Most airlines, for instance, require travelers to buy their tickets within 24 hours of booking them, forcing travelers to stick with their plans or risk steep penalties to change tickets.
 And the airlines have invested in new software to get a better sense of how many passengers will actually show up for a flight. They look at historical data on specific routes, the time of the day, whether there is a holiday, what fares passengers paid and how many business-class travelers are booked with refundable tickets. 
 Mr. Kingsbury, the Boston flier who tries to get bumped, says he books flights he thinks are likely to be oversold. He will pick the last flight of the day, for instance, and then tell the check-in clerks or gate agents that he is willing to give up his seat should it be needed. He also prays for bad weather, which increases his chances of getting bumped.
 Not all airlines practice the art of overbooking. JetBlue Airways offers only one class of service and most of its tickets are not refundable, meaning passengers are more likely to show up. As a result, last year, it had only one oversold seat for 5.1 million passengers.
 ''It's like a theater overselling tickets for a show,'' said Dave Barger, the president and chief executive of JetBlue. ''It's wrong.''
 Don Casey, the vice president of revenue management at American Airlines, said, ''As an industry under such financial duress, we have had to come up with ways of making ourselves more efficient.'' 
 About 60,000 passengers boarded 450 American Airlines flights on a sunny day at the end of March in Dallas-Fort Worth. Seventeen flights had a total of 50 oversold seats; 48 people volunteered for a later flight. Two people were bumped involuntarily.
 Thanks to a better understanding of its booking patterns, Mr. Casey said American now overbooked about 5 percent of its seats, down from about 12 percent a decade ago. 
 In 1999, the company said it had on average about 72 percent of its seats filled and 35.2 out of every 10,000 seats were oversold. Last year, the company filled 82 percent of its seats while the number of oversold seats had dropped to 8.3 for each 10,000 passengers. 
 Bill S. Swelbar, a research engineer with M.I.T.'s International Center for Air Transportation, called this ''the dark art of revenue management.'' 
 The trouble, of course, is that the airlines' mathematical wizards don't always get it right. 
 Tiffany Sumlin, a stay-at-home mother from Fresno, Calif., nearly missed her grandmother's funeral viewing after she was involuntarily bumped from her Delta Air Lines flight to Houston last month when connecting in Salt Lake City. 
 ''They had overbooked the flight and I was not going to get on,'' said Mrs. Sumlin, who was left behind with another passenger when no one volunteered to give up a seat in exchange for flight vouchers. She was initially offered $400 and a flight out the next day -- but that meant being late. 
 ''I would have literally been landing during my grandmother's viewing,'' Mrs. Sumlin said. She eventually made it in time -- but not before flying first to Atlanta, spending the night there, and getting an early-morning flight to Houston. 
 Not every passenger is equal when it comes to being bumped: business-class travelers and frequent fliers holding elite status are much less likely to get bumped. The last in line are leisure travelers holding discounted fares. (Online check-in reduces somewhat your chances of being bumped. Most airlines offer that option up to 24 hours before departure and strongly suggest that passengers use it.) 
 Passengers who are involuntarily bumped, like Mrs. Sumlin, and rebooked on another flight within two hours after their original domestic flight time (or within four hours for international flights) are entitled to $400 in cash -- double the compensation offered two years ago, according to Department of Transportation regulations. They are eligible for up to $800 if they are not rerouted by then. 
 But getting people to volunteer is tricky these days. Full planes mean that the next flight for bumped passengers may be the next day.
 While fewer people are getting bumped over all, the share of passengers being denied boarding involuntarily is going up. Last year, 1.19 of every 10,000 passengers had their seats taken away outright, the highest rate since 1996.
 One reason is that airlines are flying fewer planes in a bid to cope with high fuel costs and lower demand in the recession. Domestic capacity has fallen for five of the last nine years, the most sustained cutback in the history of commercial aviation. 
 The winter storms that led to chaos in the nation's air transportation system demonstrated just how little wiggle room airlines had. 
 ''I think this summer is going to be pretty good for airlines but the flip side is it is going to be awful for travelers,'' said Tim Winship, the editor at large for SmarterTravel.com, a Web site offering travel advice. That is good news for Mr. Kingsbury, who says he is looking forward to the coming months when tight capacity, the spring and summer travel crunch and weather cancellations could increase bumping. 
 ''I think this coming summer it will be very lucrative for people doing bumps,'' he said. ''I'll just sit back and watch the chaos.''

HEADLINE: In Syria, a Prologue for Cities

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 BODY:
Archaeologists have embarked on excavations in northern Syria expected to widen and deepen understanding of a prehistoric culture in Mesopotamia that set the stage for the rise of the world's first cities and states and the invention of writing.
 In two seasons of preliminary surveying and digging at the site known as Tell Zeidan, American and Syrian investigators have already uncovered a tantalizing sampling of artifacts from what had been a robust pre-urban settlement on the upper Euphrates River. People occupied the site for two millenniums, until 4000 B.C. -- a little-known but fateful period of human cultural evolution.
 Scholars of antiquity say that Zeidan should reveal insights into life in a time called the Ubaid period, 5500 to 4000 B.C. In those poorly studied centuries, irrigation agriculture became widespread, long-distance trade grew in influence socially and economically, powerful political leaders came to the fore and communities gradually divided into social classes of wealthy elites and poorer commoners. 
 Gil Stein, director of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, a leader of the excavations at Zeidan, said the site's northern location promised to enrich knowledge of the Ubaid culture's influence far from where the first urban centers eventually flourished in the lower Tigris and Euphrates Valley. The new explorations, he said, are planned to be the most comprehensive yet at a large Ubaid settlement, possibly yielding discoveries for decades.
 ''I figure I'm going to be working there till I retire,'' said Dr. Stein, who is 54.
 There are several reasons for excitement over the Zeidan excavations. Warfare and ensuing unstable conditions have locked archaeologists out of Iraq and its prime sites of Mesopotamian antiquity. So they have redoubled research in the upper river valleys, across the border in Syria and southern Turkey. And Zeidan is readily accessible. Having never been built upon by subsequent cultures, it is free of any overburden of ruins to thwart excavators.
 Above all, a driving ambition of archaeologists always is to dig beneath the known past for more than glimpses of the little known.
 For almost two centuries, the glory went to expeditions unearthing the houses and temples, granaries and workshops of earliest urban centers like Uruk, seat of the legendary Gilgamesh, and the later splendors of Ur and Nineveh. The challenge was to decipher the clay tablets of a literate civilization with beginnings in what is known as the Uruk period, 4000 to 3200 B.C.
 Uruk remains overshadowed the traces of Ubaid cultures, the region's earliest known complex society. Only a handful of ruins -- at Ubaid, Eridu and Oueili in southern Mesopotamia and Tepe Gawra, in the north near Mosul, Iraq -- had produced at best a sketchy picture of these older cultures. A few Ubaid sites in northern Syria were either too small to be revealing or virtually inaccessible under other ruins.
 A decade ago, Richard L. Zettler, a University of Pennsylvania archaeologist with extensive experience in Syria, said, ''Our real focus now should not be on the Uruk period, but the Ubaid.''
 Last week, Dr. Zettler, who is not associated with the Chicago team but has visited the site, said that Zeidan preserves artifacts over a long sequence of Ubaid culture at a junction of major trade routes. ''We should see the transition as the Ubaid spread from the south up to farming regions in the north,'' he said.
 Guillermo Algaze, an anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, and an authority on early urbanism in the Middle East not involved in new research, said recently that Zeidan ''has the potential to revolutionize current interpretations of how civilization in the Near East came about.''
 Tell Zeidan is a two-hour drive southeast of Aleppo and three miles from the modern town of Raqqa. Muhammad Sarhan, a curator of the Raqqa Museum, is co-director, with Dr. Stein, of the excavations, formally known as the Joint Syrian-American Archaeological Research Project at Tell Zeidan.
 The site consists of three large mounds on the east bank of the Balikh River, just north of its confluence with the Euphrates. The mounds, the tallest being 50 feet high, enclose ruins of a lower town. Buried remains and a scattering of ceramics on the surface extend over an area of 31 acres, which makes this probably larger than any other known Ubaid community.
 It would seem that the mounds had long stood on the semi-arid landscape as an open invitation for archaeologists to stop and dig. A few stopped. The American archaeologist William F. Albright identified the place in 1926. The British archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, husband of the mystery writer Agatha Christie, was intrigued and made a brief survey in the 1930s. A Dutch team led by Maurits van Loon took an interest in 1983, finding that the site appeared to date to the Ubaid period.
 Finally, after initial visits to Zeidan, Dr. Stein said the Syrian government ''encouraged me to submit an application'' to dig. Why the change?
 ''I was incredibly thrilled, but can only speculate on what their reasons were,'' Dr. Stein said in a recent interview, referring to the Syrian decision. ''Perhaps they were waiting for the right team to come along. Our institute had worked in Syria for something like 80 years, and we were interested in a long-term commitment. We also pointed out that the site was endangered from agricultural development along its edges. Parts of the site had already been bulldozed for fields and a canal.''
 In the summers of 2008 and 2009, Dr. Stein directed mapping of the Zeidan ruins and digging exploratory trenches. He said the initial findings confirmed this to be a ''proto-urban community'' in the Ubaid period, most likely the site of a prominent temple.
 A description and interpretation of the discoveries so far was published in the Oriental Institute's recent annual report, followed by an announcement this week by the University of Chicago. The international excavation team, supported by the National Science Foundation in the United States, is to resume fieldwork in July.
 Four distinct phases of occupation have been identified at Zeidan. A simpler culture known as the Halaf is found in the bottom sediments, well-preserved Ubaid material in the middle and two layers of late Copper Age remains on top. From the evidence so far, the transitions between periods seemed to have been peaceful.
 Archaeologists have turned up remains of house floors with hearths, fragments of mudbrick house walls, painted Ubaid pottery and sections of larger walls, possibly part of fortifications or monumental public architecture. The ceramic styles and radiocarbon tests date the wall to about 5000 B.C.
 One of the most telling finds was a stone seal depicting a deer, presumably used to stamp a mark on goods to identify ownership in a time before writing. About 2-by 2- 1/2 inches, the seal is unusually large and carved from a red stone not native to the area. In fact, archaeologists said, it was similar in design to a seal found 185 miles to the east, at Tepe Gawra, near Mosul.
 To archaeologists, a seal is not just a seal. Dr. Zettler said it signifies that ''somebody has the authority to restrict access to things -- to close and seal jars, bags, doors -- and so once you have these seals you must have had social stratification.''
 The existence of elaborate seals with near-identical motifs at such widely distant sites, Dr. Stein said, ''suggests that in this period, high-ranking elites were assuming leadership positions across a very broad region, and those dispersed elites shared a common set of symbols and perhaps even a common ideology of superior social status.''
 Other artifacts attest to the culture's shift from self-sufficient village life to specialized craft production dependent on trade and capable of acquiring luxury goods, the archaeologists reported. Such a transition is assumed to have required some administrative structure and produced a wealthy class. The expedition will be searching for remains of temples and imposing public buildings as confirmation of these political and social changes.
 In what appears to be the site's industrial area, archaeologists uncovered eight large kilns for firing pottery, one of the most ubiquitous Ubaid commodities over wide trading areas. They found blades made from the high-quality volcanic glass obsidian. An abundance of obsidian chips showed that the blades were produced at the site, and the material's color and chemical composition indicated that it came from mines in what is now Turkey.
 ''We found flint sickle blades everywhere,'' Dr. Stein said, noting that they had a glossy sheen ''where they had been polished by the silica in the stems of wheat that they were used to harvest.''
 Zeidan also had a smelting industry for making copper tools, the most advanced technology of the fifth millennium B.C. The people presumably reached as far as 250 miles away to trade for the nearest copper ore, at sources around modern-day Diyarbakir, Turkey. Getting the ore home was no easy task. In a time before the wheel or domesticated donkeys, people had to bear the heavy burden on their backs.
 A site like Tell Zeidan, Dr. Zettler said, is ''telling us that the Uruk cities didn't come out of nowhere, they evolved from foundations laid in the Ubaid period.''
 Until recently, Dr. Algaze said, ''accidents of data recovery'' had led scholars to think the origin of cities and states in Mesopotamia was ''a fairly abrupt occurrence in the fourth millennium that as concentrated in what is southern Iraq.''
 The southern cities may have been larger and more enduring, he said, but increasing exploration on the Mesopotamian periphery, especially the spread of trade and technology among interacting Ubaid cultures, suggests that ''the seed of urban civilization'' had been planted well before 4000 B.C.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 6 about planned archaeological excavations at the Tell Zeidan site in Syria included an incorrect reference from Gil J. Stein, director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, to the site's history. There is no evidence that a German expedition made an earlier request to excavate the site or that such a request was rejected.

HEADLINE: Now to Explain The Party Favors

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
On Thursday, two of the biggest -- and among the most tarnished -- names on Wall Street will testify in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in Washington: Charles O. Prince III, the former chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, and Robert E. Rubin, a former top adviser and director of the bank. On the watch of these men, Citigroup lost more money than almost any company in history, requiring an extraordinary government bailout.
 There are, of course, many important questions for the commissioners to ask these men about how and why the bank filled its balance sheet with so many bad subprime loans, taking on enough risk to nearly topple the system. 
 But there is one small question, not so obvious, that has been crying out for an answer for years, and it has nothing to do with exoticisms like C.D.O.'s or C.D.S.'s. Instead, this question is about incentives and compensation on Wall Street and a mind-set -- a group-think really -- that pervaded not just Citigroup but the entire industry.
 In 2007, Mr. Prince resigned from Citigroup under pressure, after the bank announced that it had written down $5.9 billion to account for the declining value of its mortgage assets and would most likely write down $8 billion to $11 billion more. (Boy, was that estimate off; those write-downs actually added up to tens of billions.)
 As a thank-you present for running the bank into the ground, the board gave Mr. Prince a parting gift valued at $12.5 million. Yes, you read that correctly, $12.5 million. That exit bonus was on top of the $68 million he received in stock and options he had accumulated over his many years at the company; a $1.7 million pension; and an office, car and driver for up to five years. In exchange, Mr. Prince signed an agreement not to compete with Citigroup for five years.
 This wasn't a case of the board paying out an exit bonus to a chief executive with no whiff of a problem, only to find time bombs ticking after he left. Mr. Rubin and Citigroup's other directors decided to pay the $12.5 million bonus knowing very well that Citigroup's market value had dropped by $64 billion during Mr. Prince's tenure.
 So the simple question for Mr. Rubin and Mr. Prince is, Why? Why would you knowingly reward such failure? What is it about the culture of Citigroup and Wall Street that encouraged you to approve such a large party favor? Why was there reason to give a bonus at all?
 Through representatives, both men declined to comment. But answers to these questions could be constructive in helping us understand the thought processes of those at the bank who were responsible for figuring out what had gone so terribly wrong that it led to the near failure of an American institution.
 Ultimately, a $12.5 million payday (it turned out to be closer to $10 million based on a formula linked to Citi's stock price) may seem mathematically irrelevant in the grand scheme of Citigroup's problems. And some people might argue that it was a run of bad luck and nothing more that led Mr. Prince, like so many others on Wall Street, to take on so much risk.
 But either way, the bonus is a symptom of a larger problem that has so enraged Main Street: a sense that on Wall Street, even big mistakes have no consequences.
 A couple of intrepid shareholders sued Citigroup's directors over the payment and several other questionable decisions. A Delaware judge dismissed most of their complaints, ruling that the board was protected by something called the ''business judgment rule.'' On the issue of the bonus, the judge said he didn't have enough evidence but seemed to lean in the same direction.
 Before we continue, a bit of background about ''the business judgment rule,'' also known among some lawyers as the ''stupidity rule.'' This rule, at its essence, means that no matter how dumb a board's decisions proved to be, as long as they were not fraudulent and were made in good faith, they were O.K. Even running a company into the ground is O.K. as long as the board provided a ''duty of care.''
 In fairness, the rule itself is important to protect board members so they can make decisions on behalf of the company without fear that every one of them could be litigated to death. But it also has kept a whole lot of directors out of hot water.
 For example, the court-appointed examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy case found that while the board might have made lots of mistakes along the way to Chapter 11, they were not liable to shareholder lawsuits for most of their decisions because they were protected by the business judgment rule.
 But the judge's finding in the Citi case is not likely to win sympathy from a bitter public or, for that matter, an angry Congress.
 The judge, William B. Chandler III, the chief judge of the Delaware Court of Chancery, wrote: ''It is understandable that investors, and others, want to find someone to hold responsible for these losses, and it is often difficult to distinguish between a desire to blame someone and a desire to force those responsible to account for their wrongdoing.''
 Ultimately, he explained, ''the discretion granted directors and managers allows them to maximize shareholder value in the long term by taking risks without the debilitating fear that they will be held personally liable if the company experiences losses. This doctrine also means, however, that when the company suffers losses, shareholders may not be able to hold the directors personally liable.''
 Judge Chandler makes a well-reasoned argument. But paying an executive on his way out seems to have little to do with maximizing ''shareholder value in the long term by taking risks'' and everything to do with rewarding failure, the exact problem that so many want fixed.
 So Mr. Prince and Mr. Rubin: Why? Please explain.

HEADLINE: Relax, We'll Be Fine

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
According to recent polls, 60 percent of Americans think the country is heading in the wrong direction. The same percentage believe that the U.S. is in long-term decline. The political system is dysfunctional. A fiscal crisis looks unavoidable. There are plenty of reasons to be gloomy.
 But if you want to read about them, stop right here. This column is a great luscious orgy of optimism. Because the fact is, despite all the problems, America's future is exceedingly bright. 
 Over the next 40 years, demographers estimate that the U.S. population will surge by an additional 100 million people, to 400 million over all. The population will be enterprising and relatively young. In 2050, only a quarter will be over 60, compared with 31 percent in China and 41 percent in Japan.
 In his book, ''The Next Hundred Million: America in 2050,'' uber-geographer Joel Kotkin sketches out how this growth will change the national landscape. Extrapolating from current trends, he describes an archipelago of vibrant suburban town centers, villages and urban cores.
 The initial wave of suburbanization was sprawling and featureless. Tom Wolfe once observed that you only knew you were in a new town when you began to see a new set of 7-Elevens. But humans need meaningful places, so developers have been filling in with neo-downtowns -- suburban gathering spots where people can dine, work, go to the movies and enjoy public space.
 Over the next 40 years, Kotkin argues, urban downtowns will continue their modest (and perpetually overhyped) revival, but the real action will be out in the compact, self-sufficient suburban villages. Many of these places will be in the sunbelt -- the drive to move there remains strong -- but Kotkin also points to surging low-cost hubs on the Plains, like Fargo, Dubuque, Iowa City, Sioux Falls, and Boise.
 The demographic growth is driven partly by fertility. The American fertility rate is 50 percent higher than Russia, Germany or Japan, and much higher than China. Americans born between 1968 and 1979 are more family-oriented than the boomers before them, and are having larger families.
 In addition, the U.S. remains a magnet for immigrants. Global attitudes about immigration are diverging, and the U.S. is among the best at assimilating them (while China is exceptionally poor). As a result, half the world's skilled immigrants come to the U.S. As Kotkin notes, between 1990 and 2005, immigrants started a quarter of the new venture-backed public companies.
 The United States already measures at the top or close to the top of nearly every global measure of economic competitiveness. A comprehensive 2008 Rand Corporation study found that the U.S. leads the world in scientific and technological development. The U.S. now accounts for a third of the world's research-and-development spending. Partly as a result, the average American worker is nearly 10 times more productive than the average Chinese worker, a gap that will close but not go away in our lifetimes.
 This produces a lot of dynamism. As Stephen J. Rose points out in his book ''Rebound: Why America Will Emerge Stronger From the Financial Crisis,'' the number of Americans earning between $35,000 and $70,000 declined by 12 percent between 1980 and 2008. But that's largely because the number earning over $105,000 increased by 14 percent. Over the past 10 years, 60 percent of American adults made more than $100,000 in at least one or two of those years, and 40 percent had incomes that high for at least three.
 As the world gets richer, demand will rise for the sorts of products Americans are great at providing -- emotional experiences. Educated Americans grow up in a culture of moral materialism; they have their sensibilities honed by complicated shows like ''The Sopranos,'' ''The Wire'' and ''Mad Men,'' and they go on to create companies like Apple, with identities coated in moral and psychological meaning, which affluent consumers crave.
 As the rising generation leads an economic revival, it will also participate in a communal one. We are living in a global age of social entrepreneurship.
 In 1964, there were 15,000 foundations in the U.S. By 2001, there were 61,000. In 2007, total private giving passed $300 billion. Participation in organizations like City Year, Teach for America, and College Summit surges every year. Suburbanization helps. For every 10 percent reduction in population density, the odds that people will join a local club rise by 15 percent. The culture of service is now entrenched and widespread.
 In sum, the U.S. is on the verge of a demographic, economic and social revival, built on its historic strengths. The U.S. has always been good at disruptive change. It's always excelled at decentralized community-building. It's always had that moral materialism that creates meaning-rich products. Surely a country with this much going for it is not going to wait around passively and let a rotten political culture drag it down.

HEADLINE: The Downsizer

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup is getting smaller, and maybe even better.
 Just 13 months ago, Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, was facing the unthinkable. After bailouts worth $45 billion, the federal government had become the largest shareholder of a bank that was once among the biggest on the planet. 
 Citigroup's shares were selling at barely a dollar each, having fallen from about $20 a year earlier and $50 a year before that. 
 There was even talk of nationalization, a move that would have wiped out shareholders and cost Mr. Pandit his job and his legacy. 
 Fittingly, New York magazine called Mr. Pandit the ''Most Powerless Powerful Man on Wall Street.'' 
 Today, Mr. Pandit is still at the helm, and through a series of small but important moves, he is quietly asserting his influence. Piece by piece, he is shedding complex businesses like the insurance and retail brokerage units, shrinking the bank's balance sheet and stabilizing its finances.
 Slowly, Citigroup is breaking with its troubled past. Indeed, when the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission begins hearings this week on Citigroup's near collapse, the panel will focus not on Mr. Pandit but on his predecessors: the former chief executive Charles O. Prince III and Robert E. Rubin, an influential board member and adviser.
 Mr. Pandit, who is accepting only $1 a year in pay until his bank is consistently profitable, still would not make anyone's short list of powerful Wall Street executives. But his stock is rising steadily along with that of Citigroup, which climbed 2 percent on Monday to close at $4.26.
 Some of Mr. Pandit's most trusted advisers notice a new bounce in his step and say he is more energetic at meetings. 
 ''Vikram is looking and sounding a lot more confident and secure,'' said one top lieutenant. ''He has a smile on his face. He sees the day when he is going to earn more than a $1 a year.''
 That day, of course, may still be months away. With unemployment still high, losses tied to Citigroup's mortgage and credit card businesses have continued to climb. New financial rules, still being determined in Washington, could dampen profits further. 
 Even so, with the markets and the economy over all on the rebound, Citigroup could beat Wall Street's break-even consensus estimate and turn an operating profit for the first quarter. It reports on April 19.
 What is more, the government will soon begin selling off its 27 percent stake to private investors -- welcome news to taxpayers who stand to turn a multibillion-dollar profit.
 ''He inherited a huge hole and is doing the best he can,'' said Charles Peabody, a longtime banking analyst at Portales Partners in New York. ''But he has had to mortgage the future earnings power of the bank to repair the balance sheet.'' 
 ''That is what I am having a hard time envisioning -- when will that earnings momentum emerge?'' he added. 
 That question has been posed from the day Citigroup was forged by the blockbuster merger of Citicorp and the Travelers Group in 1998. At the time, Sanford I. Weill, its co-chairman and founder, vowed that the bank would become an earnings juggernaut with operations all over the globe.
 Mr. Weill promoted the idea of a financial services supermarket that could offer customers ''one-stop shopping'' among businesses as varied as retail banking, credit card lending, investment banking and insurance. The poor performance of one business or region could be offset by stronger results in others, helping to reduce risk.
 But those benefits never materialized. Instead, the bank's vast size and complexity made it difficult to manage -- and all of its businesses were devastated at once by the financial crisis. 
 Today, Mr. Pandit is peeling off pieces of the financial conglomerate and slowly but surely turning it back into a global bank modeled after the original Citicorp. ''We are breaking it up,'' he told the Congressional Oversight Panel last month. 
 Mr. Pandit is hesitant to boast about his successes, a humility that many longtime colleagues attribute to his Indian heritage. (He would not be interviewed so close to the bank's earnings announcement.) 
 But his results are starting to speak for themselves. 
 Indeed, Mr. Pandit has substantially shrunk Citigroup's giant balance sheet. It now stands at $1.86 trillion, down about $500 billion, or 21 percent, from its pre-crisis peak. 
 Much of that reduction has come from Citi Holdings, a unit set up in early 2009 that contains the businesses and assets that Mr. Pandit hopes to sell. Even in a buyer's market, he has reduced its size to $547 billion, from $662 billion last year -- without being taken to the cleaners. 
 Part of the shrinkage has come from the normal churn of residential mortgages and riskier private-label credit cards, which together make up about 60 percent of Citi Holdings. Another chunk has come from the sale of billions of dollars of steeply marked-down subprime mortgage bonds, giant buyout loans and other assets -- often at a profit. 
 Mr. Pandit has also divested the bank of 30 or so businesses as varied as the prized Smith Barney brokerage unit and an investment in a Japanese ski resort. 
 Just this quarter, he sold Citi Property investors, the bank's $12.5 billion real estate arm, to Apollo Management; entered talks with SkyBridge Capital to sell its ailing hedge fund unit; and began seeking a buyer for its $10 billion private equity group. (Mr. Pandit all but endorsed the so-called Volcker Rule, which would restrict banks from sponsoring private equity and hedge funds.) 
 Last week, Mr. Pandit pulled off a $320 million initial public offering of Primerica Financial after years of trying. He turned it into an attractive company by holding onto its weakest pieces, like its reinsurance assets, and securing Warburg Pincus as an anchor investor.
 Mr. Pandit has even begun convincing regulators that he is making progress. Although tensions remain between Citigroup and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, some of the bank's other regulators recently raised their regulatory rating on the bank's management, according to people briefed on the situation.
 They even signed off on a deal that allowed him to increase an investment in a foreign bank. Last month, he spent $519 million to increase the bank's interest in the company that controlled Banco de Chile, by exercising options from a complex deal in 2007. 
 That government nod would have been difficult a year ago. 
 Citigroup employees generally agree that management of the bank has improved. Both risk oversight and Citigroup's 15-person board have undergone makeovers. Top executives say business reviews are more comprehensive, too. Bankers are now rewarded for winning client business over the long term, not just for booking big quarterly profits. 
 Even amid the turmoil, it is remarkable how many leaders Mr. Pandit has managed to keep. Some middle-level bankers and traders fled to rivals over the last year. But only two of Citigroup's top 25 executives, and just one member of the investment bank's 34-person management committee, departed in 2009. 
 And for the first time in years, Mr. Pandit may be laying the groundwork for an orderly leadership hand-off in the investment bank. Many Citigroup insiders say they believe that Jamie Forese, the head of its large trading unit, will succeed John Havens in running the group. 
 Even so, Mr. Pandit has a long slog ahead. In the near term, Citigroup must contend with tougher oversight from Washington, including new credit card regulations and new accounting rules that will require the bank to bring tens of billions of dollars of off-balance-sheet assets back onto its books. 
 There will also be more red ink. For example, Citigroup has already marked down some of its commercial real estate securities a mere 6 cents, to 94 cents on the dollar. Analysts say more markdowns are almost certain.
 There also does not appear to be a coherent strategy for Citigroup's North American consumer banking franchise, which has struggled for years. Even Mr. Pandit's closest advisers say they do not know his plans. 
 Over all, he must set a course for growth even as he shrinks the company. And with nearly 28 billion shares outstanding -- a side effect of the government's extraordinary intervention -- it will remain difficult to move the stock price higher. 
 This may be Mr. Pandit's most vexing problem yet -- and one that could take another few years to get his arms around.

HEADLINE: Preserve, Protect and Defend? Considering Violent Protests and American Values

BYLINE: SARAH KAVANAGH and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Looking at acts of political violence in the context of history, media studies, social studies, math, language and fine arts, and civics. 

 BODY:
Overview | Who and what is America? What are American values and beliefs? What does it mean to "take America back"? When, if ever, should Americans use threats and violence to promote and defend their definitions of America? In this lesson, students consider the recent public displays of political anger directed at members of Congress to examine differing conceptions of America by engaging in one of several multidisciplinary activities. 
Materials | Statement posters (as described below), computers with Internet access (optional), research materials and handouts
Warm-Up | Before class, place four statement posters ("Strongly Agree," "Agree Somewhat," "Disagree Somewhat" and "Strongly Disagree") in the corners of the classroom. As students will be moving around to stand beneath the statements with which they most relate, make sure there is easy access to each corner. 
Read each of the statements below aloud and ask students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on that subject. As students take their places, write the statement on the board. Then, ask at least one student in each group to share his or her opinion.

        
I have experienced extreme anger at the government.
        
People should protest if they disagree with their government.
        
Sometimes citizens have to threaten or engage in violence when they disagree with their political leaders.
        
If the government made a decision that I believed was fundamentally wrong, I would protest publicly.
        
If my government made a decision that I believed was fundamentally wrong, I might engage in violent protest to make my point.
After the activity, ask students if they thought about any of the questions differently after hearing their peers talk about their own positions. Why or why not?
Related | In the article "When Does Political Anger Turn to Violence?", Benedict Carey examines the public displays of political anger bordering on violence that have followed the passage of the health care bill:
Public displays of political anger have been a staple of the American scene for the last eight months or so, but in recent days a handful directed at members of Congress have gone a bit further than noisy, sign-carrying assembly to window-smashing, spitting, threatening faxes and phone calls, even a cut propane line on a barbecue grill. At the end of last week, Democratic and Republican leaders, while denouncing any violence or threat of it, reached the point of trading accusations over who was most responsible.
Read the article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension: 

        
What are people angry about? How are they expressing their anger? 
        
According to the article, is anger contagious? How high is the risk that an angry group will become "radical" and violent? 
        
What historical examples does Benedict Carey cite in which incendiary rhetoric fomented violence? 
        
According to experts quoted in the article, what factors tip inflammatory, enraged talk into violent action? What factors contribute to the dissipation of anger?
        
After reading the article, do you think that people who have threatened or engaged in violence against members of Congress are justified or not? Do you expect the current wave of violent rhetoric, and violent acts, to escalate or subside? Why?
Activity | Following are some multidisciplinary ideas for examining the recent public displays of political anger that have included threats, vandalism and violent behavior in response to the passage of the health care bill. Two or more of these activities can also be easily combined into a single project.
History
Students compare and contrast recent public displays of political anger with one or more historical events in which citizens who disagreed with governmental authority threatened or enacted violence against their government. 
You might focus student attention on violent political movements currently or previously under consideration in the course. These might include the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Vietnam War protests and the protests against American public school integration. 
After conducting research, students compare and contrast the historical and contemporary actors' reasons for threatening and/or engaging in violent resistance. Areas to consider for comparison include the actions taken, the type and scale of the violent protest or resistance, instigators and targets. 
After the comparison, invite students to analyze these movements, drawing on their research to ground their responses. Ask: Do the groups' reasons justify their tactics? Why or why not? What might the government and/or the anti-government protesters learn from the outcome of the historical event in question? What might today's protesters, and government leaders, learn from history?
As a follow-up to classroom discussion, students write papers comparing the historical and contemporary events or letters to the editor of a local paper illustrating what certain contemporary actors might learn from comparing the current situation to history.
Journalism/Media Studies 
Split the class into two groups and inform them that they are going to examine current events - including threatened and real political violence - from two different perspectives, with half the class consuming news coverage and commentary from liberal sources and the other half, conservative sources. Ideally, they should focus on a single (and perhaps continuing) story, like the fallout from health care reform or the arrests of militia members in Michigan. 
For example, on the left they might read posts on Daily Kos or The Huffington Post and watch MSNBC's Keith Olbermann. On the right they might look at The Daily Caller or Townhall.com and watch Sean Hannity on Fox News. Other potential sources are listed here. 
As students read, watch and/or listen, they complete the "5 W's and an H" handout (PDF) and then write a few sentences describing how the reporter/commentator characterizes the event, as well as how the article, post or segment might be biased. Finally, each writes a personal reaction: Did he or she find the news coverage convincing? Why or why not? 
Next, have the two halves of the class switch perspectives and complete the same activity. When all students have had the opportunity to consume news from liberal and conservative perspectives, have them choose one article, post or segment to fact-check. Did the news source get its facts right? Or did it skew the information to achieve an effect? 
Bring the class together to compare the completed handouts, responses and fact-checking. Ask: Did both sides explain the basic elements of the topic - including facts, like statistics - similarly or differently? What was the difference between how each side described the implications and context? What did your fact-checking turn up? Are there any indicators that one side tends to be more accurate than the other? If so, what are they? Would it be difficult for people who got their news from one side to converse with someone who got it from another side? Why? Should we care that Americans are getting such different stories? Why or why not? 
Have the class consider evidence that people tend to seek out information and news that confirm their worldview and political leanings, which in turn continue to reinforce those views. Was this tendency at work in how students carried out the media comparison task? Did they find themselves more sympathetic to views that mirrored their own politics, and closed to different views? Did they find themselves becoming angry? Or were they able to maintain a neutral perspective? Do they believe that inflammatory rhetoric can set the stage for violence? 
Finally, students create a video, audio or collage mash-up of news coverage from different perspectives that makes a statement about how different news coverage is when it comes from a different political perspective. (They might even take a humorous approach, a la "The Daily Show" or "Weekend Update" on "Saturday Night Live.") Make sure that students include an analysis of this phenomenon in their creation.
Social Studies/Mathematics
Students read Frank Rich's Op-Ed column "The Rage Is Not About Health Care" and/or Charles Blow's Op-Ed column "Whose Country Is It?" and then discuss these columnists' perspectives on the recent public displays of political anger directed at members of Congress. 
Ask: Do you agree with their analysis of recent events? Why or why not? How do these columnists define America? How do they believe that the anti-government protesters define America? Do your own definitions of America fall in line with either of these definitions? Why or why not? What do you make of these columnists' arguments about changing demographics in the United States? When demographics change, how does it change the nation as a whole? 
Next, students analyze the 2010 (projected) pie chart in the graphic "Then and Now: A Snapshot of the Nation." To direct a comparison of the two graphs, ask: How has our nation changed demographically in the past 30 years? Are you surprised by any of the figures? What story do these charts tell you about the change in the population in the past 30 years? What do you think the projected data are based on? After seeing these numbers, do you have a different take on the columnists' analysis? Why or why not?
The Many Eyes database contains various infographics featuring census data. Have students create their own visualization of a changing America using and comparing historical data of their own choice about a particular demographic from the Census Bureau and then analyze the significance of their datasets.
Language Arts/Fine Arts
Have students read the Op-Ed columns by Frank Rich and Charles Blow (see links above). Explain to students that both columnists are attempting to analyze the anti-government protesters' often-heard slogan "Take America back." 
Ask: What is America? Whom do protesters want to take it back from? Where do they want to take it back to? If they are taking it back, when did they have it before? What did it look like when they had it last? Who was protesting then? Were they hoping to "take America back"? What was the rhetoric like in a different political climate in recent memory?
Explain to students that, as a class, they will use literature to further examine the concept of "taking America back" and what America is (in a fine arts class, art, music and/or performance can be substituted for literature).
Student mine the poetry, literature or art that you have been covering in class for depictions, definitions or analyses of the idea of America and compare the conceptions of America found in these works with the conceptions of America presented by both the anti-government protesters and the Times columnists. 
Alternatively, introduce students to works like Langston Hughes's poems "Let America Be America Again" and "I, Too, Sing America," Walt Whitman's poems "I Hear America Singing" and "America," and Claude McKay's poem "America." Or you might introduce works of American art, like those in the Whitney Museum and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. 
Students conclude this activity by writing an analytical essay comparing conceptions of America expressed in literature or art to conceptions of America held by contemporary figures (anti-government protesters, politicians, et al.).
Civics
Pose this question: Do Americans have the constitutional right to threaten or engage in violence against their government? And if so, why and under what conditions? Explain to students that they will hold a "moving debate" on this question. 
In a moving debate, the room is divided into three parts: agree, disagree and neutral/unsure. The teacher or moderator calls on students sitting in the three sections to make arguments for their positions or to ask questions of the others. As students are convinced by others or begin to question or refine their own positions during the debate, they move to the other parts of the room to reflect their mindset - even if the change is momentary. This way, the views in the room can be gauged both by debate and by physical location, and students are encouraged not to become entrenched.
To prepare, students investigate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, looking for any and all discussions about their rights to rise up against their government, and analyze the passages that address this topic in light of recent events. They should consider these questions: Do anti-government protesters have the right to threaten and/or engage in violence against the government? Against other citizens with whom they disagree? Why or why not? Does having the constitutional right to do something make it right? Why or why not? 
After the debate, students write letters to the editor of a newspaper that has been covering the story, explaining the constitutional issues brought up by the recent threats and acts of violence directed at members of Congress and drawing on the arguments that convinced them most during the moving debate. 
Going Further | Students create an exhibition called "What America Is to Us" in a public place in school, consisting of a project made by each student that represents his or her vision. Students should work in the format and media of their choice - poster, audio or video, essay, poem, artwork - as allowed by available space and technology. Students should include a written statement about their own vision of America and how they plan to promote their ideals and values effectively. 
Invite all school community members to view and respond to the exhibition.

HEADLINE: California: City Offices Will Go Dark

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
With Los Angeles teetering toward a major fiscal crisis, Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa on Tuesday asked the city administrative officer to shut down all city agencies -- except for public safety and those that generate revenue -- for two days per week beginning next week. Mr. Villaraigosa's order comes on the heels of the city controller's warning that the city might be unable to pay employees and vendors within four weeks. The city has been pressing the Department of Water and Power for its $73.5-million contribution to the treasury, which the agency has declined to pay after the City Council recently rejected its proposed electricity rate increase, and because of a recent downgrade to the agency's bonds by Fitch Ratings. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A report in the National Briefing column on Wednesday about the fiscal crisis in Los Angeles, using information from the mayor's office, referred incorrectly to the Fitch Ratings for bonds issued by the city's Department of Water and Power. The ratings have remained unchanged; they were not downgraded recently.

HEADLINE: Drop in Birth Rate in 2008 May Be Tied to Recession

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
ATLANTA (AP) -- American births fell in 2008, updated government figures confirm, probably because of the recession. The one exception was the birth rate among women in their 40s, who perhaps felt that they did not have the luxury of waiting for better economic times. 
 The birth rate for women in their early 40s rose 4 percent over the previous year, reaching its highest mark since 1967. The rate for women in their late 40s also rose, slightly. But birth rates fell for teenagers, as well as women in their 20s and 30s.
 ''Women are postponing births to those later ages, above 40,'' said James Trussell, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton.
 Experts do not know for certain why so many are delaying having children, though some suspect that the economy is a big factor. However, ''you get to the point where the biological clock starts ticking and people realize they have to do it,'' said Mr. Trussell, who was not involved in the research.
 The report on births was issued Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is based on a review of more than 99 percent of birth certificates for 2008 -- the first full year of the recession. Over all, about 4.2 million children were born that year, a 2 percent drop from 2007. It is the first annual decline in births since the start of the decade.
 Experts say the most likely explanations are the recession and a decline in immigration to the United States, for which the weak job market has been blamed.
 Some early information for the first six months of 2009 indicates a continuing decline of about 3 percent in total births, officials with the disease control centers said.
 The report found that birth rates fell by 3 percent for women in their early 20s, 2 percent for women in their late 20s and 1 percent for women in their 30s.
 The teenage birth rate dropped 2 percent -- and the rate for Hispanic teenagers was the lowest in two decades. The teenage birth rate had been declining from 1991 through 2005, but rose from 2005 to 2007. 
 Women in their 40s still have children far less often than younger women. The rate was about 10 births per 1,000 women in their early 40s, and less then 1 per 1,000 for women in their late 40s. The rate for women in their late 20s was 115 per 1,000. The birth rate for teenagers was about 41 per 1,000.
 The Pew Research Center also issued a report Tuesday that found that several states with the biggest declines in birth rates -- Arizona, California and Florida -- were among those that fared the worst by various economic measures.
 The organization also pointed to a 2009 survey that found that 14 percent of people in their prime child-bearing years said they had put off having a child because of the recession.
 The report by the disease control centers also showed that the percentage of babies born prematurely fell a bit, to 12.3 percent from 12.7 percent, an improvement celebrated by some health advocates.

HEADLINE: Wilma Mankiller, 64, Cherokee Chief And First Woman to Lead Major Tribe

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK; William Grimes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Wilma Mankiller, who as the first woman to be elected chief of a major American Indian tribe revitalized the Cherokee Nation's tribal government and improved its education, health and housing, died Tuesday at her home near Tahlequah, Okla. She was 64.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Mike Miller, a tribal spokesman. 
 Ms. Mankiller was the Cherokee chief from 1985 to 1995, and during her tenure the nation's membership more than doubled, to 170,000 from about 68,000. 
 While many Cherokees live in a 14-county area around the tribal capital of Tahlequah, in eastern Oklahoma, its members are spread throughout the 50 states. The current tribal membership is 290,000, making it the second-largest tribe in the country after the Navajo. 
 Ms. Mankiller was admired for her tenacity, having fought off two serious diseases, lymphoma and a neuromuscular disorder called myasthenia gravis; recovered from kidney failure that would have killed her had not an older brother given her one of his kidneys; and survived a head-on automobile collision in 1979 that forced her to endure 17 operations and years of physical therapy. 
 ''We are better people and a stronger tribal nation because of her example of Cherokee leadership, statesmanship, humility, grace, determination and decisiveness,'' Chad Smith, the Cherokees' principal chief, said in a statement on the tribe's Web site. ''When we become disheartened, we will be inspired by remembering how Wilma proceeded undaunted through so many trials and tribulations.''
 Wilma Pearl Mankiller was born on Nov. 18, 1945, in Tahlequah. She was the sixth of 11 children reared by Charley Mankiller, a full-blooded Cherokee, and the former Clara Irene Sitton, who is of Dutch-Irish descent. (The Cherokees accept anyone as a member who can link any part of his or her ancestry to a member of the original tribe.) 
 She spent her early childhood on a 160-acre tract known as Mankiller Flats, given to her grandfather as part of a settlement the federal government made for forcing the Cherokee to move to Oklahoma from their tribal lands in the Carolinas and Georgia in the 1830s. The name Mankiller comes from a tribal military rank.
 Though Ms. Mankiller later recalled that she had never really felt poor growing up, the family's home had no electricity, indoor plumbing or telephones. 
 In 1956, the family moved to San Francisco as part of a relocation policy of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Its aim was to move Indians off federally subsidized reservations with the promise of jobs in America's big cities. Ms. Mankiller's father became a warehouse worker and union organizer.
 In an interview with The New York Times in 1993, Ms. Mankiller described the move as ''my own little Trail of Tears,'' a reference to the forced removal of Cherokees from the Southeast by federal troops during the winter of 1838-39. 
 In 1963, she married Hugo Olaya, an Ecuadorean businessman, and later became the mother of two daughters, Gina and Felicia. 
 Her life changed, she said, when a group of young Indian demonstrators took over Alcatraz to call attention to the government's treatment of Indians. They claimed the island ''in the name of Indians of all tribes,'' and during their 19-month occupation Ms. Mankiller visited them frequently and raised money for their cause.
 She began taking night courses at Skyline College and San Francisco State University while working as a coordinator of Indian programs for the Oakland public schools. After her marriage ended in divorce, she returned with her daughters to live on her grandfather's land in Oklahoma in 1977. 
 Soon she began volunteering in tribal affairs and leading campaigns for new health and school programs, like Head Start. She landed a job as economic stimulus coordinator for the Cherokee Nation, emphasizing community self-help. She also earned a bachelor's degree in the social sciences from Flaming Rainbow University in Stilwell and took graduate courses in community planning at the University of Arkansas.
 In 1981, she founded the community development department of the Cherokee Nation and, as its director, helped develop rural water systems and rehabilitate housing. Her successes led the tribe's principal chief, Ross Swimmer, to select her as his running mate in his re-election campaign in 1983. Their victory made her the first woman to become deputy chief of the Cherokee Nation.
 When Mr. Swimmer resigned two years later to become assistant secretary for Indian Affairs at the Department of the Interior, she succeeded him as principal chief. She won office in her own right in 1987 and in 1991 was re-elected with 83 percent of the vote.
 As the tribe's leader, she was both the principal guardian of centuries of Cherokee tradition and customs, including legal codes, and chief executive of a tribe with a budget that reached $150 million a year by the end of her tenure. The money included income from several factories, gambling operations, a motel, gift shops, a ranch, a lumber company and other businesses as well as the federal government. 
 One of her priorities was to plow much of this income back into new or expanded health care and job-training programs as well as Head Start and the local high school. 
 Even after she left office in 1995 because of her health problems, Ms. Mankiller remained a force in tribal affairs, frequently sought out for counsel and helping to mediate a bitter factional fight between her successor and other tribal leaders that had threatened to become a constitutional crisis in the Cherokee Nation. She also was a guest professor at Dartmouth College. 
 In addition to her mother, she is survived by her husband, Charlie Soap; her daughters, Gina Olaya and Felicia Olaya, both of Tahlequah; several brothers and sisters, and four grandchildren.
 In 1998, President Bill Clinton awarded Ms. Mankiller the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. 
 Her life story was chronicled in ''Mankiller: A Chief and Her People'' (St. Martin's Press, 1993), which she wrote with Michael Wallis. She was also the author and editor of ''Every Day Is a Good Day: Reflections by Contemporary Indigenous Women'' (Fulcrum Publishing, 2004).

HEADLINE: Housing Authority, Facing Shortfall, May Revoke Rental Vouchers

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Because of a $45 million budget gap, the New York City Housing Authority may have to revoke rental-assistance vouchers from more than 10,000 low-income tenants, a drastic move that could cause families to lose their apartments.
 The federal government gave the housing authority less money for the voucher program, known as Section 8, than the authority expected. But the authority made matters worse by continuing to issue new vouchers until December, eight months after the government warned it to stop doing so because the program was likely to run a deficit.
 Michael P. Kelly, the authority's general manager, said that terminating vouchers would be a last resort. The authority has not decided who might lose their vouchers, but if the deficit is not closed, the cuts could begin this summer.
 ''This is a dire option for us that we're hoping we're not going to have to do,'' Mr. Kelly said. 
 The agency is seeking federal and state funding to avert the voucher cuts. But the state is facing a huge deficit. Sandra Henriquez, an assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that HUD would review the housing authority's books, but she added that ''they cannot and should not expect that the federal government will cover the shortfall.'' 
 As an alternative, the housing authority is considering reducing the value of each voucher, meaning that landlords, tenants or both would have to absorb the cost. 
 Under Section 8, residents typically pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and the voucher covers the balance. In New York City, about 102,000 families now have vouchers, which are administered by the authority and allow families to live in units where private landlords accept Section 8 benefits. An additional 178,000 or so families live in public housing complexes owned by the authority. 
 After the authority voided 2,600 outstanding vouchers in December, prompting an outcry from affected families, it urged people to apply for public housing, although the waiting list is years long. 
 HUD provides money for the Section 8 vouchers and tells housing authorities the maximum number they can use. In May, HUD told the New York City Housing Authority it was in danger of exceeding its allotted number.
 ''What balances you are comfortable with, of course, is a local decision,'' a HUD official, Mirza Negron Morales, wrote in a memo to the housing authority. ''Our recommendation, based on your current level of funding and the data to date, is to stop issuing vouchers and maintain current leasing and cost levels for the remainder of calendar year 2009.''
 The agency continued to issue new vouchers, about 50 a week, generally to emergency cases like homeless families, domestic violence victims and families under the supervision of the city's child welfare system. ''We wanted to help as many people as possible,'' said Sheila Stainback, a housing authority spokeswoman. ''We only issued vouchers to the most vulnerable.'' 
 Historically, some vouchers that are issued are never redeemed because of the difficulty in finding a suitable apartment and a landlord who will accept vouchers. And every year, some families leave the Section 8 program. But last year, more landlords began to take Section 8 vouchers, and the attrition rate dropped to 3.5 percent from about 6 percent, most likely because of the weak economy. 
 ''Looking at the scale of Nycha's program,'' Mr. Kelly said, using the acronym for the authority, ''it was impossible for us to turn on a dime.'' 
 In December, the authority finally stopped issuing new vouchers and voided the 2,600 unused vouchers. But outside of cases of fraud or evictions for breaking other program rules, officials said they could not recall having terminated vouchers already being used. 
 Judith Goldiner, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society in New York, said the prospect of terminating so many families' vouchers was ''inconceivable.''
 ''This is just a disaster,'' she said. ''We don't know who could be impacted by it.''
 The magnitude of the problem left several housing experts puzzled. New York City has exceeded its voucher cap only once before, by several hundred in 2005, according to Gregory Kern, an agency manager who oversees the Section 8 program. 
 Linda Couch, the vice president for policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said that given the recession, the drop in attrition rates should not have come as a surprise. In recent years, she added, the act of continuing to issue vouchers to the point at which authorities exceeded their federal cap for Section 8 units has become ''a big no-no at HUD.'' 
 Douglas Rice, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said the housing authority's data showed that it ''leased up very aggressively in the second half of last year.''
 He added, ''They should have realized they weren't getting nearly enough renewal funds as they expected.'' 
 Housing authorities across the country began learning in May that they would be receiving less federal money for Section 8 than they had expected. In many cases, the recession made existing vouchers more costly as incomes dropped, leading authorities to make up the difference.
 Experts estimated that hundreds of agencies would have to reduce rental assistance or revoke vouchers. In the end, few housing authorities terminated vouchers; one small agency in Oregon cut 50 of them, with 15 of those families taken in by other public assistance programs. 
 In several places, including Monterey, Calif.; Walla Walla, Wash.; and Bridgeport, Conn., housing authorities began paying a lower percentage of recipients' rents. 
 ''I literally don't sleep anymore because every day I'm trying to see who's attriting from the program to see if I can survive,'' said Nicholas Calace, executive director of the Bridgeport Housing Authority. 
 Mr. Kern and Mr. Kelly said the New York City authority had been trying to cut the number of people with Section 8 vouchers by doing more fraud investigations and weeding out those who underreport their income. The termination rate is 400 to 450 a month, Mr. Kern said, compared with 350 to 400 last summer. 
 When other housing authorities began considering terminations last year, they contemplated a ''last in, first out'' policy, in which the most recently issued vouchers would be revoked first.
 Among the many families with newer vouchers in New York are Izolda Mandelblat, 77, and her husband, Moisey Frenkel, 85, who live in a one-bedroom apartment in Inwood, in Upper Manhattan. The couple, immigrants from Ukraine, had been on a Section 8 waiting list for 13 years. After their benefits finally started in November, the couple began to blossom, according to their granddaughter, Nera Lerner, 19. 
 Fresh fruits and vegetables began appearing in their refrigerator, replacing the fatty discount chicken, and the canned and frozen food they had subsisted on for years. Ms. Mandelblat began buying vitamins. The couple could finally afford all of their medications; he has diabetes, and she has skin cancer. 
 They earn about $1,100 in Social Security income and pay $256 a month toward their $1,019 rent; the voucher covers the rest. 
 ''They're a lot more hopeful now,'' Ms. Lerner said. Asked what she would do if she lost her voucher, Ms. Mandelblat fell into despair.
 ''Oh no, oh no,'' she said through her granddaughter, who interpreted. ''I would be homeless. I would die.''

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN; Anemona Hartocollis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The board of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers voted on Tuesday night to close its flagship hospital in Greenwich Village, ending its long struggle to stay afloat despite millions of dollars of debt.
 The exact timing for the closing of St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, which has about 400 inpatient beds, was not immediately clear, but the process of shutting down has already begun, and the State Department of Health will become involved to ensure an orderly closing. Elective surgeries are to end by April 14.
 ''The decision to close St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan inpatient services was made only after the board, management and our advisers exhausted every possible alternative,'' Alfred E. Smith IV, chairman of St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, said in a statement. They were unable to come up with a plan, he said, ''to save the inpatient services at the hospital that has proudly served Manhattan's West Side and downtown for 160 years.'' 
 Gov. David A. Paterson said Tuesday that he would work with the board and the Department of Health to preserve some of the hospital's most important community functions, perhaps by scaling it down to an urgent care center that could take patients with conditions ranging from ankle sprains to heart attacks. That plan would also try to maintain some outpatient services, like those that provide H.I.V. treatment and primary care, but it remains at a conceptual stage and would require finding a partner, people close to the process said.
 In the meantime, outpatient services will continue without interruption, the board said.
 The hospital and a task force convened by the governor had tried without success to find another hospital to absorb or unite with St. Vincent's. 
 ''While we are disappointed that we were unable to find a partner for the acute care inpatient services,'' the governor said in a statement, ''we should use this as an opportunity to ensure that the health care needs of this community are met by creating an urgent care center combined with other vital health care services the community needs. To that end, I have directed the Department of Health to solicit proposals for this new model of care.''
 With its vote, the board effectively closed the last Roman Catholic general hospital in New York, a beacon in Greenwich Village that has treated victims of calamities from the sinking of the Titanic to Sept. 11. In recent years, its management troubles were worsened by the difficult economics of the health care industry, changes in the fabric of a historic neighborhood and the low profit in religious work.
 The search for a partner hospital, which would be needed to maintain an urgent care center, is already under way. Mount Sinai Medical Center, which recently withdrew a bid to partner with St. Vincent's to keep its acute care hospital open, has indicated some interest, according to an official involved in the restructuring efforts who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to comment. Mount Sinai officials could not be reached for comment late Tuesday. 
 Christine Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, who represents the neighborhood, called on the governor not to approve any closing until an urgent care plan was in place.
 To satisfy its creditors, the hospital may sell or lease much of its valuable Greenwich Village real estate, as it drastically reduces its staff of doctors, nurses and others, to repay its estimated $700 million of debt, people involved in the hospital's restructuring efforts said.
 St. Vincent's now gets most of its admissions through its emergency department, which could be a natural match for an urgent care facility. But with vastly reduced services, it would no longer be a Level 1 trauma center, so patients with high-level emergencies would be routed to full-service hospitals. 
 An urgent care center could remain open all night, but patients could not stay more than 24 hours, and would be discharged or transferred to another hospital if they required inpatient care.

HEADLINE: Pakistani Lawmakers Weigh Changes to Constitution to Shift Power and Steady the State

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and SALMAN MASOOD

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan's Parliament opened debate on Tuesday on a set of amendments intended to refurbish the Constitution after decades of distortions inflicted by a series of military autocrats. 
 The changes were widely heralded here as important step toward improving the long-term health of the country's beleaguered democracy. But they also threatened to open a new chapter of instability for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, as they strip away his powers and leave him more vulnerable to challenges from the opposition.
 The changes, which are expected to pass this month, represent a rare moment of consensus in Pakistan's fractious politics. Representatives from 14 political parties, led by a member of Mr. Zardari's party, spent 10 months preparing 102 amendments. 
 On paper, the changes restore the country's democracy to its original form -- a parliamentary system run by a prime minister -- and undo the accumulated powers that the country's military autocrats had vested in the presidency. 
 But this is Pakistan -- a chaotic, 62-year-old country, where no elected government has ever lasted a full term and the rule of law is often up for grabs -- and it is far from certain that in practice the new laws will be respected.
 For the United States, the changes mean two conflicting things. Over the long run, they could lift Pakistan's prospects to have stronger, more effective civilian governments, something the Obama administration has said it wants.
 But short-term security interests have trumped even the best of intentions throughout the history of American-Pakistani relations, and the urge to default to dealing with the military, an effective, if bossy, institution, is likely to remain strong.
 Many argue that this is already happening. Military leaders have had their way in defining Pakistan's relationships with the United States and India, and they dismissed Mr. Zardari's attempts to place the powerful military spy agency under civilian control. Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, took center stage in a high-level meeting in Washington last month and led a meeting of federal officials before leaving for the United States, a first in Pakistan's history.
 ''Power has moved from Islamabad to Rawalpindi,'' said Farrukh Saleem, a columnist for The News, an English-language daily, referring to the country's capital and the city its army calls home. ''The civilians may be in power, but they don't really control much.''
 In theory, the changes would set into motion a reorganization of power that could start to alter that situation. The president will lose the controversial ability to dissolve Parliament, a 1980s-era weapon that has long been used by warring political parties, egged on by the military, to destroy rival governments. The president would move closer to figurehead status, and the prime minister would get new powers.
 While that is healthy over the long run, in the short term it raises questions about the viability of the government under Mr. Zardari, whose party, the Pakistan Peoples Party, or P.P.P., currently has the largest number of seats in Parliament. 
 The changes could provide an opening to Mr. Zardari's most serious opponent, Nawaz Sharif, a metals industry magnate, by allowing him to become prime minister once again. 
 ''The road is now clear for Nawaz Sharif to generate instability by demanding midterm elections,'' said Najam Sethi, editor in chief of The Friday Times, a weekly.
 A telling sign, he said, was Mr. Sharif's snubbing of a national ceremony held in Parliament for the package of changes on Monday. ''This indicates his intention to start picking holes in the amendment and government quickly,'' Mr. Sethi said.
 Mr. Zardari's supporters argue that by divesting his powers, Mr. Zardari is fulfilling a promise he made two years ago when he became president and that the step will deprive his enemies in politics, the military and the media of ammunition against him. 
 For the time being at least, although many of his powers will be shifted to the prime minister, the man who holds that post, Yousaf Raza Gilani, is part of the political party Mr. Zardari controls and is unlikely to challenge him. In Pakistan, party leaders wield immense power, as they control who gets to run on the party ticket, a huge advantage for provincial politicians. 
 ''He is a very unpopular figure, but he is the source of power in the P.P.P., and institutionally, the prime minister will have to answer to him,'' said Rasul B. Rais, a professor of political science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences.
 One of the most serious long-term implications of the changes, analysts said, would be a shift in power in favor of the provinces. After decades of being run from Islamabad, provinces will eventually have the right to legislate, to control their own education programs and significantly more of their finances, among other things, a difficult retooling that could lead to even more instability if it is not handled delicately. 
 Still, Hasan-Askari Rizvi, an analyst in Lahore, said he believed that the changes improved the prospects for Pakistan's shaky democracy, if for no other reason than after years of narrow, partisan squabbling, politicians actually came together over something important.
 ''Pakistani politicians have actually agreed on something,'' Mr. Rizvi said. ''They are not in the habit of agreeing on anything.''
 But few see the changes as likely to improve Mr. Zardari's unpopular standing among Pakistanis, who are too mired in the economic woes of joblessness and inflation to care much about constitutional tinkering.
 ''It will have implications within the media and the political class,'' said Cyril Almeida, a columnist for Dawn, a daily newspaper. ''But is it a vote getter? I don't think so.''

HEADLINE: Developers See Possibility (and Value) in Old Steel

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
As commercial real estate development nearly comes to a halt in the economic downturn, some well-capitalized investors are focusing instead on sprucing up existing properties. The process has various names: retrofitting, renovating, repurposing, even repositioning. But the underlying idea is to wring out more value at a time when rents will not support new construction.
 In New York, prominent buildings like the Empire State Building and 500 Fifth Avenue are being rehabilitated, while 475 Park Avenue South will get a $25 million renovation and face-lift led by the architect Cesar Pelli. Refurbishments have just been completed at 200 Fifth Avenue, the former International Toy Center, and 545 Madison Avenue.
 While not all of these projects have a direct tie to the recession, many do, including one started by the Hampshire Real Estate Companies, a real estate firm in Morristown, N.J. The company plans to spend roughly $16 million upgrading a rather ordinary four-story suburban office building called Centra, at 186 Wood Avenue South in Iselin, N.J., near the Metropark train station. 
 The architect for the project, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, which typically takes on projects like the 101-story Shanghai World Financial Center, envisions taking the building down to the steel and expanding the fourth floor to create an overhang supported by a treelike column. A causeway entrance will span a sunken garden that will open up the basement for office use.
 ''Here's a small building that's going from about 75,000 square feet to 110,000 square feet, but with the redesign, it will have the presence of an iconic building that tenants can rent for a reasonable price in New Jersey,'' said A. Eugene Kohn, chairman of Kohn Pedersen Fox. ''This is a really good example of repositioning a building.''
 Mr. Kohn said his architecture firm had completed designs for dozens of rehabilitation, renovation and expansion projects over the last three decades. The projects may range from simply redesigning the lobby and upgrading elevators to stripping a building down to the frame and replacing almost everything but the foundation. 
 ''All these projects are taking existing structures and enhancing them, allowing the owners to get much greater return on them,'' he said.
 While building owners may begin such projects any time it makes financial sense, they tend to predominate during recessions, Mr. Kohn said.
 ''One of the first problems that developers face in a recession is the office rents you can get do not equal what it would cost to buy a site and build new,'' he said. ''In bad times, dealing with existing stock and upgrading it seems to make more sense.''
 Also, in recessions, tenancy in general is shrinking, leaving some buildings half-empty, especially older ones that may have lost tenants who took advantage of falling rents to trade up. Office buildings that are empty or half-empty can be good candidates for repositioning.
 ''A lot of these buildings may be close to half their recent value, compared to where they were before the crash,'' Mr. Kohn said. ''If you can now buy an existing building for a great price, you can afford to upgrade it and get great rents, and you spend less than building new.''
 Hampshire, which manages investment funds and is fully capitalized, is looking for such opportunities for its investors, said Todd M. Anderson, a principal with Hampshire. Its 19-acre site in Iselin, formerly owned by the Siemens Corporation, was the perfect investment candidate as it had unused development rights, he said.
 In addition to the retrofitting of Centra, which will open by the end of this year, Hampshire is also preparing to build three more office buildings -- which will total 535,000 square feet -- and two large parking garages at the site.
 Mr. Anderson said that some developers might have decided to demolish the rather mundane office building and replace it, but that retrofitting made sense for several reasons. First, even taking it down to the steel was cheaper than tearing down and building anew.
 ''A lot of people would say there's nothing you can do with it; it's a small building that's badly sited,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''But there is inherent value in the bricks and mortar. Estimates were potentially up to $5 million in savings on a construction basis utilizing the existing structure.''
 Even if the construction savings had been minimal, there were other reasons to save the building, Mr. Anderson said. If developers rebuilt, they would lose grandfathered zoning entitlements that were attached to the structure, he said. 
 Also, repurposing has received a push from the ''green'' building sector, where renovation is obviously looked upon more favorably than building new.
 ''The focus on sustainability in this business has become huge,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''So anything you can do to foster that effort is worthwhile and hopefully makes economic sense as well.''
 The new Centra will be certified as either silver or gold by the United States Green Building Council, Mr. Kohn said.
 At 545 Madison Avenue, near 55th Street, the owners invested $90 million in a gut rehabilitation and redesign led by the architecture firm Moed de Armas & Shannon to transform a faded Class C building built in the mid-1950s into a Class A office tower attractive to tenants like hedge funds.
 It was the first time that LCOR, a real estate investment and development company, had done such an extensive rehabilitation project. When the company signed a 75-year ground lease at 545 Madison in 2006, the building's office rents averaged less than $30 a square foot; after the work, asking rents are $75 a square foot, said David A. Sigman, a senior vice president. LCOR has recently leased to five companies, including CS Tang, a hedge fund.
 ''No question about it, it's a more valuable property than it was the day we took it over,'' he said.
 LCOR saved the cost of building a new structure, which could have been $50 to $100 a square foot, and also avoided the delay of a demolition, which would have added a year to 18 months to the project. Though he described the project as a success, Mr. Sigman said he did not know if LCOR would repurpose more office buildings in the future. One reason 545 Madison Avenue was a good candidate was that all its office leases, which were timed to a ground lease, expired once LCOR leased the site in 2006, so the building was empty.
 While buildings can be repurposed with existing tenants, those projects are typically much more expensive and risky, Mr. Kohn said. Tenants in the building must be shifted around to accommodate construction, which can only be done piecemeal and may create hazards.
 ''Still, as long as the bones of the existing building are good, and if the basic structure is in reasonable shape, and the floor sizes are O.K., any building can be a candidate for repurposing,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Square Feet pages on Wednesday about the retrofitting of office buildings referred imprecisely to a project at 545 Madison Avenue. The savings realized by retrofitting the structure rather than demolishing it and rebuilding could be $50 to $100 a square foot. That range is not the cost of new construction.

HEADLINE: AOL Plans to Sell or Shut Bebo Social Networking Site

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Two years after AOL acquired the social networking site Bebo for $850 million, the company plans to sell or shut it.
 AOL sent a memorandum to employees on Tuesday saying it was seeking a buyer for Bebo, which has fallen far behind Facebook, and would no longer funnel cash into it. 
 ''It is clear that social networking is a space with heavy competition, and where scale defines success,'' the memorandum said. ''Bebo, unfortunately, is a business that has been declining and, as a result, would require significant investment in order to compete in the competitive social networking space.''
 AOL, which recently split from Time Warner, said it planned to decide what to do with Bebo by May 31.
 AOL bought Bebo from its British co-founders, Michael and Xochi Birch, in March 2008, as part of an effort to attract new users and advertisers. At the time, Bebo was popular in Britain and Australia, but it has since struggled to gain its footing in the United States. 
 As AOL continues to revamp its business strategy to focus on advertising revenue, rather than selling access to the Internet, it has had to evaluate where best to place its bets, said Augie Ray, a senior analyst with Forrester Research who focuses on social media.
 ''You need page views to drive advertising, and Bebo simply has not been able to retain an audience,'' Mr. Ray said. ''The decision was probably very simple for them.'' 
 Facebook attracted more than 462 million visitors in February, up 68 percent from a year earlier, according to the Web analysis company comScore. By comparison, Bebo drew a mere 12.8 million visitors, a dip of 45 percent from a year earlier. 
 ''We haven't seen many companies shutter their social networking enterprises,'' Mr. Ray said. ''But companies have had to adjust their business models for the reality for today.''

HEADLINE: Optimism on Low Interest Rates Offsets Worry Over Greece

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street traders were cautious on Tuesday amid worries that the European Union's plan to help Greece might unwind. But signs that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates low helped give stocks some support.
 The major indexes ended mixed, hampered by new doubts about Greece's ability to pay its debts. Reports on Tuesday indicated that the financially struggling country was seeking to sidestep aid from the International Monetary Fund because of concerns the fund would impose severe austerity measures.
 The yield on 10-year Greek bonds pushed above 7 percent for the first time in more than two months, raising the prospect that Greece could default. The cost of insuring Greek debt rose to the highest level since late February, when talk of a possible default was widespread. 
 ''It's almost cliche to say markets don't like uncertainty, but this is something of a classic case,'' said Douglas M. Peta, an independent analyst. ''Investors would like to get chapter and verse of how an aid package would work. Europe just keeps kicking the can down the road.''
 Some of that uncertainty was offset by indications that the Fed would keep its benchmark federal funds rate near zero for the near future. 
 Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee released on Tuesday showed that policy makers largely believed that inflation in the United States remained subdued. That buoyed hopes on Wall Street that the Fed might prolong a period of low rates through the end of the year and perhaps beyond.
 Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist for Capital Economics in Toronto, wrote in a research note that rates ''could be on hold at near zero for a lot longer than the markets are currently expecting.'' He predicts they will not rise until 2012.
 ''Fed officials are becoming increasingly worried about falling inflation,'' Mr. Ashworth wrote.
 At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.56 points, or 0.03 percent, at 10,969.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock average rose 2 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,189.43, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 7.28 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,436.81.
 Financial companies provided a bright spot. Shares of Wells Fargo rose 77 cents, or 2.44 percent, to $32.28, and Bank of America gained 36 cents, or 2 percent, to close at $18.49.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 9/32, to 97 11/32. The yield fell to 3.95 percent from 3.98 percent late Monday.
 Oil at one point climbed to an 18-month high, and ended the day with a slight gain at $86.84 a barrel.
 The uncertainty about the prospects for a rescue package for Greece helped weaken the euro; its value slipped below $1.34 on Tuesday. 
 Most European markets closed higher, with the concern about Greece tempered by an upbeat jobs report on Friday from the United States.
 The FTSE 100 in London was up 0.62 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris climbed 0.49 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt was 0.27 percent higher. The markets were closed Friday and Monday for Easter.
 In Asia, the Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 0.5 percent. Australia's benchmark exchange rose 0.9 percent after the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, to 4.25 percent.
 American markets closed at their highest levels in 18 months on Monday. The Dow has been inching closer to the 11,000 mark, a psychologically important level that would bring the market back to its pre-financial crisis levels.

HEADLINE: Fed Minutes Show No Sign of Rate Tightening, but the Time to Act Was Discussed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Continued low inflation has strengthened the hand of Federal Reserve officials who believe that monetary policy should not be tightened anytime soon, minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting show. 
 The minutes also disclosed that the Fed's commitment to keep short-term interest rates low was based on economic conditions rather than a particular time frame, suggesting that officials were trying to tamp down market speculation that its references since last May to an ''extended period'' meant at least six months. 
 According to the minutes, released on Tuesday, the extended-period language should not limit the Fed's ability ''to commence monetary policy tightening promptly'' if economic activity or underlying inflation were to suddenly accelerate. 
 But policy makers said the converse was also true: that the period ''might last for quite some time and could even increase'' if the economy worsened or if inflation fell further.
 The minutes showed a consensus that inflation expectations were ''reasonably well anchored,'' though a few policy makers feared that such expectations could rise in the medium term because of large fiscal deficits and extraordinarily low interest rates.
 The Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. 
 The minutes, for the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting of March 16, offered insight into a debate within the Fed about when to start tightening monetary policy.
 In recent speeches, Janet L. Yellen, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, have argued that the low rate of inflation reflected broad economic slack, or unused productive capacity, as seen in the 9.7 unemployment rate. They do not believe that inflation scares are likely to occur anytime soon. 
 In contrast, Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, has asserted that inflation measures have been distorted by the crisis in the housing market. He has argued that the ballooning of the Fed's balance sheet to $2.3 trillion posed inflationary risks, and that the Fed should begin tightening the supply of credit sooner rather than later. 
 Mr. Plosser does not currently have a vote on the committee, but one of his allies, Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Kansas City Fed, was the sole dissenter at the meeting. He argued that changing the language from ''an extended period'' to ''for some time'' would ''provide the committee flexibility to begin raising rates modestly,'' according to the minutes. 
 For now, most committee members have sided with Ms. Yellen and Mr. Dudley. 
 ''While the ongoing decline in the implicit rental cost for owner-occupied housing was weighing on core inflation, a number of participants observed that the moderation in price changes was widespread across many categories of spending,'' the minutes stated.
 The minutes added that ''participants took note of signs that inflation expectations were reasonably well anchored, and most agreed that substantial resource slack was continuing to restrain cost pressures.'' 
 In addition, a few members asserted that ''the risks of an early start to policy tightening exceeded those associated with a later start.'' 
 Ms. Yellen's perspective carried particular weight because she is President Obama's choice to succeed Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, who will retire in June. 
 The Fed's economists, who provide the data and analysis upon which the committee makes decisions, slightly lowered their projections for inflation and for growth in domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity. 
 The Fed's balance sheet is about 2.5 times its size before the financial crisis, a result of its purchases of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury securities. 
 At the March meeting, the committee discussed the possibility of allowing some or all of the Treasury securities to roll off the books when they mature, instead of being reinvested, as they currently are. The Fed held $777 billion in Treasury securities as of March 31. 
 Redeeming the maturing securities would ''significantly reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet over coming years'' and lessen the need for other tools to drain the $1.1 trillion in bank reserves being held at the Fed. But the strategy would also put upward pressure on long-term interest rates. 
 A related discussion has begun about what the Fed should do with mortgage-backed securities, which it stopped buying on March 31. It holds about $1.1 trillion in such securities. 
 In a speech on Tuesday, Narayana R. Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis Fed, noted it would take decades for the Fed's balance sheet to return to normal if it simply waited for the securities to mature or for homeowners to prepay their mortgages. 
 He said it was ''likely that the Federal Reserve will to have to sell a nontrivial amount'' of the securities by the end of this decade. ''Such sales might cause untoward jumps in interest rates unless the Federal Reserve is able to credibly commit to a sufficiently slow pace,'' he said, adding that he believed the Fed was ''well situated to make, communicate, and carry out such a commitment.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Brazil Reach Agreement on Cotton Dispute

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The United States and Brazil have reached an agreement aimed at settling a long-standing trade dispute over American subsidies to cotton growers, officials in both countries said Tuesday.
 The announcement came one day before Brazil was to begin imposing up to $830 million in sanctions with authorization from the World Trade Organization. The trade body had ruled last August that American subsidies to cotton growers had violated global trade rules. 
 Under the preliminary deal, Brazil would hold off on retaliation in exchange for American concessions that include the modification of an export loan program and the establishment of a temporary assistance fund for the Brazilian cotton industry. The broader issues in contention would be deferred until Congress takes up the next farm bill, most likely in 2012. 
 The Brazilian sanctions were to include $591 million in higher tariffs on a wide array of goods, including autos, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, electronics, textiles and wheat. 
 The case was also closely watched because Brazil would have been the first country to violate American intellectual property rights in retaliation for unfair trade policies under the approval of W.T.O. arbitrators. 
 Brazil had threatened, for example, to stop charging its farmers technology fees for seeds developed by American biotechnology companies and to break American pharmaceutical patents before their scheduled expiration. Those retaliatory actions would have cost American businesses up to $239 million.
 ''Traditionally, retaliation in trade has been the preserve of the largest developed countries, which have market power,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor of international trade and finance at the Harvard Kennedy School. ''But this mechanism -- suspending intellectual property protection -- gives smaller, developing countries a way to enforce their rights under trade rules.'' 
 The compromise was reached after Miriam Sapiro, a deputy trade representative, and James W. Miller, an under secretary of agriculture, met last Wednesday with Brazilian officials. 
 Under the agreement, the Agriculture Department will modify a program that guarantees loans extended by American banks to approved foreign banks for purchases of American agricultural products by foreign buyers. 
 The United States will also set up a technical assistance fund of $147.3 million a year. The amount represents the value of the retaliation the W.T.O. had authorized for American payments to cotton producers under a marketing loan program and a countercyclical loan program. The fund would remain in place until passage of the next farm bill or a mutually developed solution, whichever occurs first.
 Finally, the United States agreed to evaluate whether fresh beef can be imported from Brazil while preventing the introduction of foot-and-mouth disease. The authorities will move to recognize Santa Catarina, a state in southern Brazil, as free of the disease. 
 Both sides said they hoped to agree by June on a process to conclusively resolve the dispute, although such a resolution would probably await action by Congress. 
 The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, and the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, announced the deal. It was applauded by lawmakers, including the top Democrat and the top Republicans on the Senate and House Agriculture Committees. 
 Eddie Smith, a cotton producer in Floydada, Tex., and the chairman of the National Cotton Council of America, called the agreement ''a positive development in this very long dispute.'' 
 He said in a statement the deal ''avoids the immediately harmful economic effects of trade retaliation and it puts the serious discussion concerning changes in the U.S. cotton program before Congress in the 2012 farm bill.''
 The Brazilian government said the preliminary agreement ''may establish the basis for a future and final mutually satisfactory solution for the dispute.'' In a statement, the government said it ''expects the parties to reach an understanding that makes it unnecessary to adopt the retaliation measures authorized by the W.T.O.''
 The Brazilian government, under pressure from its cotton growers, filed the case in 2002. In 2005, and again in 2008, the W.T.O. found that the American agricultural subsidies violated trade agreements.
 Cotton is grown in at least 17 states, from Virginia to California, with Texas accounting for nearly half of production. The country produces between 12 million and 20 million bales of cotton a year, and exports about 70 percent of the crop, worth roughly $4 billion, according to the National Cotton Council, which represents most of the 20,000 or so cotton growers. 
 Spending on the nation's cotton program has subsided recently because rising commodity prices have reduced the need for the support.

HEADLINE: Funds Sought To Continue Restoration At Ellis Island

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Save Ellis Island, a nonprofit charged with restoring that historic immigrant gateway to America, may not be able to save itself.
 The group has run out of money. 
 ''We're not able to keep it going a whole lot longer,'' its president, Judith R. McAlpin, said in an interview. She added that the group, which recently posted an ''urgent appeal'' for donations on its Web site (www.saveellisisland.org/site/PageServer), needs to raise about $500,000 in the next few weeks if it is to survive. If it does not, Save Ellis Island will have to return $512,000 in grants that it has already received to restore 30 buildings and repurpose them for public benefit, Ms. McAlpin said, and work on current projects will be suspended.
 Save Ellis Island has been hurt not only by the decline in donations caused by the economic downturn, but also by major spending cuts from New Jersey, one of its longtime benefactors. 
 Ellis Island, which closed as an immigrant-processing center in 1954, has remained a serious concern for preservationists in the years since the main building was restored and opened as the Ellis Island Immigration Museum in 1990. Most of the remaining buildings -- many on the island's south side -- have remained unused and in disrepair. 
 The World Monuments Fund put the island on its watch list of threatened sites in 1996 and 2006. The National Trust for Historic Preservation included Ellis Island on its list of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places twice in the 1990s. 
 ''Save Ellis Island has done a very good job of marshalling us,'' said Richard Moe, the president of the National Trust, who serves on the Ellis Island group's board. ''We need an organization that's solely focused on Ellis Island because this is such a significant historical site.''
 Save Ellis Island says that it has to conduct a large-scale fund-raising drive if it hopes to cover the $350 million still needed for the renovations, but that it has been unable to get approval from the National Park Service, which oversees the island and the nearby Statue of Liberty. 
 ''We're lacking a public commitment to the campaign'' from the Park Service, Ms. McAlpin said. 
 David Luchsinger, the Park Service's superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island, said the agency had been waiting for a feasibility study and strategic plan from Save Ellis Island. ''We've been very supportive of them, trying to help them out in any way we can; we would like them to continue to be around,'' Mr. Luchsinger said. 
 But Ms. McAlpin said that her organization believed that it could not complete a feasibility study without knowing if it could count on federal support. In recent years the United States Department of the Interior has contributed to the rehabilitation of Ellis Island, but no funds were appropriated for the island for the 2011 fiscal year.
 Save Ellis Island said it had hoped to support its efforts with financing from a for-profit partner, which might, for example, hold conventions on the island. But the Park Service said certain agreements had to be in place before that move would be considered. This decision, Ms. McAlpin said, left Save Ellis Island more dependent on public funds and private contributions.
 Mr. Luchsinger said the Park Service would continue to maintain and improve the island with whatever money is made available. ''We're going to continue to try to do our part as best we can, given the allocations,'' he said. ''Whether Save Ellis Island is here or not, that is our obligation.'' 
 Save Ellis Island was established by a group of New York preservationists in 1999 to serve as a nonprofit partner for the Park Service, with the goal of rehabilitating the buildings. In 2007 the organization completed the restoration of the Ferry Building, a long hall built in Art Deco style by the federal Public Works Administration, which served as the departure point for immigrants who had passed their health and legal inspections. The Laundry/Hospital Outbuilding -- which still holds machinery that washed, sterilized and dried the bedding of immigrant patients -- is about 70 percent complete, Ms. McAlpin said. 
 ''If we can't save Ellis Island, I'd be pretty discouraged,'' said Peg Breen, the president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, an advocacy group, who also serves on the island organization's board. ''There is a great story of America at its best out there. It would be a shame for this country if the south side of Ellis Island never happens.''
 Save Ellis Island, which has an annual operating budget of $1.2 million, cut its staff to four from seven last Thursday; at its peak the organization had about 12 full-time staff members.
 Most of Ellis Island's 27.5 acres fall under New Jersey's jurisdiction; the state fought New York and won sovereignty in a 1998 Supreme Court ruling after Christine Todd Whitman, the governor of New Jersey at the time, made Ellis Island a personal cause. In 2000 she announced the plan for the island's redevelopment, to be overseen by Save Ellis Island and financed with private and public contributions. 
 ''As New Jerseyans, we take great pride in our history,'' she said at a news conference. ''But we must also take care of our history so that future generations can share our pride and visit these landmarks of our national journey.'' 
 New Jersey has contributed as much as $650,000 a year toward Save Ellis Island's general operating funds, Ms. McAlpin said, but that figure dropped to zero for its 2011 budget, and the state is under no obligation to support Ellis Island. 
 New York State, which retains minority control of the island, has not given any funds, Ms. McAlpin said. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, said through a spokesman that she was working with senators from New Jersey to encourage Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, ''and the interior appropriations subcommittee to secure the funding Ellis Island needs to continue operations and for much-needed upgrades to the park's infrastructure.'' 
 Still, the lack of government support is one of several problems that are making it increasingly difficult for Save Ellis Island to stay afloat. 
 ''It just makes me unspeakably sad,'' Ms. McAlpin said. ''This perfect storm of elements have come together and brought us to a stop.''

HEADLINE: Britain's Prime Minister Announces May 6 Election

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- Confirming what he called ''the worst-kept secret'' in British politics, Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Tuesday named May 6 as the date for Britain's general election, setting the scene for what promises to be one of the most competitive and consequential ballots in modern British history.
 After trailing the Conservatives by far wider margins for much of the last two years, Labour has clawed back in recent polls to a gap of about 10 percentage points, raising the possibility that neither party will win an overall majority. At the same time, the 2010 election is being viewed by many as potentially the most pivotal since the one in 1979 that brought the conservative Margaret Thatcher to power and recast the fundamentals of British politics and society. 
 For many in recent months, as the election issues have sharpened, there has been a ''back to the future'' feel about the contest.
 Among these issues is the shadow of social class and privilege, which Lady Thatcher and Tony Blair, architect of the New Labour project that many saw as a consolidation of the Thatcher-era reforms, prided themselves on having moved to the edges of Britain's political debate.
 Encouraged by American consultants recruited by Labour for the election, Mr. Brown and other Labour leaders have sought in recent months to depict David Cameron, the Conservative leader, and his closest allies as out-of-touch elitists. In a tactic not used at the national campaign level for decades, they have used slang terms like posh and toff, and made hay of the fact that Mr. Cameron was educated at Eton, the country's most exclusive private school.
 Also in play, again, is the power of the labor unions. The declared ambition of some leaders of the country's biggest unions to use the election as a means of regaining effective control of Labour -- and with it, the political and economic power they lost during the Thatcher years -- has carried strong overtones of the years of Labour rule in the 1970s. 
 Allied to this is state dominance of the economy, another feature of British life after World War II that Lady Thatcher and Mr. Blair set out, to different degrees, to reverse. That this is once again a political issue is dizzying to those who recall the years when Lady Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan made a centerpiece of their commitment to free Britain and the United States from the ''dead hand'' of government ownership and economic regulation.
 But under the pressure of the brutal recession and the huge government debt that the Brown government has racked up in sustaining the economy, and the shift from the centrist Mr. Blair to the more leftist Mr. Brown, Britain has moved sharply back toward becoming one of Western Europe's more statist economies.
 Together, these issues formed the backdrop as Mr. Brown and Mr. Cameron leapt into the 30 days of electioneering that began with Mr. Brown's visit to Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. There he met privately with Queen Elizabeth II to seek a dissolution of Parliament. In choosing the May date, he ran about as close as he could to the statutory expiration in early June of Labour's five-year term in office.
 After periods in the past two years when Labour trailed the Conservatives by as much as 20 percentage points, polls in the past week have shown Labour lagging by 4 to 10 percentage points. The narrowing gap between the two parties has reinforced a view among British pundits that Mr. Brown need not win outright, which few commentators think likely, but only avoid losing by too wide a margin.
 Because of the way in which constituency boundaries are set for the 650 House of Commons seats, the Conservatives need to win by a margin over Labour of about seven percentage points just to eke out a majority. Anything less, and the likelihood is for a hung Parliament in which Labour, reaching out to the left-leaning Liberal Democrats, could hang onto power.
 In his remarks on Tuesday. Mr. Brown resisted playing the class card directly. But he touched on the Labour theme of the Conservatives' being out of touch with the concerns of ordinary people by saying that Conservative plans to cut government spending risk plunging the economy back into recession just as it begins to grow again. ''The lives of hundreds of thousands of people will be put at risk,'' he said.
 In his first outing on the hustings, Mr. Cameron took issue with the claim that Conservative rule would mean large cuts in health, education and welfare, further burdening Britain's poor. He pressed voters to accept that he had recast the Conservatives from the ''nasty party'' that one leading Conservative said it had become before Mr. Cameron took the helm in 2005. The Conservatives, Mr. Cameron said in prepared remarks, were now a party open to ''young, old, rich, poor, black, white, gay and straight.''
 The Conservative leader also touched obliquely on the growing power of the state in British life, where more than half of all those in employment have government jobs, and just over half of the economy is accounted for by government activity. Urging the dismantling of the state's expanding power too directly, in Lady Thatcher's style, is seen by Conservative strategists as political suicide.
 But Mr. Cameron offered something he called ''the big society,'' a plan to devolve central government power to local communities, to finance community organizers working in deprived neighborhoods and to ease the government's grip on wide areas of British life. The Conservatives, he said, would offer ''not just a new set of politicians, but a whole different way'' to govern Britain.

HEADLINE: Analysis of California Pensions Finds Half-Trillion-Dollar Gap

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
An independent analysis of California's three big pension funds has found a hidden shortfall of more than half a trillion dollars, several times the amount reported by the funds and more than six times the value of the state's outstanding bonds.
 The analysis was commissioned by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has been pressing the State Legislature to focus on the rising cost of public pensions. 
 Graduate students at Stanford applied fair-value accounting principles to California's pension funds, using a method recently devised by two economists working in Illinois, Joshua D. Rauh of Northwestern University and Robert Novy-Marx of the University of Chicago. 
 The Stanford group's finding does not suggest that California has to come up with half a trillion dollars all at once; pensions are paid slowly over time. But the possibility that the state's public pension funds are much deeper in the hole than reported could help explain why the required contributions to the funds have been rising every year, contributing to California's annual budget drama. 
 The finding also raises vexing legal issues, because public debts in California are supposed to be approved by the voters. The voters have, in fact, duly authorized all of the state's general obligation bonds, but the much larger pension debt is appearing out of nowhere. 
 The researchers offered six recommendations for closing the gap between what is owed to the state's retirees and how much has been set aside, including less volatile investments and a revamped benefit structure. 
 Governor Schwarzenegger issued a statement on Monday, warning that unless state lawmakers tackled pension reform, ''increasingly large portions of state funding for programs Californians hold dear, such as schools, parks and health care, will be diverted to pay for this debt.'' 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger pointed out that he proposed pension initiatives a year ago, but lawmakers never followed through. 
 ''We cannot wait any longer,'' he said. ''Without reform, pension debt will only grow.'' 
 The Stanford project focused on California's big state-run employees' pension fund, known as Calpers; a second large fund for teachers, known as Calstrs, and the University of California Retirement System. The three funds serve more than 2.6 million public employees and retirees.
 Smaller public pension funds in California, run by cities and some counties, were not included in the analysis. 
 Public pension funds in all states and cities normally report their financial status with numbers prepared by actuaries, who keep track of assets and liabilities while calculating required contributions every year. Increasingly, though, economists and other authorities say that the actuarial numbers give an unacceptably distorted picture. 
 That is because pension actuaries are trying to plan a budget of smooth, predictable contributions over the years, regardless of market volatility. Their job is not to provide a current financial picture. 
 Companies are no longer allowed to use actuarial numbers when reporting their pension values to the Securities and Exchange Commission. For governments, the board that issues accounting rules has been contemplating whether to change its pension standard, but while it deliberates, economists like Mr. Rauh and Mr. Novy-Marx are recalculating public pension numbers on their own.
 The primary complaint about the method used by states and cities is how they gauge the value of the pensions they owe in the future in today's dollars -- a widely accepted financial calculation known as discounting. 
 Currently, governments discount pension values by using the return they expect their pension investments to earn over the long term. For most public pension funds, that means about 8 percent. In California, the teachers' fund uses 8 percent, Calpers uses 7.75 percent, and the University fund uses 7.5 percent. 
 The Stanford team found fault with that approach. The researchers wrote that in today's economic climate, such rates are associated with more speculative securities that carry some degree of risk, like those of emerging markets. Pensions, by contrast, are constitutionally protected and therefore the payments to public employees and retirees should carry almost no risk. 
 After the researchers applied a risk-free rate of 4.14 percent, equivalent to the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, the present value of the promised benefits ballooned. The researchers came up with a $425 billion shortfall for the three funds.
 As of July 1, 2008, the funds officially reported they were $55 billion short. They have not issued financial statements since then, but have said informally that they lost a total of $110 billion. 
 The researchers concluded that their estimate of the gap would also have grown by roughly $110 billion, to more than half a trillion, today. Their full report is expected to be released this week on the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research Web site.
 Calpers challenged the research, saying it was ''out of sync with governmental accounting rules and actuarial standards of practice.''

HEADLINE: Energy Needs in South Africa Collide With Obama Policy

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- The Obama administration, caught in an awkward bind between its own ambitions on climate change and Africa's pressing energy needs, is facing the first test of its new guidelines discouraging coal-fired power projects in developing nations. 
 This week, the World Bank will vote on a $3.75 billion loan to South Africa, most of it to help build the world's seventh-largest coal plant. The bank's own experts concede that the giant plant will ''produce large quantities of carbon dioxide that will contribute to global climate change.'' 
 But the bank's largest shareholder -- the United States -- has enacted guidelines to push for ''no or low carbon'' ways of meeting the energy needs of developing nations that rely on international financial institutions.
 Construction of the plant is well under way, so it is too late for the steps advocated in the Obama administration's guidelines to ensure that coal is a last resort. Treasury Department officials have declined to say how the United States will vote when the loan is before the bank's board on Thursday, with one describing the decision as ''challenging.''
 South African officials contend that the plant is desperately needed to help the country's economy, the largest on the continent, and those of six neighboring nations generate growth and combat poverty. The loan is the first South Africa has sought from the World Bank since apartheid ended in 1994.
 Officials here also note that the project includes $745 million for wind and solar power and efficiency measures, in addition to $3 billion for the coal plant. Without the loan, South Africa would have to turn to commercial markets to finance the rest of the coal plant's cost, a step that Public Enterprises Minister Barbara Hogan said would be ''punitively expensive'' and would probably delay the plant's completion.
 ''We run the most sophisticated economy in Africa,'' she said. ''We supply 60 percent of southern Africa's energy. If we're not able to come to the table, the consequences are huge. This is big. And renewable energy cannot provide us with that scale.''
 The fate of the loan matters to a group of developing countries that will continue to rely on coal in the coming years, even as researchers rush to devise cleaner, more commercially feasible alternatives, said Jairam Ramesh, India's environment minister. He said officials from India, China, Brazil and South Africa would meet this month in Cape Town to coordinate their positions on just such climate change issues.
 ''For the next five to seven years, we must not stop the use of present coal technologies, even as we work on developing new clean technologies,'' Mr. Ramesh said. In 2008, during President George W. Bush's administration, the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank provided $850 million to help finance an Indian coal-fired plant in Gujarat State. 
 International public financial institutions, supported by the world's richest nations, have invested $37 billion to help finance 88 coal plants over the past 15 years, many in Asia, according to a 2009 report by the Environmental Defense Fund. The plants' annual carbon dioxide emissions equal three-quarters of those from coal-fired power in the European Union, the report said. 
 The South Africa loan has set off the latest skirmish in a long-running conflict between multilateral lending institutions and environmental groups. The Environmental Defense Fund, the Sierra Club and Friends of the Earth, as well as a variety of South African civic groups, oppose the loan to Eskom, South Africa's government-controlled utility. 
 Environmentalists say that people in Africa, and especially its millions of poor farmers, have more to lose from warming temperatures -- and the droughts and extreme weather they will bring -- than people in any other part of the world. And coal plants also pollute scarce water, they say. 
 Shadowing the debate here are memories of the weeks in 2008 when South Africa went dark for long stretches as Eskom ran out of juice. Businesses shut their doors. The mining industry virtually closed for days. Traffic clogged the roads as traffic lights blinked off.
 A combination of bad management and faulty planning led to the crisis, experts say. 
 Eskom is now embarked on a $50 billion program to expand its capacity, paid for in part by a painful 25 percent to 26 percent annual electricity rate increase for each of the next three years.
 Still, the new power plant, known as Medupi, has drawn sharp opposition here on political as well as environmental grounds. Through its investment arm, the African National Congress, the governing party, has a 25 percent stake in the consortium that won a lucrative contract for boilers at the plant. A report by the public prosecutor, released two weeks ago in Parliament, found a conflict of interest in the awarding of the contract because a member of the tender committee was also on the party's national executive panel, but the report turned up no evidence that this questionable situation had influenced the outcome.
 Helen Zille, who leads the opposition Democratic Alliance, wrote last week that if the loan were approved, profits would flow to into the governing party's political operations. ''The A.N.C. will entrench its single-party dominance and, in doing so, gravely weaken our democracy,'' Ms. Zille said.
 World Bank officials reply that the bank's loan will not pay for the component of the deal in question. And they defend the project's environmental contributions, including the 100-megawatt solar project. They noted that South Africa had committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 34 percent by 2020.
 Bank officials also say their commitment to environmentally sound energy policy has gotten short shrift. Of the $8.2 billion in energy projects it financed last year, the bank said 76 percent went for nonfossil fuels; 40 percent of it went toward renewable energy and efficiency improvements. 
 ''The question is how Africa can get the understanding and support of its partners to strike the right balance between two objectives -- economic growth and climate change -- so they can light up Africa rather than keeping it literally as the dark continent,'' said Obiageli Ezekwesili, the bank's vice president for Africa.

HEADLINE: America and India Make a Pledge to Cooperate on Economic Issues

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- China's currency and role in global trade may be on economic policy makers' minds in the United States and India, but it certainly was not on their lips here on Tuesday. 
 The United States' Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, started his first official trip to India on Tuesday morning with a visit to a village to see a ''mobile bank,'' which serves customers far from bank branches. Next, he met with his economic counterparts in India, including the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee. 
 China was never mentioned in a joint press conference afterward in New Delhi, and Indian officials said later that they had no plans to intervene in China's currency policies. 
 Instead, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Mukherjee, who met to cement an economic partnership first announced during Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's state visit to Washington last November, pledged increased cooperation on macroeconomic issues and finance. They did not cite specifics but said they would meet again in Washington. 
 The two countries may ''come from different positions,'' Mr. Geithner said, but they have common problems, including the need to finance infrastructure projects and future innovation and to extend financial services to people outside the banking system. 
 Cooperation between the United States and India is ''critically important to the success of global efforts to create conditions for a more stable global financial system,'' he said.
 The two nations can help create economic growth that is ''less dependent on the willingness of Americans to live beyond our means,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 Fast-growing emerging-market countries like India, Brazil and China make up an increasing share of the world's economy and are expected to account for more than a third of global gross domestic product this year. 
 India is an ''indispensable partner in securing the future prosperity and security of the world,'' Mr. Geithner said, quoting President Obama's remarks last year. As the world recovers from the global financial crisis, India has emerged ''stronger and faster than most large economies,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 India's economy is expected to grow more than 8 percent this year as a rising middle class increases domestic consumption. The country avoided some of the worst effects of the global financial crisis in part because its banking system remains fairly isolated. 
 Mr. Mukherjee said Tuesday that discussions with Mr. Geithner had focused on ''global development with a special emphasis on U.S. and Indian economies'' and that both sides had discussed monetary and fiscal policies, banking regulations and managing capital flow, and infrastructure finance. 
 Later on Tuesday, Mr. Geithner told the Indian television channel NDTV that he was ''confident that China will decide it is in their interest to resume the move to a more flexible exchange rate that they began some years ago and suspended in the midst of the crisis.'' 
 Still, Mr. Geithner emphasized that it was China's ''choice'' to do so.
 The United States Treasury Department said over the weekend that it would delay a report to Congress that could have charged China with currency manipulation. 
 India's finance secretary, Ashok Chawla, told reporters Tuesday that the Chinese currency debate was a ''bilateral issue between the U.S. and China.'' India has ''no role to play in that,'' he said. 
 During Mr. Geithner's visit to India, the Indian foreign minister, S. M. Krishna, was on a four-day trip to Beijing. On Tuesday, Mr. Krishna spoke forcefully about increasing ties between India and China. 
 ''India and China, who share so much which is in common between our two countries, should work together and try to move much closer together so as to make an impact on global affairs,'' he said Tuesday in a speech at the China Institute of International Studies, a research group in Beijing, The Associated Press reported. 
 ''Just as we advanced decolonization and independence movements in the '50s, today we are striving to rewrite the rules of the world a little more in our favor,'' Mr. Krishna said.

HEADLINE: Pope Picks Latino to Lead Los Angeles Archdiocese

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Laurie Goodstein reported from New York, and Jennifer Steinhauer from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
The Vatican has chosen Archbishop Jose H. Gomez -- who was born in Mexico and became an American citizen while serving in Texas as a priest for the conservative Catholic organization Opus Dei -- to become the next leader of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the country. 
 The choice is an acknowledgment that the church's future in America depends on the growing numbers of Hispanic faithful, and that the Vatican is intent on elevating leaders who are solid theological conservatives. 
 The appointment of Archbishop Gomez, 58, to succeed Cardinal Roger M. Mahony represents a historic first for Hispanics, the largest minority group in the United States, and was greeted with enthusiasm by some. But the news comes as the church faces revived criticism over its handling of sexually abusive priests. 
 At his first news conference as the archbishop-designate, at the city's modern downtown Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels on Tuesday, Archbishop Gomez did not seem eager to engage repeated questions, many in Spanish, about the scandal, its impact on Catholics and accusations made by victims' advocacy groups that he mishandled abusive priests in his former archdiocese.
 Instead, he focused on his passion for evangelism, his support for comprehensive immigration reform and the distance he himself had traveled as an American immigrant. 
 ''I was born in Mexico, my sisters still live there,'' he said, his voice shaking, ''and I am very proud of the Mexican love for life and family and faith that first turned my heart toward God.'' While talking about his background, the archbishop abruptly stopped to sip from a cup. 
 ''This is getting a little emotional -- forgive me,'' he said, adding jovially, ''By the way, it's just water.''
 Archbishop Gomez, who is currently the archbishop of San Antonio, was named coadjutor bishop of Los Angeles, which means he will succeed Cardinal Mahony when the cardinal retires on Feb. 27, his 75th birthday. 
 As the leader of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which traditionally is headed by a cardinal, Archbishop Gomez is likely to receive a red cardinal's hat as well. If that happens, he would become the first Hispanic cardinal in the United States, experts on the church said Tuesday. 
 With this appointment, Pope Benedict XVI has further solidified his imprint on the leadership of the church in the United States. In only five years as pope, he has appointed dozens of bishops in this country, including new archbishops in the large and influential dioceses of Baltimore, Detroit, New York and Washington. 
 Alejandro Bermudez, director of the Catholic News Agency, based in Denver, said of Archbishop Gomez: ''He is definitely a man of the Holy Father, loyal to the Holy Father theologically, but on the other hand, he is extremely pastoral. Anybody who is expecting him to come in as a flamethrower or something like that is wrong. That's not his style.''
 Cardinal Mahony led the Los Angeles Archdiocese for 25 years and is considered one of the last remaining prominent prelates of the American bishops' ''social justice'' era, when the bishops mounted major political initiatives to encourage economic equality and the rights of farmworkers and unions. He marched with Cesar Chavez and championed immigrant rights, and last month joined a large rally in Washington for changes in immigration policy. 
 But his leadership was tarnished by accusations that he failed to report abusive priests to civil authorities and kept them working in parishes without informing parishioners. After more than 500 victims came forward with allegations of abuse by priests in Los Angeles, Cardinal Mahony signed a $600 million settlement in 2007 -- more than any other diocese has paid to settle abuse claims. 
 Archbishop Gomez was born in Monterrey, Mexico, and studied accounting there before receiving a doctorate in theology at the University of Navarra in Spain. In Spain he was ordained as a priest of Opus Dei, an elite Catholic organization founded in Spain that teaches that an ardent work ethic and devotion to demanding spiritual practices can lead to personal holiness.
 Archbishop Gomez served as the senior official for Opus Dei in Texas before he was named an auxiliary bishop in Denver in 2001. He is the first Opus Dei priest to become an American bishop, said Brian Finnerty, the United States communications director for Opus Dei. Four other American bishops are members of the Priestly Society of the Holy Cross, an Opus Dei affiliate. 
 There are 28 Hispanic bishops active in the United States, making up only 9 percent of the bishops, although Hispanics make up more than 35 percent of all American Catholics, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
 In San Antonio, Archbishop Gomez sometimes tangled with Catholic liberals who insisted that the church was expansive enough to accommodate dissenting views on such issues as abortion and gay rights. 
 But people who have worked with Archbishop Gomez describe him as more interested in practical matters than ideology. 
 On Olvera Street, just a few blocks from the cathedral in Los Angeles, where tourists and locals, many of them Mexican-Americans, gather in a festive market setting, Evelyn Rodriguez, 31, said she was cheered by the appointment.
 ''I think it's important for people to feel connected to the church,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, a cashier, who said she was an active Catholic. ''Someone who speaks the language and understands the culture is going to be different. I think he is going to pick up the pieces here.''
 But Bernabe Velarde, who owns a fruit stand in the market, was more cynical.
 ''Because the Latino community is the strongest faith group here,'' he said, ''it is in the business interest of the church to appoint a Latino. It keeps the parishioners happy.''

HEADLINE: Greek Bond Yields Soar In Sell-Off

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Investors fled Greek bonds on Tuesday, pushing up the cost of new borrowing for the debt-stricken nation and calling into question a joint rescue plan by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. 
 As early as May, Greece will need to raise an additional 11.6 billion euros ($15.5 billion), to cover a gaping budget deficit and refinance old debt as it comes due. The surge in interest rates on Greek bonds is expected to make it harder, and more expensive, for the country to borrow the money it needs.
 Over the last few months, worries about a possible default by Greece have unnerved markets around the world, forcing European leaders and the I.M.F. to come up with a plan to provide aid in the event that Greece could no longer raise money from private investors. 
 That plan, announced on March 25, was supposed to calm the markets. It succeeded briefly, but details of how it would work -- like the size of the rescue and the precise role of the I.M.F. -- were left vague. Now investors are signaling a lack of faith in the ability of the European Union and the I.M.F. to coordinate any help.
 ''The E.U. hasn't gotten that far in coming up with an aid mechanism,'' said Eric Fine, an emerging markets portfolio manager with Van Eck Global in New York. 
 The sell-off on Tuesday was spurred by reports, later denied, that Greece was seeking to renegotiate the terms of the rescue deal.
 A spokeswoman for the Greek finance ministry, Filio Lanara, said Tuesday that Greece had taken ''no action to change the terms of the agreement on mechanisms of support.'' Nor, she said, has Greece ''sought to activate this mechanism.''
 I.M.F. officials are set to arrive in Athens on Wednesday to discuss the government's austerity measures and find ways to increase tax revenue.
 At one point Tuesday, the yield on Greek debt climbed past 7 percent -- the highest since January -- as investors sold Greek bonds. At the last Greek bond auction on March 29, when the country raised $6.7 billion, yields stood at 5.9 percent.
 That auction was meant to show the world that investor confidence in Greece had returned, but it had the opposite effect because of weak demand from foreign investors. Local Greek banks were forced to buy much of the offering.
 ''It's becoming increasingly difficult to believe that Greece will be able to fund itself,'' said Michael Conelius, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore who specializes in emerging market debt.
 When Greece returns to the market in May, it will probably have to pay much more than 5.9 percent. 
 Greece needs to raise more than $40 billion before the end of the year, so an additional 1 percent in interest would cost the Greek treasury an extra $400 million annually. That would put the nation's budget further out of whack and force even sharper austerity measures than it has committed to so far. 
 ''If we don't see a concrete step, then we will enter a vicious cycle as financing costs get higher, making the debt look even more unsustainable,'' said Marco Annunziata, chief economist for UniCredit. 
 ''The end game is an I.M.F. program, and the end game is getting closer.''
 That would be a humiliating step for Greece, which is among the 16 countries that share the euro currency. 
 The prospect of a default by Greece, however, is an even more worrisome prospect; fears of such an outcome drove down the euro Tuesday, to $1.3396 from $1.3486. 
 The yield on the Greek government's benchmark 10-year bond finished the day at 6.9 percent, after officials denied that they wanted new terms for any bailout. 
 The difference in yields between Greek bonds and comparable German bonds, a barometer of market confidence, rose to 3.73 percentage points from 3.37 points.
 The Greek government has blamed speculators for its troubles, but long-term investors like Mr. Conelius are also losing faith, increasing the prospect that the I.M.F will have to act quickly and come up with a revised bailout package.
 On Tuesday, he closed out his position on Greece, contributing to a consensus of lost confidence. 
 ''I'd like nothing more than to see Greece do the right thing,'' he said.
 ''Greece needs to improve the plan.''

HEADLINE: CBS Facing Possibility of Losing a Signature Event

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The handoff from March Madness to the Masters is a hallmark of CBS Sports and a reason to say, ''Look at the high-profile events we have.'' A chunk of the sports division's identity rests with the two events, and retaining them year after year -- this will be CBS's 55th Masters -- is a way to keep viewers interested in a fractured entertainment world.
 But the stability perpetuated by Sean McManus since he became the president of CBS Sports in 1996 could be jarred within the next few months if the N.C.A.A. opts out of the final three years of its tournament deal with the network. 
 As McManus prepared to watch Duke's 61-59 victory over Butler on Monday night, he knew he might have been watching the end of March Madness on CBS. 
 McManus came to CBS Sports during its recovery from losing its N.F.L. broadcast rights. But in early 1998, he acquired the A.F.C. package that had long been NBC's. The move restored some of the spirit lost at CBS after Fox Sports spent heavily to carry the N.F.L. for the first time. 
 ''The N.F.L. was considered a bit of an unrealistic goal, but it was my primary focus,'' he said.
 In 1999, he led the talks that ended in a deal to pay $6 billion over 11 years (through 2013) to retain the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament that CBS has televised in its entirety since 1991. At the time, he said, ''There is no more important event at CBS, not just at CBS Sports, than the men's basketball tournament.''
 Since then, McManus has kept renewing CBS's rights to the N.F.L.; the United States Open tennis championship; the Masters, the PGA Tour, and the P.G.A. Championship; and the Big Ten, Big East and Southeastern Conference packages that fill its regular-season basketball schedule and its SEC football slate.
 In McManus's tenure, he has failed to renew the rights to only one major sport -- Nascar -- when NBC and Fox outbid CBS in 1999. He said, ''We made the decision then that our priorities were golf and college basketball,'' and not to accede to Nascar's desire to put more races on CBS than it could accommodate.
 All networks would like to keep what they have, but eventually, they surrender some. 
 ''On one level, it's important to keep major properties, but not crucial,'' said David Hill, the chairman of Fox Sports since its inception in 1993. He added, ''If it negatively affects your bottom line, though, and you can't see daylight, that supersedes any marketing or impact'' in keeping them. That judgment usually precludes N.F.L. rights, which are seen as ultracritical to the self-esteem of a network.
 The N.C.A.A. men's tournament gives CBS a big profile in the three weeks that it dominates the national sports conversation. And it generates significant advertising revenue. Kantar Media, a consulting firm, said CBS's March Madness sales hit $643 million in 2008 but fell to $589 million in recession-plagued 2009.
 But the cost of the next three years is steep, averaging just over $700 million annually, more than twice the first year's rights fee of $320 million. If the N.C.A.A. gambles by opting out for 2011, 2012 and 2013, CBS would be relieved of what are essentially balloon payments, a financial burden that seems to guarantee losses. 
 An opt-out does not mean CBS is automatically gone; an alliance with Turner Sports would compete with ESPN for what is likely to be an expanded 96-team tournament. ESPN would love to snare the tournament, to add to its myriad regular-season deals and to the B.C.S. postseason package that it outbid Fox to acquire.
 McManus is also the president of CBS News, which is in third place in the network news competition, losing money and trying to secure its place in an insecure universe. It can't boost Katie Couric's ratings by acquiring the exclusive rights to an election, as he can when he buys a major sports television package.
 ''It's challenging and invigorating to one minute worry about '60 Minutes' or the CBS Evening News while instantaneously shifting to the Masters or the Final Four,'' he said.
 McManus would like to stay in the March Madness business and thinks its cachet is tied partly to being on a major broadcast network. (ESPN would put some games on ABC.)
 ''If you run a sports event or a league, being able to say the broadcast is available in every household in America adds prestige,'' he said. ''When you lose that over time, the importance and relevance of those properties diminish.''

HEADLINE: The Labor Department Wakes Up

 BODY:
The Department of Labor has begun a long-overdue campaign to protect workers' rights, a core part of its job that was sorely neglected in the fiercely antiregulatory Bush era. The campaign, ''We Can Help,'' uses public-service announcements, a Web site and a phone hot line to encourage workers -- particularly those in construction, janitorial fields, hotels, food services and home health care -- to report employer abuses. It also adds 250 investigators, a one-third increase, to the department's wage and hour division. 
 We hope this opens a concerted effort by Hilda Solis, the labor secretary, to energize her department's somnolent bureaucracy. Workers need the protection. 
 Last fall, a comprehensive investigation uncovered rampant abuses of low-wage workers in factories, stores, construction sites, offices, warehouses and private homes. The study, released by the Center for Urban Economic Development, the National Employment Law Project and the U.C.L.A. Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, surveyed more than 4,000 workers in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. 
 The workers -- many undocumented immigrants -- told of employers who ignored the minimum wage, denied overtime, illegally docked their pay for the cost of tools or transportation, or forced them to work without pay before or after their shifts. More than a quarter had been paid less than the minimum wage, often by more than $1 an hour. Violations typically robbed workers of $51 a week, from an average paycheck of $339. 
 The new campaign rightly points out that all workers, including the undocumented, deserve to be paid for their labor. These are truths too often forgotten. If you work in this country, you are protected by its laws. And if unscrupulous employers can exploit the most vulnerable employees, no workers are safe. The best way to improve jobs and lives for all workers in America is to give those who are silent and exploited the courage and means to speak up.

HEADLINE: Thousands May Lose Rental Vouchers

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
Because of a $45 million budget gap, the New York City Housing Authority may have to revoke rental-assistance vouchers from more than 10,000 low-income tenants, a drastic move that could cause families to lose their apartments.
 The federal government gave the housing authority less money for the voucher program, known as Section 8, than the authority expected. But the authority made matters worse by continuing to issue new vouchers until December, eight months after the government warned it to stop doing so because the program was likely to run a deficit.
 Michael P. Kelly, the authority's general manager, said that terminating vouchers would be a last resort. The authority has not decided who might lose their vouchers, but if the deficit is not closed, the cuts could begin this summer.
 ''This is a dire option for us that we're hoping we're not going to have to do,'' Mr. Kelly said. 
 The agency is seeking federal and state funding to avert the voucher cuts. But the state is facing a huge deficit. Sandra Henriquez, an assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said that HUD would review the housing authority's books, but she added that ''they cannot and should not expect that the federal government will cover the shortfall.''
 As an alternative, the housing authority is considering reducing the value of each voucher, meaning that landlords, tenants or both would have to absorb the cost.
 Under Section 8, residents typically pay 30 percent of their income toward rent, and the voucher covers the balance. In New York City, about 102,000 families now have vouchers, which are administered by the authority and allow families to live in units where private landlords accept Section 8 benefits. An additional 178,000 or so families live in public housing complexes owned by the authority.
 After the authority voided 2,600 outstanding vouchers in December, prompting an outcry from affected families, it urged people to apply for public housing, although the waiting list is years long.
 HUD provides money for the Section 8 vouchers and tells housing authorities the maximum number they can use. In May, HUD told the New York City Housing Authority it was in danger of exceeding its allotted number.
 ''What balances you are comfortable with, of course, is a local decision,'' a HUD official, Mirza Negron Morales, wrote in a memo to the housing authority. ''Our recommendation, based on your current level of funding and the data to date, is to stop issuing vouchers and maintain current leasing and cost levels for the remainder of calendar year 2009.''
 The agency continued to issue new vouchers, about 50 a week, generally to emergency cases like homeless families, domestic violence victims and families under the supervision of the city's child welfare system. ''We wanted to help as many people as possible,'' said Sheila Stainback, a housing authority spokeswoman. ''We only issued vouchers to the most vulnerable.''
 Historically, some vouchers that are issued are never redeemed because of the difficulty in finding a suitable apartment and a landlord who will accept vouchers. And every year, some families leave the Section 8 program. But last year, more landlords began to take Section 8 vouchers, and the attrition rate dropped to 3.5 percent from about 6 percent, most likely because of the weak economy.
 ''Looking at the scale of Nycha's program,'' Mr. Kelly said, using the acronym for the authority, ''it was impossible for us to turn on a dime.''
 In December, the authority finally stopped issuing new vouchers and voided the 2,600 unused vouchers. But outside of cases of fraud or evictions for breaking other program rules, officials said they could not recall having terminated vouchers already being used.
 Judith Goldiner, a supervising lawyer at the Legal Aid Society in New York, said the prospect of terminating so many families' vouchers was ''inconceivable.''
 ''This is just a disaster,'' she said. ''We don't know who could be impacted by it.''
 The magnitude of the problem left several housing experts puzzled. New York City has exceeded its voucher cap only once before, by several hundred in 2005, according to Gregory Kern, an agency manager who oversees the Section 8 program.
 Linda Couch, the vice president for policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said that given the recession, the drop in attrition rates should not have come as a surprise. In recent years, she added, the act of continuing to issue vouchers to the point at which authorities exceeded their federal cap for Section 8 units has become ''a big no-no at HUD.''
 Douglas Rice, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said the housing authority's data showed that it ''leased up very aggressively in the second half of last year.''
 He added, ''They should have realized they weren't getting nearly enough renewal funds as they expected.''
 Housing authorities across the country began learning in May that they would be receiving less federal money for Section 8 than they had expected. In many cases, the recession made existing vouchers more costly as incomes dropped, leading authorities to make up the difference.
 Experts estimated that hundreds of agencies would have to reduce rental assistance or revoke vouchers. In the end, few housing authorities terminated vouchers; one small agency in Oregon cut 50 of them, with 15 of those families taken in by other public assistance programs.
 In several places, including Monterey, Calif.; Walla Walla, Wash.; and Bridgeport, Conn., housing authorities began paying a lower percentage of recipients' rents.
 ''I literally don't sleep anymore because every day I'm trying to see who's attriting from the program to see if I can survive,'' said Nicholas Calace, executive director of the Bridgeport Housing Authority.
 Mr. Kern and Mr. Kelly said the New York City authority had been trying to cut the number of people with Section 8 vouchers by doing more fraud investigations and weeding out those who underreport their income. The termination rate is 400 to 450 a month, Mr. Kern said, compared with 350 to 400 last summer.
 When other housing authorities began considering terminations last year, they contemplated a ''last in, first out'' policy, in which the most recently issued vouchers would be revoked first.
 Among the many families with newer vouchers in New York are Izolda Mandelblat, 77, and her husband, Moisey Frenkel, 85, who live in a one-bedroom apartment in Inwood, in Upper Manhattan. The couple, immigrants from Ukraine, had been on a Section 8 waiting list for 13 years. After their benefits finally started in November, the couple began to blossom, according to their granddaughter, Nera Lerner, 19.
 Fresh fruits and vegetables began appearing in their refrigerator, replacing the fatty discount chicken, and the canned and frozen food they had subsisted on for years. Ms. Mandelblat began buying vitamins. The couple could finally afford all of their medications; he has diabetes, and she has skin cancer.
 They earn about $1,100 in Social Security income and pay $256 a month toward their $1,019 rent; the voucher covers the rest.
 ''They're a lot more hopeful now,'' Ms. Lerner said. Asked what she would do if she lost her voucher, Ms. Mandelblat fell into despair.
 ''Oh no, oh no,'' she said through her granddaughter, who interpreted. ''I would be homeless. I would die.''

HEADLINE: Fewer Bags, More Revenue

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
Airlines in the United States started charging for luggage in 2005 by instituting a fee for passengers with more than one bag to check. Soon, even the first bag wasn't free. Now, Spirit Airlines says it will charge as much as $30 each way for carry-on bags that are too big to fit under the seat.
 Spirit is a small airline and after its announcement Tuesday, none of the bigger airlines said they would follow suit. Yet. 
 But it is already clear that the fees air travelers pay to check luggage on most flights have had a big impact on airlines' bottom lines, perhaps bigger than even the airlines expected. A fee for a carry-on bag only underlines the new financial reality at airlines: Everyone, and everything, on a plane must pay its own way. 
 ''Nobody brings their package to FedEx or U.P.S. and expects them to ship it for free,'' said Ben Baldanza, the chief executive of Spirit Airlines.
 The total in bag fees collected by the airlines has skyrocketed since they were first imposed. According to the Transportation Department, the fees rose from $464 million in 2007 to nearly $2 billion in just the first nine months of last year. 
 At the same time, passengers are now checking fewer, and lighter, bags to avoid the extra fees for heavy suitcases. As a result, the airlines have not been losing as many bags, and baggage handlers appear to be suffering fewer injuries. 
 In addition, the airlines now have more space available for cargo, which sells at a higher rate than a checked bag. ''Freight makes a significant contribution to the bottom line of passenger airlines,'' said Ulrich Ogiermann, chairman of the International Air Cargo Association. The revenue potential ''cannot be ignored,'' he added.
 A baggage report released last month from SITA, an aviation information technology company that studies trends in passenger baggage, found that one in four passengers chose not to check bags last year, compared with one in six in 2008 -- the first year virtually all the major airlines imposed the fees. 
 The decrease in the number of bags checked last year, which the report also attributed to a drop in the number of people flying, resulted in a 24 percent decrease in the number of bags mishandled worldwide -- both damaged and lost. That, in turn, saved the United States airline industry $94 million, according to SITA's figures. 
 Joseph Pascarella, who has worked as a baggage handler in Tampa, Fla., for 37 years, said he had noticed the difference. ''Before the bag fees, we would handle an average 250 bags on a flight. Now it's closer to 150 to 175. People are also thinking twice about taking that extra bag.''
 If passengers are being more thoughtful about what they pack, the benefits can be widespread, said Catherine Mayer, a vice president at SITA. ''There's less strain on the airline, less handling costs.'' 
 The airlines, though, are not so quick to acknowledge that. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines all say they are not tracking the relationship between baggage fees and the other economies. But Daniel McKenzie, an airline analyst for Hudson Securities in Chicago, said the airlines had generally been citing the advantages on financial conference calls.
 ''They talk about the benefits of reduced baggage handling and reduced workers' compensation claims, and that helps free up restricted cash,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''The other one is, if you've got bag handlers handling fewer bags, it means maybe they don't need to replace as many when employees turn over.''
 He said he thought the airlines did not want to talk publicly about the advantages of the fees because ''they would like to manage what they make public,'' adding: ''They get beat up constantly. They've gotten beat up by Congress, the D.O.T., passenger rights' advocates.''
 Ryanair, the low-cost carrier based in Ireland that is known for its rock-bottom tickets, is now considering another big step toward keeping passengers traveling light. This fall, the airline plans to eliminate checked baggage altogether at certain times of the day on selected routes. 
 ''Bringing a big bag and expecting it to travel for free, it's too much to ask,'' said Stephen McNamara, director of communications for Ryanair. ''It's expensive to ship something heavy in an airplane when fuel prices are very high.'' Mr. McNamara said the airline had as a goal nothing less than changing passenger behavior. ''People are packing way too much; women bringing four pairs of shoes, hair dryers, that sort of thing.'' 
 In the United States, the most visible consequence of baggage fees has been the increase in more, and heavier, items in the passenger cabin, the very behavior that prompted Spirit's new fee for carry-on policy. A survey by the Association of Flight Attendants found ''excess amounts of oversized carry-on items'' were causing flight attendants to be injured. Eighty percent of the flight attendants reported muscle pulls and sprains. Thirty-five percent said they were hit by falling bags.
 Injuries and inconvenience in the cabin are two reasons cited by Representative Daniel Lipinski, an Illinois Democrat, for introducing a bill to limit the size of bags that can be brought into the cabin. ''The bill would enhance safety, help reduce boarding and de-boarding times, and prevent baggage compartment overcrowding,'' the congressman said in an e-mail message. 
 One thing baggage fees were expected to do but have not done is to reduce the turnaround time at the gate. With so many passengers trying to bring everything they need for a trip into the passenger cabin, departures are often delayed to deal with the problem of trying to squeeze too many bags into too little space. 
 ''Almost every flight, the amount of luggage people try to carry on doesn't fit,'' Mr. Pascarella, the baggage handler, said. ''It's at least 10 to 20 bags per flight.'' 
 In 2005, the average weight of passengers and their luggage was revised upward to more accurately reflect the larger girth of travelers and their wider array of travel gear. But the Federal Aviation Administration does not keep track of how much baggage goes into the cargo hold and how much is carried into the cabin. In an e-mail message, Les Dorr Jr., a spokesman for the F.A.A., said that might change.
 ''We are aware of the potential change in passenger behavior due to the imposition of baggage fees and are currently considering if it is appropriate to revise our existing guidance,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Medicine, The Power Of No

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 How can we learn to say no?
 The federal government is now starting to build the institutions that will try to reduce the soaring growth of health care costs. There will be a group to compare the effectiveness of different treatments, a so-called Medicare innovation center and a Medicare oversight board that can set payment rates.
 But all these groups will face the same basic problem. Deep down, Americans tend to believe that more care is better care. We recoil from efforts to restrict care.
 Managed care became loathed in the 1990s. The recent recommendation to reduce breast cancer screening set off a firestorm. On a personal level, anyone who has made a decision about his or her own care knows the nagging worry that comes from not choosing the most aggressive treatment. 
 This try-anything-and-everything instinct is ingrained in our culture, and it has some big benefits. But it also has big downsides, including the side effects and risks that come with unnecessary treatment. Consider that a recent study found that 15,000 people were projected to die eventually from the radiation they received from CT scans given in just a single year -- and that there was ''significant overuse'' of such scans. 
 From an economic perspective, health reform will fail if we can't sometimes push back against the try-anything instinct. The new agencies will be hounded by accusations of rationing, and Medicare's long-term budget deficit will grow. 
 So figuring out how we can say no may be the single toughest and most important task facing the people who will be in charge of carrying out reform. ''Being able to say no,'' Dr. Alan Garber of Stanford says, ''is the heart of the issue.''
 It's easy to come up with arguments for why we need to do so. Above all, we don't have a choice. Giving hospitals and drug makers a blank check will bankrupt Medicare. Slowing the cost growth, on the other hand, will free up resources for other uses, like education. Lower costs will also lift workers' take-home pay.
 But I suspect that these arguments won't be persuasive. They have the faint ring of an insurer's rationale for denying a claim. Compared with an anecdote about a cancer patient looking for hope, the economic arguments are soulless. 
 The better bet for the new reformers -- starting with Donald Berwick, the physician who will run Medicare -- is to channel American culture, not fight it. We want the best possible care, no matter what. Yet we often do not get it because the current system tends to deliver more care even when it means worse care. 
 It's not just CT scans. Caesarean births have become more common, with little benefit to babies and significant burden to mothers. Men who would never have died from prostate cancer have been treated for it and left incontinent or impotent. Cardiac stenting and bypasses, with all their side effects, have become popular partly because people believe they reduce heart attacks. For many patients, the evidencesuggests, that's not true. 
 Advocates for less intensive medicine have been too timid about all this. They often come across as bean counters, while the try-anything crowd occupies the moral high ground. The reality, though, is that unnecessary care causes a lot of pain and even death. Dr. Berwick, who made his reputation campaigning against medical errors, is a promising (if much belated) selection for precisely this reason. 
 Can we solve the entire problem of rising health costs by getting rid of needless care? Probably not. But the money involved is not trivial, and it's the obvious place to start.
 Learning to say no more often will be a three-step process, and if the new agencies created by the health act are run well, they can help with all three. 
 The first is learning more about when treatments work and when they don't. ''All too often,'' the Institute of Medicinereports, the data is ''incomplete or unavailable.'' As a result, more than half of treatments lack clear evidence of effectiveness, the institute found. It says the most promising areas for research include prostate cancer, inflammatory diseases, back pain, hyperactivity, and CT scans vs. M.R.I.'s for cancer diagnosis. 
 As part of the health act, a Patient Centered Health Research group will have an annual budget of $600 million. Relative to total health spending, that's a paltry sum. But it's real money relative to what's now being spent on such research.
 The second step -- and maybe the most underappreciated one -- is to give patients the available facts about treatments. Amazingly, this often does not happen. ''People are pretty woefully undereducated about fateful medical decisions,'' says Dr. Michael Barry of the Massachusetts General Hospital, an advocate for sharing more with patients.
 Dale Collins Vidal, a reconstructive breast surgeon at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, told me a story about a patient's husband who asked to sit in on the medical team's discussion of his wife's case. The doctors said no, because they were uncomfortable with him knowing about the uncertainty surrounding the case. ''The paternalism is a little more kind-hearted than it was in the past,'' Dr. Collins Vidal says, ''but it's still paternalism.''
 When patients are given information about potential benefits and risks, they seem to choose less invasive care, on average, than doctors do, according to early studies. Some people, of course, decide that aggressive care is right for them -- like the cancer patient (and palliative care doctor) profiled in this newspaper a few days ago. They are willing to accept the risks and side effects that come with treatment. Many people, however, go the other way once they understand the trade-offs. 
 They decide the risk of incontinence and impotence isn't worth the marginal chance of preventing prostate cancer. Or they choose cardiac drugs and lifestyle changes over stenting. Or they opt to skip the prenatal test to determine if their baby has Down syndrome. Or, in the toughest situation of all, they decide to leave an intensive care unit and enter a hospice. 
 The health act requires Medicare and other agencies to help hospitals and doctors give patients more information -- which is practically a no-lose proposition. In the course of receiving more control and more choice, two distinctly American values, patients will probably help hold down costs.
 The final step is the bluntest. It involves changing the economics of medicine, to reward better care rather than simply more care. Health reform doesn't go nearly far enough on this score, but it is a start. 
 The tax subsidies for health insurance will shrink, which should help people realize medical care is not free. And doctors who provide good, less expensive care won't be financially punished as often as they now are.
 None of these steps will allow us to avoid the wrenching debates that are an inevitable part of health policy. Eventually, we may well have to decide against paying for expensive treatments with only modest benefits. But given how difficult that would be for this country, it makes sense to start with the easier situations -- the ones in which ''no'' really is the best answer for patients.
 ''In the United States, I don't know that we're ever going to get to a point where we limit health care spending,'' as Dr. Collins Vidal says. ''But maybe we could get patients to the same place on their own.''

HEADLINE: Upbeat Signs Revive Mood For Spending

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
American consumers are finally coming out of hiding.
 After months of penny-pinching amid the recession, new figures -- showing an improving job market, rising factory output and increased retail sales -- suggest that consumers are no longer restricting their budgets to necessities like food and medicine. They are starting to buy clothes, jewelry and even cars again. 
 The mood has gone from panicked to cautious, and now, as Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody'sEconomy.com put it, some consumers are ''almost a bit giddy.'' 
 After the financial crisis hit in late 2008, consumers retrenched heavily. And in the months that followed, there were fears that newly frugal Americans would increase their savings so much there was no hope that consumer spending could be a factor in a recovery. 
 That was a troubling prospect because consumers have been the drivers of economic growth after past recessions. After all, their spending accounts for more than two-thirds of all economic activity in the United States.
 But just a year later, consumers have eased off a bit on their savings, which frees up cash for them to spend. And in part because of the high rate of mortgage defaults, the overall consumer debt burden has been dropping. Those trends suggest to some economists that consumers may now be in a position to help drive the recovery.
 The improved outlook has been showing up at store cash registers for several months, and the trend seems to be accelerating. Major retailing chains posted better-than-expected earnings in their most recent reporting periods and are likely to deliver more good news on Thursday, when they report their March sales results. 
 Total industry sales are predicted to increase up to 10 percent compared with the period a year ago, which would make March the seventh month of growth in a row, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry group. (A significant part of that increase is because of a calendar shift involving Easter.)
 SpendingPulse, an information service of MasterCard Advisors, is scheduled to release figures on Wednesday showing that closely watched retailing categories -- furniture and home furnishings, clothing, electronics and luxury goods -- had healthy year-over-year sales growth last month. 
 And after months of cutting inventory to bring it in line with weakened demand, the nation's retailers are ordering more merchandise. The cargo volume at major ports that handle retail imports is expected to increase 8 percent in April compared with the period a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation and the consulting firm Hackett Associates.
 ''What I'm hearing across a wide swath of retail is that sales are simply much stronger than companies had expected,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm.
 The improvement extends even to some of the most costly household items. Last week, almost every automaker, including Ford, Toyota and General Motors, reported robust sales increases in March. Spring incentives like no-interest loans helped lure consumers into showrooms. 
 The Commerce Department said its broadest measure of retail sales, a figure known as personal consumption expenditures, increased 0.3 percent in February compared with January, or $34.7 billion, the fifth monthly gain in a row. And the personal savings rate -- which jumped above 5 percent during the recession -- has returned to its historical level of about 3 percent.
 Lauren Keshet, the owner of Paws and Claws, a pet care company in Hoboken, said her business suffered when the economy nose-dived and consumers snapped their wallets shut. ''My business went to half'' of what she had been selling, Ms. Keshet said. But today, ''my business is booming again,'' she said. ''It's really come back.'' 
 So has her spending, and that of other shoppers she has seen lately at the Westfield Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, N.J. ''Right now I'm renovating my house,'' she said. ''I'm buying furniture.'' 
 Indeed, sales of furniture and furnishings combined increased 13.8 percent year-over-year in March, according to SpendingPulse. 
 Perhaps the most meaningful sign of recovery is that employers added 162,000 jobs last month. With unemployment hovering at 9.7 percent, the job market is still weak by historical standards, but the rate is no longer rising.
 John D. Morris, a retailing analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said that at the nation's malls, strong fashion trends like jeggings (jeans so tight they resemble leggings) are helping drive sales. He expects the new iPad from Apple will do the same. 
 ''There's a true desire to buy that I haven't seen in two or three years,'' Mr. Morris said. ''The consumer's gotten a little bit braver.''
 Economists and analysts said much of the uptick in spending was being propelled by wealthier consumers. With year-end bonuses in their pockets and healthier stock portfolios, they have slowed their savings. That has contributed to robust sales at upscale chains that were hit hard by the recession, like Nordstrom, Tiffany, Saks and Neiman Marcus. SpendingPulse said sales of luxury goods climbed 22.7 percent in March compared with a year ago, making the category one of the best performers last month.
 In February, the pricey teenage clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch -- which had been reporting the worst monthly sales of any major national chain -- posted a 5 percent year-over-year same-store sales increase. And it is expected to post another strong figure on Thursday. 
 Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for SpendingPulse, pointed out that the results from chain stores sound robust largely because this year's sales were being compared with the depths of the recession. So the big gains really represent a return to normal patterns.
 ''It's more about how little people were buying a year ago than how much people are buying today,'' he said.
 Indeed, retail sales are still below the highs they hit in 2006 and 2007.
 A lingering fear is that the sales gains could turn out to be temporary. Mr. Zandi of Moody's said that once wealthier consumers satisfied their pent-up demand, they might become cautious again. And other economists fear that the strengthening retail figures are not necessarily a good sign. 
 ''The more money the consumer spends, the worse shape our economy is going to be in,'' said Peter D. Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, ''because we are spending borrowed money.'' 
 Paul Laudicina, chairman of A. T. Kearney, the management consulting company, said that while some people were feeling confident enough to spend, he predicted a continuing degree of caution among consumers.
 ''We shouldn't free the balloons,'' he said, ''because this is going to continue to be a slow, long, steady climb.''

HEADLINE: Deaths at Mine Raising Issues About Safety

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA and MICHAEL COOPER; Ian Urbina reported from Montcoal, and Michael Cooper from New York. Reporting was contributed by Bernie Becker and Dan Heyman from Montcoal, and Dan Barry, Charles Duhigg, Liz Robbins and Stephanie Strom from New York.

 BODY:
MONTCOAL, W.Va. -- Rescue workers began the precarious task Tuesday of removing explosive methane gas from the coal mine where at least 25 miners died the day before. The mine owner's dismal safety record, along with several recent evacuations of the mine, left federal officials and miners suggesting that Monday's explosion might have been preventable.
 In the past two months, miners had been evacuated three times from the Upper Big Branch because of dangerously high methane levels, according to two miners who asked for anonymity for fear of losing their jobs. Representative Nick J. Rahall II, a Democrat whose district includes the mine, said he had received similar reports from miners about recent evacuations at the mine, which as recently as last month was fined at least three times for ventilation problems, according to federal records.
 The Massey Energy Company, the biggest coal mining business in central Appalachia and the owner of the Upper Big Branch mine, has drawn sharp scrutiny and fines from regulators over its safety and environmental record. 
 In 2008, one of its subsidiaries paid what federal prosecutors called the largest settlement in the history of the coal industry after pleading guilty to safety violations that contributed to the deaths of two miners in a fire in one of its mines. That year, Massey also paid a $20 million fine -- the largest of its kind levied by the Environmental Protection Agency -- for clean water violations. 
 It is still unclear what caused Monday's blast, which is under investigation. But the disaster has raised new questions about Massey's attention to safety under the leadership of its pugnacious chief executive, Don L. Blankenship, and about why stricter federal laws, put into effect after a mining disaster in 2006, failed to prevent another tragedy. 
 Kevin Stricklin, an administrator with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the magnitude of the explosion -- the worst mining accident in 25 years, which also left four people missing, including a woman working as a mining operator -- showed that ''something went very wrong here.''
 ''All explosions are preventable,'' Mr. Stricklin said. ''It's just making sure you have things in place to keep one from occurring.''
 Mr. Rahall said that even veteran rescue workers, some with decades of experience, had told him they were shocked by what they saw inside the mine. They said they had never witnessed destruction on that scale, Mr. Rahall said, or dealt with the aftermath of an explosion of that magnitude.
 ''It turned rail lines into pretzels,'' Mr. Rahall said. ''There seems like there was something awfully wrong to make such a huge explosion.''
 Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and members of Congress said state and federal officials would begin investigating the explosion. 
 In an interview with the Metronews radio network in West Virginia, Mr. Blankenship said that despite the company's many violations, the Mine Safety and Health Administration would never have allowed the mine to operate if it had been unsafe.
 ''Violations are unfortunately a normal part of the mining process,'' Mr. Blankenship said. 
 ''There are violations at every coal mine in America, and U.B.B. was a mine that had violations,'' he added, referring to Upper Big Branch.
 ''I think the fact that M.S.H.A., the state and our fire bosses and the best engineers that you can find were all in and around this mine, and all believed it to be safe in the circumstances it was in, speaks for itself as far as any suspicion that the mine was improperly operated,'' Mr. Blankenship said.
 The Massey Energy Web site also contains a defense of the company's safety record. It says 2009 was the 17th year out of 20 that the company had scored above the industry average in safety.
 But miners and other workers in the mine took issue with Mr. Blankenship's reassurances.
 ''No one will say this who works at that mine, but everyone knows that it has been dangerous for years,'' said Andrew Tyler, 22, an electrician who worked on the wiring for the coal conveyer belt as a subcontractor at the mine two years ago. 
 Mr. Tyler said workers had regularly been told to work 12-hour shifts when eight hours is the industry standard. He also said that live wires had been left exposed and that an accumulation of coal dust and methane was routinely ignored. 
 ''I'm willing to go on record because I am a subcontractor who doesn't depend on Massey for my life,'' Mr. Tyler said. 
 In March alone, the Mine Safety and Health Administration cited the Upper Big Branch mine for 53 safety violations.
 Last year, the number of citations issued against the mine more than doubled, to over 500, from 2008, and the penalties proposed against the mine more than tripled, to $897,325.
 J. Davitt McAteer, a former assistant director of the Mine Safety and Health Administration, said the Massey company ''is certainly one of the worst in the industry'' when it came to safety and called recent violations at the mine for substandard ventilation and other problems ''cardinal sins.''
 ''The Massey record is without doubt one of the most difficult in the industry from a safety standpoint,'' Mr. McAteer, now the vice president of Wheeling Jesuit University, said in an interview. He said other large, diversified coal operators had far better safety records than Massey.
 In 2008, the Aracoma Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey, agreed to pay $4.2 million in criminal fines and civil penalties and to plead guilty to several safety violations related to a 2006 fire that killed two miners at a coal mine in Logan, W.Va. 
 After the fire broke out, the two miners found themselves unable to escape, partly because the company had removed some ventilation controls inside the mine. The workers died of suffocation. Federal prosecutors at the time called it the largest such settlement in the history of the coal industry.
 The company's commitment to safety came under scrutiny in 2005 after Mr. Blankenship sent a memorandum to his deep mine superintendents. 
 ''If any of you have been asked by your group presidents, your supervisors, engineers or anyone else to do anything other than run coal (i.e., build overcasts, do construction jobs, or whatever), you need to ignore them and run coal,'' said the memo, a copy of which was obtained from Bruce E. Stanley, a lawyer who represented the widows of the victims of the Aracoma mine fire. ''This memo is necessary only because we seem not to understand that coal pays the bills.''
 In a follow-up memo a week later, Mr. Blankenship said some superintendents might have interpreted his first memo as implying that safety was a secondary consideration; in the second memo he called safety the company's ''first responsibility.''
 In Washington on Tuesday during an Easter prayer breakfast, President Obama offered his condolences to the families of the victims and said the federal government was ready to help in whatever way needed. 
 Thirty-one miners were in the mine around 3 p.m. Monday when the explosion occurred. Some died from the explosion. Others suffocated from the fumes, state safety officials said. Seven of the bodies have been removed, and 14 have not yet been identified.
 Four of the miners who were believed to have been farther back in the mine remained unaccounted for late Tuesday. Officials said there was still a possibility, though slim, that they had been able to reach airtight chambers, where there are stockpiles of food, water and oxygen.
 Governor Manchin said at an afternoon news conference on Tuesday that four drills were in place to begin drilling holes behind the rescue chambers, an effort that began in earnest later in the day. It may not be until Wednesday night that rescue workers can regain entry to the mine after the first ventilation hole is drilled, he said.
 ''Everyone is going to cling on to the hope of that miracle,'' the governor said of the four missing miners. ''The odds are against us. These are long odds. They know. These are mining families. They know methane, they know about air.''
 As the families of the miners waited on Tuesday, frustrations grew. State and mine officials were taking a long time to confirm the names of the dead, many of the miners said. Families also voiced frustration that they had learned about the disaster from news reports rather than from Massey officials.
 Some of these tensions boiled over around 2 a.m. Tuesday when Mr. Blankenship arrived at the mine to announce the death toll to families who were gathered at the site. Escorted by at least a dozen state and other police officers, according to several witnesses, Mr. Blankenship prepared to address the crowd, but people yelled at him for caring more about profits than miners' lives. 
 After another Massey official informed the crowd of the new death toll, one miner threw a chair. A father and son stormed off screaming that they were quitting mining work. And several people yelled at Mr. Blankenship that he was to blame before he was escorted from the scene.

HEADLINE: Mourning in the Mountains

BYLINE: By DENISE GIARDINA. 
Denise Giardina is the writer-in-residence at West Virginia State University.

DATELINE: Charleston, W.Va. 

 BODY:
 PEOPLE in West Virginia had hoped that on Monday night we would gather around televisions with family and friends to watch our beloved Mountaineers face Butler in our first chance at the men's N.C.A.A. basketball title since 1959. Men working evening shifts in the coal mines would get to listen thanks to radio coverage piped in from the surface. Expectations ran high; even President Obama, surveying the Final Four, predicted West Virginia would win. 
 Then, on Tuesday morning, we would wake to triumphant headlines in sports pages across the country. At last, we would say, something good has happened to West Virginia. The whole nation would see us in a new light. And we would cry.
 Instead, halfway through Saturday night's semifinal against Duke, our star forward, Da'Sean Butler, tore a ligament in his knee, and the Mountaineers crumbled. And on Monday evening, while Duke and Butler played in what for us was now merely a game, West Virginians gathered around televisions to watch news of a coal mine disaster.
 On Tuesday, the headline in The Charleston Gazette read instead: Miners Dead, Missing in Raleigh Explosion. And we cried.
 Despite the sunny skies and unseasonably warm weather, the mood here in southern West Virginia is subdued. As of Tuesday afternoon, 25 men have been confirmed dead, two are critically injured, and four are missing and presumed dead. Their fellow West Virginians work round the clock and risk their own lives to retrieve the bodies. 
 Already outrage is focused on Massey Energy, owner of the Upper Big Branch mine. Massey has a history of negligence, and Upper Big Branch has often been cited in recent years for problems, including failure to properly vent methane gas, which officials say might have been the cause of Monday's explosion. 
 It seems we can't escape our heritage. I grew up in a coal camp in the southern part of the state. Every day my school bus drove past a sign posted by the local coal company keeping tally, like a basketball scoreboard, of ''man hours'' lost to accidents. From time to time classmates whose fathers had been killed or maimed would disappear, their families gone elsewhere to seek work.
 We knew then, and know now, that we are a national sacrifice area. We mine coal despite the danger to miners, the damage to the environment and the monomaniacal control of an industry that keeps economic diversity from flourishing here. We do it because America says it needs the coal we provide.
 West Virginians get little thanks in return. Our miners have historically received little protection, and our politicians remain subservient to Big Coal. Meanwhile, West Virginia is either ignored by the rest of the nation or is the butt of jokes about ignorant hillbillies.
 Here in West Virginia we will forget our fleeting dream of basketball glory and get about the business of mourning. It is, after all, something we do very well. In the area around the Upper Big Branch, families of the dead will gather in churches and their neighbors will come to pray with them. They will go home, and the same neighbors will show up bearing platters of fried chicken and potato salad and cakes. The funeral homes will be jammed, the mourners in their best suits and ties and Sunday dresses.
 And perhaps this time President Obama and Americans will pay attention, and notice West Virginia at last.

HEADLINE: From AT&T, at-Home Cellular 'Towers'

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Faced with withering criticism for its spotty iPhone service, AT&T blames in part a shortage of cellphone towers near homes and businesses. But it has a solution: put a miniature cell tower in your living room.
 There's a catch, though. You have to pay for it. And that is making some customers angry. 
 The size of a couple of decks of cards, these mini-towers act and look like Wi-Fi hot spots at cafes, and redirect cellphone calls from congested cell towers to home Web connections. 
 ''It's a fabulous idea, especially if you can't get service, but to charge for it is insulting,'' said Christina Zachariades, 28, of Manhattan who already pays $130 a month for iPhone service but cannot receive or make calls in her fifth-floor apartment on the Upper East Side. ''How much more do I have to pay to get the service required for me to use my phone?'' 
 Despite complaints like this, the technology is poised for big sales, thanks to price drops but also because of the entrance into the market by AT&T. Other companies -- Verizon, for example -- have already marketed their mini-towers for niche use to customers in places with limited cellphone signals, like basements or homes with particularly thick walls.
 But although AT&T says its mini-towers will help in that kind of situation, it also acknowledges that it wants to help iPhone users who cannot get consistent signals.
 The company, which has been testing such devices in a few markets, plans to officially start selling this month what it calls ''MicroCells'' in a few places for $150. 
 Even though the calls would be offloaded to an Internet service provider, AT&T customers would be charged for the minutes of phone service in their existing wireless plans unless they pay an extra $20 a month for unlimited calling. (The call volume is not expected to clog the Internet's pipes.)
 Over the long term, basic economics favors mini-towers in homes over big towers, said Pasquale Romano, chief executive of 2Wire Inc., a company in San Jose, Calif., that is developing one of the devices. 
 He said it did not make sense for carriers to spend money building large towers in residential areas because most people are not home during the day; as it is, AT&T already plans to spend $8 billion this year on improving its wireless coverage, including on big towers, according to public filings. 
 And the mini-tower, Mr. Romano said, will pay consumers a big dividend. ''It'll make your cellphone work perfectly at home,'' he said.
 But David S. Isenberg, a telecommunications industry analyst who recently worked as a senior adviser to the Federal Communications Commission, said mini-towers were a better deal for AT&T than for its customers.
 ''It directly addresses a deficiency AT&T has gotten a black eye from with its iPhone,'' he said. But he added that the company also had a chance to lock in customers with new deals that include a mini-tower. ''It's so much more of an advantage for AT&T than it is for the customer.''
 The price for the AT&T device could fall to $49 if consumers buy a broadband or in-home calling plan, and could be free to customers who buy both. Still, marketing mini-towers has its risks for AT&T. Even though it expects the towers to improve signal quality and take pressure off its network, they could displace landline telephones because wireless consumers will not need a second phone number. And while landlines are quickly disappearing, they still bring the phone companies billions of dollars.
 David Christopher, chief marketing officer for AT&T's wireless and consumer markets, said the company initially planned to sell the devices in only a few cities, including New York and San Francisco. They are among the cities with high concentrations of iPhone users who complain that the service does not work even in homes and offices with direct line of sight to traditional cellphone towers.
 ''This has very interesting longer-term potential,'' Mr. Christopher said of the microcells. ''We have to be thoughtful that this doesn't cause more cord-cutting,'' he added. At AT&T, residential landlines have fallen about a third since 2006, to 26.4 million.
 An AT&T spokesman, Mark Siegel, said consumers frustrated by iPhone service and concerned about paying for a MicroCell were asking a fair question. But, he said, ''we are taking significant steps to improve our service.'' And a mini-tower, he added, was ''another alternative.''
 Industry analysts say mini-towers, known as femtocells, are poised for spectacular growth. Shipments should grow from 571,000 this year, to 1.9 million next year, to 40 million by 2013, according to iSuppli, a market research firm. 
 And falling prices will help propel sales. Two years ago, for example, consumers would have paid $500 or more.
 Cisco, Samsung and Netgear are among the companies that make the towers; Qualcomm and Texas Instruments, which make chips for phones, have also developed products.
 Francis Sideco, an analyst at iSuppli, said there were still bugs to be worked out before femtocells become a mass-market product like wireless routers or storage devices, which were once hard to market. 
 Wireless phone companies must make sure they do not interfere with one another; work even when consumers change their location in a house or business; and work seamlessly with the larger cell towers, so that calls can be handed from one to the other. 
 Sprint sells its mini-tower, the Airave, for $99, along with a $4.99 monthly fee that it markets as ''having your own miniature cell tower.'' Verizon introduced its ''Network Extenders'' in January 2009; the company sells them for $250 and says they are meant for residents whose homes have unusual geographic constraints that limit cellphone signals. 
 Tom Pica, a Verizon spokesman, said the product had found a niche market. 
 There also are ways to connect mobile phones to Wi-Fi hot spots, but that requires people to download software, like Skype, to route the calls to the cellular network.
 AT&T says its mini-towers will help not just the customers who own them but others using the AT&T network because there will be less traffic. AT&T says its device is the first femtocell on the market to allow users to send not just voice signals but also data over their phones.
 ''It's a great user experience, and it'll help offload data from our network,'' Mr. Christopher said.
 It could be great, customers say, but grudgingly. 
 ''They want to find a new way to make money off me, versus actually servicing me for the money I pay already,'' Ms. Zachariades said. ''They're trying to find a way to profit from their weakness.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Court Curbs F.C.C. Authority On Web Traffic

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that regulators had limited power over Web traffic under current law. The decision will allow Internet service companies to block or slow specific sites and charge video sites like YouTube to deliver their content faster to users.
 The court decision was a setback to efforts by the Federal Communications Commission to require companies to give Web users equal access to all content, even if some of that content is clogging the network. 
 The court ruling, which came after Comcast asserted that it had the right to slow its cable customers' access to a file-sharing service called BitTorrent, could prompt efforts in Congress to change the law in order to give the F.C.C. explicit authority to regulate Internet service. 
 That could prove difficult politically, however, since some conservative Republicans philosophically oppose giving the agency more power, on the grounds that Internet providers should be able to decide what services they offer and at what price. 
 More broadly, the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit could raise obstacles to the Obama administration's effort to increase Americans' access to high-speed Internet networks. 
 For example, the national broadband plan released by the administration last month proposed to shift billions of dollars in money from a fund to provide phone service in rural areas to one that helps pay for Internet access in those areas. Legal observers said the court decision suggested that the F.C.C. did not have the authority to make that switch.
 The F.C.C. will now have to reconsider its strategy for mandating ''net neutrality,'' the principle that all Internet content should be treated equally by network providers. One option would be to reclassify broadband service as a sort of basic utility subject to strict regulation, like telephone service. Telephone companies and broadband providers have already indicated that they would vigorously oppose such a move.
 The appeals court's 3-0 decision, which was written by one of the court's more liberal members, Judge David S. Tatel, focused on the narrow issue of whether the F.C.C. had authority to regulate Comcast's network management practices. 
 But it was a clear victory for those who favor limiting the F.C.C.'s regulation of the Internet, said Phil Kerpen, a vice president at Americans for Prosperity, a group that advocates limited government. ''The F.C.C. has no legal basis for imposing its dystopian regulatory vision under the net neutrality banner,'' he said.
 As a practical matter, the court ruling will not have any immediate impact on Internet users, since Comcast and other large Internet providers are not currently restricting specific types of Web content and have no plans to do so. 
 Comcast, the nation's largest cable provider, had a muted reaction to its victory. The company said it was gratified by the court's decision but added that it had changed the management policies that led it to restrict access to BitTorrent, a service used to exchange a range of large data files, from pirated movies to complex software programs. 
 ''Comcast remains committed to the F.C.C.'s existing open Internet principles, and we will continue to work constructively with this F.C.C. as it determines how best to increase broadband adoption and preserve an open and vibrant Internet,'' Comcast said in a statement.
 The company is currently seeking federal approval for its proposed acquisition of a majority stake in NBC Universal, the parent of the NBC broadcast network and a cadre of popular cable channels. Some members of Congress and consumer groups have opposed the merger, saying that it would enable Comcast to favor its own cable channels and discriminate against those owned by competitors -- something the company has said it does not intend to do.
 After the ruling on Tuesday, consumer advocates voiced similar concerns about Comcast's potential power over the Internet, saying that the company could, for example, give priority to transmission of video services of NBC channels and restrict those owned by a competitor like CBS.
 ''Internet users now have no cop on the beat,'' said Ben Scott, policy director for Free Press, a nonprofit organization that supported the F.C.C. in the case.
 Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the F.C.C., had said previously that if the agency lost the Comcast case, he would seek to find other legal authority to implement consumer protections over Internet service. In a statement, the F.C.C. said it remained ''firmly committed to promoting an open Internet.'' 
 While the court decision invalidated its current approach to that goal, the agency said, ''the court in no way disagreed with the importance of providing a free and open Internet, nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end.''
 The concept of equal access for all Internet content is one that people who favor some degree of F.C.C. regulation say is necessary not only to protect consumers but also to foster innovation and investment in technology.
 ''You can't have innovation if all the big companies get the fast lane,'' said Gigi B. Sohn, president of Public Knowledge, which advocates for consumer rights on digital issues. ''Look at Google, eBay, Yahoo -- none of those companies would have survived if 15 years ago we had a fast lane and a slow lane on the Internet.''
 The court's ruling could potentially affect content providers like Google, which owns YouTube, a popular video-sharing service. Content providers fear that Internet service companies will ask them to pay a fee to ensure delivery of material like high-definition video that takes up a lot of network capacity. 
 Google declined to comment directly on the ruling but pointed to the Open Internet Coalition, of which it is a member. The coalition's executive director, Markham Erickson, said the decision ''creates a dangerous situation, one where the health and openness of the Internet is being held hostage by the behavior of the major telco and cable providers.''
 Sam Feder, a lawyer who formerly served as general counsel for the F.C.C., said that the court's decision ''is the worst of all worlds for the F.C.C.'' He said the opinion was written narrowly enough that it was unlikely to be successfully appealed, while also raising enough possibilities of other ways that the F.C.C. could accomplish the same goals that it was unlikely to inspire Congressional action to give the agency specific regulatory authority over the Internet.
 Under the Bush administration, the F.C.C. largely deregulated Internet service. But in 2008, the final year of the administration, the agency decided to impose the net neutrality order on Comcast. Under President Obama, the F.C.C. has broadened that initiative, seeking to craft rules governing the entire industry.
 Tuesday's ruling was the latest in a string of court decisions that rebuffed efforts by the F.C.C. to expand its regulatory authority, noted Eli M. Noam, a professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University graduate business school and the director of the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information. 
 ''The F.C.C. is going to have to be more careful in how it proceeds,'' he said, suggesting that the agency would have to structure policy decisions that were more broadly acceptable to the major telecommunications industry players in order to give them some legitimacy. 
 Andrew M. Odlyzko, a professor at the University of Minnesota who has served as director of the university's Digital Technology Center, said that while some service providers might jump at the opportunity to establish toll roads for broadband, the biggest companies, including Comcast and Verizon, have said they do not intend to do so.

HEADLINE: Who's Up For Building Bridges?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I'm no expert on American politics, but I do know something about holes. And watching the way the Republican Party is reacting to the passage of health care, it seems to me the G.O.P. is violating the first rule of holes: ''When you're in one, stop digging.''
 Yes, I know, the polls show that the G.O.P. is not being hurt by its ''just-say-no'' strategy. But there is no groundswell moving its way either. Republicans will have to come up with more than ''just-say-no-to-everything-except-lower-taxes-and-more-drilling'' to field a credible 2012 presidential candidate. Here's why: 
 If you step back far enough, you could argue that George W. Bush brought the Reagan Revolution -- with its emphasis on tax cuts, deregulation and government-as-the-problem-not-the-solution -- to its logical conclusion and then some. But with a soaring deficit and a banking crisis caused by an excess of deregulation, Reaganism has met its limit. Meanwhile, President Obama's passage of health care reform has brought the New Deal-Franklin Roosevelt Revolution to its logical conclusion. There will be no more major entitlements for Americans. The bond market will make sure of that.
 In other words, both major parties have now completed their primary 20th- century missions, first laid down by their iconic standard-bearers. The real question is which party is going to build America's bridge to the 21st century -- one that will strengthen our ability to compete in the global economy, while practicing much more fiscal discipline.
 Obama is at least trying to push an agenda for pursuing the American dream in these new circumstances. I don't agree with every policy -- I'd like to see a lot more emphasis on innovation and small business start-ups -- but he's clearly trying. I do not get that impression from the Republicans, and especially those being led around by the Tea Partiers. 
 Obama-ism posits that we are now in a hypercompetitive global economy, where the country that thrives will be the one that brings together the most educated, creative and diverse work force with the best infrastructure -- bandwidth, ports, airports, high-speed rail and good governance. And we're in a world with a warming climate that is growing from 6.8 billion people to 9.2 billion by 2050, so demand for clean energy is going to go through the roof. Therefore, E.T. -- energy technology -- is going to be the next great global industry.
 So, government matters. It needs to be incentivizing businesses to build their next factory in this country -- at a time when every other nation is throwing incentives their way; it needs to be recruiting highly skilled immigrants; it needs to be setting the highest national education standards and funding basic research; it needs to be laying down the right energy regulations that will stimulate more clean-tech companies. 
 And -- something neither Democrats nor Republicans have stepped up to yet -- we will need to pay for all this by simultaneously raising some taxes, cutting others and by taking away some services to pay for needed new investments in infrastructure and education. We can't get away anymore with a G.O.P. that wants to cut taxes but never specifies which services it plans to give up, or a Democratic party that wants to add services by taxing only the rich. 
 ''Health care was the final act of the New Deal,'' argues Edward Goldberg, who teaches global business at Baruch College and is writing a book on globalization and U.S. politics. ''The 21st-century will require a mix of cutting, investing and innovation and entrepreneurialism beyond anything we have dreamed of.'' To simply say that government is not the answer, he adds, ''when we are essentially fighting four wars -- Iraq, Afghanistan, the Great Recession and the retooling of the American economy'' -- is ludicrous. Smart government needs to be the leader or silent partner in all of these projects.
 One reason the G.O.P. has failed to spawn an agenda for the 21st century is that globalization has fragmented the party. Its Wall Street/multinational corporate wing understands we need immigration, free trade, clean-tech and government support for better infrastructure and the scientific research that is the wellspring of innovation. The Tea Party wing opposes virtually all those things. All that unites the two wings is their common desire for lower taxes -- period.
 Globalization has also weakened the Democrats' blue-collar/union base, but the Democrats have absorbed a new constituency created by globalization -- what Goldberg calls the '' 'Newocracy' -- which combines the multinational corporate manager, the technology entrepreneur and engineer, and the aspirational members of the meritocracy.''
 These ''Newocrats'' previously would have leaned Republican, but now many lean toward Obama. They don't agree with everything he's proposing, but they sense that he is working on that bridge to the 21st century, while today's G.O.P./Tea Party is just not in the game. Today, we have no real opposition party with its own pathway to the 21st century. We just have opposition.

HEADLINE: Crusading Chinese Lawyer Picks Family Over Dissent

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BEIJING (AP) -- A crusading Chinese human-rights lawyer whose disappearance more than a year ago caused an international outcry said Wednesday that he was abandoning his once prominent role as a government critic in hopes of being allowed to reunite with his family.
 In his first interview since he resurfaced two weeks ago, the lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, said he did not wish to discuss his disappearance and whether he had been held and mistreated by the authorities. He appeared thinner and more subdued than the stocky, pugnacious civil rights defender of the past, though he said his health was fine. 
 Mr. Gao said the ordeal had taken a toll on him and his wife and two children, who secretly fled China early last year to escape relentless harassment by the police. He disappeared into the custody of public security personnel shortly afterward.
 ''I don't have the capacity to persevere,'' said Mr. Gao, sitting straight-backed at a tea house near his apartment in northern Beijing. ''On the one hand, it's my past experiences. It's also that these experiences greatly hurt my loved ones. This ultimate choice of mine, after a process of deep and careful thought, is to seek the goal of peace and calm.'' 
 His eyes brimmed with tears several times when he discussed his family, especially when he described seeing their shoes when he returned home for the first time on Tuesday.
 ''I completely lost control of my emotions, because to me these are the three dearest people in the world, and now, we're like a kite with a broken string,'' he said.
 Among the most dauntless of a group of human rights lawyers, Mr. Gao, 44, was a thorn in the Chinese government's side for much of the past decade. He advocated constitutional reform and took on difficult cases involving evangelical Christians and members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group. He was jailed, tortured and watched by the police until he disappeared 14 months ago. Vague statements from the government about his whereabouts drew protests by international human rights groups, the United States and British governments and the United Nations torture investigator.
 The interview seemed partly intended to dispel concerns over Mr. Gao's health and state of mind since his disappearance. He showed flashes of his previously defiant self, mixing praise for the government's building of the economy while calling for democracy.
 But his desire not to talk about the past and his often roundabout answers raised questions about the current conditions of his freedom and whether he was still under police surveillance.
 Mr. Gao said his meeting with a reporter was ''a chat''; interviews are forbidden under terms of his 2006 parole for a subversion conviction. He hinted at a compromise with the authorities, giving up his past activism in exchange for contact with his family and perhaps a reunion one day.
 ''You know that past life of mine was abnormal, and I need to give up that former life,'' he said. ''I hope I can become part of the peaceful life of the big family.'' 
 He later added: ''You know the main basis for choosing to give up is for the sake of family feelings. I hope I can reunite with them. My children need me by their side growing up.''
 Mr. Gao's sudden reappearance on March 18 added to the confusion about him. For a few days, he spoke with friends, family and the media by cellphone, saying he was at Mount Wutai, a well-known Buddhist retreat, and wanted to be left alone. That explanation was so out of character for the normally garrulous Mr. Gao that it prompted speculation from friends and supporters that he was being pressured by the authorities.
 Mr. Gao acknowledged that his seeming turnabout was sure to dishearten his backers, and he asked for their understanding. ''Everybody will be disappointed,'' he said. ''Some people were really involved, concerned, supportive, making appeals. So when they read my words they will definitely feel disappointed. To them, I apologize. I'm extremely sorry.''
 He said his experiences from his previous imprisonment and run-ins with the police -- including a time in 2007 when he recounted that security forces gave him electric shocks to his genitals and placed cigarettes in his eyes -- helped him survive the past 14 months.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Moves to Tighten Rules on Bonds Backed by Consumer Loans

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Credit rating agencies would lose their formal role in evaluating certain bonds backed by consumer loans, like home mortgages, under rules proposed on Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, the companies issuing these bonds would have to vouch for their soundness.
 The bond issuers would also be required to keep a chunk of the securities in their own portfolios so that they retain some of the bonds' risk, under the S.E.C.'s plan. 
 The proposed changes, approved in a 5-0 vote despite misgivings expressed by two commissioners, now enter a 90-day period for public comment before coming back to the commission for revision and final approval.
 The changes would ''represent a fundamental revision to the way in which the asset-backed securities market would be regulated,'' the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, said. ''I think changes are both necessary and critical components of restoring investor confidence.''
 The asset-backed securities that would be affected by the new rules are bundles of loans, like residential mortgages, student loans or automobile loans. They are converted to bonds for sale to investors, whose returns are generated from the payments on the loans. 
 Many such bonds sold in the years leading up to the financial crisis were backed by home loans made to unqualified borrowers. Regulators say the financial companies that created the bonds had little incentive to ensure that the bonds were backed by reliable loans. When large portions of the borrowers began to default on the loans, the holders of the securities had big losses. 
 The proposed rules, which would affect a large portion of new offerings in the $9.5 trillion market for securities backed by consumer loans, would in many cases require financial companies to retain 5 percent of each offering, a move that Ms. Schapiro said would ''better align'' the interests of investors and the securities firms.
 Financial reform bills winding their way through Congress contain similar requirements that financial companies ''keep skin in the game,'' as the commission put it. So does a proposal by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates some asset-backed securities originated by banks.
 Also on Wednesday, the commission proposed removing a requirement that securities offered through an expedited process, known as a shelf offering, be rated as investment grade by a credit rating agency. The move is part of the S.E.C.'s effort, it said, to ''eliminate the appearance of an imprimatur'' that a mandatory credit rating might create. 
 The changes could amount to a significant blow to the credit rating agencies, which generated large fees from rating asset-backed securities before the housing crisis all but killed the market for the bonds. The commission noted that there were 87 registered offerings in 2009, down from 1,306 in 2004. 
 Under the new rules, bond underwriters would not be required to receive a credit rating; rather, the chief executive of the bond issuer would have to certify that the assets were likely to produce the expected cash flows.
 Asked about the impact of the change, the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said it was still studying the commission's 667-page proposal. ''We will examine the proposed changes by the S.E.C. and will update the market following our review of the proposed rules,'' the company said in a statement. 
 Moody's, in a statement, said, ''We believe the market benefits when ratings agencies compete on the basis of the quality of their credit analysis, and we have long supported the removal of ratings from regulation.''
 The companies selling the bonds would also have to give the government extensive information, in a form that is easily searchable, on all of the individual loans that make up the portfolio behind the bond offering, and update it on a continuing basis. Previously, reports were required only on the overall credit quality of the pool of loans, and for some bonds, updates were suspended after about a year.
 Two commissioners expressed misgivings about the proposed rules, despite their votes to release the proposals for public comment. 
 One of them, Troy A. Paredes, said he had ''significant reservations'' about some of the proposals and cautioned that the S.E.C. must be ''mindful of the adverse impact the agency's actions could have on the real economy if the commission does not properly calibrate these reforms.''
 The other, Kathleen L. Casey, said she feared that instituting strict new disclosure requirements for securities that were already aimed at sophisticated investors could cause the agency to ''regulate to the lowest common denominator and eviscerate the market for asset-backed securities.'' 
 Ms. Casey also expressed concerns about the impact of the rules on personal privacy, asking whether ''data miners'' might be able to use the information on individual loans to determine the identification of loan holders. And she criticized the exemption of asset-backed bonds issued by government-sponsored entities, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, from the proposed requirements.
 Many of the new disclosure rules would extend not only to securities registered with the S.E.C. but also to private placements of bonds, which are sold only to large institutional investors.
 Tom Deutsch, executive director of the American Securitization Forum, a trade group, said those rules could alter the economics of private-placement transactions to the point of destroying the market.
 ''Do very large institutional investors need investor protection from other financial institutions that sell them securities?'' he asked, implying that the answer was no.

HEADLINE: Maestro's Pay Hangs on Unsigned Deal

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
As the conductor James Levine prepares to undergo lower-back surgery, his employers at the Metropolitan Opera and the Boston Symphony Orchestra are nervously hoping that he will recover and resume his extremely busy schedule.
 His situation underlines the extent to which even the largest and most august cultural institutions can depend on the drawing power of a few megastars. Mr. Levine's relationship with the Boston Symphony, in particular, also offers a window into the unusual employment arrangements at the very top of the classical music heap. 
 At the Met, where he has been conducting for four decades, Mr. Levine, 66, has a long-term contract, a Met spokesman confirmed. But in Boston, where he took over as music director in 2004, he is without a signed contract, as The Boston Globe reported on Wednesday. 
 Instead, said Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston Symphony, since Mr. Levine's original five-year contract expired, the relationship has been covered by an unsigned service agreement between the orchestra and management company that represents him. The orchestra, like the Met, has scrambled to replace Mr. Levine when successive ailments have forced him to cancel concerts, Mr. Volpe said Wednesday. 
 In Boston Mr. Levine is paid a certain amount as music director, but most of his compensation comes from performance fees as conductor, so if he misses concerts, he does not get paid as much, Mr. Volpe said. The Boston Symphony paid Mr. Levine a total of about $1.7 million for the fiscal year ending August 2008, the most recent year for which its tax returns are publicly available. (The Met paid him nearly the same amount in a similar period, but a spokesman on Wednesday declined to disclose the terms of Mr. Levine's contract.) 
 Mr. Levine's original contract with the Boston Symphony expired last year, and the current agreement covers this season and next, Mr. Volpe said. After the economy crashed in late 2008, the Boston Symphony cut the pay for some of its top talent and administrators, including Mr. Levine. A letter was sent to Mr. Levine's representative, Ronald A. Wilford, chairman of Columbia Artists Management, detailing the revised salary and payment schedule. 
 Mr. Wilford said that Mr. Levine accepted the pay cut, and that they considered the agreement with Boston -- documented in e-mail messages -- to be fully negotiated and binding. 
 ''It's a service agreement,'' Mr. Wilford said. ''If the services are not performed, you do not get paid.''
 Fans of Mr. Levine have grown accustomed to cancellations. Last fall at the Met Mr. Levine missed performances of ''Tosca'' and ''Der Rosenkavalier'' after surgery for a herniated disk. Two years ago he had a cancerous kidney cyst removed, and in 2006 he had rotator-cuff surgery. This season he was scheduled to conduct the Boston Symphony in four concerts at Carnegie Hall; he made it to one, and the orchestra found replacements for the others.
 Mr. Volpe has said that Mr. Levine's health problems have created scheduling difficulties, most urgently this summer at Tanglewood, where he is to conduct concerts and participate in events at the festival's school. Mr. Volpe said that the orchestra was making contingency plans: one if Mr. Levine is unable to appear at all; another if he can make only a few concerts; and so on.
 But Mr. Volpe said that the orchestra was still devoted to Mr. Levine, and that it would be premature to decide whether he would remain its music director.
 ''We are going to see how he does in surgery,'' Mr. Volpe said. ''And then, obviously, once we're through that, have a conversation with him and anybody else who has an interest in that, and see what's possible.''

HEADLINE: Buy a Truck, Create Cash Flow

BYLINE: By JAY GOLTZ

 BODY:
April 15 is drawing closer, and somehow it doesn't seem as scary as usual -- at least not to those of us who weren't very profitable last year. But if you're planning to make money this year, you might want to think ahead.
 As a small business recuperates, it sucks up money -- to finance new hires, training, receivables, inventory, equipment, real estate and other things that support growth. And then you have to pay taxes. It is very easy for a business to end up with no cash left in the pot on April 15 to pay those taxes. 
 Here's a simple example: A company gets its sales up to $1 million a year. It is growing at 20 percent a year, which is a good rate. It has a 5 percent profit, which is a decent margin and should leave the company with $50,000 at the end of the year (after the owner's salary). The problem is that much, if not all, of that $50,000 can disappear into inventory and receivables to support the continuing growth. And then the tax bill arrives. Not only is the $50,000 long gone, but now the owner has to scrounge for cash to pay Uncle Sam.
 There are many solutions to this problem, including slowing growth (by raising prices or cutting back on advertising, for example), borrowing money, factoring receivables and taking in investors. There is another solution that is perhaps less obvious: Don't pay the taxes. Calm down. I am not promoting tax evasion, which is bad. I am promoting tax deferral, which is good. In fact, it is being promoted by no less an authority than the United States of America.
 Just as the government created 401(k) plans to allow individuals to delay paying taxes, it also offers Section 179 of the tax code to allow businesses to delay paying taxes. Section 179 lets businesses deduct the full price of any qualified property purchases immediately (up to $250,000 a year). Without this provision, the purchases would have to be depreciated over a number of years, typically five to seven. Section 179 is not news, but I'm not sure all business owners realize how useful it can be right now -- if your company needs equipment and if it will turn a profit this year.
 To stick with my example, here is how Section 179 can create cash. Let's say the company needs a new delivery truck but the owner had been thinking of waiting until next year. It could buy the $40,000 truck in September with no money down, finance it with a 48-month loan, and write off the entire $40,000 this year. What would that mean? It would mean that the company would get the new truck it needed -- and additional cash flow of more than $9,000.
 Here's the math: The truck purchase and write-off reduces the company's profit by $40,000, which cuts the tax liability by $12,000 (with a 30 percent tax bracket). Meanwhile, the payments on the truck would be roughly $900 a month (or $2,700 over the last three months of this year). That gives you the improved cash flow this year ($12,000 - $2,700 = $9,300), and it means it will take about 14 months (14 x $900 = $12,600) for the monthly payments to equal the tax savings. Because the savings exceed the payments for 14 months, the truck purchase produces positive cash flow in 2010 and for most of 2011 (it matters that the truck was bought in September). Think about it: you could get the new truck you need -- and use the cash flow it generates to pay off your credit card debt.
 This is a win, win, win. The business owner delays tax liability and gets new equipment (it doesn't have to be a truck). The economy benefits because of all of the trucks, computers, furniture and other things that companies buy sooner rather than later, creating work and jobs for delivery people, electricians, truck salesmen, computer programmers, etc. And in the end, the government collects the same amount in taxes -- it just takes a little longer.
 Tax strategy is an important part of business. It is well worth the time to sit down with a professional business accountant to keep up with the current rules. It has been my observation that many business owners use accountants that do not specialize in business, or they try to save money by telling the accountant to just do their tax returns. Good accounting advice should pay for itself many times over.

 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Why a Business Competition Shut Down in New Orleans

BYLINE: By LORA KOLODNY

 BODY:
As it was getting started in 2008, the New Orleans nonprofit 504ward wanted to make a big splash while advancing its primary goal: to retain or draw talented young professionals and their businesses to New Orleans, a city still recovering from Hurricane Katrina.
 ''Moving to New Orleans is an adventure for people,'' explained the nonprofit's founder, Jessica White. ''It is not a standard move like going to D.C. or San Francisco. It is a wild card in that sense. The people we attract are by their nature entrepreneurial. Fifty-five percent of the 23- to 35-year-olds we surveyed here said they considered themselves somewhat to very entrepreneurial. But to keep the talent here, we need to make sure they have a great experience.'' 
 She decided to hold a business plan competition at the suggestion of another nonprofit in New Orleans, IdeaVillage, which is dedicated to accelerating innovation in the area. Within one week, 504ward developed enough partnerships, sponsorships and approvals from its main philanthropic contributor to offer a grand prize of $100,000 cash and a bevy of free business services and smaller prizes.
 Held last April, the 504ward Business Competition was a success by all measures. A video announcing the event landed on YouTube's nonprofit homepage; 504ward received 142 applications to compete; and the winners actually started their companies in New Orleans and are doing business today.
 So why did 504ward cancel its 2010 competition?
 One reason was that planning, promoting and producing a business plan competition turned out to be more work than Ms. White anticipated. She is the only full-time employee of 504ward, which is supported by volunteers, partner organizations and one main philanthropic backer, Leslie Jacobs. In 2009, Ms. White and her volunteer corps spent all of their time (and most of their funds) from September to April arranging the competition.
 That's the same reason Union College's Business Plan Competition and the KodakGallery.com-American Marketing Association Business Plan Competition were canceled in recent years. Liz Scanlon, a Kodak representative explained: ''Sponsoring and co-hosting a business competition was beneficial for us because it brought fresh insight about our own business from an audience outside the company -- including lots of good ideas around photo-sharing and the social media space -- but we have not participated recently because we are just not resourced to have someone really oversee and run it. These competitions involve a lot more than just reading a few applications.''
 Another concern for 504ward was raising sponsorship dollars amid a worsening recession. Ms. White didn't want to offer cash grants that were any lower than the previous year's prize: ''That would feel like a step back.''
 Scarcity of funding is not just a recessionary concern, said Rebeca Hwang, co-founder of YouNoodle, a company that helps schools and other organizations run competitions through a collaborative, online platform. There are more competitions now than ever, straining resources. For example, Tulane Business Plan Competition, which offers a $50,000 grand prize, is another high-stakes event in the New Orleans area.
 At a recent conference for those who teach and support entrepreneurs, the M.I.T. Global Start-Up Workshop in Reykjavik, Ms. Hwang met several attendees and panelists who reported having a harder time selling their events to sponsors, who are increasingly expecting hard data on the effectiveness of the competitions. ''Twenty years ago,'' she said, ''it didn't matter. There were so few competitions everyone would get sponsored. Now, you have to really prove the outcome of your competition, be it economic development, leadership training or education. They don't just take your word.''
 The main beneficiaries of last year's 504ward competition were the winner of its grand prize, playNOLA, and the second-prize winner, LaunchPad.
 PlayNOLA, started by Lavonzell Nicholson, brings young professionals and entrepreneurs together through activities other than drinking at bars. Among playNOLA's offerings are cook-offs, recess-inspired game days, sports leagues and sailing classes. It has more than 2,100 members, Ms. Nicholson said, ''including groups who would not normally get together.''
 Meanwhile, LaunchPad -- a k a LaunchPadNola -- which was started by Chris Schultz, offers co-working space and business classes in New Orleans. It has 43 tenants today.
 Ironically, the fact that these companies became operational actually helped persuade 504ward to drop the competition. The event had served its desired purpose -- to inspire smart, recent college graduates and young professionals ages 23 to 35 not to flee the city but to stick around and improve it. This year, instead of a competition, 504ward offered a BizCamp 2010 ''un-conference'' during New Orleans Entrepreneur Week (which is run by IdeaVillage), including an agenda set by attendees, free admission to all business students and area residents, free classes and training for aspiring and existing entrepreneurs of New Orleans, and networking sessions with investors, local employers and potential advisers.
 Ms. Hwang said success was the best reason she could imagine to cancel a competition: ''Typically the goal of a competition is to promote entrepreneurship, to capitalize an ecosystem and get parties together. If your competition did a really good job of that, you may not need it any more.''

HEADLINE: For Executives in Concrete Testing Case, a Sentencing and a Suicide Attempt

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
The sentencing of two executives of Testwell Laboratories, once the leading concrete testing company in New York, was reduced to the sentencing of one on Wednesday, after one of the defendants made his second attempt to kill himself.
 While a Manhattan judge was sentencing Testwell's vice president, Vincent Barone, to 5 years 4 months to 16 years in prison, the company's owner, V. Reddy Kancharla, lay unconscious in a hospital after trying to commit suicide on Tuesday afternoon, his lawyer said.
 ''It does not look life threatening,'' the lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said outside the courtroom. ''At this time, I'm not thinking about the case but about Reddy Kancharla and his family, for whom this has become a dark nightmare.'' 
 Mr. Kancharla, 46, and Mr. Barone, 43, were found guilty for their roles in falsifying numerous inspection and concrete mix reports at major construction projects throughout the city, including the new Yankee Stadium, the Freedom Tower and the Second Avenue subway line. The most serious conviction was on a charge of enterprise corruption, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison.
 Justice Edward J. McLaughlin of State Supreme Court allowed Mr. Barone to remain free pending appeal and rescheduled Mr. Kancharla's sentencing for April 20. Mr. Barone, who did not speak at the sentencing, was also fined $15,000.
 Mr. Kancharla first tried to kill himself in February, two days after he was convicted of some of the lesser charges in the indictment. He slit his wrists and took sleeping pills in his office in Ossining, N.Y., according to a transcript of a closed-door proceeding among the lawyers and the judge in the case. 
 Mr. Shechtman declined to give the details of the latest suicide attempt.
 Diana Florence, the assistant district attorney who tried the case, asked Justice McLaughlin for a long sentence for Mr. Barone. To support her request, she presented PowerPoint slides highlighting testimony in the case and the 119 projects in which she said Testwell had committed fraud.
 Ms. Florence said the defendants were not remorseful for their actions and were still trying to justify them. She asked Justice McLaughlin to send a message to the construction industry that ''you cannot routinely falsify vital safety tests without severe consequence.''
 ''The message needs to be sent that integrity matters, tests matter, the building code matters,'' Ms. Florence added. ''While it is true most buildings tested safe, you also know that had the concrete continued to be poured at the Freedom Tower using Testwell's recipe, it would not have supported the weight of that iconic structure, and the consequences would have been devastating.''
 Several agencies that had hired Testwell submitted letters to the judge, also seeking a tough penalty. Randy L. Levine, the president of the New York Yankees, wrote that the organization had spent $1.4 million in investigative costs just to expose Testwell's fraud.
 ''If we had not exceeded legal and engineering requirements in monitoring this construction project, the consequences to us and to the public could have been catastrophic,'' Mr. Levine wrote.
 Rose Gill Hearn, commissioner of the city's Department of Investigation, which took part in the investigation of Testwell, said the city also had spent more than $1 million to investigate and check Testwell's work.
 ''This executive's fate should stand as a stern warning that engaging in fraud against the city carries a high cost,'' Ms. Gill Hearn said in a statement. 
 Before handing down his sentence, Justice McLaughlin discussed the need for the construction industry to avoid illegal conduct.
 ''The construction industry in New York City over the decades has been rife with corruption,'' he said, adding that there was a ''willingness to cut corners for financial gain.''
 Testwell's actions, Justice McLaughlin said, put the public and construction workers at risk. And it was not as if the crimes were committed by unemployable or uneducated ''misfits,'' he said. Rather, the judge said, they were ''educated working adults for whom such conduct was wholly unnecessary.''

HEADLINE: AT&T Image Campaign Accentuates the Positive, Not Products

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THINGS are starting to look up on Madison Avenue, or so it seems, as more advertising takes on the type of upbeat tone that had been noticeably missing during this recession.
 The primary reason is ''a feeling of cautious optimism about the economy at large,'' said Bruce Lefkowitz, executive vice president for advertising sales at the Fox cable entertainment unit of the News Corporation, responsible for channels like FX.
 That belief was buttressed on Wednesday when ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, raised its forecast for growth in global ad spending this year to a 2.2 percent gain over 2009, compared with an increase of 0.9 percent that the agency had predicted in December. 
 An example of the mood shift is a major corporate brand image campaign to be introduced on Thursday by AT&T, which is one of the five largest American advertisers, according to data from the Kantar Media unit of WPP. The campaign, by the Atlanta and New York offices of BBDO North America -- part of the BBDO Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group -- carries the sunny theme ''Rethink possible.''
 The spirit of the campaign is ''so much in keeping with what an innovative company like AT&T embodies,'' said Esther Lee, senior vice president for brand marketing and advertising at AT&T in Dallas, ''regardless of the economy.'' Ms. Lee offered a preview of the campaign in an interview on Tuesday. 
 David Lubars, chairman and chief creative officer for BBDO North America, said he agreed that ''we are moving out of the gloom'' and described AT&T as ''a forward-thinking, optimistic company.''
 The elements of the cheerful campaign -- which include television commercials, print and online ads, social media like Facebook, signs in stores and messages aimed at employees -- build upon commercials that AT&T ran during the Winter Olympics. Those spots saluted athletic achievement -- and, by extension, anyone who strives to be the best -- with the theme ''Here's to possibilities.''
 The campaign is the first meant to burnish the AT&T brand image, rather than sell specific products and services, since a $1 billion campaign in 2006 that carried the theme ''Your world. Delivered.'' The purpose of that campaign was to tell consumers about the formation of the new AT&T after the original ''Ma Bell,'' the AT&T Corporation, was acquired by SBC Communications, which then renamed itself AT&T. 
 Since then, AT&T has been transformed by the growth of businesses like mobile communications -- embodied by the AppleiPhone -- and data services, which now account for about 70 percent of annual revenue. 
 AT&T has not tried lately ''to define the totality of who we are,'' Ms. Lee said, adding that research among consumers found that ''people understood we had evolved, but there wasn't enough acknowledgment of us being an innovative company.''
 Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys in New York, a research company that studies consumer and brand loyalty, said a campaign to burnish the AT&T brand ''makes a lot of sense'' as the company battles rivals in the intensely competitive telecommunications category because it can counter the negative effects of ads that use low prices to peddle products and services.
 ''Selling on price is a pathway to commoditization,'' Mr. Passikoff said, which can devalue a brand image. ''The only way to get out of that is to have the brand stand for something meaningful to consumers,'' he added, like innovation or heritage.
 A TV commercial that will help introduce the campaign uses a device of whimsical children's drawings materializing in the real world to show what can be achieved by defying expectations. ''Remember when you were 5,'' an announcer asks, ''and anything was possible?''
 The commercial uses the song ''Pure Imagination'' from the 1971 movie ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,'' as performed by the original Wonka, Gene Wilder. In a manifestation of the rethinking being done by AT&T, the campaign plays down the letters ''AT&T'' and plays up the company's globe logo. 
 Most times, the globe will be seen without the letters in a change that is meant as ''a leadership move,'' said Craig Stout, senior creative director at Interbrand in New York, an Omnicom agency that is leading the brand design aspects of the campaign.
 Recognition of the logo as the symbol of AT&T is ''in the high 90 percentage'' among consumers, Mr. Stout said, and displaying it without the ''AT&T'' echoes the way Nike is recognized by its swoosh and Target by its target. The globe will frequently be displayed in different colors and styles. 
 As the campaign is rolled out, most AT&T product and service ads will be phased out -- including those for AT&T's wireless operations featuring the actor Luke Wilson. That will please the many critics of those ads, like a writer for TV.comwhose recent article carried the headline ''AT&T, Luke Wilson Please Break Up.'' 
 The Wilson ads, also by BBDO, were produced to answer a caustic campaign for Verizon Wireless that pokes fun at the shortcomings of the AT&T network. A commercial in the new AT&T campaign makes a point made by the Wilson ads -- with AT&T, you can talk and browse the Web at the same time -- but in an upbeat manner, without attacking Verizon.
 The iPhone ''has put some pressure on our network,'' Ms. Lee said, ''but that's what happens when you live on the tip of the spear.''
 AT&T executives ''were fully expecting'' the issue to be brought up by consumers who were shown the new campaign before its debut, she added, but there was ''not one negative.''
 ''I expect there will be some commentary'' once the campaign begins running, Ms. Lee said, but she and Mr. Lubars expressed confidence that, as he put it, ''in the end the water will find the right level.''
 Mr. Lubars and Ms. Lee declined to discuss the AT&T ad budget other than to say it would be increased. AT&T spent $1.9 billion on advertising last year, Kantar Media reported, while Verizon Communications spent $2.2 billion.

HEADLINE: A Call for the Fed to Raise Rates Unsettles Investors

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street investors were rattled on Wednesday by the prospect of higher interest rates and new signs that consumers were reluctant to spend again.
 A downward trend intensified after a Federal Reserve official raised the possibility of higher interest rates. In addition, a report showed that consumer borrowing fell more steeply than predicted.
 Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Fed's Kansas City bank, said policy makers should consider lifting rates to 1 percent to ward off inflation. Mr. Hoenig's view is not embraced by many other Fed policy makers, but his call to raise rates from record lows was the most explicit to date. 
 On Tuesday, the Fed released minutes indicating that it had no plans to raise interest rates soon because inflation has remained subdued. But some investors remain nervous about the prospect for inflation, even as low rates have helped stimulate lending.
 ''The concerns about inflation are going to be an increasing concern within the investing public,'' said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist for Key Private Bank.
 The market shuddered when a Fed report showed that consumer borrowing declined by $11.5 billion in February. The report reflected a drop in outstanding credit card debt, which economists had expected to rise modestly. They explained the discrepancy by pointing to unusually stormy weather in February, which may have kept consumers out of stores.
 ''It was a shock,'' said Craig F. Thomas, senior economist for the PNC Financial Services Group. ''But we are still seeing evidence that consumers are a bit more optimistic and spending more freely.'' Recent retail spending reports showed a modest improvement in spending on food, clothing and other consumer goods; the consumer borrowing report measures revolving and nonrevolving loans, such as credit card activity and auto loans. 
 Mr. Thomas said attitudes about spending may also be shifting. With the unemployment rate at 9.7 percent, many Americans are nervously hoarding cash, and debit cards have become more popular, he said.
 ''Households have worked diligently in working down their debt burdens,'' Mr. Thomas said. ''One wonders whether they're shy about increasing credit balances.'' 
 Adding to the unease on Wall Street, the prognosis for Greece, which is struggling to finance looming debt payments, remained cloudy. Yields on 10-year Greek bonds continued to hover above 7 percent on Wednesday.
 On Tuesday, reports emerged that the country was seeking to bypass the International Monetary Fund and obtain relief directly from its European neighbors. Greek officials denied that speculation, but that only underscored a sense that no firm rescue package had been decided.
 ''The whole credit issue is going to be a lingering concern,'' Mr. McCain said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 72.47 points, or 0.66 percent, to 10,897.52. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.99 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,182.45, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 5.65 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,431.16. 
 A downturn in the energy sector weighed on the major indexes as oil fell nearly 1 percent, to $85.88 a barrel. Shares of Chevron fell 51 cents, to $77.37. Exxon Mobil dropped 56 cents, to $67.34, and Schlumberger declined 75 cents, to $66.04.
 European exchanges were lower, too. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.32 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt declined 0.48 percent.
 The euro continued to slide, hovering at $1.3373 against the dollar, amid worries that swelling debt burdens could undermine Europe's monetary union. Interest rates were lower.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 25/32, to 98 4/32, and the yield fell to 3.90 percent from 3.95 percent late Tuesday.

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
The new start at General Motors isn't as fresh as it looks. Last year's quick-rinse bankruptcy washed away almost $90 billion of debt and other obligations. But there are still wrenches in the Detroit automaker's gears that its Chapter 11 restructuring was supposed to remove more cleanly.
In the six months after emerging from bankruptcy last July and after stripping out a couple of big one-time items, G.M. almost eked out a profit before interest and taxes. As the economy improves, G.M. should have a good shot at climbing into the black before 2010 ends. 
 But costs remain high, just shy of the $63 billion the old G.M. spent in the admittedly slower first half of 2009. And the manufacturer's factories produced at just 61 percent of capacity in the fourth quarter. That's encouraging in a way, because it means G.M. has room to grow as car sales pick up. But a rough-and-ready calculation suggests that for the rate to reach 100 percent, annual United States car sales would have to hit 18 million, more than at the height of the boom. In other words, G.M. still has fat to trim.
 G.M. also still has pension problems. Retiree funds are currently short by about $27.5 billion, three-fifths of which is in the United States. G.M. already reckons it will contribute $43 billion to its United States pensions over the next five years. That could rise if the plans remain underfunded.
 The company is also still on the hook for $9.5 billion of nonpension costs, including life insurance and health care for retirees younger than 65. What's more, the U.A.W. is suing G.M. for $450 million the union says it is still owed under a settlement that helped get Delphi, G.M.'s parts supplier and former subsidiary, out of bankruptcy last year.
 These obligations are, at least, nowhere near as overwhelming as prebankruptcy ones. But prospective investors in a share sale -- and taxpayers hoping to recoup some of their $50 billion in aid -- would do well to remember that the retooled G.M. still has a way to go before it completely shakes off its past.
 A New W.P.A.?
 The Works Progress Administration was established 75 years ago on April 8, 1935. The job-creation program left many happy memories among fans of big government, as well as some physical reminders of its accomplishments, including post office murals and 650,000 miles of roads. Over the last year, long-term unemployment in the United States has doubled, to 6.5 million people. Is it time for W.P.A. II?
 The first W.P.A. absorbed 2.1 percent of the nation's G.D.P. from 1935 to 1941. The money went to pay workers who had been unemployed for years to work on a variety of projects. Nearly half was spent on infrastructure of long-term value, including unglamorous sewers as well as Connecticut's elegant Merritt Parkway.
 The program scratched more or less where the United States itched. Not only was the unemployment rate 20 percent, much higher than today, but the federal government could borrow responsibly. The deficit during the W.P.A.'s life averaged 3.2 percent of gross domestic product, hardly alarming by current standards. Besides, bank failures meant that private investment financing was scarce.
 But the W.P.A. had serious flaws. It was too attractive as an alternative to the private sector because it paid comparable hourly wages for a short workweek. Along with unionization, the W.P.A. helped keep average wages above the minimum level that would have created jobs. So it may in some ways have exacerbated unemployment. Even so, the United States could now benefit from a program that spent $150 billion to $200 billion annually on genuinely useful public works and that employed and trained the long-term unemployed. But the government is in much worse shape now. So every dollar that goes into a new W.P.A. would have to come from other federal spending.
 Also, W.P.A. II would need to be less generous so as not to be the employer of first resort. It would have to pay less than comparable private sector work for more hours on the job. That would help get workers off the government payroll, and make W.P.A. II the stuff of memories as soon as possible.

HEADLINE: Corporate America Still Has Its Allure

BYLINE: By BARBARA TAYLOR

 BODY:
Out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, I got a call from a headhunter on my mobile phone. I happened to be walking across a parking lot at the time. I glanced over my shoulder -- like a refugee in the witness-protection program -- and wondered, ''How did they find me?''
 The truth is, my professional background includes more than one successful stint in corporate America. I am a loyal, hard-working, high-achiever type who plays well with others. I'm the kind of employee who is continually awarded both recognition and additional responsibilities. My M.B.A. usually counts for something, as do a list of references who are willing to sing my praises. My husband admits that he hated working with me when we were in wireless telecommunications together. He claims I was the quintessential teacher's pet. I'm not a corporate wonk, but I can play that role when I have to. 
 The headhunter -- I'll call him Deep Pockets -- cited my previous experience as a sales analyst with a Wal-Mart supplier and told me he was looking to fill an account manager position at a large company. He asked if I'd be interested.
 I receive phone calls like this on occasion, although the longer my absence from corporate America, the less frequently they come. Whenever I get them I automatically go into my spiel about owning my own business. But this time I hesitated.
 I don't think it was perceptible to Mr. Pockets, but it shook me to the core. I lost my rhythm and found myself floundering through my spiel and then agreeing that there might be a possibility of meeting for coffee sometime. When I got off the phone I was horrified. What had just happened?
 After several weeks of introspection, here's my take: I think the Great Recession, which I've been keeping at bay, finally got under my skin. It has diminished, however slightly, my usual bravado and left me wondering just how safe it is to be a small-business owner right now. One of the most insidious enemies in the business world is uncertainty, and there seems to be a lot of it going around these days.
 It's easy to thumb your nose at big companies when things are going well. But Mr. Pockets made me stop and think in a way I haven't in several years. Most of us are happy just to be in business right now. But is that good enough? Is it foolish -- or even irresponsible -- to turn down the prospect of a good job with benefits in today's economy?
 It's one thing to proclaim stoically that the market punishes the weak. It's another to watch a war of attrition take place before your eyes. In the past 18 months I've watched three of my closest competitors fall. One closed up shop and took a chief financial officer position, one vacated his office and appears to be working out of his home, and -- rumor has it -- another had to get a personal loan from a friend to keep the doors open. Now is certainly a tempting time to duck and run for cover in a cubicle.
 I have no safety net, other than the fact that we live below our means and maintain an outsize rainy day fund. I have no inherited wealth, no friends or family members with money to lend (that I'm aware of).
 What I do have is faith. Faith in the path that my husband and I have chosen, faith in our abilities and our business, faith in the future of our industry, faith that this economy -- like every other down economy I've lived through -- will turn the corner, and those of us who have survived will be well positioned for the future.
 So, I was tempted to have coffee with Mr. Pockets. Even in a good economy, being a small-business owner can be a tough gig. It can be a thankless, lonely existence where being successful can get you hated as much as it can get you liked. The hours are terrible; the stress is constant. Why not go skulking back to corporate America? Because for all its warts and troubles, this is what I do. And the majority of the time, I love it.
 For me, the most unsettling effect of the Great Recession has been that moment my voice faltered on the phone. Most people would probably forgive me for entertaining, if for only a split second, the thought of a cushy job at a big company. I just don't know how long it will be before I forgive myself.
 Are you ever tempted to go back to the cubicle? How are you keeping the faith?

HEADLINE: The Work Interns Do, and the Pay They Don't Get

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Unpaid Intern, Legal or Not'' (Business Day, April 3):
 Having completed a nauseating number of unpaid, largely menial internships over the course of my education, I am amazed to learn that it is illegal for a host organization to receive ''immediate advantage'' from an intern's labor. I knew that stuffing those envelopes was exploitation, but I had no idea the law was on my side! 
 Unpaid work that benefits a company is called volunteering -- a fine practice, but one that should be distinct from interning. A good rule of thumb: Would you do this job for free if you couldn't put it on your resume? If not, then you aren't learning enough and you should be paid.
 A company that refuses to pay its interns is a company that's likely to need the free labor for uninstructive secretarial work. It may be counterintuitive, but the truly educational internships often come with a paycheck.
 Elizabeth Weinbloom Somerville, Mass., April 3, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your article brings to light a set of rules that are in desperate need of revamping: federal legal criteria governing internship compensation. While I believe that internships should be paid, internships are valuable whether paid or not. A set of pragmatic standards should be in place in the event of unpaid opportunities -- namely, laws that will help employers do the right thing and ensure that interns have meaningful professional experiences.
 Current law sets a high bar, requiring that employers meet six requirements to classify interns as unpaid employees. Few do. Requiring academic credit in lieu of compensation, for example, in general meets only one of the guidelines, but in many cases students work for free and must also pay full tuition fees for these credits. We have to fix this.
 As for the notion that the employer does not receive any benefit from the work of the intern, if interns are gaining substantial experience, their work is likely adding value.

 To the Editor:
 I have had five unpaid internships and am still unemployed (class of 2009). During my experience, I always referred to myself as a ''slave'' and wondered how it was legal for me to complete tasks that should be paid.
 Whenever I finished ''work'' at my unpaid internship, I felt used and dirty. My worst unpaid experience occurred at my internship with a record label. I put stickers on thousands of CDs, which made me feel like a machine as my brain began to numb.
 I have been told that if you are unemployed, you need an (unpaid) internship to show that you are doing something related to what you would ultimately like to be doing. On the other hand, if you need money, you will need to take a minimum-wage job, which will not look good on your resume.
 I understand that everyone is hurting from the economy, but costs should be cut elsewhere instead of using students and graduates for free labor.

HEADLINE: For Designer Bargains, Step Into Their Closet

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
ON a recent foray for new spring clothes -- a sundress, slouchy pants, a nautical-inspired top or two -- I was determined not to break the bank. 
 But I was also determined not to kill an afternoon trying to unearth something special from the jammed and chaotic racks of big-box discount chains like Filene's Basement and Century 21. 
 The solution? A 40-minute train ride from Penn Station to Mineola, N.Y., where tucked alongside the tracks like a greasy-spoon diner is an under-the-radar shop called Fox's. Devotees, myself included, typically learned of the small chain through friends and family who live in the area. For more than 20 years, locals in the know have been flocking there to snap up designer clothing at prices often better than those of popular discount fashion Web sites. 
 Take the Pucci ballet flats that cost $295 on the Italian fashion emporium Yoox.com. They were $139 at Fox's last week. 
 Or consider the Alice & Olivia knickers that are typically $275. The Fox's price tag was $89. 
 And those JPK Paris crossbody handbags that cost upward of $150 at the likes of Nordstrom? They were $69 at Fox's. 
 That Fox's is modest in size and is frequented by regulars makes it feel more like an old-fashioned dress shop than a discount warehouse.
 Another reason for that are the experienced sales staff members -- they are friendly yet not overly solicitous. 
 What truly sets the chain apart for me, though, is that it does not simply stock excess merchandise from manufacturers. Fox's buyers travel to Europe and hand-pick fashions for the stores. Many of those labels are not carried anywhere else in the United States, with the occasional exception of a few boutiques here and there. So over time, you can amass an unusual (and relatively affordable) wardrobe with pieces from places like Israel and France. Shipments arrive daily. 
 But you need not travel to Long Island to shop there. Fox's has 14 stores, 9 of them nearby, in Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey, Connecticut and Westchester. (Details are at Foxs.com.) I kicked off my spring shopping at the Mineola outpost at 80 Main Street, a short walk from a train stop reached most easily by the Port Jefferson line. 
 At Mineola, the merchandise is divided between a women's clothing shop and, across the street, a boutique with handbags, jewelry and shoes. This is the chain's flagship and one of its more mellow stores; I've heard the Brooklyn shop is bustling. 
 The clothes at discount chains are not always seasonal or trendy, yet Fox's is usually attuned to fashion's mood swings. Indeed, the staff said the clothes and accessories are always current. In the winter you'll find furs, not swimsuits.
 A pervasive trend, ballet flats, were offered in enough colors to fill a Crayola box. There was a $29 silver pair from DKNY, and $39 bejeweled styles by Redfoot that fold up to fit in your purse in the event you want to change out of high heels on a dance floor. (The ''Sex and the City'' shop at HBO.com is selling the shoes for $64.99.) 
 There were also those ubiquitous open-toe booties. A pair by Candela, a brand sold at Saks Fifth Avenue, were $69 at Fox's. Sweet peep-toe pumps, by Rock & Republic, were $98.
 Affordable and eye-catching accouterments, like sequined wallets from India ($19) and chunky glass-and-metal necklaces ($24), dapple the space. Aqua bags -- on the pages of nearly every fashion magazine -- were plentiful. A turquoise Whiting & Davis mesh and Lucite clutch was $79; the same bag on Buy.com is $200. 
 Willpower and a paucity of size 38 Pucci flats enabled me to exit the accessories shop with my money still in my pocketbook. 
 That lasted until I walked across the street into the clothing store. 
 Fox's strength is not necessarily its offering of everyday basics but rather its rotating selection of European fashions, and brands like Tahari, Calvin Klein, Free People and Michael Kors. (A note to the label-conscious: sometimes the tags are cut out of the clothes, a tactic employed by luxury brands to preserve their prestige. But consider it a fashion I.Q. test. In some instances I have been able to identify the brand based on the cut, the distinctive remnants of the label or my having spotted the same item in a department store.) 
 I entered the fitting room with a few items from my list and many more that simply caught my eye, including a $79 Isaac Mizrahi dress for QVC that the television shopping network is selling for $131. (I have a weakness for voluminous tulle skirts; however, this one was so frothy it transformed its wearer into Thumbelina.) 
 Fox's does not limit the number of items allowed in the dressing room, and while that's a plus, it appears such generosity comes at a cost. The stalls are without curtains. In the end, I bought black men's wear-inspired pants and a periwinkle striped sundress with red accents, both unfamiliar Parisian labels. 
 Fox's accepts only cash, checks and debit cards, which in another economy might be an annoyance. In this one, though, it's a way to stay frugal. And note the three-day return policy. If you need more time because, say, you live a $13.50 round-trip train ride away, ask and a staff member will give you a week or so by making a note on your receipt. 
 I have yet to return anything. Sometimes, it's good to think outside the big box.

HEADLINE: Eliot Spitzer's Long, Winding and Slightly Bewildering Road to Redemption

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
HERE is Eliot Spitzer on MSNBC with the host Ed Schultz, railing against fallen Wall Street titans who regain power (''absolutely insane''). There he is on Fox's ''Good Day New York,'' taking swipes at Andrew Cuomo (''he has to answer the hard questions'') and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (''I don't like politicians who vacillate''). He's lunching regularly at power restaurants like Michael's (telling the waiter, ''Silda wants me to have the salad''), holding hands with his wife at charity galas, attending a private salon at Tina Brown's. Writing his twice-monthly Slate column, ''The Best Policy.'' Teaching undergraduates at the City College of New York, lecturing at Harvard about ethics, parsing the meaning of love on BigThink.com.
 It's been scarcely two years since Mr. Spitzer, his ashen-faced wife at his side, seemed to have written his political obituary, with his taut-jawed, almost lipless grimace of resignation as governor of New York, following disclosures that he was a client in a prostitution ring. Now he is emphatically back, seemingly everywhere. 
 For public figures whose falls have been as spectacular as that of Mr. Spitzer's, there are many time-tested paths to image rehab. Seclusion. Prison. Good works. The seminary. 
 None of those options, it seems, are for Eliot Spitzer.
 ''Most people faced with that kind of disgrace would disappear off the face of the earth for a longer period of time,'' said Howard Rubenstein, the public relations impresario. ''But there is a lot of curiosity about him. And he is a publicity steamroller'' -- a reference to Mr. Spitzer's expletive-garnished self-description as a ''steamroller.'' ''In time people will remember his strengths and his intelligence,'' Mr. Rubenstein said, ''and what he's showing now: determination.''
 During an interview this week in the Fifth Avenue offices of Spitzer Engineering, his father's real estate business, Mr. Spitzer, 50, relaxed and ruddy from a family ski vacation in Utah, made it clear he was following a different path. ''The only thing I can try to do is contribute in a small way and not in a way that is designed to get forgiveness,'' he said. ''That would be too transactional: 'I'm doing X, now you will forgive me.' I don't think it can or should work that way.'' 
 He made no apology for his pervasiveness as a pundit, first joking: ''Public speaking? I speak to myself on the street!'' Then he grew earnest. ''You can view it as pure selfishness and hedonism,'' he said. ''But I care about this stuff. Obviously it's more rewarding to participate when you can do something about it -- which is why I loved and sorely miss the jobs I had.'' He glanced over at Lisa Linden, a public relations consultant for Spitzer Engineering, whom he asked to be present.
 After his resignation, Mr. Spitzer had a self-imposed exile that lasted about 8 1/2 months. On Nov. 16, 2008, 10 days after federal prosecutors declined to press charges, Mr. Spitzer had an opinion article on financial regulation published in The Washington Post. Two weeks later, at the behest of Cliff Sloan, Slate's former publisher and a friend from Harvard Law School, he started his online column.
 ''I keep pressing the button on the Slate column,'' Mr. Spitzer said, laughing, ''so it looks like I'm getting a lot of hits.''
 As the first anniversary of his resignation on March 12, 2008, approached, Mr. Spitzer expanded his audience: Fareed Zakaria on CNN, ''Today,'' the cover of Newsweek. 
 ''Eliot is like the smartest kid in the room with his hand up, but the teacher's not calling on him,'' said his former political advertising aide, Jimmy Siegel. ''He believes he has the answers to things, economically, and he would love to be in a position to do something about it.''
 By last fall, he was teaching at City College. He said his students told him they didn't watch mainstream news media, so he agreed to appear on ''Real Time With Bill Maher'' on HBO.
 ''I always thought he'd be a good guest as the Sheriff of Wall Street because of the financial meltdown,'' said Mr. Maher, referring to Mr. Spitzer's nickname. ''I'd seen him on shows with the de rigueur 'Let's beat up on this guy before we get to what matters.' I wanted to be the first one to have him on a program and not bring up the scandal.'' 
 Indeed Mr. Maher did not; by the time Mr. Spitzer was a guest again in February, his onscreen identifier read, ''Eliot Spitzer, columnist, Slate.com.''
 Mr. Spitzer said he doesn't court appearances. ''This was a process over time of my accepting invitations from people that seemed would be fun.''
 While some muscular forays -- like his exchanges with Mr. Zakaria about the absence of Wall Street transparency -- may remind viewers of Mr. Spitzer's finer moments in government, others recall his tendency to be tone deaf. 
 In February, he faced off with Stephen Colbert on ''The Colbert Report.'' After Mr. Colbert recited what he said were the missteps of Ben Bernanke, he asked Mr. Spitzer if he was surprised that Mr. Bernanke had been reappointed chairman of the Federal Reserve, adding, ''Does this give you hope for being re-elected governor of New York?'' -- laughter and applause from audience -- ''Because, may I remind you, he screwed everybody.''
 Mr. Spitzer, laughing, answered, ''I just became a big fan of Ben Bernanke.'' 
 ELIOT SPITZER'S swift return to the bully pulpit may say as much about us -- a scandal-fatigued public's diminishing expectations of its officials -- as it does about Mr. Spitzer's restless inability to stay gone. And though he professes not to have a specific strategy of image rehabilitation in mind, whatever he is doing may be working.
 In June, a poll by The New York Times, Cornell University and New York 1 News found that 26 percent of New Yorkers had a favorable view of Mr. Spitzer; only 21 percent held favorable views of his successor, Gov. David A. Paterson.
 On ''Hardball,'' the Chris Matthews MSNBC program, Mr. Spitzer's possible political return inspired a lively debate in February. And Mr. Rubenstein said that at a recent dinner party of 20 prominent New Yorkers, Mr. Spitzer's past, present and future were closely analyzed. ''Some thought he is making a play to come into elected office,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''That didn't get a lot of support. But they thought, 'He's having an influence on policy, so let's look past that episode in his life and appoint him as an adviser to something.' That was the consensus.''
 But Mr. Spitzer resigned, he said, in part to repair his family. ''I've got a family that is intact and happy, and three kids who are spectacular, whom I had not seen enough of in years when I was A.G. and governor,'' he said. ''Is life as exciting? No,'' said Mr. Spitzer, digressing about whether to introduce bees or sheep on his upstate property. ''But I gained an awful lot that is more powerful and important.''
 That said, his youngest will be a high school senior in 2012. An empty nest looms. A return then to politics? ''Why does it have to be politics?'' he said. ''Is there a dynamism to that world and a theoretical capacity to do things that draws many talented people? Absolutely. Are there other ways to be involved and lead an interesting life? Of course.''
 But each time he speaks out, doesn't he expose his family to more churning ofhis misdeeds? ''I don't do things they don't want me to do,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''I also think you face up to your errors, deal with them and go forward.''
 The scandal shadows him still. Not only on ''The Good Wife,'' CBS's show based loosely on the imbroglio, but in The New York Post, where Ashley Dupre, the prostitute he was linked to, is a sex columnist. 
 And more is coming: the just-published ''The Journal of the Plague Year,'' by his former adviser, Lloyd Constantine, and later this month, ''Rough Justice: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,'' by Peter Elkind, an editor at large at Fortune, who was editor of the campus paper at Princeton when Mr. Spitzer was head of the student government. ''That is part of what I have to deal with,'' Mr. Spitzer said stiffly, ''and staying under a rock won't change that.''
 While Mr. Spitzer maintained that he had no role model for comebacks, there are plenty of political Lazaruses. President Nixon. Senator Ted Kennedy, after Chappaquiddick. Representative Barney Frank, whose former roommate ran a male prostitution ring. Bill Clinton, whose name is rarely synonymous these days with a blue dress.
 ''You can be rehabilitated and make a comeback and get away with really bad behavior,'' said Doug Muzzio, a professor of public affairs at Baruch College. ''It depends on your base.'' (Though many political consultants concur that ''comeback'' and ''John Edwards'' will never appear in the same sentence.)
 What remains of Mr. Spitzer's base remains unclear. But as lurid memories of black socks fade, Mr. Spitzer may be the beneficiary of a perfect storm: the populist rage at Wall Street, the troubled administration of Mr. Paterson, and other recent sex scandals.
 ''There's a dumbing down of our expectations,'' said Mr. Muzzio. ''When you've got Mark Sanford and Rod Blagojevich, and other criminals in state houses, what Spitzer did doesn't look as bad. Given the barrenness of the terrain, he may stand a little taller.''
 Jeff Greenfield, the CBS political analyst, who is to interview Mr. Spitzer at the 92nd Street Y on May 2, distinguishes the former governor's scandal from the more recent ones, like those of Mr. Edwards. Mr. Spitzer, he said, took swift responsibility and did penance. 
 ''This was legitimately a private failure,'' Mr. Greenfield said. ''A serious one, that made him no longer able to be governor. If he were trying to talk about moral rearmament, it would be appropriate to say, 'Hold it.' But he is talking about how to prevent another financial meltdown, and he's in a pretty interesting position to talk about that.''
 And Mr. Spitzer may benefit from the fact that other celebrities who behaved badly and have apologized have resumed their lives on an expedited track. Tiger Woods is returning to golf after five months. David Letterman kept showing up for work. 
 Lloyd Constantine, with whom Mr. Spitzer is no longer on speaking terms, said he was distressed but not surprised by the ex-governor's early return to the megaphone. Mr. Spitzer, he said, needed to give a better accounting for his brief gubernatorial tenure. 
 ''Those 14 months were awful,'' Mr. Constantine said. ''The state was in bad shape when he took office, it was worse when he left and it's continued to decline ever since.''
 In the interview, Mr. Spitzer refused to speak about Mr. Constantine. But almost instinctively, he produced an old-fashioned stump speech, ticking off his accomplishments as governor: education, Medicaid, the environment. He wrought his achievements, he said, by thinking outside of the box, by ignoring conventional wisdom that said, ''You can't do that.''
 Referring to his personal downfall, this reporter asked: ''Wasn't there a voice inside you that said, 'You can't do that?' ''
 ''Sure there was,'' Mr. Spitzer replied.
 ''But you didn't listen?''
 Mr. Spitzer answered, ''That's a separate issue.''
 The room fell silent, thick with promises both broken and unfulfilled.
 At last, Mr. Spitzer spoke. ''Kind of pathetic,'' he said quietly. His face reddened. ''Take out 'pathetic,' '' he said. '' 'It's a shame.' ''

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Nation Must Take Action Soon To Shape Fiscal Future

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Wednesday that an aging American population posed fiscal challenges for the United States. 
 In a rare foray into the realm of fiscal policy, Mr. Bernanke said the United States ''must begin now to prepare for this coming demographic transition.''
 Mr. Bernanke, speaking before the Dallas Regional Chamber, said that the economy was still fragile, and he made it clear that he did not expect the federal government to raise taxes or cut spending anytime soon. But he spoke about the budget pressures posed by Social Security and Medicare with greater urgency than he has in the past. 
 ''The arithmetic is, unfortunately, quite clear,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above. These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put them off -- until the day they cannot be put off any more.''
 He said a ''sharp near-term reduction in our fiscal deficit is probably neither practical nor advisable,'' but that a long-term plan for fiscal sustainability could help to lower interest rates and borrowing costs, and even stimulate economic growth. 
 Mr. Bernanke's comments on the nation's budget problems could lead to political confrontations. Raising taxes is anathema to Republicans while slashing entitlement programs is strongly opposed by Democrats. Still, Mr. Bernanke's comments could add urgency to the work of the bipartisan fiscal commission named by President Obama. 
 Mr. Bernanke also used his speech to review the Fed's conduct during the economic crisis. He voiced support for regulatory changes being debated in Congress that would seek to prevent any company from being seen as too big to fail. 
 ''To end 'too big to fail,' the new regime should permit regulators to close a failing firm and impose losses on shareholders and creditors,'' he said. 
 ''Indeed, I would argue that no financial instrument counted as regulatory capital should be allowed to receive any protection from losses.''
 Mr. Bernanke has hinted that long-term unemployment has become one of his major worries as the economic recovery slowly moves forward. 
 Noting that more than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or longer, nearly double the share of a year ago, he said: ''I am particularly concerned about that statistic, because long spells of unemployment erode skills and lower the longer-term income and employment prospects of these workers.''
 In a separate speech earlier in the day, a member of the Federal Reserve's policy-making board challenged the notion that financial markets were self-correcting, saying that asset bubbles existed and that central banks could do more to prevent them.
 William C. Dudley, president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called on policy makers to more aggressively speak out against prevailing wisdom when asset prices fluctuated wildly.
 ''The costs of waiting to respond to an asset bubble until after it has burst can be very high,'' Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks to the Economic Club of New York. ''A proactive approach is appropriate.''
 In recent months, the Fed has faced intense criticism for failing to prevent the recent bubble in home prices that brought the economy to its knees. 
 Though Mr. Dudley acknowledged the difficulty in identifying bubbles, he said ''uncertainty is not grounds for inaction.'' He called for combining the power of the bully pulpit with other tools, like limiting loan-to-value ratios and debt loads. 
 Mr. Dudley's remarks contrasted sharply with those of Alan Greenspan, a former Federal Reserve chairman. Testifying before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Greenspan defended the Fed against complaints that it had not done enough to prevent the subprime mortgage crisis. 
 Mr. Greenspan seemed to reject the idea that central banks could use the power of their words to ward off bubbles. Instead, he said central banks should rely on tools like requiring banks to hold more capital and demanding traders hold more collateral.
 A third Fed official, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, raised the specter of higher interest rates on Wednesday. Mr. Hoenig has repeatedly expressed concern that extraordinarily low interest rates may spur inflation.
 Mr. Hoenig said in a speech in Santa Fe, N.M., that the Fed should consider lifting the benchmark federal funds rate to 1 percent, from near zero, which he called a ''highly accommodative policy.''
 ''I am confident that holding rates down at artificially low levels over extended periods encourages bubbles, because it encourages debt over equity and consumption over savings,'' Mr. Hoenig said.

HEADLINE: Debt Report Shows Drop In Borrowing In February

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer borrowing fell again in February, reflecting weakness in credit cards and auto loans. The news set back hopes that consumers were beginning to feel more confident and would start spending more. 
 The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that borrowing declined by $11.5 billion in February, surprisingly weaker than the small $500 million gain that economists had expected.
 The decline was the 12th in the last 13 months as consumers cut back sharply on borrowing in the face of a deep economic recession and continued high unemployment.
 In January, borrowing rose by $10.6 billion, ending a record 11 consecutive monthly declines.
 In percentage terms, the January increase represented a rise of 5.2 percent at an annual rate while the February decline was a drop of 5.6 percent.
 The February weakness reflected a 13.6 percent drop in revolving loans, the category that includes credit card debt, and a 1.6 percent decline in nonrevolving loans, which include auto loans.
 A revival in consumer borrowing and spending is considered crucial to providing support for the overall economy, which is still struggling to emerge from the worst recession since the 1930s.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said on Wednesday that the economy seemed to have stabilized and was growing again, but that threats remained.
 ''We are far from being out of the woods,'' Mr. Bernanke told a business audience in Dallas. ''Many Americans are still grappling with unemployment or foreclosure or both.''
 Economists are hoping that consumer borrowing will stabilize in coming months and resume growing, although they caution that the rebound will be restrained by tighter credit restrictions imposed by many banks in the wake of the financial crisis.
 Consumers who would like to borrow are finding it hard to get credit at banks, which are being pushed by regulators to bolster their lending standards.
 The $11.5 billion decline in consumer borrowing in February reduced total borrowing to $2.45 trillion, 4 percent below where it was a year ago. The Fed's measure of consumer credit excludes home mortgages and other loans secured by real estate.

HEADLINE: Looking Good In Three Figures

BYLINE: By DAVID COLMAN

 BODY:
BACK in the day, there were many choice slurs to run a fellow down, but somehow nothing was more damningly dismissive than to sneer that he wore a cheap suit. Then, of course, there came a new generation for whom the very term ''suit,'' cheap or no, was an even worse insult: a middle-management man who couldn't think outside the boxy garb of Big Business.
 But in the last decade, the suit, courtesy of designers like Miuccia Prada, Tom Ford and Thom Browne, has been transformed into an outfit with serious counter-cultural cred. Now, with the economy listless, even the cheap suit is brushing off its unsuave guise. And in the hands of youthful designers like Billy Reid and Sam Shipley and Jeff Halmos of Shipley & Halmos, and stores like Uniqlo and Topman, the cheap suit has become a garment that is as unfussy as jeans or chinos yet still has your back in an interview, at dinner or on a date. 
 This change is being driven as much by the guys buying suits as by the guys making them: youthful, inexpensive suits are one of the strongest selling items on the sales floor right now. According to the NPD Group, which tracks retail sales, suit sales in 2009 were almost exactly even with those of 2008 (a drop of just 0.01 percent), while sales of sport coats and jackets slid more than 13 percent. (Remember, gentleman reader, flat is the new up.)
 ''Less expensive suits, primarily bought by younger consumers, are faring best,'' said Marshal Cohen, NPD's chief analyst. ''Men's suits are a classic example of how aspirational consumers who had reached beyond their means are now coming back to more affordable prices -- still pricey but not as extreme as over $1,000. Suits over $1,000 are still not in recovery mode.''
 This is certainly the case at Topman. ''They're selling very well, particularly in the New York store,'' Gordon Richardson, the design director, said of Topman's slim, smart (and thrifty) suits. ''What is so attractive is that it's not about the old power dressing. It's about looking good, and looking cool in a suit.''
 Moreover, stylish upgrades are giving the cheap -- or shall we say cost-conscious? -- suit new appeal. No longer is a suit always a safe, sober investment buy. There are suits in pastel cotton twill, in black sharkskin, and in synthetic blends so high-tech they can practically do your taxes. They can suggest men's clubs (with a vest or a self-belt), country clubs (with a bright color or a jaunty plaid) or nightclubs (with satin shawl lapels or a single-button closure). All told, today's suit manages to embody a polished yet casual approach to dressing that, some 40 years ago, the leisure suit reached for and missed -- by a mile.
 Some young designers have actually been caught off guard by the enthusiasm and demand for inexpensive suiting. Ten years ago, new brands made a version of blue jeans their signature piece -- now that piece is the suit.
 ''Back when we were at Trovata, we never had a real suit,'' said Mr. Shipley, who was a partner in Trovata before founding Shipley & Halmos with Mr. Halmos. ''With this brand, we found ourselves gravitating towards suits, since there's so much you can do with fabric and cut and detail, and then they started selling really well. Now we've got guys coming back every season for a new one. That's how our business has grown.''
 Cost was a key part of the formula. ''We try to keep everything under $1,000,'' he said. ''We'd rather take a smaller margin and get guys into good-looking suits.''
 No small part of the suit's new appeal lies in how it has been re-engineered to be greater than the sum of its parts. When a suit was intended for business dress alone, the jacket and pants were designed to be paired only with each other. You could try to wear that pinstripe jacket with jeans, but it didn't really go. 
 ''I remember, growing up, you were told to never bust up a suit,'' said Mr. Reid, the designer of the Billy Reid collection. ''Those times have definitely changed.'' Now he makes his jackets a couple of inches shorter, narrowing the shoulder and raising the armhole, and slims the pants -- some of the improvements that help make the two pieces work with other garments. 
 Josh Levin, an urban-planning consultant who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, owns two of Mr. Reid's suits. ''The suit coat itself is really versatile,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I can wear it with any number of pants. And when I wear it as a suit, I don't feel stiff.''
 On the contrary, it gives him a certain cosmopolitan elan and the freedom that he likes. ''I spent my grad school years in Portland, Ore., and Denver, where dressing up in a suit is not well accepted,'' he said. ''Here, I'm checking out what other men are wearing, what looks good on them and how they're able to pull it off. I used to feel so constrained about how I could dress, but here I don't feel that way.''
 Others, like the musician Justin Townes Earle, who has bought suits at Uniqlo and Billy Reid, have a soft spot for the shot of formality a suit gives a man. ''I always wear a suit when I perform,'' Mr. Earle said. ''I like how it respects tradition.''
 Best of all, costly suited fellows can't snub you for having thrifty threads. Just like the old suits, the old gibes no longer fit.

HEADLINE: As Rescue Efforts Continue for Miners, Officials Press for Answers

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA and BERNIE BECKER; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from New York, Gardiner Harris from Washington, and Dan Heyman from Montcoal.

 BODY:
MONTCOAL, W.Va. -- As rescue workers waited anxiously on Wednesday to re-enter the Upper Big Branch mine where at least 25 people were killed in a deadly blast this week, federal officials said two safety citations were made against the mine's operator on the day of the explosion.
 According to newly released records from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, one of the citations issued Monday against the operator, the Massey Energy Company, was for failing to properly insulate and seal spliced electrical cables. That citation was for a problem outside the blast area and the error was fixed immediately, federal mine safety officials said. 
 The other citation was for failing to keep maps of above-ground escape routes current. It was not immediately clear if federal inspectors were at the mine before the blast, or if the citations were issued for conditions they discovered after responding to the explosion.
 At the time of the explosion on Monday, Kevin Stricklin, an administrator at the mine safety agency, was waiting at the airport in nearby Charleston, W.Va., on his way from Washington to a Massey mine in Kentucky. An agency spokesman said Mr. Stricklin was traveling to discuss various violations at the Kentucky mine. Mr. Stricklin quickly canceled his plans to visit the other Massey site and instead headed to the Upper Big Branch.
 On Jan. 7, federal regulators issued two citations against the mine because the intake system that was supposed to pull clean air inside was moving air in the wrong direction. Similar problems were also noted by the mine safety agency after a 2006 fire at a Massey mine in Logan County, W.Va., killed two miners. 
 After that fire, the Aracoma Coal Company, a subsidiary of Massey, agreed to pay $4.2 million in criminal fines and civil penalties and to plead guilty to several safety violations. Over the years, Massey has accumulated a long record of violations and fines for its coal mining operations.
 Massey representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
 Federal mining regulators said Wednesday that they had assembled a team to investigate the mining accident and that they hoped work would begin soon.
 While local families clung to slim hope that survivors might soon be found, mining officials said more ventilation was needed before a search could continue. Workers continued drilling holes into the mine to help air out the methane and carbon monoxide gases that have accumulated, and a morning effort to contact the miners by beating on pipes met with no response. Thirty-one miners were in the area during a shift change when the explosion rocked the mine.
 ''We're in a full rescue operation now, then we'll go into recovery,'' Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia said at a news conference on Wednesday morning. 
 At the mine, families convened at an open warehouse on the Massey property, where local residents delivered food and condolences. 
 Because of the hilly terrain, cellular telephone reception is weak to nonexistent near the mine. As they waited for news, relatives of miners lined up at one of the few landline phones available near the site to call home and update loved ones.
 Once workers re-enter the mine, it will probably take two to three hours to reach the area where the missing miners are believed to be, state officials said, adding that it was highly unlikely that survivors would be found.
 Governor Manchin said he was concerned about reports of several recent work stoppages because of high methane levels in the mine before the explosion. The mine is supposed to be outfitted with air-quality sensors that shut machines off when methane levels grow too high.
 ''Why didn't it happen this time?'' Mr. Manchin asked, adding that he was eager to find out. ''Why didn't sensors go off?'' 
 After their initial ventures into the mine, rescue workers said the explosion appeared to have occurred in its active section, not in the abandoned, sealed-off areas. Dennis O'Dell, a safety official with the United Mine Workers of America, said if that were true, it would indicate that the mine not only had methane problems, but also probably had dangerous levels of coal dust in the air.
 Lawmakers in West Virginia and Washington said they planned to hold hearings to review what went wrong and what, if anything needed to be done to improve safety regulations.
 In 2006, Congress conducted the biggest overhaul in federal mining regulations in three decades. Under the new federal regulations, mine operators are required to add emergency breathing devices and airtight rescue chambers to help miners escape explosions and fires. Companies were ordered to report serious accidents more quickly and to add more mine rescue teams.
 Investigators will probably want to see whether the mine operator was in compliance with the requirement to have new communications and tracking gear to help miners reach people above ground and help rescuers locate missing workers.
 Mr. Stricklin, of the mine agency, said it was not entirely clear whether the mine was in compliance. It had an approved tracking and communication plan in compliance with the federal law, but tracking equipment was not in place in the section of the mine where the missing miners are believed to be, he said.
 Federal mining data indicates that only one in 10 underground mines nationwide have met the law's requirements.

HEADLINE: Obscure Panels, Often the Stuff of Jokes, Survive Cost-Cutting Efforts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Financially ailing states seeking to cut bureaucratic sprawl have zeroed in on what might seem a vulnerable target: the countless advisory, advocacy and regulatory boards and commissions that ripple out from their capitals into infinite niches of human need and pursuit. 
 Iowa's Grape and Wine Development Commission? Gone. The Committee on Agency Officials' Salaries in Washington State? Done. The Advisory Commission on American and Francophone Cultural Affairs in Connecticut? No more. 
 Yet for all the cutting, far more boards are surviving scrutiny than succumbing to it. Obscure but obstinate, they are proving a surprisingly hardy species within the mysterious ecosystem called government. The efforts can seem an endless loop of relearning the same lesson, with bold plans for streamlining colliding with the reality that cutting many boards saves little money but can exact a high political price. 
 While their arcane names often prompt dismissive jokes, many boards serve serious purposes and vocal constituencies. Appointing their members also gives governors and lawmakers a means to reward supporters.
 ''We as legislators love to create boards and commissions,'' said State Senator Staci Appelof Iowa, a Democrat. ''We just don't like to decommission them.''
 For three years now, Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut, a Republican, has tried to eliminate the Permanent Commission on the Status of Women and its $1.2 million annual budget. But the group, which has played an advocacy role on issues like family leave and sexual assault, endures (although its budget has been reduced by more than half). 
 The commission's executive director, Teresa Younger, noted that the word ''permanent'' was put in the name by ''our founding mothers and fathers'' when the commission was formed in 1973.
 ''They understood we had an ongoing role to play,'' Ms. Younger said.
 In Iowa, Ms. Appel, as a co-chairwoman of the new Government Reorganization Committee, helped lead a 10-month effort to reorganize government by consolidating agencies and services, and reducing boards and commissions. 
 Ms. Appel said the work yielded $187 million in savings, but relatively little of it came from cutting boards and commissions. And even as several Iowa commissions were consolidated, many retained separate offices. As the legislative session came to a close last week, some commissions that were cut altogether were riding back to life on last-minute amendments.
 ''They're all trying to come back in,'' Ms. Appel said. 
 Among them was the Hemophilia Advisory Committee.
 ''They'll save a few thousands dollars in operational expenses,'' Dr. Steven R. Lentz, director of the Hemophilia Treatment Center at the University of Iowa and a member of the committee, said of the plan to eliminate it. ''But it may end up costing a lot more if they make a boneheaded decision about providing care for these patients in the future.'' 
 Ms. Appel said she hoped that the Government Reorganization Committee would conduct similar reviews every other year. If it does, Iowa will not be the only state to start new boards and commissions in the name of contracting them.
 In September, Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican, formed the Advisory Commission to Optimize State Government. An excess of boards and commissions -- the state has 400 executive boards alone, including the Naturopathic Formulary Peer Committee -- ''is one of the areas that the advisory commission is looking at,'' said Angie Welling, a spokeswoman for the governor.
 ''Basically, what you're doing is picking 100 fights,'' said Billy Hamilton, a former deputy comptroller in Texas and former co-director of the California Performance Review, an aggressive but ultimately failed effort to streamline government in the state led by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2004. 
 Among the review's most controversial proposals was a plan to eliminate 88 of the 339 state boards and commissions it evaluated, including many powerful regulatory groups with paid positions. 
 Mr. Hamilton said that while the current economic climate would seem ideal for paring down the extremities of government, the real savings was in core functions, like education and health care. Politicians, however, keep promising to eliminate the little things.
 In January 2009, as Washington State faced a bleak budget deficit, State Senator Craig Pridemore listened as Gov. Christine Gregoire, also a Democrat, vowed in her State of the State address to sharply reduce the more than 400 boards and commissions. 
 ''Here we go again,'' Mr. Pridemore whispered to a colleague. 
 Mr. Pridemore then went on to lead a legislative effort last year that set out to cut about 200 commissions but ultimately shed just 18.
 In this year's address, Ms. Gregoire announced plans to eliminate still more boards and commissions.
 Mr. Pridemore, however, decided not to sponsor a government reorganization bill that has moved through the Legislature this year.
 ''I came to the conclusion,'' he said, ''that it wasn't worth the exercise.''

HEADLINE: Texas Oil Firms Oppose California Climate Law

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; John M. Broder reported from Washington, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Several Texas oil companies are bankrolling a petition drive to suspend California's path-breaking climate change law in a move that may prove a bellwether for national efforts to address global warming.
 The Valero Energy Corporation, a San Antonio-based company that is one of the nation's largest independent oil refiners and retailers, has contributed $500,000 to a ballot initiative that would halt the carrying out of the California climate law known as Assembly Bill 32, which Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, signed in 2006. At least one other Texas oil company, Tesoro, with operations in California and a prominent antitax group are helping to finance the petition drive to place the initiative on the November general election ballot.
 The California law, the first of its kind in the nation, is intended to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases by 15 percent below current levels by 2020 through a variety of means, including a regional cap-and-trade system. The bill also calls for greater efficiencies in buildings and transportation, more use of renewable sources of energy and greater reliance on clean-burning fuels. These are all major elements of climate change proposals now being discussed in Washington. 
 The fine points of the California plan, including the critical questions of how emissions permits would be allocated and how any revenues would be distributed, are still being worked out.
 The ballot initiative would prevent the law's taking effect until unemployment in California falls to 5.5 percent or lower for four consecutive quarters. The state's current unemployment rate is 12.5 percent. The average statewide unemployment rate in 2006 was 4.9 percent.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger has said he considers the climate change law one of the signal achievements of his administration and wants to see it put in place. He said recently he believed the petition drive was fueled by the ''greed'' of out-of-state energy companies.
 ''I think that the California people are outraged about the fact that Texas oil companies, Texas oil companies, are coming to California and trying to change laws and policies in California,'' he said at a green technology exhibition in Sacramento last month. ''I mean, it's outrageous.'' 
 But the governor has also expressed concern that the new law, scheduled to take effect in 2012, not harm the state's crippled economy and cause additional job losses. 
 The California Jobs Initiative, the group collecting petition signatures to upend the California law, has raised just under $1 million, according to a spokeswoman for the group. Most of the money came from oil companies, but the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, founded by the father of California's antitax movement, contributed $100,000. 
 A Valero spokesman, Bill Day, said costs would rise at the company's two large refineries in California under the new emissions law because refineries use a lot of electricity and natural gas to heat and refine crude oil. Electricity prices would go up under the law, he said, and the consumption of natural gas produces carbon emissions that would be penalized under the legislation. 
 ''Like the national cap-and-trade legislation, it does nothing at all to alleviate the problem of climate change, but it would have tremendously bad impacts on the California economy,'' Mr. Day said. ''This is exactly the wrong time to be implementing a cap and trade program that will further hurt consumers and cause more job loses. We are supporting a measure that would give California voters the chance to express their opinion on whether this legislation should be implemented now.''
 Valero has also been active in opposing federal cap-and-trade regulations. In response to the climate bill passed by the House last June, Valero organized a ''Voices for Energy'' campaign against the bill and placed signs at its gas stations around the country depicting Uncle Sam warning drivers that the legislation would increase gasoline prices.
 Steven Maviglio, spokesman for Californians for Clean Energy & Jobs, an alliance supporting the climate bill, said he had little doubt the organizers of the initiative would collect the required 434,000 signatures by mid-April to win a spot on the November ballot. He said his organization, representing technology firms, environmental advocates and public health groups, had raised nearly $1 million to defend the law. But he said both sides in the fight would probably raise tens of millions of dollars for what he called an environmental ''battle royal'' in the fall. 
 ''Valero has been very outspoken on the national level against climate change regulation,'' said Mr. Maviglio, who served as spokesman for Gray Davis, the Democratic governor whom Mr. Schwarzenegger succeeded in a lively recall election in 2003. ''This is a strategic effort by the oil companies to try to unravel this law before it spreads throughout the country. The theory is if they can kill it here, they can kill it everywhere.''
 There are already signs of economic and political unease in state capitals about climate change legislation. Arizona announced this year that it was pulling out of an embryonic regional greenhouse gas emissions trading group, and more than a dozen state attorneys general have challenged the Environmental Protection Agency's plans to regulate global warming gases.

HEADLINE: White House Presses Japan to Reopen Market to U.S. Beef

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Saya Speidel contributed research.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Obama administration is stepping up pressure on Japan to reopen its market to American beef, in hopes of helping ranchers and meatpackers gain full access to what was once their most lucrative market.
 Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has been dispatched to Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart, Hirotaka Akamatsu, on Thursday.
 Japan resumed American beef imports in 2006, but restricted them to meat from cattle 20 months old or younger -- a limit that American exporters say has no scientific basis. Japan says older animals are more prone to developing mad cow disease. Japan also bans certain body parts. 
 Mr. Vilsack indicated that the United States was amenable to incremental steps to revive the beef trade to address Japanese concerns. For instance, he said the United States would be willing to gradually raise the age limit on imports.
 ''It's an effort on the part of the U.S. to convey a willingness to re-energize the dialogue about beef, to convey a sense of flexibility in how we approach the ultimate reopening of this market,'' Mr. Vilsack said Wednesday in an interview.
 ''There can be incremental steps taken to reassure the Japanese government and Japanese consumers that we can provide a safe product, a quality product,'' Mr. Vilsack said.
 Japan, the world's largest net importer of food, abruptly banned shipments from American meat packers in 2003 after mad cow disease was discovered in one animal imported to the United States from Canada.
 When the ban was eased in 2006, the United States ambassador to Japan at the time, J. Thomas Schieffer, appeared before Japanese television cameras to eat an American beef and rice bowl at a Tokyo restaurant. But imports have risen only slightly.
 In 2003, Japan was the largest market for American beef, with exports of $1.4 billion; since then, American beef exports to Japan have averaged about $196 million, or less than 15 percent of 2003 levels.
 Japan's restrictions cost American producers about $1 billion in lost exports a year, according to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
 American lawmakers have urged Mr. Obama to do more to urge Japan to relax its stance. Last month, Senators Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, and Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, introduced a resolution pressing Japan to immediately expand market access for American beef.
 Mr. Johanns, a former agriculture secretary, has contrasted Japan's strict stance with what he said had been Washington's more cautious handling of Toyota cars amid recalls over sudden acceleration problems.
 He referred to ''an inconsistency between Japan's continued ban on safe U.S. beef and beef products compared to America's fair treatment of Japan after reports of faulty Toyota vehicles,'' in remarks after meeting Japan's ambassador to the United States in March.
 The Obama administration is eager to increase American exports to help rebuild the economy. In his State of the Union address in January, Mr. Obama said he aimed to double total American exports in the next five years.
 Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is a fatal disease that affects the brains of cattle; it has been linked to a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, a fatal illness in humans.
 Americans note that in recent years, Japanese beef producers have found at least 36 cases of mad cow among their cattle herds while only three have been identified in the United States.
 But Japanese producers argue that they test all cows bound for slaughter for the disease, while the American meat industry has resisted blanket testing, partly because of cost concerns. Some critics also question the accuracy of testing methods.
 Concerns about American beef among the Japanese public have been fanned by the discovery of several shipments from the United States that contained banned cow parts.
 ''Whether food safety is strictly secured is the issue,'' Mr. Akamatsu, the agriculture minister, told reporters on Wednesday. ''The Japan-U.S. relationship is important, but that does not mean food safety can be neglected.''

HEADLINE: In a Tour for Visitors, Iraq's Past Is Present

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and YASMINE MOUSA

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- A group of foreign visitors went on a tour of Baghdad recently. Such an event, almost anywhere else, would have passed unnoticed. But this is Baghdad, where the rumblings of a passing thunderstorm recently had people convinced that insurgents had unleashed a string of synchronized bombings. 
 Indeed, only a week or so after the visitors had left, a series of bombings in the capital, including at least seven on Tuesday, killed more than 100 people and wounded several hundred others, lending substance to the fears. 
 And so to ensure that peace would prevail for a few hours and ghastly headlines avoided, the authorities deployed an entire Iraqi Army battalion, hundreds of police officers, a group of special forces commandos from the Interior Ministry and took the extraordinary step of closing much of Baghdad's historic old quarter.
 The occasion was an excursion by about 75 architects and city planners from the United States, France, Iran, Italy, Japan and elsewhere, who were attending a six-day conference on the ''Preservation of Iraqi City Centers.'' 
 After a welcome speech by Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, they spent days listening to redevelopment experts. On the fourth day, they piled into three minibuses with heavily armed police officers and intelligence service agents riding in armored vehicles in front, back and in between for a tour of architectural and cultural wonders that most foreigners have not had access to for decades and that Iraqis are often too frightened to visit.
 The convoy crept through traffic, past the Baghdad Provincial Council building and the Justice Ministry, where bombs killed 155 people last October. A guide pointed out the damaged structure without emotion. The planners and architects took photos. 
 As the buses were whisked through checkpoints on otherwise gridlocked streets, people stuck their heads out of car windows and pointed, as if that act might make the remarkable sight more real. The odds of seeing a foreigner here not wearing a uniform or carrying a weapons are vanishingly small. Many do both. 
 ''Who are you?'' a taxi driver shouted before a tour guide asked that windows be rolled up so the air-conditioner could be switched on.
 Like just about everyone else on the tour, Marc Santos, a 49-year-old architect who works for the municipality of Barcelona, said he had been worried about Baghdad's dangers but decided the risk to see what is essentially a forbidden city was worthwhile.
 ''Everything is very controlled,'' he said. ''But I guess that's logical.''
 The first stop was Mustansiriya University, opened in 1233 during the Islamic Golden Age. The city was sacked 25 years later by Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis and brother of Kublai.
 The tour group climbed several sets of steps up to the roof. One young woman pretended to fall off, which would have been a novel way to die in Iraq.
 The police, armed with AK-47s, but unaccustomed to dealing with such behavior, did not quite know how to react.
 ''Should we go up upstairs?'' one asked another.
 ''I don't know,'' was the response.
 ''No, we have to go,'' said the first. 
 On the roof, the soldiers pulled out their own cameras and took photos of themselves, exhibiting rare smiles.
 The next stop was a market where carpets, books, fabric and copper -- items that have long been part of Baghdad's identity -- are among the items sold.
 As the tourists walked on a street that had been cleared of traffic, people gathered on sidewalks and gawked, but were kept away by police officers and troops who kept the visitors in a protective cordon. 
 ''It's like we're the circus,'' one tourist said.
 At the antiques and copper market, the sound of hammers striking metal echoed through the building, but the place had been emptied of shoppers and, by extension, much of its character. 
 Merchants in their stalls peered out at the visitors. Usually voluble, the men said nothing.
 ''We love visitors,'' one vendor said finally. ''We need more of them.'' 
 Back outside, Mutanabbi Street, named for a 10th-century poet, is home to Baghdad's book market. Books were on tables, laid on the sidewalk and only sometimes in bookshops. Titles ranged from the Koran to cookbooks, and in some cases they had been placed next to one another. The market was bombed in 2007, killing 26 people.
 ''The energy is much more positive than I'd imagined,'' said Nadya Nilina, an architect from Rotterdam.
 Did she feel safe here?
 ''We are always with heavily armed security -- come on,'' she said as a police officer nudged by.
 At the Qushla, the administrative headquarters of the Ottoman government in Baghdad a century ago, the tourists snapped photos. Off to the side, a guard placed himself strategically in front of a plaque that noted the buildings had been rehabilitated during the Saddam Hussein era.
 As the tour neared its end, Michael Pearson, a 77-year-old architect from a family of three generations of London architects, was wilting in the heat. He wore a blue pinstripe suit with a red handkerchief in the pocket, a red gingham shirt and red tie.
 Unlike most of the others on the tour, Mr. Pearson had been to Baghdad before -- but that had been 30 years ago.
 ''It's looking very tired after three wars,'' he said. ''It's very sad.''
 At the Shahbandar Cafe, a venerable hangout for intellectuals, men sipped sweet tea and smoked hookahs. The walls were lined with black-and-white photos of a glorious looking, unrecognizable city. A bulbul bird hopped around in a cage.
 Gary L. Russell, a staff architect from the Boston Landmarks Commission, said what had surprised him most about Baghdad was the city's quiet at night. Much of that, of course, is due to Baghdad's nighttime curfew.
 ''The damage is not as extensive as I'd thought,'' Mr. Russell said. ''You don't get this sense that it is a dangerous place like it was two or three years ago.''
 At the Baghdadi Museum, there is a saying by a blind, 11th-century philosopher and poet, Abu Ala al-Ma'ari, posted on a wall: ''One who lived and died in Baghdad, as if he has moved from heaven to heaven.''
 Inside, the architects and city planners ate lunch, perhaps dreaming up ways to make the poem a reality. Outside, a clutch of policemen and soldiers kept people away.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Russia Agreement Stirs Old Worries Among Czechs

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
KARLOVY VARY, CZECH REPUBLIC -- As President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia and President Barack Obama prepare to arrive in Prague on Thursday to sign a landmark arms control treaty, Marcela Balounova, like many Czechs, remains haunted by her memories of 1968, when nearly one million Warsaw Pact troops invaded Czechoslovakia, ushering in a period of political repression.
 ''The Russians invaded us before and they are invading us again,'' Ms. Balounova, 50, said from her art gallery in this picturesque spa town, where Peter the Great first came for a treatment in 1711 and which has since become so popular with Russians that most signs offering luxury products and services -- from million-euro villas to colonic irrigation -- are in Russian. ''I still remember crying when the Russians came here. And now here we are more than 40 years later and this place has become a Little Moscow.'' 
 For the United States, the signing of an arms reduction treaty with Russia in the heart of the former Eastern Bloc, one year after Mr. Obama laid out his vision in Prague for a world free of nuclear weapons, offers a symbolic opportunity to reset relations with Moscow. 
 But while the American-Russian deal to reduce the binding cap on deployed warheads by 30 percent has been hailed as a diplomatic triumph in Washington and Moscow, Ms. Balounova's sentiments reflect the growing concerns of many Czechs about Russia's motives and America's resolve in a region where history is never far from the surface. 
 Such alarm has been all the more pronounced in the Czech Republic, where many saw a capitulation to Moscow in Mr. Obama's decision last year to abandon the antimissile system proposed by his predecessor, George W. Bush, which would have been partly deployed in the Czech Republic. While Mr. Bush said the system's purpose was to shield Europe from Iranian missiles, many here saw it as a bulwark against a newly assertive Kremlin. 
 U.S. officials said Mr. Obama was eager to overcome anxieties about Russia and, at a dinner Thursday with 11 heads of state or government from the region, would urge them to discard outdated Cold War ideas.
 ''President Obama will seek to impress upon regional leaders a new attitude toward Russia in which the outmoded fears of Russians hiding under the bed are a thing of the past,'' said a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to speak for attribution. 
 Jiri Schneider, director of the Prague Security Studies Institute, noted that two competing narratives threatened to clash during the Obama-Medvedev visit. 
 ''By signing this treaty in the Czech Republic, a member of the European Union and NATO, the United States is symbolically asserting its commitment to European security and putting to rest old East-West Cold War divisions,'' he said. ''But the risk is that the Russians can also use this visit to embarrass the host country, to say, 'We are here and you are not out of Russia's sphere of influence.''' 
 For many Czechs of the Cold War generation, who still recall with visceral contempt the sight of Russian tanks on the streets of Prague, the Obama administration's attempts to reach out to Russia is both naive and fraught with danger. Hospodarske Noviny, a leading Czech newspaper, said dryly Tuesday that Prague's role for the Obama administration was that of ''butler'' and ''panoramic backdrop.'' 
 Lubos Dobrovsky, 78, a former dissident who worked as a window cleaner during the communist era before going on to become defense minister and presiding over the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, dismissed the new arms reduction treaty as ''a cheap marketing trick by Washington and Moscow.'' 
 Mr. Dobrovsky joined former President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, former President Lech Walesa of Poland and other Central and East European leaders last July in signing an open letter pleading with the Obama administration to retain a ''full engagement'' in the region and to be wary of resurgent Russian imperialism. 
 He insisted in an interview that recent events showed that Russia remained determined to impose its will, including its ''invasion'' of Georgia in 2008, its threats of military action against the Czech Republic and Poland if they collaborated with the United States on missile defense, and its lackluster support of U.S. diplomacy in Iran. 
 He criticized Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton as ''insinuating that she can imagine Russia in NATO,'' thus ''creating a dangerous illusion that the United States and Russia are equal.'' He added his skepticism of the effectiveness of a treaty that would leave both countries with '' more than enough carriers and missiles to obliterate the entire world.'' 
 Whatever the treaty's disarmament aims, many Czechs say that Russia's encroaching economic influence is a far bigger concern than its military might. 
 Here in Karlovy Vary, where Russian influence is so strong that the local Czech hockey team has been considering joining Russia's national hockey league, Czech residents complain that investments in real estate by Russian investors have pushed property prices up by 40 percent. Some 25,000 Russian tourists visited last year, and borscht is supplanting knedliky, or Czech dumplings, on menus around town. 
 Elsewhere in the Czech Republic, which receives 75 percent of its supply of natural gas from Russia, concern that Russia is colonizing the energy sector is growing. A Czech-Russian consortium led by Atomstroyexport, a Russian engineering company, is a leading contender to build as many as five nuclear reactors in southern Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia in a deal valued at 20 billion, or $27 billion. And the Russian energy giant Lukoil financed the Russian-language edition of a book by the Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, that plays down the effects of industry on global warming. 
 Natalia Sudliankova, editor of Prazsky Telegraf, the country's largest Russian-language newspaper, said it was an open secret that Russian business interests in the region were supported by the Kremlin. ''What Moscow is doing is no different than what any country does,'' she said. ''If they can buy influence, they buy it.'' 
 For all the Czech concerns, however, many here also stressed that Russia had seldom been weaker, buffeted by the global financial crisis, the loosening of its grip over former satellites like Moldova and Ukraine and the recent terrorist attack in the Moscow Metro. That, argued Petr Pospichal, a Czech who organized secret meetings with fellow dissidents from Russia during the Cold War and who became ambassador to Bulgaria in the 1990s, offered an opportunity for the Czechs and the region as a whole to overcome old stereotypes and look for a new approach. 
 ''I never expected the memories of 1968 to last this long,'' he said. ''The world has changed since communist times, and Russia is no longer the superpower it once was. We Czechs must not assume that every time Russia defends its national interests, it is being an aggressor.'' 
 Indeed, some among the 150,000 Russian speakers living in the Czech Republic are hopeful that the signing of an arms reduction treaty by a Russian president on Czech territory will help banish the ghosts of the past. 
 Konstantin Makarenko, a 21-year-old Russian real estate developer from Siberia, whose parents came to Karlovy Vary 10 years ago in search of economic opportunity, lamented that most Czechs had selective memories, recalling 1968 and 1989, but conveniently forgetting 1945, when the Red Army liberated the country from fascism. 
 Yet Mr. Makarenko was optimistic that the summit meeting Thursday couldsignal a new era. ''The Czechs still seem to think we are occupying them, and I am hoping that this visit will help change that,'' he said. ''I am tired of being blamed for things that happened before I was born.'' 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Fast Is Your Broadband?

 BODY:
There are many ways for marketing professionals to bamboozle customers into believing they are getting a better deal than they actually are -- notable among them ''as low as'' pricing come-ons and offers that promise to deliver ''up to'' some standard of service. 
 The Internet is no stranger to this sort of gauzy offering, but it has become too central to the way Americans communicate to rely on dubious metrics. A consistent federal standard is needed to determine the speed at which Americans navigate the Internet so consumers can make informed choices about their service.
 Broadband providers argue that their dazzling promises of ''up to'' speeds are not a gimmick. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, a lobby group, is protesting a Federal Communications Commission report that says the typical speeds experienced by American consumers are less than half the ''up to'' speed advertised. 
 In a report last month, the F.C.C. reprinted the results of a study by comScore that found that the typical download speed into American homes is only 3.1 megabits per second, less than half the median advertised rate of ''up to'' 7 Mbps. 
 The cable association says comScore used flawed methods. It argues that the slow downloads are because of factors beyond providers' reach -- from the traffic on the Internet and the distance a download must travel, to the speed of a user's home network or computer.
 But broadband providers have not supplied the F.C.C. with their own measure of speed. And regardless of what may be slowing downloads, from the point of view of consumers, the advertised ''up to'' speed is often pointless, if not outright misleading. The F.C.C. wants to develop a measure of broadband speeds that can function like the miles-per-gallon standard used to gauge fuel economy across all the nation's cars and trucks. 
 It hired a company to measure speeds in a sample of homes in a more standardized way. It is calling on industry and consumer groups to help find a common method to crunch the data into metrics that can be deployed nationally for all devices that are plugged into the Internet. The objective should be federally mandated standards of measurement and disclosure that consumers can rely on when deciding which online service to use.

HEADLINE: It Isn't Easy Building Green

BYLINE: By TRACEY TAYLOR

 BODY:
Michelle Kaufmann, an architect, remembers leading Laura Bush, the first lady, on a personal tour of one of her prefabricated homes, pointing out its on-demand water heater and explaining how the graywater system recycled waste water. It was May 2006, and a full-scale model of Ms. Kaufmann's Glidehouse design had been erected at the National Building Museum in Washington. It was, Ms. Kaufmann said, one of the high points for her design-build company, mkDesigns.
 There were others. The company had its debut with a bang in 2004 when Sunset magazine chose to feature a model of the Glidehouse in its annual Celebration Weekend event in Menlo Park, Calif. An estimated 25,000 people -- builders, architects, potential clients -- waited in long lines that formed even before the doors opened to see mkDesigns' modern take on the prefab home. The overwhelming response jump-started the company, which until that point had been a one-woman operation. It seemed like the right idea at the right time. 
 Ms. Kaufmann immediately hired a client-services manager to handle the hundreds of customer inquiries she began receiving and set to work building her business. ''There hadn't been a precedent for a green preconfigured home,'' Ms. Kaufmann said, ''and ours struck a chord.'' The firm, based in Oakland, Calif., rapidly earned a reputation for its streamlined modular homes and went on to build a total of 53, mostly on the West Coast. 
 Ms. Kaufmann built more homes than any of the other dozen or so boutique prefab-home companies that have sprung up in the past decade. These include Resolution 4 Architecture in New York, LivingHomes and Marmol Radziner in Los Angeles, and FlatPak in Minneapolis. While most of the firms emphasized custom designs and high-end prices, mkDesigns aimed to reach a middle market with homes that cost $160 to $180 per square foot, not including the site. 
 Together, the green prefab companies represent a tiny segment of the home construction market, but with their focus on sustainability and affordability, they offer the prospect of genuinely green homes delivered to a mass market -- an alternative to cookie-cutter spec houses and bloated McMansions. ''Before the economic meltdown, all builders were looking at prefab in one way or another,'' said Leo Marmol, founder of Marmol Radziner.
 One reason was the success of similar firms outside the United States. Of all the new single-family houses built in Finland last year, for example, 68 percent were wholly or partly prefabricated, and the home building company Sekisui builds approximately 15,000 modular housing units a year in Japan.
 Predictability is one attraction. Home parts are made in a controlled environment and assembled on site, often in a matter of days, meaning weather is less of an issue. And prefab buildings produce about 50 to 75 percent less waste than site-built homes.
 Ms. Kaufmann's first challenge was to find factories that would produce the parts necessary to assemble her homes. ''Factories wanted high volume,'' she said. And some of them did not want to take on the liability of manufacturing green but untested features, like countertops made of recycled paper.
 Even when Ms. Kaufmann found factories that would create what she wanted, the alliances didn't always last. ''We found a factory in Canada that worked well for a while,'' she said. ''But they got a big order to build workers' camps in Alaska and told us we would have to add six months to our project schedule, and they doubled the fee. Here we were in contract with a client -- it was not acceptable for us to pass that on to them.'' 
 In late 2006, Ms. Kaufmann decided she had no choice but to buy or build her own factory. With capital from one of mkDesigns's partners, the company bought a modular-home factory in Seattle that was rapidly reconfigured to put out 14 homes a year.
 To run the factory, Ms. Kaufmann hired away a manager who had been in charge of laptop production and distribution for Hewlett-Packard in Tokyo. This was in line with Ms. Kaufmann's vision of creating a hybrid company that straddled the line between architecture and product design. ''You could compare one of our homes to an iPod -- a really well-designed product that can be customized with different skins and applications,'' she said. 
 Having a manufacturing plant changed the game. ''It allowed us to design the elements we wanted and to grow,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''We were wearing two hats and the clients were getting a better product.'' The factory was so successful that within two years, it became apparent that the company needed another -- larger and more sophisticated. ''We didn't start off with the fanciest factory,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''We were in bootstrapping mode.''
 At the height of its success, mkDesigns employed 60 people in the design studio and the factory. Ms. Kaufmann attracted a number of investors willing to put up $100 million to help buy half a dozen factories across the United States. In early 2008, before the economy turned, the firm found a plant in Sacramento that it thought would be perfect. Ms. Kaufmann decided to sell the Seattle plant but leased it back and kept production going. 
 When the economy did turn, the mortgage collapse made it increasingly difficult for clients to obtain loans. With business declining and the housing climate increasingly uncertain, Ms. Kaufmann decided not to buy the Sacramento plant. ''We realized others could do the job much more cheaply than us,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. Things had changed. Factories that had previously been reluctant to risk manufacturing unfamiliar parts were now phoning Ms. Kaufmann, hungry for work and offering competitive bids. 
 But then, in quick succession, two factories she had chosen to work with went out of business. One had taken payment of $700,000 for two homes whose parts they had committed to produce, but mkDesigns had to finance the completion of both homes. The other factory left mkDesigns to finish work on homes whose parts were only partly delivered.
 In hindsight, Ms. Kaufmann says she believes that one of her company's main issues was an inability to create economies of scale. She and her partners had hoped that over time, and as the volume of their output grew, they would create more production and time efficiencies and that their costs would fall. Other practitioners have had similar problems. 
 ''Volume is still one of our biggest challenges,'' said Todd Jerry, chief operating officer at Marmol Radziner Prefab. Ms. Kaufmann concedes, too, that she was sometimes overly optimistic about production expenses and priced her homes for less than they actually cost. 
 Last May, she came to the painful realization that while the company might have been able to cope with one challenge, it could not handle all of its difficulties at once: the collapsing housing market, the closing of the two factories, the financial hits. ''We need to close,'' she told her staff, which had been pruned to 25.
 It was a difficult time. ''We had all invested so much of ourselves into the mission of making thoughtful, sustainable design accessible,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ''Closing was heartbreaking.''
 Last September, a fledgling prefab firm, Blu Homes of Boston, bought the rights to build mkDesigns' preconfigured home models. Bill Haney, co-founder of Blu Homes, said the company had technologies that would allow it to make the homes more affordable. So far, none have been built.
 A full-scale model of one of Ms. Kaufmann's homes, an mkSolaire, continues to stand on the grounds of the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, a spot that had been occupied previously by only one other house, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Erected in May 2008, Ms. Kaufmann's home features a solar-electric generation system and a living roof. Its purpose, according to the museum, is to ''show consumers what the future may bring.''

HEADLINE: Countries Urged to Plan for End of Stimulus

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
PARIS -- An international financial organization urged advanced economies on Wednesday to begin laying the groundwork now so that next year they could start removing economic stimulus measures.
 ''In most countries, decisions about movement, about action, should start to be discussed and taken now,'' said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Planning spending cuts and raising taxes, he said, take ''months in some cases to go through.''
 ''Next year, in 2011, fiscal consolidation programs should be moving,'' he said at a briefing to present the interim economic forecasts of the O.E.C.D. 
 Most advanced economies have announced only limited measures to end emergency stimulus -- for example, allowing tax incentives on automobile purchases to expire. But most have avoided raising tax rates or cutting spending, fearing such policies may dent the fragile recovery or anger voters. 
 ''Certainly I would not recommend countries to wait for market pressure to go up rapidly to start taking action,'' Mr. Padoan said.
 That is what has happened in Greece. Investors worried about the country's rising debt and deficit ratios have pushed up yields on Greek bonds, forcing Athens to turn to its European partners and the International Monetary Fund for support.
 The 30-member O.E.C.D. also urged central banks to continue reining in the exceptional liquidity stimulus measures that they put in place during the recession.
 ''We would like to see monetary policy go back to a normal rate sooner rather than later,'' Mr. Padoan said.
 In the United States, the Federal Reserve has ended its $1.25 trillion program to buy mortgage-backed securities, a program credited with holding mortgage interest rates at near-record lows and slowing the nationwide decline in home prices.
 The O.E.C.D. report itself was moderately upbeat on the outlook for the large economies, although it stressed that growth was likely to moderate during the first half of 2010 as support from the inventory cycle faded, some fiscal stimulus measures ended and private demand suffered from sluggish credit growth and weak labor markets.
 The pace of the recovery will remain uneven, it added, with growth in the United States likely to outstrip the expansion in Japan and Europe.
 ''Following a sharp narrowing during the recession, global imbalances have widened somewhat as activity has picked up,'' the report said, stressing in particular that large external imbalances remain within the euro area.
 Mr. Padoan said that he was encouraged that Chinese external surpluses appeared to be moderating, but added it was too early to judge whether that trend would be sustained.
 On a positive note, the unemployment rate has edged down in the United States and Japan and may well have peaked in the euro area, the report said.
 It predicted an annualized quarter-on-quarter growth of 2.4 percent in the United States for the first three months of 2010, up from the 1.6 percent that was forecast previously. For the second quarter, the forecast is 2.3 percent.
 For the three largest euro-zone economies -- Germany, France and Italy -- the O.E.C.D. forecast growth of 0.9 percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent during the second quarter.
 A separate release Wednesday from the European Union's statistics office showed Europe's economy stagnated in the fourth quarter. Gross domestic product in the 16-nation euro region was unchanged compared with the third quarter, when it rose 0.4 percent, Eurostat said. The office had previously estimated a fourth-quarter expansion of 0.1 percent.
 For Japan, the O.E.C.D. predicted 1.1 percent G.D.P. growth in the first quarter of 2010 and 2.3 percent for the second quarter.
 The organization's forecasts were limited to G.D.P. for the first and second quarters. More detailed forecasts will be provided in May.
 The O.E.C.D. also used the occasion to prod Beijing on the issue of its currency policy.
 ''We of course all know that there is one key currency that we recommend should move from its current level and start appreciating and of course I'm thinking about the Chinese currency,'' Mr. Padoan said.
 ''That would add positively to the issue of global imbalances'' and it ''would also probably add to global growth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In a Surprise, Geithner's Trip Includes China

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and KEITH BRADSHER. 
Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- In a sign of improving economic relations between the United States and China, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner will meet the Chinese vice prime minister in Beijing on Thursday on his way back to the United States from India, a Treasury spokesman said here on Wednesday. 
 The unexpected meeting between Mr. Geithner and the vice prime minister, Wang Qishan, comes during a flurry of diplomatic activity between Washington and Beijing meant to avoid a confrontation on China's policy of keeping its currency, the renminbi, at a nearly fixed exchange rate. 
Critics in Congress and elsewhere say that the policy artificially makes Chinese exports costs less at the expense of American exports and jobs. Economists estimate that the value of the renminbi, pegged at about 6.827 to the dollar, could be 20 to 40 percent higher if Beijing allowed it to trade freely. 
 On Saturday, the Treasury Department delayed a report on foreign exchange rates to Congress beyond an April 15 deadline. Many lawmakers in Washington had been pushing the Treasury to officially declare China a currency manipulator in that report. The move would have been largely symbolic but could have allowed Washington to retaliate against Chinese policies. 
 China has also made overtures to Washington in recent days. Last week, Beijing said that President Hu Jintao would visit Washington next Monday and Tuesday for a nuclear security meeting, just before the April 15 deadline that the Treasury later put off. This week, a Chinese agency appeared to warn exporters about protecting themselves, presumably from a revaluation of the renminbi. 
 Mr. Wang, the vice prime minister, is an influential economic policy maker in Beijing who was the primary contact for Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary. Mr. Paulson had started a strategic economic dialogue with China in part to persuade the country to allow its currency to rise against the dollar. 
 From 2005 to 2008, China allowed the renminbi to appreciate about 20 percent against the dollar. 
 Economists said they did not expect the visit by Mr. Geithner to Beijing to produce any immediate breakthroughs on currency policy. 
 Chinese officials have gone out of their way to signal that they will not make any policy shift that might suggest to their own people that they were backing down in the face of American pressure. 
 Mr. Geithner has been cautious about not seeming to push China hard in public, and he was conspicuously silent about the renminbi during March, when the Chinese Commerce Ministry issued combative statements warning that American pressure on the currency issue could lead to a trade war. Mr. Geithner would not take questions about his visit from reporters on Wednesday. 
 A spokesman, Andrew Williams, said Mr. Geithner and Mr. Wang had been trying to meet for some time and they confirmed the Thursday appointment on Tuesday, while Mr. Geithner was on a two-day trip to India. Mr. Williams declined to say whether a renminbi revaluation would be part of the discussion. 
 Stephen Green, an economist in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered, said Mr. Geithner would have to choose his words carefully in Beijing, particularly in any public appearances. Mr. Geithner, Mr. Green said, needs to meet criticisms in the United States that he is too soft on China while at the same time not interfering with any gradual shift in the consensus among Chinese officials toward allowing the renminbi to inch up this year. 
 ''He's obviously got to play a delicate balancing act,'' he added. 
 Mr. Green said that there was virtually no chance that China would announce a change during or immediately after the Treasury secretary's visit. ''The game plan is to move gradually to more flexibility in the second quarter,'' he said. 
 China has been letting the renminbi edge up almost imperceptibly over the last few days in trading in Shanghai. The currency has stayed close to 6.827 to the dollar since July 2008, but the official fixing for the start of trading on Wednesday in Shanghai was 6.8259, the first time this year that the government has allowed the currency to open at a level stronger than 6.826. 
 The currency has bobbed up and down lately. The government has been worried that many exporters earn revenue in dollars and sign contracts three months or more in advance, but incur many of their costs in renminbi. By allowing even a slight variation in the currency, the government may be signaling to exporters that they should begin preparing for the possibility of a stronger renminbi by giving fewer discounts on sales contracts or by keeping a particularly close eye on costs. 
 In Asian trading before the announcement of Mr. Geithner's meeting with Mr. Wang, the value of renminbi forward contracts rose. The one-year contracts are used to speculate on the value of the renminbi in the future, and they traded 0.1 percent higher at 6.6303 to the dollar, according to Bloomberg News. 
 Mr. Geithner has been careful not to talk about the renminbi during his trip to India. He told a television reporter that revaluing the currency was China's ''choice.'' 
 Indian officials, whose currency has appreciated about 14 percent against the dollar over the last 13 months, have also avoided discussing the renminbi, choosing to treat it as a bilateral issue between the United States and China, even though India's exports have become less competitive relative to China's as a result of Beijing's currency policy. 
 China is ''becoming more open to the world, and with that, you're going to see the currency take on a broader role internationally,'' Mr. Geithner said on Bloomberg Television in a taped interview. ''That's a healthy, necessary adjustment,'' he added. 
 Also on Wednesday, the People's Bank of China said it would sell 15 billion renminbi, the equivalent of $2.2 billion, in three-year bills at higher interest rates than in effect now. The decision suggests that policy makers may be preparing ground for a revaluation of the currency and are trying to cool down the economy.

HEADLINE: Job Creation Basics

 BODY:
President Obama recently noted that, by itself, government cannot replace the 8.2 million jobs lost over the past two years. What government can do, he said, is ''help to create the conditions'' for renewed hiring. 
 We couldn't agree more. The question is whether Congress will do what is needed. The job situation is dire. But Republicans have apparently decided that grandstanding about the deficit is more important. 
 The economy added 162,000 jobs in March, a welcome gain after more than two years of nearly uninterrupted losses. But unemployment remained stuck at 9.7 percent. And without more government support, it is unlikely to fall much anytime soon. 
 Most of March's job gains were temporary positions with the Census Bureau or in the private sector. The Census Bureau will keep hiring for a while, but the jobs will end by the fall. Private-sector temporary jobs won't become permanent unless employers see steady economic growth, which is far from assured as stimulus spending fades later this year. 
 Perhaps most destabilizing, upcoming budget cuts by recession-battered states will lead to more job losses.
 As states try to close their deficits with tax increases, consumers cut back on their spending, which harms businesses and hiring. As states cut spending, there is less business for private-sector contractors and more layoffs of government employees. Already in March, state and local governments shed 9,000 jobs. 
 That is why it is so critical to extend unemployment benefits through the end of the year and get more aid to states. Jobless benefits are the most powerful way to bolster waning demand during times of high unemployment. State aid also flows quickly to contractors, employees and beneficiaries, whose spending then supports jobs. 
 The House recently passed a one-month extension of expiring federal unemployment benefits. Before the Senate left town for spring break, Tom Coburn, a Republican of Oklahoma, blocked the extension, saying that it should be paid for with other budget cuts. 
 The House and Senate have already passed bills with a more generous extension and increased aid to the states. But they have been slow to finalize legislation and there are worrying signs that Mr. Coburn's arguments are gaining ground throughout his caucus.
 Make no mistake, the deficit is a serious problem that must be addressed in the medium term. The economy needs to be bolstered now. 
 Congress also must increase aid to small business. The Treasury should also redeploy bank bailout money for small business loans. And legislation is also needed to reinforce spending on infrastructure and clean energy, and create public jobs, especially summer youth jobs. Teen unemployment is currently 26 percent.
 Mr. Obama is right that the government needs to do more to create the conditions for more hiring. But being right about the policy isn't enough. He needs to get the politics right. Americans are nervous about the deficit, and so far the Republicans are carrying the debate. 
 The president needs to make the case to the public that without more emergency aid to jobless workers and hard-pressed states, unemployment will remain unacceptably high. And that will be bad news for all Americans.

HEADLINE: Cabrera Goes From Pauper Caddy to Prince of the Greens

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
Reluctant to embrace the spotlight, particularly if English is being spoken there, Angel Cabrera has been well served this week as he has prepared to defend his Masters title.
 Although Cabrera's story -- an improbable rise from impoverished caddy to two-time major champion -- remains a compelling tale, as this tournament begins Thursday nothing is as compelling to the golf world -- and beyond -- as Tiger Woods's return after his free fall from grace.
 Even in Cabrera's appreciative home country of Argentina, he is not the sports topic of the week -- not in a week when Lionel Messi, Argentina's diminutive soccer savant, scored all four of Barcelona's goals in a Champion's League mismatch against Arsenal on Tuesday night.
 ''It doesn't matter to Angel, but there's no doubt that he'll be more under the radar than your usual defending champion,'' said Charlie Epps, Cabrera's American swing coach and confidant. 
 Even when Cabrera won at Augusta National last year, it seemed to be much more about Kenny Perry's losing his touch and his two-shot lead down the stretch than about Cabrera's keeping his cool.
 But how can it be a coincidence that Cabrera -- a balding, bearish, 40-year-old who is much more deft than he appears -- keeps coming up with the major trophy under crushing pressure? He acquired his first at the 2007 United States Open. He then did it again last year at the Masters, conjuring a great escape among the trees on the first hole of the sudden-death playoff with Perry and Chad Campbell.
 Blocked by a tree trunk after his errant tee shot on 18, Cabrera took a wide-eyed whack at his ball and ended up finding refuge in the fairway, eventually salvaging par and then winning the tournament on the next playoff hole. Returning to Augusta this week, he made sure to visit that tree with his son Angelito, who will be caddying for him this week.
 ''Honestly, I'm the one who wanted to go see that shot, but he was a perfect excuse,'' Cabrera said of his son. ''He said: 'No. You're crazy. There's nothing there to shoot at.' ''
 It was a rare moment of levity at an otherwise matter-of-fact news conference, one in which the Argentine, speaking in Spanish, declined to dip his toe into the Tiger trap. ''They can talk about anybody,'' he said. ''They can talk about Tiger, but the Masters is the Masters, and we have to give that importance to the Masters as the Masters.''
 Even Jack Nicklaus, the retired 70-year-old golf icon who generally graces every query with a thorough answer, declined repeatedly to address Woods's travails. ''Well, it's been none of my business, so I've stayed away from it, frankly,'' said Nicklaus, a six-time Masters champion whose career record of 18 major tournament victories remains catnip to Woods, now holding at 14.
 But even with the emphasis more than ever on Woods, the Masters -- a carefully tended symbol of American privilege -- is an ever-more international experience. The last two champions have been non-Americans: Trevor Immelman of South Africa and Cabrera. In the 96-player field this year, as last year, the international players have the numerical edge, with 51 players to 45 from the United States.
 It should come as no surprise then that the cast in the main interview room on Tuesday was resolutely cosmopolitan, with the 10 men who came in for questioning hailing from five continents.
 There were Americans like Phil Mickelson, Steve Stricker and Cink. There was the Australian Geoff Ogilvy and South Korea's Han Chang-won, an amateur who took advantage of a new route into the Masters field by winning the inaugural Asian Amateur title last year. There was also Matteo Manassero, the reigning and engaging European amateur champion who, at 16, is the youngest player in Masters history and one of a record three Italians in the field, with the brothers Edoardo and Francesco Molinari.
 Cabrera made some history of his own last year, becoming the first South American to win at Augusta. He might not have had that honor if his Argentine compatriot Roberto De Vicenzo had not signed an incorrect scorecard at the 1968 Masters, costing himself a spot in an 18-hole playoff with Bob Goalby.
 De Vicenzo, now 86 and living in Buenos Aires, said he cried with delight when he watched on television last year as Cabrera donned his green jacket, but Cabrera and De Vicenzo are rarely in contact. They are from different generations, economic backgrounds and addresses, with Cabrera still living in Villa Allende, near Argentina's second city of Cordoba.
 From a poor family, Cabrera's parents left him in the care of his grandmother as a child. ''It was another mouth to feed, and in Argentina, there's a lot of poverty and so he had to sacrifice his education to put food on the table,'' Epps said.
 ''At the age of 10, Angel became a caddy, and he'd caddie every day,'' he added, ''and he said that at the end of the day, they'll give me a bologna sandwich and send me home, and he'd get home at night and his grandmother would give him a hard roll and a cup of tea.
 ''I always like to say that the young kids in the United States, they dream about winning the Masters, ''but when Angel was a young boy, he was dreaming about food.''
 Cabrera was a caddie at the Cordoba Golf Club, the same place where Epps, years before, had played regularly as a teenager when his American father worked in Argentina for Kaiser Motor Company in the 1950s. As a fluent Spanish speaker with strong connections to Cordoba and Villa Allende, Epps was a natural mentor for Cabrera when they begin working together on his weak point -- putting -- in 2007. Not long after, Cabrera won the United States Open.
 ''He knew where I was coming from, and I think that's what bonded us together,'' Cabrera said.
 Cabrera is now a member of the golf club that once would not allow him into the clubhouse. He is now the head of his own foundation and a symbol of upward mobility in a country where golf remains largely a sport for the elite. For Epps, it is Cabrera's demanding childhood that molded him into a pressure player, but he still needed to learn the technique and mental tricks that would provide him with a base.
 ''One thing about caddying is you learn first with your eyes,'' Epps said. ''You're almost deprived from playing, and you caddie six days a week and then you get a chance to play on Monday. I always like to tell people that Angel's favorite club in his golf bag is a 7-iron, because that's the only thing he had when he was a boy.''
 ''He came out of poverty,'' he added. ''But it drives certain people. Angel learned by watching other people play.''
 Judging from last year's Masters, where he was under par every round, he is a gifted observer.

HEADLINE: Riding 21st Century Rails

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Nearly 150 years after American railroads brought in thousands of Chinese laborers to build rail lines across the West, China is poised once again to play a role in American rail construction. But this time, it would be an entirely different role: supplying the technology, equipment and engineers to build high-speed rail lines.
 The Chinese government has signed cooperation agreements with the State of California and General Electric to help build such lines. The agreements, both of which are preliminary, show China's desire to become a big exporter and licensor of bullet trains traveling 215 miles an hour, an environmentally friendly technology in which China has raced past the United States in the last few years.
 ''We are the most advanced in many fields, and we are willing to share with the United States,'' Zheng Jian, the chief planner and director of high-speed rail at China's railway ministry, said. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has closely followed progress in the discussions with China and hopes to come here later this year for talks with rail ministry officials, said David Crane, the governor's special adviser for jobs and economic growth, and a board member of the California High Speed Rail Authority. 
 China is offering not just to build a railroad in California but also to help finance its construction, and Chinese officials have already been shuttling between Beijing and Sacramento to make presentations, Mr. Crane said in a telephone interview.
 China is not the only country interested in selling high-speed rail equipment to the United States. Japan, Germany, South Korea, Spain, France and Italy have also approached California's High Speed Rail Authority.
 The agency has made no decisions on whose technology to choose. But Mr. Crane said that there were no apparent weaknesses in the Chinese offer, and that Governor Schwarzenegger particularly wanted to visit China this year for high-speed rail discussions.
 Even if an agreement is reached for China to build and help bankroll a high-speed rail system in California, considerable obstacles would remain.
 China's rail ministry would face independent labor unions and democratically elected politicians, neither of which it has to deal with at home. The United States also has labor and immigration laws stricter than those in China.
 In a nearly two-hour interview at the rail ministry's monolithic headquarters here, Mr. Zheng said repeatedly that any Chinese bid would comply with all American laws and regulations.
 China's rail ministry has an international reputation for speed and low costs, and is opening 1,200 miles of high-speed rail routes this year alone. China is moving rapidly to connect almost all of its own provincial capitals with bullet trains.
 But while the ministry has brought costs down through enormous economies of scale, ''buy American'' pressures could make it hard for China to export the necessary equipment to the United States.
 The railways ministry has concluded a framework agreement to license its technology to G.E., which is a world leader in diesel locomotives but has little experience with the electric locomotives needed for high speeds.
 According to G.E., the agreement calls for at least 80 percent of the components of any locomotives and system control gear to come from American suppliers, and labor-intensive final assembly would be done in the United States for the American market. China would license its technology and supply engineers as well as up to 20 percent of the components.
 State-owned Chinese equipment manufacturers initially licensed many of their designs over the last decade from Japan, Germany and France. While Chinese companies have gone on to make many changes and innovations, Japanese executives in particular have grumbled that Chinese technology resembles theirs, raising the possibility of legal challenges if any patents have been violated.
 All of the technology would be Chinese, Mr. Zheng said.
 China has already begun building high-speed rail routes in Turkey, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It is looking for opportunities in seven other countries, notably a route sought by the Brazilian government between Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Zheng said.
 International rail experts say that China has mastered the art of building high-speed rail lines quickly and inexpensively.
 ''These guys are engineering driven -- they know how to build fast, build cheaply and do a good job,'' said John Scales, the lead transport specialist in the Beijing office of the World Bank.
 The California rail authority plans to spend $43 billion to build a 465-mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles and on to Anaheim that is supposed to open in 2020. The authority was awarded $2.25 billion in January in federal economic stimulus money to work on the project.
 The authority's plans call for $10 billion to $12 billion in private financing. Mr. Crane said China could provide much of that, with federal, state and local jurisdictions providing the rest. Mr. Zheng declined to discuss financial details.
 China's mostly state-controlled banks had few losses during the global financial crisis and are awash with cash now because of tight regulation and a fast-growing economy. The Chinese government is also becoming disenchanted with bonds and looking to diversify its $2.4 trillion in foreign reserves by investing in areas like natural resources and overseas rail projects.
 ''They've got a lot of capital, and they're willing to provide a lot of capital'' for a California high-speed rail system, Mr. Crane said.
 Later plans call for the California line to be extended to Sacramento and San Diego, while a private consortium hopes to build a separate route from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. 
 Toyota is shutting a big assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., that it once operated as a joint venture with General Motors, and one idea under discussion is converting the factory to the assembly of high-speed rail equipment, said Mr. Crane, who is also a member of the state's Economic Development Commission. 
 Rail parts from China would then come through the nearby port of Oakland, in place of auto parts from Japan.
 ''High-speed rail requires a lot of high technology -- we would send many high-end engineers and high-end technicians'' to California, Mr. Zheng said. 
 G.E. estimates that the United States will spend $13 billion in the next five years on high-speed rail routes. China, with a much more ambitious infrastructure program, will spend $300 billion in the next three years on overall expansion of its rail routes, mainly high-speed routes, according to G.E.
 China's long-term vision calls for high-speed rail routes linking Shanghai to Singapore and New Delhi by way of Myanmar, and someday connecting Beijing and Shanghai to Moscow to the northwest and through Tehran to Prague and Berlin, according to a map that Mr. Zheng keeps on a bookshelf behind his desk. He cautioned that there were no plans to start construction yet outside China.
 A high-speed rail link for passengers from Beijing to Shanghai will be finished by the end of 2011 or early 2012, and cut the journey to four hours, from 10 hours now, Mr. Zheng said. 
 New York to Atlanta or Chicago is a similar distance, and takes 18 to 19 hours on Amtrak, which must share tracks with 12,000-ton freight trains and many commuter trains.
 For the American market, Mr. Zheng said, ''we can provide whatever services are needed.''

HEADLINE: Fed Reviews Find Errors In Oversight Of Citigroup

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ERIC DASH; Sewell Chan reported from Washington and Eric Dash from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Citigroup ran into trouble under the noses of federal regulators. But even after taxpayers rescued the financial giant, regulators failed to monitor the company adequately, according to reviews by the Federal Reserve. 
 Excerpts of two Fed reviews were released on Wednesday as the committee examining the causes of the financial crisis began three days of hearings on the problems at Citigroup, Fannie Mae and the subprime mortgage market.
 The panel heard a strong defense of the Fed from its former chairman, Alan Greenspan, who fended off a barrage of questions about the Fed's failure to crack down on subprime mortgages and other abusive lending practices during his tenure. 
 But the excerpts, culled from thousands of documents turned over to the bipartisan Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, painted a troubling picture of the Fed's oversight of Citigroup both before and after Mr. Greenspan left the Fed -- and again after Citigroup received three taxpayer-financed bailouts. 
 The most recent documents from 2009 portray bank examiners from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then headed by Timothy F. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary, as overly optimistic about Citigroup's prospects, according to a person briefed on their contents. 
 They also suggest that the Fed examiners failed to move swiftly as Citigroup's financial condition deteriorated, according to this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize the commission's inquiry. 
 Together, the excerpts suggested that oversight of Citigroup was inadequate as far back as 2005 and remained so as recently as late December. 
 ''Although the dedicated supervisory team is well-qualified and generally has sound knowledge of the organization, there have been significant weaknesses in the execution of the supervisory program,'' according to one excerpt of the 2009 review.
 The report, characterized as a preliminary working paper, has not been approved by the Federal Reserve Board or the New York Fed. Even so, it underscores the challenges of overhauling banking supervision and regulation as Ben S. Bernanke, the current Fed chairman, has vowed to do, and comes as many in Congress are pushing to give the Fed even more responsibility for overseeing big financial companies. 
 William C. Dudley, who succeeded Mr. Geithner as president of the New York Fed, acknowledged Wednesday that the Fed could have done a better job. 
 ''I think there's no question that the Federal Reserve and a lot of the other regulators could have done much better,'' Mr. Dudley said during a presentation at the New York Economic Club. 
 Mr. Geithner, who as president of the New York Fed from 2003 to 2008 was in charge of overseeing Citigroup, has not yet been interviewed by the panel's investigators but most likely will be called for questioning.
 According to the Fed reviews, the New York Fed failed to keep a close enough eye on Citigroup for years. A 2005 review found that the New York Fed had neither the time nor the staffing to supervise Citigroup adequately, according to the person briefed on the review. The Fed currently has about 30 examiners assigned to Citigroup, the most among major banks. That is up from about 20 in 2006.
 In his testimony Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan adamantly denied that the New York Fed had inadequate resources. 
 ''The president of the Fed bank would have been on the phone immediately with me and complained,'' Mr. Greenspan said. ''I find this notion of inadequacy not verifiable.''
 The eight-hour hearings also featured a former Citigroup mortgage lending officer, Richard Bowen III, who testified that he had alerted his bosses to ''breakdowns in processes and internal controls.'' 
 From 2006 to 2007, Mr. Bowen said that decisions on poorly underwritten loans were changed from ''turned down'' to ''approved,'' and that as many as 80 percent of the loans that Citigroup sold to Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and other investors were defective. 
 After several attempts to correct the problems, he sent a detailed e-mail memorandum to Robert E. Rubin, an influential Citigroup executive and board member, and several other high-ranking officers. 
 Under relatively friendly questioning, Mr. Bowen said that a Citi lawyer contacted him a few days after he sent the e-mail message, but did not hold an in-depth discussion with him until January 2008. He left the company after a leave of absence -- a point that panel members did not ask him to publicly elaborate on. 
 Without specifying a timetable, a Citigroup spokeswoman said the issues raised by Mr. Bowen were promptly and carefully reviewed when he raised them and corrective actions were taken.
 But much of the morning was devoted to Mr. Greenspan, who briefly testified in the dark after the lights went off. Staff members opened the curtains. 
 A particularly sharp exchange occurred between Mr. Greenspan and Brooksley E. Born, a panelist and former regulator who clashed with Mr. Greenspan and members of the Clinton administration over derivatives regulation -- and lost that battle. In tough questioning on Wednesday, Ms. Born called on Mr. Greenspan to defend his longtime deregulatory bent. 
 ''The Fed utterly failed to prevent the financial crisis,'' she said. ''The Fed and the banking regulators failed to prevent the housing bubble. They failed to prevent the predatory lending scandal. They failed to prevent our biggest banks and bank holding companies from engaging in activities that would bring them to the verge of collapse without massive taxpayer bailouts.''
 ''Didn't the Federal Reserve fail to meet its mandates, fail to meet it responsibilities?'' she added. 
 Mr. Greenspan replied that there was a failure: an underestimation of the ''state and extent'' of financial risks and the ability of private counterparties to assess them.
 ''The notion that somehow my views on regulation were predominant and effective at influencing the Congress is something you may have perceived,'' he said. ''But it didn't look that way from my point of view.''

HEADLINE: Ways to Honor Those Who Served

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Turning Our Backs on Heroes,'' by Bob Herbert (column, April 6):
 As a combat veteran who served with the 101st Airborne in Vietnam, I often wonder how many Americans really understand exactly what support for our veterans involves.
 Many think that it is putting a yellow ribbon on their vehicle, while at the same time supporting conservative political candidates who have cut taxes and bankrupted our country at the expense of our wounded veterans. 
 Dennet Oregon, the soldier Mr. Herbert writes about, is a double amputee and deserves to have his every need taken care of.
 As an American, I am willing to pay the necessary taxes to pay for these costs. I urge others to follow suit and skip the yellow-ribbon decals.
 John Georgiton Columbus, Ohio, April 6, 2010
 To the Editor:
 At the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, we wholeheartedly agree that much more needs to be done to care for our severely wounded troops. They have given their arms, legs and sometimes even their memories for the lives and human rights of people in Baghdad, Kabul and elsewhere.
 These brave heroes deserve the best, most advanced medical care to treat their injuries, whether visible (amputations and burns) or invisible (post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries).
 But the federal government cannot, and should not, do it alone. That is why, with generous donations from millions of concerned Americans and from people in places like Kuwait, too, we have built state-of-the-art rehabilitation facilities, like the Center for the Intrepid, adjacent to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Tex. In June, we will open the National Intrepid Center of Excellence at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.
 It is also why so many other organizations are getting the support they need to help our troops.
 Thank you for raising this critically important issue at a time when our troops and their families will need us the most. We owe them our freedom. It's as simple as that.
 Bill White President Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund New York, April 6, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I was grateful for Bob Herbert's column about disabled veterans and their extraordinary sacrifices. It reminded me of a different sacrifice -- the sacrifice of conscience and responsibility that we made as a country with adoption of an all-volunteer Army in 1973.
 If there were still a universal draft, if foreign policy had consequences that reached into every home, would we have blundered our way into war in Iraq and allowed a second war to distract us from finishing the first?
 How would the money saved in military expenditures and health care costs for our veterans have affected our deficit and recession?
 In 1973 I was pregnant. I didn't realize that the sacrifices from which my children were spared would fall on my working-class and immigrant students. I never dreamed that this personal boon would not only extend the inequities of our society, but would also alter our foreign policy decision-making process, with enormous consequences.
 When we moved foreign policy from the high stakes of ''shared sacrifice'' to the low stakes of ''sacrifice'' by those who ''volunteer,'' we destabilized more than the lives of our ''volunteers.''
 Lea W. Fridman Brooklyn, April 6, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As someone who is working at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, I agree with Bob Herbert that there is ''a strong tendency, in our national consciousness, to give short shrift'' to today's veterans. I believe that this is likely a collective condition that affects all countries when dealing with wounded warriors.
 I am proud to work with what Mr. Herbert called the ''extraordinarily talented and dedicated staff'' at Walter Reed. Yet I fear for what will become of our veterans after their discharge. This is the point at which Americans need to provide the support that our veterans are going to need for the rest of their lives.

HEADLINE: For Crisis Panel, the Creativity Is Verbal Instead of Financial

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 BILL THOMAS, the vice chairman of the panel investigating the causes of the financial crisis, dumbfounded the crowd that filled a House hearing room on Thursday. 
 A new revelation of lending fraud? Excessive risk-taking? Jaw-dropping executive pay? 
 No. Mr. Thomas had just compared complex mortgage bonds to a piece of cowhide. 
 Blaming subprime lending on fragmented regulation, he said, was like ''listening to someone blame the inferior quality of leather in a pair of shoes based on the feed that some person supplied to a feedlot feeding the cattle that produced the leather.'' 
 It was not the only head-scratching metaphor from Mr. Thomas, whose arch humor, dripping sarcasm and fierce mien have become commonplace at the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission's hearings.
 The panel, which began its second round of hearings on Wednesday, must deliver a report by Dec. 15 on the origins of a crisis that has left many Americans jobless, bankrupt or homeless. And its hearings this week, focused on subprime lending and mortgage securitization, have been mind-numbingly technical. 
 But injected into somber discussions of liquidity puts, off-balance-sheet entities, cyclically adjusted capital requirements and super-senior collateralized debt obligations have been unexpected doses of dark humor.
 Mr. Thomas, a California Republican who served 28 years in the House, has been particularly inventive in using analogies to explain aspects of a crisis that remains confusing to most people outside the world of structured finance.
 ''What made you walk away?'' he asked Richard Bowen III, a mortgage lending officer who left Citigroup after blowing the whistle on lax underwriting practices, on Wednesday. ''Was it kind of like the cannibals, where they start with the cold water in the pot and then it started getting a little hotter and then eventually you realized the circumstances you were in?''
 Minutes later, Mr. Thomas told Mr. Bowen approvingly: ''Your analysis of what was going on was akin to the fellow in the field who calls an air strike on his location because his position is being overrun.''
 Mr. Thomas, 68, was chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee when he retired in 2007 after the Democrats took control of Congress. 
 There, he was known for a hair-trigger temper -- he once summoned the Capitol police to deal with Democrats who tried to walk out of a committee meeting -- and an impatience with fools, a category he defined broadly.
 On Wednesday, he interrupted one witness, Richard Bitner, who had compared subprime mortgages to low-quality ''widgets.''
 ''Hey, can you sell them?'' Mr. Thomas asked. 
 Mr. Bitner: ''What's that?'' 
 Mr. Thomas: ''Can you sell them?'' 
 Mr. Bitner: ''Well, yes, we can sell.''
 Mr. Thomas: ''So you feel guilty about the decreased quality of the widgets?'' 
 Mr. Bitner gave up. ''Let me get out of the widget example,'' he said. ''Let's go back to the mortgage example.'' 
 With Susan Mills, a mortgage finance executive at Citigroup, Mr. Thomas was equally curt. ''If you sell a baby blanket, you're supposed to make sure that it doesn't burn easily,'' he told her. 
 Mr. Thomas has used the hearings to channel the widespread public outrage over the disconnect between the rewards Wall Street reaped while the economy teetered. 
 At one point, he seized on the widely cited notion that mortgage lenders had no ''skin in the game'' when they made questionable loans because they were able to sell the loans quickly to banks.
 ''Everyone uses 'skin in the game' as a euphemism,'' Mr. Thomas told Patricia Lindsay, a former executive of the New Century Financial Corporation, a failed lender. ''I'm beginning to think more and more, if it wasn't a euphemism it would be even better.'' 
 Other commission members have used analogies and jokes to clarify things for themselves and for the public.
 One member, Byron S. Georgiou, a Democratic lawyer from Nevada, likened the packaging and sale of shoddy mortgage-backed securities to ''medieval alchemy'' on Wednesday. And on Thursday, he told two former Citigroup executives who blamed outside forces for the bank's woes that they appeared to be hallucinating. 
 Another commissioner, Heather H. Murren, a retired equity analyst at Merrill Lynch who has used her financial expertise to ask probing questions of several witnesses, drew laughter during an exchange on Wednesday. 
 When a former Citigroup executive, Thomas G. Maheras, said the bank ''had the largest risk management structure in the business,'' Ms. Murren interjected, ''Um, bigger isn't better.'' 
 At times, the witnesses have unwittingly provided fodder for verbal jabs from the commission.
 Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, said Wednesday of his two-decade career in government: ''I was right 70 percent of the time, but I was wrong 30 percent of the time. And there were an awful lot of mistakes in 21 years.'' 
 That prompted Phil Angelides, the commission's chairman, to say Thursday that he would consider himself a success if he was right just 51 percent of the time. ''I don't aspire to reach what Mr. Greenspan thinks he has reached,'' he said, in a sardonic tone.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the oral antics in a hearing by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission misidentified the witness to whom the panel's vice chairman, Bill Thomas, directed the question ''What made you walk away?'' The witness was Richard Bitner, a former subprime lender -- not Richard Bowen III, a former Citigroup mortgage lending officer.
