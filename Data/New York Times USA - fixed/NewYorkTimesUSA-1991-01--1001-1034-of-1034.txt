HEADLINE: Net Declines 3% at Du Pont

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 30

 BODY:
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company reported today that its fourth-quarter net income fell 3 percent, as the company's petroleum business helped offset weak results in other segments.
The chemical giant said its net income was $468 million, or 69 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $483 million, or 71 cents a share, in the comparable quarter of 1989.
Its revenues for the quarter were up 23.4 percent, at $11.1 billion, compared with $8.99 billion in 1989.
Du Pont said the slowdown in the economy affected its fibers and industrial products businesses. But the effect was offset by improvements in the performance of the company's petroleum business.
For the year, Du Pont reported net income of $2.31 billion, down nearly 7 percent from $2.48 billion, or $3.53 a share, the previous year.

HEADLINE: Contributions To Neediest Hit $4 Million

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
With contributions still coming in, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund yesterday passed the $4 million mark, an amount that many charity officials had said would be difficult to raise amid concerns of recession, layoffs and a municipal fiscal crisis.
Instead, the economic hard times have inspired thousands of New Yorkers to dig deeper into their pockets and offer help to the city's impoverished and destitute. Many are giving to the fund for the first time, while others who have contributed for years have given larger gifts than ever before. 
 With today's total of $4,037,728.36, this year's drive -- the 79th annual appeal -- becomes only the third campaign in the fund's history to surpass $4 million. No previous drive has ever made it to this figure before February, and today's total is $127,209.57 ahead of the amount raised last year at this time.
If the campaign collects a little more than $300,000 before it closes in five weeks, the fund will break last year's final tally -- a record $4.3 million -- and will be the sixth consecutive one in which the campaign has recorded an increase.
 
'Unexpectedly Encouraging'
 "Today's fund report is unexpectedly encouraging," said Arthur Gelb, the president of the New York Times Company Foundation which administers the fund. "In these troubled times, we never anticipated being $100,000 ahead of last year on this date, and there had been considerable doubt about whether the fund would reach the $4 million mark."
"Now we can only hope that the continuing generosity of New Yorkers will enable us to do even better than last year's record before the drive ends on Feb. 28," he said.
Proceeds from the Neediest Cases drive are distributed to seven charities to help the sick and poor. Over the years, money from the fund has provided thousands of people with food, shelter, clothing, counseling and job training.
More than 12,400 people and organizations have contributed to this year's appeal, and for many, the gift was a direct response to the poverty they see around them in the streets of New York.
"I have been fortunate this year through my job to travel all around the world," wrote Leslie Lane of Manhattan. "Invariably, when I return home, I am pained to see the suffering of the homeless on our streets -- especially since New York has as much, if not more to offer than any other city that I've visited." She sent $500 to the fund to help the homeless.
 
'Growing Chasm'
 A gift of $100 from Peggy Straus -- her eighth consecutive donation -- came with a letter that remarked on the "growing chasm between the well-to-do and the poor." She wrote, "As I see the poor and homeless begging on the subway platforms or on the streets, I feel badly that there is so little I can do that can truly make a difference in so many people's lives."
Another donor, Jessica Schneerbaum of the Bronx, wrote to the fund about two homeless men who have placed their bedrolls and a television set at the train station near her home. "We joke around, and I always wish I could take them with me," her letter said. "I feel I would hurt their pride by giving them anything directly as they never once asked.
"But when I get off the train late at night and see them sleeping under a flimsy blanket, I hope they won't see me," she wrote. "I don't want them to be embarrassed by being seen by a friend when they are in such a terrible position."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Closes Mixed; Gold Prices Decline Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended the day mixed against major currencies yesterday, after staging a moderate early advance amid signs that the Persian Gulf conflict was shifting from an air to a ground war. But the currency meandered lower then as the market's recent numbness to war events once again crept in.
Gold fell sharply, largely on technical factors. The spot February contract declined by $7.60 an ounce, to $368.80, on New York's Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $368.75, down $8 from late Tuesday.
Currency analysts said traders sought the dollar's safety after news that Iraqi tank soldiers had mounted the first major ground assault of the two-week-old war.
Iraq's attack on the frontier port of Khafji, Saudi Arabia, took the lives of 12 United States marines, the first allied ground soldiers to die in combat in the war, American military officials said.
But "as it became clear that it wasn't a full-scale ground war, just a limited attack in which the United States came out pretty well, everything pretty much reversed," said Greg Jones, a market analyst for MMS International.
 
Confusing Messages
 Traders were mixed on whether the dollar's earlier upward move was linked to the release of the Government's index of leading economic indicators, which exceeded some expectations but was just one of several reports this week that combined to deliver a confusing message about the economy's direction.
In the report yesterday, the Government's chief economic forecasting gauge inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in December, its first gain in six months.
Jack Barbanel, managing director of First Global Asset Management, said the market viewed the relatively positive news as a sign that the Federal Reserve would be less likely to ease interest rates, a move that tends to erode the dollar's value.
"Originally, we expected the numbers to be a little bit weaker," he said. "Now there are some underpinnings for the dollar."
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 131.70 Japanese yen, from 131.20 on Tuesday. Later in London, it fell to 131.60 yen, and then dropped to 131.10 yen in New York, down from 132.15 late Tuesday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.9600, from $1.9700 late Tuesday. In New York, sterling rose to $1.9630 from $1.9585.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates on Tuesday, were: 1.4880 German marks, down from 1.4966; 1.2625 Swiss francs, down from 1.2675; 5.0490 French francs, down from 5.0790; 1,115.50 Italian lire, down from 1,122.75, and 1.1604 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1611.

HEADLINE: Officials Weigh 'Credit Crunch'

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Senior banking regulators met today with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to work on proposals to ease what is widely seen as a "credit crunch."
The meeting took place a day after President Bush, in his State of the Union address, exhorted banks not to tighten their lending standards and called for lower interest rates.
Senior Treasury officials and regulators are to meet with a group of leading bankers on Thursday to discuss the problems facing the industry and the Federal program that protects bank deposits.
Those who met with Mr. Brady included Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve; L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, and T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.
While no new specific initiatives came out of today's discussions, officials said they could ultimately lead to changes in accounting and regulatory requirements.
Officials at the meeting said the main issues discussed were appraisals, valuing nonperforming bank assets and insuring adequate diversity of bank portfolios.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: BAGHDAD;
Excerpts From Saddam Hussein's Comments on the Gulf War

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from remarks by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in an interview Monday with Peter Arnett, Cable News Network correspondent in Baghdad. The interview was broadcast by CNN Tuesday night. The excerpts were provided to Reuters by News Transcripts Inc.
 What we say is that light comes through the dark, penetrates the dark. As much as -- whenever the American Administration expects that it is filling Baghdad or covering Baghdad with darkness, then the American Administration will face the light that exists, that fills the breasts of the Iraqi people, the light, which is based on deep conviction in God, the one and only. What is important to us is that the darkness which the American Administration wants to see penetrate to the brains, to the minds, to the hearts, to the conscience of the people, is a darkness that has no place in the people -- amongst the people of Iraq.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	 
 But as regards your question . . . Have they really won the first round? Or have they in fact -- all they have reaped is shame from the very moment they decided to launch their aggression.
You see, in fact, they were defeated, they were dealt a defeat the moment they signed the decision to launch the aggression, because they have signed a wrong, an unjust decision.
. . . Because victory and winning is not just in winning one particular or single battle or losing that one. But winning, in gaining the satisfaction, the pleasure of God, the one and only, and in winning the hearts of the people, first gaining the satisfaction of God the one and only, and secondly, winning the hearts of the people.
The pleasure of God, the blessings of God, and have they gained or won the hearts of the people? This is the criteria which we adopt, we at least adopt.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
On the War
 The most important thing is that our people now -- our people now has never been -- has never been as pure in its soul as it is now and throughout its history, and our armed forces have never been determined as they are now, throughout the history, and throughout the difficult circumstances in which -- through the difficult situations with which they have dealt.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
Planes Fleeing to Iran
 The important thing is that Iraq and Iran are two neighboring Muslim countries. And regardless of the circumstances of the past, these -- these facts shall remain the most important in the relationship between the two countries. . . .
And it is only natural that if -- it was only natural that if a certain [inaudible] Iraqi aircraft found it under certain circumstances necessary that it should go down in a neighboring country's airport, an Islamic country, in this particular Islamic country or the other, then this could happen in the light of this spirit and in the light of this picture.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
Oil Spill in Gulf
 The facts that cannot be denied, the facts that have not been denied by Western media, are that there were Iraqi tankers loaded with crude oil, and they were attacked and sunk by the American forces. And -- and the fact that the United States has not denied that they have attacked these tankers, and they knew these tankers were loaded with oil. And in addition to this fact, there is the other fact, which is that the United States armed forces have attacked oil installations which they themselves have not denied have done.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	But when the Iraqis, if the Iraqis were to use oil for self-defense, including the use of oil in waters, then the Iraqis shall be justified for taking such an action. And it is certain that the future will show which part -- what action for which the United States is responsible, and what action for which Iraq is responsible.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
The Kuwaiti Front
 You, I do not -- I do not want to insult anybody here. But this is the word that one has to use. This is what we find in the dictionary, whoever -- a liar is a man who doesn't tell the truth. The fact is that the Iraqi Army is there in Kuwait. And I'm sure that you as Americans can imagine that the offensive will be launched against the armed forces.
Where did it start on the night of the 16th -- on the night of the 17th? No attack was launched against armed forces in our 19th province. But he started his attack against Baghdad. And not against the military forces, but against our (inaudible) installations and economic installations. . . . Didn't you -- hasn't it become certain to you now that the battle that is started now is not really for Kuwait, it's not a battle over Kuwait, but for other reasons?

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	And we also said do not delude yourselves into believing that once the war started then it would be -- it would end in a matter of hours or days or weeks. It wouldn't be a war of weeks.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	Do you remember what the Western leaders including President Bush were saying? They were saying that they would enter this war without a single American getting wounded. Has this been the case? We're only at the very outset of the war, only 10 days. Is it true that no Americans have been wounded? So what would happen if war were to expand or to begin taking its more comprehensive form?

 	 	 		.. 	 		 	 	I shall tell you that the problem here and now is not one of who has more weaponry or more weapons. In order to decide who will lose and who will win, it's based on who has the devil on his side and who has God on his side.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	But if I were to take you around our antiaircraft men that you would see that each one will be proud for what he has done in the defense of Iraq and in defense of the values in which he believes.
In some situations the vultures were coming like rain. Our antiaircraft men were showered with bombs on occasion. But they never relinquished their guns. They never left their places, especially on the early days of fighting, first and second and third and fourth.
Through these pictures you could rest -- you could rest assured about the answer as to how the result of the outcome of the confrontation on land is going to be. That is if the forces in question were to launch an offensive against our faithful men in the 19th province.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
Foreign Hostages
 Do you remember what we said about keeping the foreign guests in this country, that it was being done in order to prevent war, and that if we were to keep them there, it may prevent war? What the hypocritical politicians, or the hypocrites of politics in the West said at the time -- they said that keeping the foreign guests here would in fact itself lead to the war, will cause the war to happen, but letting them go will prevent war from happening.
Now this is past us, this is beyond us. We never repent any decision which we take and we have not repented taking the decision to let the foreigners go.
But if -- but had we kept those 5,000 individuals from the West and from Japan here, would Bush still have attacked Baghdad? When we decided to allow the foreigners, Western foreigners, to leave, we were not afraid of any action or any decision being taken against us.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
Chemical Warfare
 What I said was that we shall use the weapons that shall equate the weapons that are used against us. We shall use the weapons that shall be equitable to the weapons used against us. But in any case, and under any circumstance, we shall never relinquish Iraq.

 	 	 		. . 	 		 	 	
 
On the Israelis
 All of the force that is now being used against Baghdad, that is now attacking Baghdad, is Israel. What interest would you as an American have to come to attack Baghdad unless it is the Zionist influence that has played its role in the corridors of the U.S. Administration and led to this attack, to this aggression being waged? . . .
This war that is being waged against us is a Zionist war. Only here, Zionism is fighting us through American blood, through your blood. And if Zionism is not using now some of its weapons, then the Zionists want to keep these weapons in order to be master of the situation, in order to be the dominant power in the area once the war has come to an end.
Zionism is fighting us. And had it not been for the Zionist influence, you would not have come here to occupy the land of our sanctity, the land of the tomb of Mohammed, and the land of the Muslims everywhere and to commit this aggression against Iraq and against Baghdad.

HEADLINE: Deficit at U.S. Credit Union

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The financial crisis that has plagued many of the nation's savings institutions has hit home. The credit union used by Government employees and former officials who regulate the nation's savings and loans has been insolvent since 1989, its president said today.
"It is an embarrassment," said James Deemer, president of the credit union and comptroller of the Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises the nation's 2,300 savings associations. "We had hoped nobody would find out about it." 
 The condition of the credit union was publicly disclosed in an article in the latest issue of National Mortgage News, a weekly trade publication.
"We made too many bad loans, basically car loans and personal loans," Mr. Deemer said. "At the same time, we had extra cash that was not being lent out."
Mr. Deemer said that the credit union reported its difficulties in 1989 to the National Credit Union Administration, the Federal agency that regulates credit unions and insures their deposits. At the time, the credit union was facing a deficit of $118,000.
He said a two-year plan to reduce the deficit had cut the figure to $19,800. The plan eliminated certain benefits and substantially cut costs.
The credit union has 2,000 members and has reported $4.1 million in assets.

HEADLINE: Once Blackballed, Romania Joins the Aid Club

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Western industrialized nations agreed today to bring Romania into an economic aid program set up more than a year ago to help the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
Until today, Romania's participation in the program had been blocked because of the Government's violent repression of protesters in June. 
 But officials of the 24 nations at the meeting, including the United States and Japan, voiced no objections to extending the aid to the Romanian Government, spokesmen for the European Community said.Romania's membership in the effort will not be officially announced until written conclusions are issued by the meeting, the spokesmen said.
A delegation from the Bucharest Government joined representatives from Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, who outlined the states of their nations' economies.
Officials of the Western nations meet periodically to coordinate efforts to help the new democracies in Central and Eastern Europe. The European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc, runs the program.
There was no word on how muchmoney might now go to Romania, but the other countries have been offered considerable sums in food, economic, environmental, technical, vocational and other aid.
Frans Andriessen, the top foreign affairs official of the European Community, said Western nations have pledged a total of $38 billion in assistance.
He called on the Western nations to reaffirm their commitment to the new democracies. Mr. Andriessen also said the Western nations intended to help ease financial hardships those countries might suffer from the Persian Gulf crisis."There can be no question of allowing external shocks or uncertainties to jeopardize prospects for reform in Central and Eastern Europe," he said.
 
Hurt by Oil Prices
 "Countries which have been courageous enough to introduce bold reforms in a highly uncertain international climate deserve the full support of the community and of all the industrialized countries," he said.
The East European countries, like other oil-consuming nations, have been hard hit by the surge in crude oil prices caused by worries about the conflict. Moreover, the Soviet Union, the world's largest crude producer, has begun demanding that its former allies pay oil bills in dollars and other hard currencies.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From an Interview With the Fed's Chairman

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board:
Q. Other than lowering interest rates, what weapons do you have in your arsenal to increase the money supply?
A. Well, obviously we have reserve requirements. . . . I did mention that we were looking at other areas of action to get at the credit crunch, but if we were to resolve the credit crunch, in part it would flow through into the money supply.
Q. What about more liberal accounting rules, say on real estate?
A. Well, I don't want to get into that until we've got some specific policies. There are lots of different things that we can do, but I've become convinced that the vast majority of them are infeasible. But some of them may not be. Some of them may be useful and what I'm getting at is it's the credit crunch that we're focusing on. The money supply is symptomatic of the credit crunch. So it's more important that we resolve the credit crunch than the messenger of the credit crunch.
Q. How severe has that crunch been?
A. It's been as severe as any supply-induced constraint ever, other than from policy actions.
Q. You said that there was some slight evidence that the credit crunch was beginning to ease?
A. There is evidence that the better-capitalized banks are increasing their market share relative to those banks which are less well capitalized.
Q. And what's the implication of that?
A. What you need to get the credit crunch unwound is to change the attitudes of those who are concerned about their capital position and have them return to extending loans to their credit-rated customers. If they begin to lose those customers to competitors, which in this case would be the more well-capitalized banks, some banks will then under those conditions begin to start to be more willing to lend to customers.
Q. When will you know?
A. What I've been getting at is that what we know at this stage is the beginning of that process has begun but we don't yet see any evidence of that lending from the less-well-capitalized banks.
Q. How sensitive is the problem to lower interest rates? Would another point on the Fed funds rate encourage those less capitalized banks and make them move?
A. Well, it's obvious that any incentives you can give -- which means in effect opening up profit margins to the banks -- will clearly induce those at the margin who have been disinclined but just barely disinclined to start to lend.
Q. In retrospect, should you have acted sooner to deal with the credit crunch?
A. No. Because if the credit crunch had lasted for six months, its implications on the economy would probably have been very marginal. It is the cumulative effect of the credit crunch that I find increasingly disturbing.
Q. And you didn't think that would happen?
A. Well, no, I didn't. Looking back, I'm not sure that there's very much different that I would have thought personally to do.
Q. The Fed in general and you in particular were getting credit politically for a long time when it looked as if we were going to have a soft landing. Now that it turns out that the landing is a little rockier, why shouldn't you also get the blame?
A. First of all, if you're asking me whether or not that I thought without the Middle East that whether we would have gotten the soft landing. In July, I would have said yes, 50-50, maybe, most probable that we would have gotten a soft landing. The data that we got in for the months of August and September in retrospect, at least as best I can judge it, increased those probabilities. In other words, we knew actually what happened.
Q. Do you mean it increased the probability that you would not have had a recession?
A. Correct.
Q. What is the implication of the fact that so much lending now is going on outside of banks -- in commercial paper, for example? Does it mean the Fed has less influence over macroeconomic policy?
A. No. It does mean, however, that the trend towards the loss of competitive franchises in the commercial banking system has been going on now for quite a number of years. It still exists. There are increasing alternate means, as a result of technology, which can bypass commercial banking to get financing. . . .
So long as we have a monopoly on a major form of asset in the system, claims against the Federal Reserve banks, it is a sufficiently large instrument that we can affect interest rates.
Q. Is there some business that the banks could get into that would really help pay the rent? Wall Street is having enough problems making money in its own lines of endeavor.
A. The time you want to expand powers is when businesses which they might go into are not operating all that well. Because the real dangers to banks is that if you give them powers at a time when the new business in which they go are flourishing, you actually create possibilities that they may overextend themselves. If they succeed in a cautious environment which is weak, they're going to be non-risk-takers. That's what you want as they phase their way into the business.
Q. If everything goes as you expect and hope, would you guess that the recovery would be a strong recovery?
A. I think that it would be moderate. It depends where it starts from. We don't have that much slack in the economy as of now. If the economy slips further, and that of course is not to be ruled out, then the nature of the recovery will be more vigorous. But you cannot have a vigorous recovery from a shallow decline.
Q. And the banks will have to get over their own crisis of confidence in order to have a recovery?
A. Yes, I would say that is a necessary condition.
Q. Would the banking system be better off with a real thorough round of consolidation in one way or another?
A. I would think that there are a number of institutions which probably would be better off if they merged, and there's no question in my mind that some significant, real cost in savings would occur under those conditions. That is talking about individual institutions. But as far as the system as a whole, the basic issue is that we've got a large number of community banks out there who do very well, and they serve their communities in an exceptionally effective manner. When we know that is when big banks try to come in and take their business away, they fail. So, unless you're going to argue that a lot of those community banking institutions are somehow not serving your community or are unprofitable or unsafe and unsound, none of which one can argue, you can't just merely make a generic statement that we should collapse the number of banks. It is true that we should in certain areas and certain individual institutions.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Warns of a Deep Recession if War Lasts

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, says the nation could face a long and deep recession if the war with Iraq lasts past the middle of April.
In an interview in his office late Tuesday, Mr. Greenspan said he expected a rapid rebound from the current recession if the war is "relatively short" and oilfields are not seriously damaged. 
 "But if you get beyond three months," he continued, "you begin to risk consumer confidence erosion, and that would abort any meaningful recovery."
 
More Pessimistic Than Before
 This is a more pessimistic stance than the one he took before Congress last week, when he suggested that the economic consequences of the war would probably be slight. He also repeated his view that the Fed might need to take steps soon to make banks more willing to lend money to credit-worthy customers.
The economy today is in "the most confidence-sensitive cycle I've seen in decades," the chairman said in the interview. "The risks that confidence will not come back sufficiently adequately to bring the economy out of its recession is regrettably higher than I would like." [Excerpts from the interview, page D6.]
The Federal Reserve has more influence over the economy than any other part of the Government, and Mr. Greenspan is personally in the hot seat. His four-year term as chairman expires in August. Many economists and politicians say he waited too long last year to deal with the slowdown and is thus partly to blame for the recession. He is also responsible for trying to bolster a fragile banking system.
He is so close to the Bush Administration that he is almost a part of it. President Bush announced in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night that he was appointing Mr. Greenspan, a strong supporter of a lower capital gains tax, to head a commission to sort out the technical differences that separate the President and Congress on the issue.
But the Fed chairman is also increasingly under attack from the Administration. In a barely veiled blast at Fed policy on interest rates, President Bush said in his address, "Interest rates should be lower -- now."
Answering questions a few hours before the President's speech, Mr. Greenspan refused to discuss what steps the Fed would take to deal with the recession and strengthen the banks, and he declined to say whether he wanted to be reappointed to another term. But in the course of an hour, he made these points:
*Even in hindsight, he sees no policies the Fed could have followed that would have averted recession.
*He is paying close attention these days to the money supply, not so much as a gauge of the overall economy but because it is the best measure of the severity of what he repeatedly called the "credit crunch."
*This is a good time to permit commercial banks to enter other lines of business, like the underwriting of corporate securities, because those businesses are weak now and banks would be especially careful about their investments.
*The law should be changed to allow banks to collect interest on the money they must hold as reserves.
*United States exports are much more sensitive to economic conditions in this country's trading partners than they are to the value of the dollar.
The length and severity of the recession, Mr. Greenspan said, depends almost entirely on what happens in the Persian Gulf and whether banks can be induced to lend money more freely. Mr. Greenspan seemed to be saying that President Bush did not threaten the economy by going to war in the first place but that the economy might be damaged if the war lasted so long that people became uneasy about the prospects.
He said the optimistic assessment he gave Congress last week, when he said that the worst might be over and that he expected the recovery to begin no later than summer, was based in large part on the assumption that the war would be short.
 
Consumer Confidence
 "Unless new forces of weakness re-emerge," Mr. Greenspan said, "then the initial negative force -- the sharp drop in consumer confidence that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait -- may be beginning to wane."
But he said he was "listening with one ear" to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's repeated warnings against overconfidence and was concerned that the economy could suffer from a longer war. Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Cheney worked in the White House together in the Ford Administration and are personally close.
Mr. Greenspan took issue with economists who say the Fed made a mistake by not lowering interest rates in the first half of last year when the economy was quite weak.
The economic data for last year, he said, indicate that the odds are better than even that the country would not have tipped into a recession had it not ben for the Iraqi invasion, an event he could not have anticipated.
 
No Workable Policy
 "Looking back now," he said, "it's not clear to me that there was a monetary policy that would have significantly altered the sharp change in consumer psychology" and the effects of the steep rise in oil prices, the twin forces he says are most responsible for the recession. "I don't know of any policy action that could have been taken at that time."
The one misjudgment he might have made, he indicated, was that he did not recognize how long banks would maintain tight lending policies. Bank lending gives consumers and businesses more money to spend and thus generates economic growth.
"If the credit crunch had lasted for six months, its implications on the economy would probably have been very marginal," he said. "The cumulative effect of the credit crunch is what I find increasingly disturbing."
He repeated his statement to the House Budget Committee last week that if the credit situation did not improve, the Fed would take new policy actions to encourage banks to lend more freely. The possibilities, he suggested, included reducing interest rates, reducing the portion of deposits banks must hold in reserve and changing the way real estate loans are reflected in banks' balance sheets. He ruled out the possibility of reducing the amount of investor capital banks must hold as a cushion against losses.
 
Banks' Market Shares
 The Fed chairman said the first signal that the credit crunch might be easing was that the "better capitalized banks are increasing their market share relative to those banks that are less well capitalized."
That implies, he said, that weaker banks must expand their lending or lose customers. He conceded that he had no evidence that such lending was under way.
Mr. Greenspan said that since early fall, the money supply, basically the sum of all currency, bank deposits and money-market accounts, has grown much more slowly than the Federal Reserve's target of at least 3 percent annually.
"It's the credit crunch that we're focusing on," he said. "The money supply is symptomatic. It's more important that we resolve the credit crunch than the messenger of the credit crunch."
 
Disappointed Monetarists
 That statement is bound to be disappointing to the school of economists who call themselves monetarists. They hold that the money supply is the best measurement of the way the overall economy is performing and that steady growth of the money supply will assure a strong economy. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, this was the dominant view of the Federal Reserve, but Mr. Greenspan's statement that the money supply is merely a symptom suggests that the Fed is not returning to the monetarist view.
Mr. Greenspan was more optimistic about the strength of the banking system than are some economists. For example, Benjamin M. Friedman, a prominent professor of economics at Harvard, said at a Congressional hearing last week that he saw a 10 percent or 20 percent chance that the fragility of the banks could lead to tragic consequences for the economy.
Mr. Greenspan took issue with that position. "While there is still a degree of fragility, which in fact was the cause of the credit crunch, I think that we're gradually working our way out of this," he said.
He supported the Bush Administration's view that laws should be changed so that commercial banks could enter new lines of business from which they are now barred like underwriting bonds and trading stock. The Administration is soon expected to propose such a change as part of a larger package of banking legislation. This is a perfect time to let banks get into other business, Mr. Greenspan said.
"If you give them powers at a time when the new business in which they go are flourishing, you actually create possibilities that they may overextend themselves," he said. "In a cautious environment which is weak, they're going to be non-risk takers."
One way to help banks, he suggested, would be to change another law and permit them to invest their required reserves in interest-bearing Government securities. Now, banks are required to hold reserves in cash or in accounts at regional Federal Reserve banks that do not pay interest.

HEADLINE: Congress Predicting $298 Billion Deficit, Reaching a Record

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office predicted today that the Federal budget deficit would reach $298 billion this year, $77 billion more than the highest deficit ever recorded by the Government.
The estimate meant that the Congressional agency and the Bush Administration were in agreement that this year's deficit would set a record. The White House Office of Management and Budget recently estimated that the deficit would be $318 billion. 
 Robert D. Reischauer, director of the budget office, presented his estimate at a hearing of the House Budget Committee. The estimate does not include the costs of the war in the Persian Gulf, which are sure to drive the deficit even higher.
Mr. Reischauer said that under current law, Federal spending would total $1.4 trillion this year, representing 25 percent of the gross national product, "a post-World War II record." The G.N.P. measures the national output of goods and services.
The largest deficit to date was $221 billion, in 1986. The deficit last year was $220 billion.
Despite a five-year deficit-reduction package adopted in October, Mr. Reischauer said, the Federal debt will soar 46 percent to $3.5 trillion in 1996 from $2.4 trillion at the start of the current fiscal year. The debt represents the accumulated total of all Government borrowing.
The Federal debt will be equivalent to one-half of the gross national product in 1993, Mr. Reischauer said. There is virtually no way for the Government to reduce its debt unless it runs a budget surplus.

Fidelity Planning To Cut 226 Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest mutual fund operator, said it would lay off 226 workers because a slumping economy has weakened investor activity. The layoffs will reduce Fidelity's staff by 3.3 percent, to a total of 6,670. The cuts will affect 151 employees in Boston, where Fidelity is based; 30 in Dallas; 18 in New York City, 12 in Salt Lake City and smaller numbers at other locations.
The private company forecasts a modest increase in overall revenues for 1991 but said processing volumes and revenues in some areas have declined. Fidelity has been trying to cut its expenses without layoffs, but decided that staffing cuts were also necessary, said Edward C. Johnson 3d, the chairman.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Up by 0.1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
The Government's main economic forecasting index edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in December, the first increase in six months and a sign, many analysts said, that the economy may have begun to stabilize after falling into recession during the latter half of 1990.
The report follows similar recent data on gross national product, incomes, unemployment insurance claims and orders for durable goods, all of which were less negative than many had feared. It tended to support the widely held belief that the recession would be shorter and milder than the 11-month, 2.2 percent average decline posted by the other eight postwar contractions.
 
White House Encouraged
 The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said the Administration was encouraged by today's compilation of the index of leading indicators. But private economists cautioned that even a fully arrested downturn does not imply prompt economic revival. Some also noted that most of the data available so far cover periods before fighting started in the Middle East in mid-January and that polling and other evidence over the past week suggests a further sharp reduction in consumer confidence. 
 "I would not blow the whistle just yet" to begin chronicling recovery, said Frederick W. Sturm, an economist for Fuji Securities in Chicago. He said steadiness in the leading index after four straight sizable declines provided only a bit of confidence in his view that national output would be less punishing in coming months than had been widely feared.
 
Worst May Be Over
 Pittsburgh National Bank's Stuart G. Hoffman said the steepest part of the decline might be past but that today's report did not mean the low point was necessarily in sight. "I don't think it signals an early end to the recession," he said.
Credit market participants appeared to take the same view and generally shrugged off the report. But the stock market advanced strongly, in part on expectations of economic improvement, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 50.50 points, to 2,713.12, its highest level since August.
Six of the 11 components of the index contributed to the December increase, paced by higher stock prices and a longer factory workweek. The others were higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, a rise in the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations, a decline in average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance and a rise in unfilled orders at factories producing durable goods.
Five components had a negative effect on the index: lower factory orders for consumer goods, a drop in building permits, speedier deliveries by suppliers, lower prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle and a decline in the M-2 money supply.
"The leading indicators report for December contnued to confirm the weak state of the economy, even though it registered an uptick," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Today's report also showed that the Department's index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity, edged down one-tenth of 1 percent after three straight pronounced declines. The index of lagging indicators, whose components tend to move later than the economy, jumped 1.4 percent, the biggest increase since September 1987.
 
Alternative Indicator
 The ratio of the coincident index to the lagging index, which is regarded as an alternative predictor, fell 1.5 percent.
A private forecasting index compiled by Safian Investment Research also fell last month. The decline was six-tenths of 1 percent, to 191.3, with seven components up, 14 down and two unchanged.
On the other hand, Jesup & Lamont's macroeconomic index was calculated at minus 110, somewhat improved from the minus 118 posted in November. Business expansion is due in the second half of the year, but "it's not yet in sight," said the firm's David B. Bostian, whose index will not signal recovery until it moves up to at least minus 50.
 
More Optimistic View
 Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that its experimental index of leading indicators pointed to economic growth, albeit modest, in both the first and second quarters of this year. This is considerably more optimistic than the conventional view that gross national product will shrink significantly in the January-March period and will not turn up until midyear or later.
The research bureau, whose dating committee is the official arbiter of recession, also disclosed that its experimental recession index put the probability that the economy would be in recession six months from now -- in June -- at just 9 percent, down from 14 percent last month.
Revising earlier data, all to show slight improvements, the Commerce Department said its leading index fell 1.1 percent in November instead of 1.2 and and fell in October by 1.2 percent instead of 1.3. July was revised to show no change instead of down one-tenth of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: IRAN;
IRAN SAID TO PLAY BOTH SIDES IN GULF

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
By harboring scores of fleeing Iraqi warplanes, Iran is playing a balancing act calculated to optimize its political position once the gulf war is over, Administration officials and independent Middle East experts say.
State Department officials who monitor Iran say that Teheran, which has declared its neutrality in the war, apparently has two fundamental policy goals: to replace Iraq as the dominant power in the Persian Gulf and to prevent the establishment of a permanent Western military presence in the region. At the same time, they speculate that Iran is trying to show Islamic fundamentalists that it is helping Iraq. 
 "We think they are going to hold on to these planes until the end of the war and that's fine with us," said a State Department official. "It's not in their interests to either help Iraq get an edge over the coalition nor is it in their interests to see the war drag on."
Despite that view, the flight of 90 or more Iraqi transport and combat aircraft to Iran this week has set off much speculation that the two countries have buried their past differences and even that they have reached a secret alliance. The experts said it was conceivable that the Iraqis might be able to fly the aircraft into battle at a later date with Iranian acquiescence, particularly if Israel enters the conflict.
 
Gains for Teheran
 Administration officials are divided in their opinions on whether or not there was a prior agreement to save elements of the Iraqi Air Force. But they do not think the two countries have common military or political aims.
They noted that the Iranians had long been playing off both sides in the conflict. By supporting the United Nations resolutions against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Iranians helped to lift their international isolation. But at the same time, American officials said, the Iranian private and public sectors selectively broke the embargo against Iraq by trading across their border.
Iran has gained much from the conflict so far. Shortly after Mr. Hussein invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, he announced his intention to free Iranian prisoners of war and surrender virtually all territory Iraq took from Iran in their 1980-88 war with the goal of freeing for battle thousands of troops guarding the Iraq-Iran border. Meanwhile, rising oil prices have helped bost the Iranian economy.
But State Department officials noted that if Iran were trying to tilt in favor of Iraq, it could unleash terrorists in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries, something that has not yet happened.
 
Iran's Real Intentions
 "You get the impression the Iranians are playing fast and loose, playing the odds, placing themselves in a good position down the road," said another State Department official.
Iran's representative at the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, has said in television interviews over the last two days that his country was surprised when the aircraft began entering Irani airspace. He said Iran was interrogating the Iraqi planes' pilots.
An Administration official said Mr. Kharrazi's assurances correspond with intelligence information and with private Iranian assurances to European diplomats in Teheran and to Swiss diplomats who serve as interlocutors between Iran and the United States. Washington and Teheran broke off formal diplomatic relations after Iranian students stormed the United States Embassy in Iran in late 1979 and took more than 60 Americans hostage.
American officials cautioned that it is impossible to know for sure what Iran's real intentions are.
A professor of Middle Eastern history at George Mason University, Shaul Bakhash, said it was highly improbable that Teheran and Baghdad worked out prior arrangements for the flights, although he noted that a high-level Iraqi delegation visited Iran this month.
He said relations between the two countries were still strained, in part because Mr. Hussein has not freed all the Iranian prisoners of war or handed over all the occupied Iranian territory he had promised to give up.

U.N. Mission to Iraq
 UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 30 -- The United Nations will decide next week whether it is safe to send a mission to Iraq to assess its food and other needs five months after Baghdad's trade links with the rest of the world were severed, officials said today.
The conclusions of such a mission would determine whether the Security Council agrees to authorize a shipment of Iranian food to Iraq, the first such food shipment Iraq will have received for its own people since sanctions were imposed in August.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Investors Betting on Big Recovery

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE stock market seems to have concluded that this recession will be a short one, and that the economic recovery will not be a slow and cautious one.
That optimistic forecast, which has crystallized in the weeks since the allied bombing of Iraq began, flies in the face of the gloom that pervaded the stock market after Iraq invaded Kuwait last summer. 
 It can be seen not only in the rising prices of market indexes, but in the market's internal dynamics. The cautious stocks that were the market stars for much of the last year have been replaced as market leaders by riskier shares. These new favorites stand to gain more from a vibrant economy, but also risk suffering more if the recession should be a sustained and prolonged one.
Utility stocks, which were strong performers for a time late last year and were the favored stock investment of advisers who were fearful of a continued weak economy, have badly underperformed in recent weeks. The underperformance of the utilities, with their generally high dividend yields, has most sharply hit telephone and gas stocks, but the electric utilities have also lagged.
Small stocks, meanwhile, generally considered more speculative and by far the least popular investments for months before the market's war rally, have also started to surge.
Those trend reversals can be interpreted as signs that stock traders are worrying less about economic conditions. It appears that faith in the ameliorative actions of the Federal Reserve, which has been aggressively easing credit, has overcome fears that the economy was in such bad shape that the Fed's moves would have little impact.
That market forecast could, of course, be wrong. The old joke about the stock market forecasting nine of the last five recessions can also be applied to recoveries. But it still provides the first indication that the glum attitude of investors has started to turn cheerful, and that the recent market rally has more behind it than a belief that the war with Iraq will be a military success and relatively short.
"This is just like 1982," said Michael O'Higgins, a money manager in Albany. He recalled that when that recession ended, there was also a widespread belief that the Fed's actions to ease credit would not work.
The new optimism can be seen not only in the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average, which has risen 14.7 percent since it bottomed, at 2,365.10, on Oct. 11, but also in the fact that the Dow, dominated by stable blue-chip stocks, is no longer the market leader. The Nasdaq composite average has gained 25.5 percent in the same period. But the Dow industrials have done much better than the Dow utilities, up just 2.1 percent.
The relative performance of the Russell 2,000, which measures only small stocks, compared with the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500, which is dominated by large ones, hit bottom on Nov. 1. That was just a few days before utility stocks reached their recent relative high as compared with industrial stocks. As it happens, those turning points also came just after the first firm indication that the Fed was easing credit, a move that was greeted with widespread doubt as to its effects.
Now, Wall Street seems to be willing to believe that the Fed's actions will work. The report yesterday that the leading economic indicators rose in December, for the first time since June, was both an encouragement to the market and a result of its rebound. The rise in stock prices in December provided one of the two largest increases to the index, which would have showed a decline had the stock market moved up less.
The trends of utility underperformance, and small-stock overperformance, accelerated after the Persian Gulf war began. While the prospect of a war had scared many investors, the reality of it seemed to offer both an early victory and an economic stimulus.
"Now that the war is on, defense orders are bound to be an important source of economic growth in 1991," said Edward Yardeni, the chief economist of Prudential-Bache. He noted that the 4.4 percent increase in durable goods orders last month was largely caused by a 57 percent leap in military orders.
It is possible that the economic impacts of both the war and the Fed's moves will prove to be disappointing, and if so the stock market's rally may start to fade. But for now, the growing mood on Wall Street is one of optimism.

HEADLINE: Saying Life Is Not Enough, the Disabled Demand Rights and Choices

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
After 42 years as a quadriplegic, Irene Armistead can no longer afford the care she needs to live on her own. So she is trying to decide whether to die.
Since being paralyzed in a car accident when she was 24, Ms. Armistead has managed to live independently with the help of attendants. For years, she has paid them from her salary as a speech pathologist at Craig Hospital in Denver. 
 But now her disability has worsened and she depends on a respirator to breathe. Instead of needing an attendant only in the morning and evening, she needs one 24 hours a day. She no longer works and her money has run out. She may be forced to move to a nursing home or other institution for long-term care, and she worries that that could be like living in prison, with no autonomy and with caretakers who might be insensitive.
Ms. Armistead is among a growing number of severely disabled people who have survived serious injury because of medical advances only to confront questions about the quality of their lives. As a group, they have begun lobbying for Federal funds for care to allow them to live independently.
They have also become increasingly sophisticated about the legal rights they already have, including the right to discontinue medical treatment and die. And hundreds of them have quietly chosen death, advocates for the disabled say.
 
'No Hope, No Future'
 The advocates say many of those who chose death felt that the only alternative was a numbing life in a nursing home, where they feared they would have no choice about what and when to eat or bathe or go to bed, little contact with younger people, little to do except watch television, and no opportunity to work.
"Disabled people all over the country have killed themselves," said Edward V. Roberts, president of the World Institute on Disability, a research and advocacy group in Oakland, Calif. "The quality of their life is so bad. They see no hope, no future."
Mr. Roberts is paralyzed from the neck down and uses a respirator. He lives with others in a private home and has attendants.
Although the Federal Government will pay for the severely disabled to be cared for in nursing homes, there is little money and few programs for attendants who could help them at home. Disabled people often find that they do not qualify for programs or that, if they do qualify, they must be put on long waiting lists.
 
'What Is Going On Here?'
 Without attendants, most disabled people end up in nursing homes or their families become their unpaid and overburdened attendants. When the disabled choose death, advocates say, they are demonstrating that society has made life so difficult that it may seem not worth living.
"The difficulty is not in being disabled," said Mary Johnson, editor of The Disability Rag, a magazine of the disability-rights movement. "It's in the way we treat disabled people. When you look at disabled people who are petitioning to die, you have to step back and ask, 'What is going on here?' "
Michael Auberger, a quadriplegic who is a director of Atlantis Community, an independent living and home health care agency, agrees. "There is this acceptance of the idea that it's so awful to be disabled that you would naturally want to kill yourself," he said.
As she contemplates dying, Ms. Armistead is talking at length with her minister and a psychologist. "For me, the biggest struggle that I have is spiritual," she said. "It's hard for me to evaluate if it is the right way."
She said the declining quality of her life was weighing heavily. "Just because I have a severe disability," she said, "the finger is pointed and people say, 'We don't know what we're going to do with you.' "
 
More Are Surviving
 Around the country, thousands of people are alive now who would not have survived 15 years ago; their numbers have risen as doctors get better at saving the badly injured, at preventing infections that used to be fatal, and at keeping people alive with debilitating and often degenerative diseases like amylotrophic lateral sclerosis, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease, or cerebral palsy.
At the same time, said Dr. Lester Butt, the director of psychology at Craig Hospital, disabled people are "becoming increasingly sophisticated as to what their rights are.
Severely disabled people who are mentally competent have the legal right to decline medical care, even the respirators and feeding that are keeping them alive, said Dr. Robert Veach, director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University in Washington. The courts have established this as a fundmental right of patient autonomy, he said.
The few cases that have gone to court because doctors or nursing homes refused to comply with patients' requests to have respirators disconnected or to have feeding withdrawn, have been decided in favor of the disabled people.
 
Georgia Case Is Recalled
 For example, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that Larry McAfee, a 33-year-old quadriplegic who was injured in a motorcycle accident, could have his respirator turned off. Mr. McAfee decided not to die.
Last year, a Nevada court agreed to let Kenneth Bergstedt, a 33-year- old quadriplegic, die but asked that he wait until the State Supreme Court could rule on his request. He died before the court could rule. In October, his father said he had died in the night after his respirator was loosened. The elder Mr. Bergstedt did not say who had loosened the respirator.
In March, Nancy Gamble of Nashville got court permission to have her doctor disconnect her respirator. Ms. Gamble had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which made her a quadriplegic. She died on April 11.
But these cases are the exceptions because they involved the courts. Staff members at rehabilitation hospitals say that the vast majority of suicides of disabled people occur far from the public eye. Although most patients choose to live, doctors say, more and more are becoming aware that it is also their right to die.
"I personally have been involved with eight cases," Dr. Butt said, adding that he has worked at Craig Hospital for five years.
The cases include a young man in his 20's who had become completely paralyzed after inhaling lead paint fumes in an unventilated room while painting his house seven years ago. He could breathe on his own and could think, but could not move his body. A few months ago, Dr. Butt said, the man checked into a hospice associated with a local hospital and asked that his food and water be withdrawn. He died.
 
Spelling Out 'Death'
 Another man, in his 50's, had a stroke that completely paralyzed him. He depended on a ventilator and could only move his eyebrows. He used an alphabet board, signaling the letters of the words he wanted to spell out, to ask to die. His ventilator was turned off.
A man in his 40's was paralyzed after being hit by a drunken teen-age driver. He was only expected to need a ventilator temporarily, but while he was on it, he insisted that it be removed so that he could die. The hospital staff reluctantly complied.
These deaths were extraordinarily difficult for the hospital staff, said Dr. Butt, who described the cases with a catch in his voice. "We are pro-life here," he said.
Dr. Simi Litvak, director of research at the World Institute on Disability, is conducting a national survey to determine how available attendant services are for the disabled. "The short answer is that every state has something, but none has much," Dr. Litvak said. Most of the Federal and private insurance money goes to nursing homes, she added.
 
'I Would Rather Be Dead'
 Some disabled people move to states where they qualify for programs that provide attendant care. Steven Vidas, for example, said he was paralyzed from the neck down after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver in 1986. He lived in Chicago for three years, where his girlfriend cared for him. When she said she could not continue, Mr. Vidas said, he was faced with life in a nursing home.
He learned about a program in Denver that would allow him to live independently and immediately moved there. "I'm 35 years old," he said. "I don't need to be in a nursing home. I would rather be dead." He does not work, and his care, five or six visits a day from an attendant, is paid for by Medicaid.
Disability-rights advocates say they are now pushing for a national attendant-care program that would take $5 billion of the $18 billion that Medicaid and Medicare now pay annually to nursing homes. They say that nursing home care costs an average of $30,000 a year but that attendant care costs range from $4,000 to $12,000 a year.
Advocates like Mr. Roberts and Mr. Auberger say that one reason attendant care can cost less than nursing home care is that attendants often are not needed 24 hours a day. Mr. Auberger, for example, said he needs an attendant just two and a half hours a day. And with an attendant, he is able to live independently and work full time.
But economists and Federal regulators say they do not know whether it would cost the same or less to provide attendant services to disabled people now in nursing homes. One concern, said Dr. Mark Pauly, a professor of health care systems at the University of Pennsylvania, is that as soon as the Federal Government offered to pay for attendant care, disabled people who were being cared for free by relatives would suddenly ask for funds to pay for attendants.
But advocates for the disabled say that more than economics is involved. Even if an attendant-care program did not save money, they say, it is the morally right thing to do.
They cite the case of Mr. McAfee. After he got permission from the Georgia Supreme Court to have his respirator disconnected, United Cerebral Palsy took up his case. Under pressure from disability-rights groups, the State of Georgia agreed to pay $7,340 a month for attendants for Mr. McAfee and care in a private home. Mr. McAfee, a draftsman, was taught to operate a computer by sipping and puffing on a straw. He decided not to die.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Officials Fault Property-Tax Figures

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 29

 BODY:
Local budget officials across New Jersey are challenging State Senate calculations that about half of the state's towns will be able to lower property-tax rates this year.
When a measure to shift $395 million from school aid to local property-tax relief emerged from committee last week, its sponsor, Senate President John A. Lynch, distributed charts predicting to the penny the 1991 property-tax rates for the state's 567 communities. 
 Mr. Lynch contends that his bill, added to property-tax relief measures taken by the Florio administration, would allow 292 towns to lower tax rates this year, and the other 275 to impose only marginal increases.
But local officials say there are problems with any legislator in Trenton saying what might happen with any town's or city's property taxes. Not a single new budget for towns, schools or counties has been drafted yet.
 
As Property Values Fall
 The officials say that Senator Lynch's calculations also do not reflect the recession's effect on tax revenues. And they say they cannot accurately predict the amount of tax refunds they will have to pay as a growing number of property owners seek lower tax assessments as property values fall.
"It's all mirrors," said Jack Coughlin, business administrator of East Brunswick and head of the New Jersey Municipal Management Association, a statewide group of town officials.
"I would look at precise figures with caution," said Linda Spalinski, executive director of the New Jersey Association of Counties, which represents elected officials in the state's 21 counties.
Senator Lynch's plan is part of an intensifying personal contest with Governor Florio over property-tax relief. Each is telling residents that his plan promises more benefits.
 
Higher Property Tax Rebates
 The Governor is trying to rebuild his popularity rating after pushing $2.8 billion in higher sales and income taxes through the Legislature last spring. Mr. Lynch is trying to improve re-election chances for himself and his Democratic colleagues this November.
Early this month, he said the Governor's promises of property-tax relief in the administration's new school-financing formula, a companion to the higher taxes, were empty ones.
On Tuesday, the Governor called his $14.3 billion budget plan "the property tax relief budget" and said it had funds for higher property-tax rebates for one million homeowners.
As the Governor was speaking, two Democratic Senators broke ranks with Mr. Lynch and left his plan two votes short of passage in the Senate. For the moment, it has been shelved.
Senator Lynch's aides defended their tax-rate projections as "very conservatives estimates."
"The Senator would admit there are other variables, but these are a lot harder numbers than anyone else is putting forth," said Robert Noonan, deputy director of the State Senate.
The calucations, Mr. Lynch's aides say, are based on several state measures aimed at controlling local and county spending. The basic ones are state controls that allow towns and counties to increase their 1990 spending by only 5 percent. Other factors include the state's taking over about $250 million in county costs for welfare and psychiatric hospitals; increases in urban aid programs, and Senator Lynch's proposal to limit 1991-92 spending increases to 13.5 percent in the state's 30 poorest urban school districts and 8.5 percent in all other districts.
The tax-rate projections also assume that 1991 municipal revenues will remain the same as 1990's, Mr. Lynch's aides said. Some local officials, however, say their revenues are declining. They also say perhaps as much as one third of municipal and county spending is not restricted by the 5 percent caps.

HEADLINE: Bush Would Let the States Decide How to Spend $15 Billion in Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
In his budget for the fiscal year 1992, President Bush will propose giving the states complete control over $15 billion a year in Federal aid now earmarked for specific activities like health care, education, housing, transportation and sewage treatment.
The proposal, one of the few significant domestic policy initiatives in Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message, is reminiscent of President Ronald Reagan's "new federalism" proposal in 1982. Under the Reagan proposal, the Federal Government would have assumed full responsibility for financing Medicaid, while the states would have shouldered the entire cost of food stamps and the nation's main welfare program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
 Bush Administration officials asserted today that their proposals might succeed where Mr. Reagan's failed. In an effort to allay the fears of some governors that Washington is imposing new responsibilities on the states with no extra money, Mr. Bush would guarantee the continuation of $15 billion a year in Federal payments to the states.
Mr. Bush said Tuesday that his proposal moved "power and decision-making closer to the people" and asserted that governors should welcome it because it allowed "states to manage more flexibly and more efficiently."
 
Focus on Gulf War
 Some Administration officials, including Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, had urged Mr. Bush to use his State of the Union Message for a rousing appeal to the nation to find new ways of fighting poverty. But the President devoted the emotional energy of his speech overwhelmingly to the war in the Persian Gulf.
Under Mr. Bush's proposals, programs like Medicaid and food stamps, which involve benefit payments to individuals, would not be turned over to the states. Rather, his proposal applies to Federal grants made to state and local government agencies for narrowly defined programs in health, education, housing, transportation and environmental protection.
Experts on federalism say Washington should consult more closely with state and local officials on the distribution of Federal aid. But James L. Martin, director of Federal-state relations for the National Governors' Association, and Michael W. Brown, a spokesman for the United States Conference of Mayors, said the Administration had not consulted governors or mayors in developing its latest proposal.
Brad C. Johnson, director of New York State's office in Washington, said the Bush proposal to turn Federal programs over to the states with a single consolidated grant was disappointing.
"We are facing fundamental social problems, the receession, drugs, the AIDS epidemic, and the Bush Administration is rearranging furniture in Washington," Mr. Johnson said.
Mr. Brown said many mayors were worried about the Bush proposal because it could reduce the amount of Federal aid to cities. Under the proposal, he said, money that now flows from the Federal Treasury to city halls might flow through state capitols first, reducing the amounts that ultimately arrive in the nation's hard-pressed inner cities.
 
'Warmed-Over Ideas'
 Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, said many of the proposals on Mr. Bush's domestic policy agenda were "warmed-over ideas."
Mr. Bush's proposals on crime, urban enterprise zones, tax credits for research and development and a cut in the capital gains tax all mirror proposals previously made by him or by Mr. Reagan.
The President does have some novel, although modest, proposals to increase prenatal care and other services to low-income women in cities with the highest infant mortality rates. The White House said Mr. Bush's 1992 budget, to be submitted to Congress on Monday, would also increase funds available for immunizing children against measles and other diseases. Congress is likely to welcome such proposals and to appropriate substantially more money than the President requests.
 
$139 Billion in Federal Grants
 The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, created by Congress in 1959 to monitor Federal-state relations, has estimated that the Federal Government distributed $134 billion in grants to states, counties, cities and towns last year. Of that amount, $75 billion was for payments to individuals, including Medicaid, welfare and food stamps.
The remaining $59 billion is the pot of money from which the Bush Administration would choose programs to be turned over to the states. Mr. Bush said he wanted to give the states "a single consolidated grant" of $15 billion a year, representing about one-fourth of the Federal aid not earmarked for payments to individuals.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said today that Federal regulations and requirements would wither away under this proposal. "We would hope that if this were carried out as envisioned, there would be a point at which there would be a diminishing of Federal programs and Federal management and employees," he said.

GRAPHIC: Chart: 'Domestic Policy: Bush's State of the Union Proposals'
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: FEDERALISM -- Turn over $15 billion worth of Federal programs to the states, with "a single consolidated grant."
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: President Reagan's "new federalism" proposals were similar, but much more ambitious; they died in Congress, amid opposition from governors, who felt that not enough money was designated to run the programs.
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: CRIME -- Establish new sentencing procedures to permit greater use of the death penalty; set strict new limits on appeals by death row prisoners; change court rules to permit the use in criminal trials of some evidence obtained illegally by law-enforcement officers.
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: The House of Representatives approved versions of all three proposals last year; the Senate approved two. But the items were all dropped from the final version of the legislation.
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: HEALTH -- Increase prenatal care and other medical services to low-income women in cities with the highest infant mortality rates. Increase funds available for immunizing children against measles and other diseases.
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: Congress is likely to welcome such proposals and to appropriate substantially more money than President Bush requests.
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: URBAN ENTERPRISE ZONES -- Offer tax incentives to encourage businesses to invest and create jobs in inner cities.
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: Presidents Reagan and Bush have repeatedly proposed such incentives. Congress has expressed interest in the idea, but has not approved any significant tax breaks to date.
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: TAX CREDITS -- Establish permanent statutory authority for businesses to take Federal tax credits for investments in research and development.
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: Congress has approved such credits on a temporary basis, but has been unwilling to make them permanent unless other tax breaks are also extended indefinitely.
 
BUSH PROPOSAL: CAPITAL GAINS -- Appoint a panel, including Congressional leaders and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to resolve "technical differences" over the cost of a cut in the Federal tax on profits from investments.
 
ACTION IN CONGRESS: President Bush has made this proposal a centerpiece of his political program for several years, saying the tax cut would stimulate the economy. Many Democrats say it would lose revenue for the Treasury and would mainly benefit people with high incomes.

HEADLINE: New Course for 'Star Wars,' From Full to a Limited Defense

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
President Bush's decision to reduce the goals of the "Star Wars" program from an impenetrable shield to a limited defense against missile attacks is a milestone in the Government's slow rejection of Ronald Reagan's grandiose aims.
 The shift has long been advocated by Congress and implicit in the Pentagon's turbulent, seven- year search for technologies to destroy all enemy missiles. 
 The feasibility of limited protection has recently been driven home by the achievements of the Patriot antimissile missile in the Persian Gulf war and the successful interception Monday of a mock warhead high above the South Pacific, an achievement that took seven years of intensive research.
Yet despite formidable efforts by scientists, the dream of being able to zap thousands of nuclear warheads speeding through space, surrounded by hundreds of thousands of decoys and false targets, seems to most experts as distant today as when President Reagan proposed the goal in March 1983. Moreover, the collapse of the Soviet economy and the easing of East-West tensions are believed to have reduced that threat.
"The President's rhetoric has fallen in line with what everybody other than the most ardent true believers have known for some time," said Dr. Albert Carnesale of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, who is an an expert on antimissile technology.
 
Bush Sets New Policy
 In Tuesday night's State of the Union Message, Mr. Bush called for a new emphasis in the antimissile program, the Strategic Defense Initiative.
"I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on providing protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their source," he said. "Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future threat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our friends and allies."
In theory, the move would reduce the cost of deploying a defense and perhaps raise the research program's fortunes in Congress, which has repeatedly cut its budget. But there are already rumblings of disapproval on Capitol Hill, with some members of Congress seeing the move as a pretext for the acquisition of a more ambitious system.
The announcement follows years of high-level agonizing over what the program should do. As worries about a threat from the Soviet military faded, the White House grew increasingly concerned about a threat from other nations.
William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, warned in a speech nearly two years ago that at least 15 developing nations would be producing their own ballistic missiles by the turn of the century.
For the past year or so, the missile-defense program has tried to formulate a more limited approach that would address the threat from developing countries, while giving a modicum of protection against a small Soviet attack, perhaps begun by accident.
Dr. Henry F. Cooper, the program's director, outlined the results of that search in December in a talk to the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Theoretically, the system, called Global Protection Against Limited Strikes, would protect against threats of up to 100 enemy warheads.
The proposed system, he said, would have ground-based as well as space-based interceptors that destroy targets by force of impact rather than an explosive charge. The ground-based interceptors would include derivatives of the one fired Monday, the Exoatmospheric Re-entry Vehicle Interceptor System. Space-based interceptors would be swarms of tiny homing rockets, which have undergone no realistic test in the Brilliant Pebbles program.
A senior Defense Department official, who would speak only on the condition of not being identified, said yesterday that the limited defense would have about one-quarter of the 4,612 space-based rockets the Government previously envisioned for full defense and about half the 2,000 or so ground-based interceptors.
The official added that its cost would also be about $30 billion, half the $60 billion envisioned for the first phase of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
Representative Charles E. Bennett, a Florida Democrat who is on the House Armed Services Committee and has fought to cut the budget of the antimissile program, yesterday expressed doubts about the cost estimates and the merit of President Bush's move.
Brilliant Pebbles would violate the 1972 treaty in which the Soviet Union and the United States agreed to limits on developing or deploying improved antimissile devices.
Mr. Bennett predicted that any system with space-based elements would be rejected by the Congress and suggested that Mr. Bush's move was simply a maneuver to keep the "Star Wars" program alive.
But Dr. Carnesale said he thought the move would prompt a serious re-evaluation of antimissile defense and perhaps a renaissance.
"In the past, it's been too easy to refute defenses on the basis that they couldn't achieve the most optimistic vision," he said. "It was difficult to have a rational discourse." Now, he said, the debate will focus on technical issues like feasiblity and cost.

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Senate Leader Present Cost-Cutting Plans

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed today a broad package of cost-cutting measures that would cushion local governments from the pain of impending budget cuts but would also lead to reduced services for the poor and disabled.
Included in the package, which will be part of the budget Mr. Cuomo releases on Thursday, were proposals to narrow the definition for children who qualify for special education and to require some Medicaid recipients to pay part of the cost of their health care. 
 The Republican majority leader of the State Senate, Ralph J. Marino, released his own proposals for $750 million in cuts in social services today, and many of them mirrored the recommendations of the Democratic Governor. Because Mr. Marino and Mr. Cuomo historically have found little common ground on social issues, many lobbyists interpreted their new kinship as a stark illustration of this year's fiscal and political realities.
 
'Own Levels of Fright'
 "It's striking how similar they are," said Anne E. Erickson, legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project, which lobbies on Medicaid and welfare issues. "Both have their own levels of fright to them, but it's amazing that we have a Governor and a Senate that are so close."
Mr. Cuomo released his package of initiatives to relieve local governments of costs of mandated services one day before he is to unveil his plan for filling a $6 billion budget gap in the 1991-92 fiscal year, which begins on April 1. He is expected to propose filling three-fourths of the gap through severe cuts in spending that would cost local governments hundreds of millions of dollars in state aid.
The Governor said his mandate-relief initiatives, many of which require legislative approval, would save local governments more than $450 million and would save school districts more than $160 million next year.
In addition, he said in a statement that local governments could save $400 million through repeal of the state's Wicks Law, which drives up construction costs by requiring that independent contractors -- instead of a general contractor -- be hired for municipal projects. He said he was "supportive" of efforts by local government and school board officials to repeal the law.
 
A 1988 Pledge
 In 1988, when negotiating a school construction law with legislative leaders, Mr. Cuomo declared that he would wait five years before asking the Legislature to repeal the Wicks Law. The Governor's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said Mr. Cuomo's statement today did not violate his pledge because he was not personally proposing to repeal the law, only supporting a proposal made by others.
The primary cost-saving measures in both Mr. Cuomo's and Mr. Marino's proposals are in Medicaid, welfare and education, three of the most expensive elements of the state budget. New York has nearly 2.4 million eligible Medicaid recipients and 1.3 million welfare recipients, and caseloads have surged during the economic downturn.
Among the similarities between the two plans are proposals to require unmarried welfare recipients who are under 18 and have children to live with a parent or guardian to receive benefits. Both plans also said sanctions should be strengthened against welfare recipients not complying with drug and alcohol treatment requirements.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Marino agreed that Medicaid recipients should pay small amounts, perhaps $3 an office visit, for their health care and that more Medicaid recipients should be enrolled in managed care programs, like health maintenance organizations.
Analysts inside and outside state government said the recession might provide incentives to pass mandate-relief measures that have languished in Albany for years. "The fiscal crisis lends itself to some rethinking about the role of state and local governments," said Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties. "This may be the year when some dramatic things occur to alter that relationship."
Mr. Cuomo said his plan, if put into effect fully, would save the state about $400 million. Mr. Marino calculated the savings in his plan at $750 million.
Mr. Marino placed much of the blame for the state's fiscal problems on a bloated social-services bureaucracy. "New York is the Cadillac of welfare states," he said. "We can't afford it anymore. What we need is Chevys and Fords in this state."
He suggested that home-relief benefits, which are welfare grants paid to childless couples and single men, should be limited to 90 days and be paid only to residents who have lived in New York for at least 30 days.

HEADLINE: 6-Month High For Stocks; Dow Up 50.50

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices advanced sharply yesterday, soaring to their highest level in six months, as investors rushed into the market in expectation of strong Administration efforts to put new bounce into the economy.
With many people seemingly betting that the country could soon pull itself out of recession, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1.9 percent, or 50.50 points, to 2,713.12. 
 It was the highest level since August for the Dow, which measures leading blue chips like Alcoa, I.B.M. and Merck.
Birinyi Associates said persistent waves of program buying carried the Dow 33 points higher. A strong push in the final 16 minutes accounted for 10 points of the gain.
Cyclical stocks -- in chemicals, paper, aluminum and other industries that could be big beneficiaries of an economic revival -- showed surprisingly strong gains.
The spurt went well beyond the safe, solid blue chips, though, continuing to spill over to the smaller stocks in the over-the-counter market and on the American Stock Exchange.
Trading volume, which poked along on Tuesday at 155.7 million shares, climbed to 226.8 million, the best in two weeks.
In one of the best indications yet, 93 Big Board stocks, including I.B.M., Merck, Bristol-Myers and International Paper, rose to new highs. A strong 1,216 stocks advanced and only 406 declined. Eighteen dropped to new lows.
While many people continued to feel that the war in the Persian Gulf could drag on, traders got the feeling from President Bush's State of the Union Message Tuesday evening that he would try to end the war as quickly as possible.
"He seized a moment in history to transfer his international leadership to home," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson, Lehman Brothers. "He made us realize that if we can win overseas, we can win here. It was like a pep talk at halftime."
Also yesterday, the Government said the index of leading indicators rose for the first time in six months.
Investors, always looking for lower interest rates to strengthen the economy, were particularly impressed by President Bush's pointed remark that "interest rates should be lower, now," a strong sign that rates will indeed come down quickly.
In other signs that he has been spending considerable time working on ways to get the nation back on its feet, the President also proposed the formation of a commission headed by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, to work out the politics to get Congressional agreement on a capital gains tax cut.
Edgar Wachenheim 3d, chairman of Greenhaven Associates, with $300 million under its management, said, "We put what we would have put into the market and the fact that it went up didn't influence us."
Mr. Grennan of Shearson maintained that many traders were skeptical of the market rally and afraid of a future drop. As a result, he said, they are selling short, or selling borrowed stock in the hope of buying it back later for less. When the market starts to rise, they buy and thus move the market higher.
Heavy buying developed from the opening bell. Within an hour the Dow had jumped 23 points; by noon it was ahead 38 and by 1:30 it was up 43. It fell back slightly after that but resumed its climb after 2 P.M.
Except for gold shares, which slumped after the price of gold plunged $7.30 an ounce, to its lowest level in four months, most major stock categories advanced.
Chemicals, airlines, paper, military suppliers, drugs, trucking, retail stores, metals and Wall Street firms were all strong.
Mr. Wachenheim of Greenhaven Associates said he had bought three stocks yesterday -- Global Natural Resources, American Express and American Home Products. "They're good values," he said, "over the long term." Global, an energy company, rose 1/8, to 5 5/8. American Express, the most active Big Board stock, with 4.4 million shares changing hands, rose 1 1/4, to 21 7/8. American Home Products rose 1 3/8, to 50 1/8.
Among other active stocks, I.B.M. rose 2 1/2, to 127, on 2.5 million shares, helping to move other technology stocks into higher ground.
Compaq Computer, with volume of 2.4 million shares, rose 3 1/2, to 66 3/4, trading at one point as high as 67 1/8. Borland jumped 4 1/4, to 48 5/8; Digital Equipment 2 3/4, to 72 3/4; Honeywell 2, to 48 7/8, and Apple Computer 1 3/4, to 55 1/2.
Automotive and auto parts stocks were also strong. General Motors rose 1 5/8, to 35 1/2, and Ford Motor 1 1/8, to 27 7/8, both in brisk trading. Safety Kleen, a parts cleaning service, rose 2 3/8, to 45 1/4.
 
Stocks Higher in Tokyo
 TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 31 (REUTERS) -- Japanese stock prices were higher at midday today, following Wednesday's rally on Wall Street. At the end of the morning trading session, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 144.66 points, or 0.62 percent, to 23,554.27. On Wednesday, the Nikkei lost 50.51 points.

HEADLINE: Turmoil, Then Hope in Argentina

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Following the appointment of a new Economy Minister, Argentina's stock market soared 30 percent today, in a stunning reversal of investor sentiment after three days of sharp plunges by the nation's currency.
Economic officials saw the rising market as a sign that financial and business executives still believe that the country's economic recovery plan is on track, despite the financial and political turmoil earlier this week. 
 "The wild moves over the last few days are really just a hiccup and I don't think any of this signals a departure from the broad policies," said the head of one foreign bank, who insisted on anonymity. "So we had a little bit of volatility. Welcome to Argentina."
Under President Carlos Saul Menem, Argentina has been reducing the size of the Government payroll, selling off money-losing Government-owned businesses to private investors and, in general, opening the economy more to free-market forces. The nation is also placing greater restraints on printing new money.
Bankers and economists said today that they welcomed Tuesday's appointment of Domingo Cavallo as Economy Minister and predicted that he would continue the Menem Government's broad economic policies. Mr. Cavallo, who had been the country's Foreign Minister, is President Menem's fourth Economy Minister in a little more than 18 months.
Mr. Cavallo is expected to announce a new economic plan by Monday, and many people are predicting that it will include an overhaul of the country's inefficient tax system.
Investors also said the sharp drop in the austral, the Argentine currency, could help their economy by making Agentine products cheaper abroad, leading to an export boom and enabling the country to pay more of its debts. The austral fell to 9,500 to the dollar today, from 6,500 to the dollar on Friday, and some economists had predicted that the devaluation could unleash a new round of hyperinflation.
Still lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund, as well as the United States Government, will be watching closely to see how the Menem Government handles the crisis. While President Menem has gained popularity and some credibility in Washington, Government officials are quick to acknowledged that they are still not sure if he will be able to overcome a history of inflationary economic policies and bloated Government payrolls in this country.
 
Big Investment Needs
 Argentina sorely needs vast amounts of new capital investment from abroad to revitalize its economy. The way it handles a crisis like a currency swing sends unmistakable signals to business and banking executives.
Many Argentine economists, bankers and Government officials had been saying for months that the austral was greatly overvalued.
Despite inflation that exceeded 1,000 percent in 1990, the austral rose against the dollar throughout the year, mainly because of highly restrictive Government measures that tied up vast sources of dollars. By December, the austral had been trading as high as 4,500 to the dollar. Some economists say a more realistic exchange rate is around 12,000 australs to the dollar.
As the austral began to fall on Friday, speculative fever erupted, so that foreign-exchange houses were crowded with investors frantically trying to sell australs.
 
Two Officials Resign
 Late Monday, the Government announced that banks and exchange houses would close for two days, and Tuesday night President Menem accpeted the resignations of the Economy Minister, Antonio Erman Gonzalez, and the central bank president, Javier Gonzalez-Fraga.
After being named Economy Minister, Mr. Cavallo announced late Tuesday night that he would reopen the banks and exchange houses, and that for now the central bank would keep the austral in a trading range of 8,000 to 10,000 to the dollar.
Some of the optimism following the appointment of Mr. Cavallo reflects the fact that he has been known to advocate a higher exchange rate. Moreover, he announced that he planned to give the Argentine central bank complete autonomy from the Finance Ministry.
Business executives here said such a step would go a long way toward insulating the central bank from pressure by other parts of the Government to cover budget deficits by printing more australs.
 
Rising Consumer Prices
 Despite the optimism, some prices have risen sharply this week, with increases as great as 40 percent for sugar and 25 precent for cooking oil.
Many shops have been posting signs that they will no longer accept credit cards, fearing that by the time they are paid by the banks for the charge purchases, the value of the austral will have dropped sharply.
Moves like that left some economists expecting prices to rise even further.

Eagerness in AIDS Fight Ruffles a Neighborhood

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Three years ago, Jon C. Parker drove his van into the Mission Hill neighborhood here, opened his door and began swapping hypodermic needles with intravenous drug users.
"Clean needles help prevent AIDS," Mr. Parker, a former drug addict from South Boston, told the users. And in his campaign to stem the disease he has given out 50,000 clean needles to addicts here and in New York, New Haven and cities in seven other states. 
 The needle swap was illegal under Massachusetts law, but given the rapid rise in the number of local drug users infected with the AIDS virus, Boston officials and neighborhood residents made few complaints -- so long as Mr. Parker and his group, the National AIDS Brigade, kept a low profile.
They did -- until last week, when the group unexpectedly opened a storefront operation in Mission Hill, the city's most racially and economically diverse neighborhood. Neighborhood leaders and residents were enraged that they had not been consulted and quickly began a protest.
"Having a permanent place for needle exchanges will make the addicts come here more often and will make it rough for people to walk out around here," said Rinaldo Colazo, who lives next to the storefront. "Maybe if they had asked us if they could be here, we would feel differently. But they didn't, so we don't."
A series of meetings between groups of Mission Hill residents and planners of an AIDS hospice is credited with the smooth opening of the hospice in the neighborhood more than a year ago.
But Mr. Parker and his spokesman, Joe McGrath, have given no ground.
"I don't really care if the community leaders were consulted," Mr. McGrath said, adding that the brigade would continue distributing needles despite daily picketing at the storefront. "We really don't have time to make sure everyone has their feathers smoothed. This is an urgent problem."
About 35 percent of Boston's 20,000 addicts are already infected with the AIDS virus, said Larry Kessler, executive director of the AIDS Action Committee, a local education group.
Tension between Mr. Parker and neighborhood residents heightened Sunday after a confrontation outside the storefront. The Rev. Graylan Ellis-Hagler of the Church of the United Community in Roxbury accused Mr. Parker of biting him on the nose. Mr. Parker denied the accusation and filed charges of assault against Mr. Ellis-Hagler, saying the minister knocked him down.
"Mr. Parker is creating controversy where we need to be creating unity," Mr. Ellis-Hagler said.
Mr. Parker does not confine his needle distribution to Massachusetts, one of 11 states that ban possession of hypodermic needles and has worked with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power in New York City to give out needles. He says that since 1988 he has been arrested 14 times for distributing needles but that only one of those arrests has resulted in a trial. That trial, in Boston Municipal Court in 1990, ended in his acquittal on a charge of illegal possession of hypodermic needles.
"We are challenging laws," he said. "There is so much power in this. The confrontations just spice up the stew. Doing needle exchange unofficially brings the issue to people's attention, and they have to think about it."
Still, Mr. Parker's exuberance for confrontation has rubbed many people the wrong way, including some members of the brigade's board.
In a meeting with Boston officials today, Will Murphy, a brigade coordinator, said he and a majority of the group's nine-member board had agreed to stop exchanging needles at the storefront until meetings with community members could be held.
Earlier, in an interview, Mr. Murphy said the board's majority was also seeking to remove Mr. Parker from the brigade's governing body.
"Jon's only tactic is confrontation," Mr. Murphy said. "He may think we are going down in a blaze of glory, but no one is going to want to work with us."
Mr. Parker, in turn, accuses the board of trying to take over an organization he had founded.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Trim Sale of Reserve Oil by Half

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Energy Department, facing a very weak market for the high-sulfur crude it had planned to sell from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said yesterday that it would cut the total sale by nearly 50 percent.
The department said it would sell only 3 million barrels of the high-sulfur, or "sour," crude instead of the 22.5 million barrels originally planned, because the prices bid were too low. But it said it would increase the sale of "sweet," or low-sulfur, crude to 14.35 million barrels, from 11.25 million barrels. As a result, the sale will comprise a total of 17.35 million barrels, rather than the 33.75 first planned. 
 The intended sale from the 586-million-barrel reserve was first announced two weeks ago, when the air attack on Iraq began, as a way to avert panic in the oil market. But the price of oil unexpectedly plunged when traders concluded that the attack was a success and that Saudi exports were not threatened.
 
Statement by Watkins
 In a statement yesterday, James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary, said, "We clearly must remain sensitive to the market by making available the crude oil the industry is saying it really needs, and not allowing bargain hunters to take advantage of the taxpayers."
He added that the department would also fulfill the commitment it made to the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based organization of 21 oil-importing nations, whose members had collectively agreed to release 2.5 million barrels a day. Half of that was to come from American reserves, although the department had said it would be flexible.
The largest contract, for 7.52 million barrels, was awarded to Phibro Energy Inc., a trading company and refiner based in Greenwich, Conn. Bids were submitted by 26 companies, 13 of which won contracts.
The 17.35 million barrels were auctioned at prices ranging from $25.67 to $28.52 a barrel.
 
Oil Drops 88 Cents
 The news of the amended sale plan, which was first disclosed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, did not upset the oil market yesterday, with oil for delivery in March closing on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $20.97 a barrel, down 88 cents.
That oil, however, is sweet crude. The announcement did push up the price of sour crude relative to sweet, according to industry experts. Sour crude is traded among refiners, producers and trading houses, generally at bids expressed in relation to sweet crude rather than at an absolute price. And the announcement prompted the discount for sour crude to shrink, with the price difference per barrel dropping to $3.30 late yesterday from about $3.70 on Tuesday. The reason was that supplies of sour crude will now be smaller than the market had anticipated.
Market participants said the price of sour crude actually started to close in on the price of sweet crude in trading late Tuesday afternoon. Several participants said they were angry with the Energy Department because it appeared to them that the information had leaked out and that some companies had been able to take advantage of it.
 
Department Denies Leak
 The department denied there had been a leak. And at least one trader, while saying he had suspicions of such an advantage, said it was possible that an astute trader could have made the same trades based on conclusions drawn from publicly available information.
Philip K. Verleger Jr., a commodities economist and visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, who follows the oil market closely, said the price move started Tuesday afternoon when Phibro, the company that received the largest contract, "started buying up a lot of sour crude." He said the trading suggested that Phibro had "advance notice" of the change in the oil auction, and that what he believed was an information leak "tarnished what is otherwise the greatest success in energy management in 18 years."
There is no law against insider trading in commodities, as there is in stocks.
A Washington lawyer who specializes in energy matters, Peter H. Rodgers, said that trading companies he works with had complained to him yesterday morning, after the change in the auction was made public, that Phibro's purchases, beginning at about 4:30 P.M. on Tuesday, appeared to them to indicate the company had early knowledge.
 
A 2 P.M. Decision
 Robert F. Baker, a spokesman for Phibro's parent company, Salomon Brothers, would not confirm trading by Phibro, but said any suggestion Phibro had advance information was "utter nonsense."
At the Energy Department, M. J. Jameson, the chief spokeswoman, said that the decision was made at about 2 P.M. on Tuesday, in consultation with the White House, and that the first time the information was divulged outside the Government was to a Wall Street Journal reporter at 6:30 P.M.
But a trader at one international oil trading company, who spoke on condition that neither he nor his company be identified, also said Phibro started buying at about 4:30, and he felt there may have been a Government leak. "I trade off information all the time," he said. But, he added that his information usually came from private sources, "and this is a Government body."
One energy trader at a different international company also said there may have been a leak, although he added that a perceptive reading of publicly available information, including Energy Department data showing that sweet crude was in much higher demand than sour, might have led an astute trader to expect the Government to cut back on its sale of sour crude and to anticipate a rise in its price.

HEADLINE: Three Big Steel Companies Post Disappointing Results

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Two of the nation's leading steel producers reported fourth-quarter losses yesterday, saying their earnings were hurt by special charges, sharply reduced steel prices and lower demand, and a third reported plummeting profits.
At the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the nation's second-largest steel producer after the USX Corporation, the loss included a previously announced $550 million charge for layoffs and the shutdown of plants under a proposed joint venture with British Steel P.L.C. 
 Armco Inc., the nation's fifth-largest steel company, said it had lost money for the quarter and the year partly because of the recession.
National Steel, the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker, said its fourth-quarter profits had tumbled nearly 95 percent, partly because of a mid-October fire that idled an underground mine.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Bethlehem
Bethlehem reported a $522.7 million loss for the quarter, compared with net income of $43.6 million, or 58 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 4 perecnt from $1.15 billion in the 1989 period.
Bethlehem said that excluding the effects of the charges, the company's income would have been $33 million. "Lower steel prices and shipments and higher operating costs were the principal causes of this decline," said Walter F. Williams, chairman and chief executive.
For the year, the company, based in Bethlehem, Pa., reported a loss of $487.7 million, compared with net income of $219.7 million, or 2.93 a share, in 1989. Sales for the year were $4.9 billion, down nearly 7 percent from $5.25 billion in 1989, the company said.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Bethlehem's stock was up 75 cents yesterday, closing at $14.25.
 
Armco
Armco, based in Parsippany, N.J., reported an $8.5 million loss for the quarter, compared with income of $15.5 million, or 15 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were down slightly, to $414 million, from $416 million in the 1989 period.
For the year, the company had a net loss of $89.5 million, compared with net income of $165 million, or $1.78 a share, in 1989. The company said that the 1990 net loss included charges totaling $86.1 million, compared with charges of $35.7 million in 1989. Sales for the year were down 28.5 percent, to $1.73 billion, from $2.42 billion in 1989.
Armco's stock gained 12.5 cents yesterday, closing at $4.50, on the Big Board.
 
National
National Steel, based in Pittsburgh, said profits for the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to $1.5 million from $28.4 million in the 1989 period. Sales decreased 5 percent in the quarter to $606.2 million from $638.9 million a year earlier.
For the year, the ocmpany earned $21.8 million, down from $83.2 million in 1989. Sales for 1990 were $2.51 billion, up from $2.58 billion in 1989.

HEADLINE: Mistrust At Hearing On Art Regulation

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
In an atmosphere of heavily cordial mistrust, art dealers, auction house officials, city and state administrators and others squared off yesterday at a daylong public hearing in Manhattan on the regulation of the art market in New York City.
The topics included whether auction houses should be allowed to continue their practice of keeping secret the reserve, or the minimum price acceptable to a seller, and whether the sale of art objects should be covered under the Martin Act, which regulates the sale of securities in New York. 
 There are practices in the art market that should be looked at, said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester. As chairman of the New York State Assembly Committee on Oversight, Analysis and Investigation, he called the hearing with Assemblyman Joseph T. Pillittere, a Democrat of Niagara County and the chairman of the New York State Assembly Committee on Tourism, Arts and Sports Development.
 
Provoked by 'Irises'
 The chief instigator of the hearing was Mr. Brodsky, who had said his interest in art market regulation was prompted by the financing of Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the painting Sotheby's sold at auction to the Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond for $53.9 million in 1987. The auction house later lent Mr. Bond $27 million to help pay for the work, using the painting as collateral. But Mr. Bond defaulted on payments and "Irises" was later sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.
The practice of lending money to buy an object that is itself used as collateral for the loan has ended at Sotheby's, officials at the auction house say, because of negative public reaction. But under New York City laws regulating auctions, the practice is still legal. Despite the demurrals of auction officials and even dealers, Mr. Brodsky made it clear yesterday that he felt the "Irises" transaction gave Mr. Bond an unfair advantage and that he would like to prevent other such transactions.
"Didn't Alan Bond have an advantage that other buyers didn't have?" he said to John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, about the loan provided by Sotheby's.
Mr. Marion replied, "Mr. Bond had no promise of credit from Sotheby's." He added that the loan to Mr. Bond was negotiated three days after the sale. But Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America, said Mr. Bond's representatives had asked the auction house before the sale whether extended credit from six months to a year was possible.
 
A 'Tilted' Playing Field
 Mr. Brodsky said, "Whatever level of understanding Bond had, the fact is that he could have bid higher than people who didn't have similar means available to them. So the 'level playing field' of the auction was tilted."
He said the hearing resulted from discussions he and his staff began more than a year and a half ago with major figures in the New York City art market and with such agencies as the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussions have already led to a series of draft legislative proposals.
While some who attended said they saw the hearing as a publicity forum for Mr. Brodsky, whose track record is skimpy on art legislation, save for a bill he introduced several years ago on resale royalties for art, Mr. Brodsky promised that his committee would continue its interest in finding ways to support art market activities in New York City.
 Although the Brodsky proposals took dealers into account, Gilbert Edelson, the administrative vice president and counsel of the Art Dealers Association of America, said the legislator's concerns had far more to do with the practices of auction houses, including reserves, guarantees and the financing of art purchases.
Though the auction process, by virtue of its "public competitive bidding," Mr. Edelson said, had long been held to be subject to the public interest, art dealers were retail business establishments whose transactions were "private, one-on-one, between the dealer as seller and a buyer or prospective buyer."
 
Concerns About Overregulation
 "Consumers expect dealers to represent the art which they are offering for sale," Mr. Edelson said at the hearing, held in the Arthur Levitt State Office Building at 270 Broadway, at Chambers Street. "The expectation is that an auctioneer is an impartial middleman." But he said he was against overregulation, even for auction houses. "To the extent that New York legislation interferes with the normal functioning of the art market, it is bound to be harmful to New York dealers and the New York economy," he said.
 One of the most discussed topics at the hearing was chandelier bidding by auction houses. This refers to the auctioneers' practice of driving up the bidding to the secret reserve price by pretending to pick up bids from people in the audience. Under the New York City code, this practice is legal up to the reserve price set by the consignor, even if there are no real bids from the audience.
"It's nothing short of an effort to deceive people into thinking there's real competition when there isn't any," Richard L. Feigen, an art dealer, said of the practice, adding that he was speaking not as a dealer but as an art collector.
Consecutive bidding, which is a term preferred by the auction houses to chandelier bidding, was stoutly defended by auction officials at the hearing as a way of maintaining the secrecy of the reserve, or the minimum price acceptable to the seller.
"The use of confidential reserves in art auctions is the most effective, time-tested and universally accepted device to protect sellers at auction from accepting too low a price for the object that they have consigned," Mr. Marion said. Under questioning by Mr. Brodsky, Mr. Marion insisted that sellers were "the widows and orphans" of the auction market and that they had to be protected as much as buyers.
In a day of few surprises, the hearing did produce a pair of strange -- and certainly temporary -- bedfellows: Sotheby's and Christie's . Because of Mr. Brodsky's legislative iniatives, the two auction houses joined in hiring a lobbyist, Stanley Fink, a former Assembly Speaker, to represent them in Albany.
 Mr. Brodsky was commended for his legislative initiatives by Richard Schrader, Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, who said the department would be willing to take a fresh look at its auction regulations.

HEADLINE: THE THIRD YEAR;
State of the War

 BODY:
The State of the Union is to Washington what the lighted ball is to Times Square: the beginning of the new year. The political year that began on Capitol Hill Tuesday night is already stunningly different than 1990.
When he opened his second year in office, President Bush was still riding a golden chariot pulled by the twin steeds of peace and prosperity. Unprecedented peace, in fact, with democracy marching through Eastern Europe, generals driven from power throughout South America and apartheid crumbling in South Africa. And unprecedented prosperity, with the economy continuing to grow for an eighth straight year. 
 Not anymore. Economic contractions are now so sharp that even the President publicly pronounces the word recession. And peace, meanwhile, has yielded to the war that so painfully divides Americans. But this time around, unlike Vietnam, the divisions are not only between people but within them.
Citizens who revile war also revile the barbarity of Saddam Hussein. Put off by the oversimplified postures of hawks and doves, they grope for a principled, limited position that resists aggression and also violence. Yet as recently as last week, the President was loosely enlarging his war aims.
To judge by the State of the Union Message and other recent policy statements, President Bush has now come to recognize the need to articulate and, presumably, stick to limited objectives in a limited war.
 On other subjects, the State of the Union speech clanked with banalities. ("We are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism.") But the President devoted nearly half the address to the war, and that was notable for simple eloquence ("the hard work of freedom") and a statement of limited war aims.
The speech and the U.S.-Soviet joint communique, issued almost simultaneously, offer some reassurance to Americans who were afraid their President was starting to sound like a war lover.
As late as last week, Mr. Bush seemed intent on raising the stakes. Speaking to the Reserve Officers Association, he described four new goals beyond those enunciated in United Nations resolutions -- to derail Iraq's nuclear weapons ambitions, to demolish the Iraqi war machine, to topple Saddam Hussein and, resisting any pause in the fighting, to go "all the way."
Even if desirable, those goals raise the alarming prospect of unlimited war to Americans who are just coming to terms with the reality of limited war. But before Congress Tuesday night, Mr. Bush seemed more restrained.
He welcomed sensible dissent. He noted how widely the war burden is shared, whether measured in pilots or billions. With feeling he said, "If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all." And it took only a few hours for the news of the first American combat deaths to give somber depth to his words "Any cost in lives -- any cost -- is beyond our power to measure."
Explicitly, Mr. Bush restated limited goals: "Our purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant -- to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate Government and to insure the stability and security of this critical region." Explicitly, he renounced any aim to destroy Iraq or leave it so helpless that it could become a target for aggression.
Meanwhile, even as the President prepared to speak, his intimate colleague, Secretary of State Baker, joined with the new Soviet Foreign Minister in issuing a statement that can be interpreted as opening, if only by a crack, a new door to peace.
Since the war began, the U.S. has been insisting the war would be prosecuted without pause. The joint statement, by offering a cease-fire if Iraq takes "immediate, concrete steps" to get out of Kuwait, could save lives on all sides.
The joint statement also commits Washington and Moscow to "promote Arab-Israeli peace and regional stability, in consultation with other parties in the region" after the war. By restating these goals now, the Administration usefully pre-empts any effort by Saddam Hussein to take credit for a Middle East settlement.
The State of the Union, 1991, is troubled, full of doubts at the beginning of a war. Tuesday's words offer a glimmer of hope about how to end it.

HEADLINE: THE THIRD YEAR;
Meanwhile, Back in the Union

 BODY:
The State of the Union, judging from Mr. Bush's address Tuesday, does not have much room for major cities that are staggered by epidemics of homelessness, AIDS and crack. Or for 40 million families lacking medical insurance; the fifth of all children who live in poverty, or the male high-school graduates earning less, after inflation, than at any time during the past 20 years. Intractable problems worthy of national attention are not part of Mr. Bush's union.
Instead, he offers bromides. Recession is a worry, but be patient; it will go away before long. Poor people walk some streets; that's best handled by individual acts of charity. As for long-term economic growth, minor tinkering with the tax code is the answer -- even though Congress has previously rejected President Bush's suggestions to offer tax-free family savings accounts and penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for first-time home buyers. 
 Ever the good manager, the President dutifully promised to present Congress, as legislatively required, new policies on energy, transportation and banking. But he issued no clarion calls.
On other domestic issues, Mr. Bush's presentation was rushed and unspecific. He rattled off vague promises about education, space exploration, private research and development expenditures, enterprise zones and a top-level meeting on crime.
The nation surely needs enlightened Federal policy in each of these areas. But by committing his Administration to nothing specific, the President set no priorities. By promising a little bit of everything, he promised nothing of consequence.
In the rare instances where the President did commit himself to a specific goal, the promises rang hollow. Making "America Number One in math and science" can't be done soon, and not without a mammoth Federal commitment that, at a time of huge deficits, he is unlikely to propose. The President who vetoed the Civil Rights Act of 1990 now piously calls for civil rights legislation. And though he asked for an end to political action committees, he ducked the corollary need: public funds for political campaigns.
Mr. Bush renewed his obsessive, and benighted, campaign to cut taxes on capital gains, but even here the call was half-hearted, even defeatist, and he shunted off the idea to a new commission to collect facts.
Even the potentially significant initiatives lacked oomph. His proposal to turn over control of $15 billion each year in Federal aid to states is a pallid version of President Reagan's "new federalism." And he scrupulously avoided bold rhetoric and ambitious goals when he came to offering the poor more control over Federal programs.
 The contrast between Mr. Bush the military leader and Mr. Bush the domestic leader was never more stark. No listener could miss his resolve when discussing war in the Persian Gulf. And no listener could find resolve when he discussed problems at home. To his credit, the President did not pander to a right-wing constituency by gratuitously raising subjects like abortion or flag burning. But neither did he give any sign of fire in the belly or an animating vision.
In the Middle East, President Bush stands up to lead the world. At home, he waits to manage each crisis as it happens to come along.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC & PRIVATE;
The Domestic Front

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
There are many ways to watch America in action, but one of the most colorful is to stroll the public spaces of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, that squat, ever-busy gateway to the world on wheels. You can learn something about the State of the Union by the state of this place. And it has precious little to do with cuts in the capital gains tax.
The irony of the terminal is that the building has never looked better, with neon wall sculptures and bright lighting. It's the people that are the problem. The scamsters, who do a booming business in selling telephone calling card numbers for $10 a shot. The runaways, their eyes as old as the stories they can tell about serial parents, prepubescent incest and foster homes. The broken men, with years of booze running red in the veins of their faces. "Excuse me, sweetheart," some of them say as you edge past, proving that chivalry is not dead, it's just drunk. 
 And all around them move the commuters, angry at being panhandled, tired of walking over prone bodies to get to the greener, cleaner places where they live.
America is a little like this now. In some ways it has never looked better, with its flags flying and the yellow ribbons tied around its trees. It's the inside that's rotting away, the domestic disintegration that war has given us all an excuse to forget.
On television, reporters said that children in Israel were sleeping in hotels, homeless because of the war. Children in New York slept in hotels for years because they were homeless.
On television they showed bombed buildings that were shells amid fields of rubble. I've seen those broken buildings and rubble fields in forgotten neighborhoods all over New York.
The same country that has rallied round pushing Iraq out of Kuwait has given up on parts of itself. Infant mortality. Teen-age pregnancy. Drugs. Dropouts. Bank failures. Home foreclosures. We walk around the bad stuff on our way to somewhere else and mutter under our breath: Own fault, own fault.
Fault is not the point. A capable, no-nonsense woman named Janis Beitzer runs the little world of the bus terminal, and it would be perfectly understandable if she said her job was to put people on buses, and all the rest is someone else's problem. But that would be shortsighted, like missing the opportunity to rally people united behind a war abroad around an equally horrible war at home. Rerouting traffic patterns to discourage loitering, opening a drop-in center for the homeless, hiring social service workers -- she's had to deal with issues no one running a bus terminal ever had to consider before.
"We didn't really have a choice," Ms. Beitzer says.
Neither do we. America often has a one-track mind, and the track in the last month has led straight to the Persian Gulf. The President knew where the ovations lay in his State of the Union address, a kind of boilerplate noble-cause speech that could have been delivered by any American President engaged in battle abroad. When he praised the men and women fighting in the gulf, a great roar went up from his audience.
But the domestic initiatives in his speech were sketchy, perfunctory and shockingly beside the point. At a time when many Americans still believe this war is inextricably linked to our reliance on foreign oil, he kissed off energy conservation with one vague sentence. Elimination of PAC's and a cut in capital gains taxes don't seem like pressing issues for a country with thousands of people sleeping in the streets and thousands of mothers giving birth to addicted babies.
Time magazine named George Bush "Men of the Year" at the beginning of the month, declaring him adept at foreign affairs and muzzy on domestic issues. It was the first known case of a multiple personality defense for an elected official. Now the President has a mandate to play to his strengths, and to forget the national weaknesses. And his own.
A one-track mind is not enough for government. If the President thinks only of war, the home front will have disintegrated, in some cases beyond repair.
The soldiers he invoked to such rousing effect the other night will come home. Some of them will lose their houses if the recession continues. Some of them will watch their children die on city streets if we do not do something about crime and drugs. Some of them might even wind up someday in a bus terminal, sleeping on the floor, in the home of the free and the brave. When that happens we will know that we have lost the war, the war we turned our backs on while we were busy with yellow ribbons.

HEADLINE: Business Improvement District Concept Can Work Citywide

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"When City Hall Fails, Do It Yourself" (editorial, Jan. 13) rightly praises the self-help initiative shown by neighborhoods that have formed a business improvement district (BID) to finance private security patrols, sanitation pickups and other services. But we should not assume that this technique is appropriate for all communities. In neighborhoods where there are no very large property owners to shoulder a major share of the additional tax burden, even a modest BID-financed service program can result in considerable increases in tax payments.
In most low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, the business community consists mainly of small businesses with limited financial resources, many of them young companies owned by minority entrepreneurs. Whatever fragile prosperity exists in these communities could easily be damaged by excessive taxation. With real estate taxes likely to increase because of the city's financial problems, further increases should be approached cautiously.
Equitable delivery of city services may also be affected. As you have pointed out, improvement districts may only supplement city services, not replace them. But coming reductions in the municipal work force raise the possibility of inadequate services in those neighborhoods where local businesses cannot afford extra taxes. Neighborhoods with wealthier businesses would be able to avoid reductions in services through use of BID funds.
These fears need not be realized. Careful study of business improvement districts will help us design methods to compensate low- and moderate-income communities for the limited financial capacities of local businesses. Then BIDs can be used throughout the city, without exacerbating existing disparities between prosperous and deprived communities.

HEADLINE: California Set to Impose Most Drastic Water Curbs

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 30

 BODY:
California stands on the verge of imposing the most drastic restrictions on water use in its history.
The action is being forced by a relentless drought, now in its fifth year, that is shriveling the state's crops, roiling its politics, compelling profound compromises in an expansive way of urban life and threatening to stunt California's economic and population growth. 
 Hopes that January, normally the wettest month in the West, would bring welcome relief have now entirely evaporated with discouraging reports that rain and snowfall were only about 15 percent of normal levels for the month, and even lower in the crucial northern Sierra region that feeds most of the state's agricultural water needs.
 
Options Being Considered
 "This is one of the most serious situations we've ever faced in California," W. Don Maughan, chairman of the California Water Resources Control Board, said at a break in a two-day emergency hearing that ended here today. "We need to take some action."
Among 18 moves under consideration by the five-member board, which is empowered to control surface water rights statewide, are cutting water for permanent crops like oranges and almonds to subsistence levels, diverting fresh water meant to reduce salinity and pollution in San Francisco Bay, and limiting domestic use to 300 gallons a day per household, a move that would have widely varying implications, depending on the size of the household and region of the state. A decision is scheduled for Feb. 7.
Whatever action is taken, it is likely to have profound consequences not only for 30 million Californians, but for much of the rest of the nation as well.
The drought has raised doubts about whether California, which grew by a staggering 20 percent in population and gained seven seats in Congress over the last decade, can continue to grow at such a pace. Moreover, substantial water reductions to farmers in California, which produces half the fruit and vegetables in the United States, are likely to affect food supplies and prices everywhere.
The prospect of water rationing has rekindled longtime animosities in California that have pitted farmers against urbanites, north against south, environmentalists against industry, in competition for the scarce lifeblood that is taken for granted in most parts of the country.
 
Approach of Dry Season
 Without relief, water deliveries to the San Francisco Bay area will have to be halved this year, said Anson B. Moran, general manager of the San Francisco Hetch Hetchy Water and Power Project, which supplies 2.6 million people. "The impact of that kind of cutback could be catastrophic," he said.
Such comments came against a backdrop of gloomy statistics, with reservoirs at or near record low levels. Maurice Roos, chief hydrologist for the state's Department of Water Resources, said precipitation in the northern Sierra from Oct. 1 to Jan. 28 was only about 5 inches, compared with 27 inches in the average year.
Although precipitation could pick up before the summer dry season, he estimated that this meant a "deficit" of nine million acre-feet of surface water this year, or about 26 percent of California's normal annual use of 34.5 million acre-feet. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, or roughly enough to supply two typical households for a year.
As a result, officials of the State Water Project, a vast system of dams, reservoirs and aqueducts that supplies nearly 10 percent of the state's water, said they might have to cut off all supplies to farmers and reduce deliveries to municipal and industrial customers to 15 to 20 percent of what they need.
"This could be the single largest disaster agricultural has ever faced," said Steve Hall, representing the California Farm Water Coalition, adding that the uncertainty had forced farmers to lay off many employees.
Urban users were no less pessimistic. Carl Boronkay, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, the wholesaler that supplies half the water used by 15 million people, said his agency had imposed a 17 percent reduction on local utilities starting Feb. 1 and expected cuts as deep as 31 percent soon.
 
25% Cut in Allotment
 In addition to the drought, the water district expects a 25 percent cut, or 300,000 acre-feet, from its normal allotment of water from the Colorado River as a result of a Federal court order allocating more water to Arizona.
Mr. Boronkay disputed criticism that is often voiced by Northern Californians, who are resentful of what they see as water profligacy in Southern California, a land of swimming pools and car washes. Southern California, he said, is a land of perpetual drought and has invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the years to assure its supplies and deserves to keep them.
Perhaps the most politically explosive proposal by the water board is the one to limit water to 300 gallons to every household. Usage tends to be higher in desert inland areas than on the coast. But it is estimated that it runs 100 to 200 gallons a day for each person.
Numerous witnesses at the hearing, which drew about 700 people to the Sacramento Community Center, urged the board to avoid any such across-the-board edicts, given differing water supplies and needs. "It is difficult, if not impossible, to lay down rules on a statewide basis that can address these varying water supply conditions," said John P. Fraser, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, which represents 400 local water districts supplying 90 percent of the water in California.
 
Heavy Use by Farmers
 Urban interests and environmentalists have long contended that the solution to water problems lies in forcing conservation on farmers, who use about 85 percent of available water, most of it cheap and heavily subsidized by the state and Federal governments. They say much of it is squandered on crops that demand vast amounts of water, like alfalfa and cotton, which together consume 24 percent of all water in the state.
But farm representatives argue that these crops are important to the state and national economies.
Assemblyman Bill Chandler, who represents six largely rural counties in Northern California, argued for preserving traditional water rights enjoyed by farmers. "Agriculture cannot be allowed the target this year," he said, adding that the solution was to build more dams and reservoirs. That approach was opposed by environmentalists, who opposed further damage to the state's ecology and wildlife.
If nothing else, there was agreement that the state should ease legal restrictions on transfers of water from one area to another. But the market for such transfers is "both wary and limited," in the words of Mr. Moran of the San Francisco water project.
Almost nobody who spoke was willing to concede that they were obliged to cut back on use.
"Everybody is going to have to give up a little and nobody wants to give up anything," said Sandra Salazar, spokeswoman for the board. The board's chairman, Mr. Maughan, said in the interview: "We are going to have to balance these things out. It has been worthwhile getting their attention."

HEADLINE: Labor Dept. Nominee Lists Her Goals

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30

 BODY:
Former Representative Lynn Martin, President Bush's nominee to be Secretary of Labor, said today that she would press for tough enforcement of child-labor and worker-safety laws, try to curb discrimination in the workplace and seek better training both for new workers and for those who lose their jobs.
In her confirmation hearing before the Senate Labor and Human Resouces Committee, Mrs. Martin spoke passionately about those issues but suggested no significant departures from the policies of her immediate predecessor, Elizabeth Dole, who resigned in October to become president of the American Red Cross.
 
Looking Beyond War Is Urged
 She also evaded directly addressing senators' appeals for an expansion of unemployment benefits. Current eligibility standards have limited the benefits to a third of the unemployed, said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee. Mrs. Martin said some forecasters were predicting a short recession, which would reduce unemployment, now at 6.1 percent. But Mr. Kennedy said forecasters had also predicted a short war in the Persian Gulf. 
 Mr. Kennedy and Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, urged Mrs. Martin to look beyond the war, to the economy as a whole and particularly to the recession that soldiers now serving in the Persian Gulf may find when they return home. Mr. Hatch asked what policies Mrs. Martin was considering to help them.
"The department is already examining a number of changes that could be made," both administratively and with new legislation, Mrs. Martin said. She declined to elaborate, but a Labor Department official said the department was reviewing employers' obligations on health care, pension and re-employment for men and women temporarily serving in the armed forces and could provide special assistance to help such people find jobs.
Mrs. Martin, a leading supporter of Mr. Bush's 1988 Presidential campaign, was a five-term Congresswoman from Illinois when she lost a Senate race in November to the incumbent, Paul Simon, a member of the Labor Committee. Mr. Simon endorsed her nomination unequivocally today, and remarks by other senators, including the chairman, Mr. Kennedy, indicated that the committee would approve her unanimously, probably within two weeks.
Mrs. Martin, a 51-year-old former high school teacher, is a rarity among Cabinet nominees in that as a member of the House, she broke with Mr. Bush over several important issues. For instance, she joined in unsuccessful attempt to override the President's veto of legislation that would have required employers to grant workers unpaid time off to care for ailing family members. On another occasion, she was part of an effort that failed to override his veto of a bill that would have raised the minimum wage 30 cents higher than the level it will reach on April 1, $4.25 an hour, a level that the President subsequently approved.
 
Fights Will Be in Private
 Mrs. Martin has also steadfastly supported legal abortion and Federal financing of abortions for poor women, again in opposition to Mr. Bush's stance.
Family leave and a higher minimum wage rank high on Senate Democrats' agenda this year, along with job-related civil rights legislation and a ban of employers' using permanent replacement workers to counter a strike. But in her comments today, Mrs. Martin indicated that she would fight any battles she had with the President within the Cabinet, rather than take public positions opposing him.
"Is Lynn Martin going to be an also-ran, just a rubber stamp for the White House?" Mr. Simon said. "Or is she going to be a Secretary of Labor in the tradition of the giants?" He said he believed she would be not only a team player for the Administration but also candid and spirited. "Within the Administration where there are vacuums," the Senator said, "I think she will move in and do an effective job."
Despite her position on issues like family leave and the minimum wage, Mrs. Martin's nomination has been greeted coolly by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Organized labor is particularly concerned about the use of replacements for striking workers and about the decline in union membership. Mrs. Martin was not asked her views on strike issues at the hearing today.
In her prepared remarks, she pointed to the same "excrutiatingly tight budgets" other Cabinet officers have cited in warning against adopting costly new programs. But some of her predecessor's objectives that she said she would pursue are not costly. She said they included Mrs. Dole's initiative aimed at removing the barrier to promotion of women and blacks to the highest levels of corporate management.

Davey Waits By the Phone, And Waits

BYLINE: By Joseph Durso

 BODY:
This may be more of a recession note than a baseball note. But two of the smartest managers in baseball are out of work as we turn toward spring training, and the phone isn't ringing.
For Whitey Herzog, this hasn't happened since he became a manager in the big leagues with the Texas Rangers in 1973. For Davey Johnson, it hasn't happened since he became a manager with the Mets in 1984. So, they are not exactly the chronically unemployed. 
 But it's happening now for different reasons. Herzog got disgusted with the St. Louis Cardinals' players last summer when they seemed to be focusing more on their next contracts than on their next game, and he stepped out of the dugout and into some vague scouting duties. And it's happening to Johnson because the Mets sacked him May 29 after the best six-year run in the business.
Strictly speaking, they may be out of jobs but they're not out of coin. The Cardinals are still paying Herzog more than $500,000 for just being the White Rat, in uniform or not. The Mets must pay Johnson $500,000 this year because it's the final year of his contract. But it's strange: They used to get paid for outsmarting each other; now they're getting paid for not.
But they were smart enough to be business partners even when they were business enemies. They are two of the founding partners in a celebrity fishing resort near Ocala, Fla., and any day now the city slickers will be forking over big bills for the chance to catch a couple of catfish with baseball's two most successful dropouts. And Johnson, a whirling dervish in real estate and investing, has always been something of a one-man conglomerate.
Herzog is off skiing and doing some fishing on his own these days. But Johnson is minding the store and, when the telephone rang the other day in his home down the road near Orlando, he answered it. No, it wasn't opportunity calling; just a guy from his baseball past wanting to know if he had a baseball future.
"We're keeping a low profile," Johnson reported, laughing at the incongruity of it all. "I guess we kept a high profile for a while."
High profile? They're a tough act to follow, two of the strategic brains in the business, shrewd and even slick, and rip-roaring on stage. Remember when they used to fight each other down to the last pitch, often thrown by Herzog's seventh pitcher in the game against Johnson's pinch-hitter for a pinch-hitter? Remember how they even sniped at each other through the umpires, impounding bats and X-raying them for cork? Remember that they won five Eastern Division titles and four National League pennants between them during a seven-year stretch in the 1980's?
Now, Herzog is skiing and fishing and Johnson is selling real estate in a bare market. But they are one telephone call away from staging the old act.
"Whitey and I talk about it all the time," Johnson was saying. "I tell him we'll split the job. I'll be the manager, and you be the general manager. Then, halfway through the season, you can fire me. And I'll become the general manager, and you take the team on the field as the manager."
But is the telephone ringing?
"I'm here," he said. "If somebody wants me, that's up to them. But I'm not in a hurry. I'm still being paid by the Mets. If somebody's smart enough to know he wants me, I'm here. I'm making $500,000 a year. Other clubs know I'm making that kind of money. I don't think that's a factor. If anybody hires me, the Mets pay the difference."
One reason they're keeping a low profile these days is that they don't have to bang drums to get attention. The record shouts for itself.
"Whitey does some scouting for the Cardinals," Johnson said. "The Mets don't want me to do anything. I'm spending a lot of time watching war movies on TV. But I'm feeling good. Bud Harrelson and Mel Stottlemyre were here. They're both involved in the fishing camp. I'm busy doing some things with arena football and celebrity resorts.
"A lot of people invested money in our fishing camp. It's like when I was with the Mets: I gave my energy then for Doubleday and Wilpon. They invested in me. Now, these people have invested in me, too.
"The real estate business is slow. I've got a lot of horse farms for sale down here. They used to give you tax relief if you raised horses as a second business. But they took it away. When there's a reason again, people will spend on horse farms again.'
But when will people spend on baseball smarts again? Johnson implied that the phone hadn't been entirely silent since the Mets sacked him. But he hasn't received "the call" yet.
"Look," he said, sounding like a man who expects something to happen, "I think I'll be back in the game this year. But not probably until after July. That's when the teams will need help. And maybe some of them will be smart enough to call me."
The line forms on the right, boys. Herzog and Johnson, managers at large.
