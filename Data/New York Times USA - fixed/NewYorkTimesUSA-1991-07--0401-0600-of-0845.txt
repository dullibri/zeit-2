HEADLINE: Industrial Output Up in June for a 3d Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed seven-tenths of a percent in June, the third straight sizable advance, the Federal Reserve reported today.
Although analysts had expected such an increase, the gain was greeted by economists with some relief, after a Government report on Friday of a surprising decline in retail sales in June. 
 "This certainly confirms even further that the recession's over," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank North America. He noted that the economy was getting "a lot of thrust" from automobile and truck production, which hit an annual rate of nine million in June. But the rise in the index of industrial production was broadly based and was up six-tenths of a percent even when motor vehicles were excluded.
The Fed's report also showed that industry again stepped up its operating rate last month, to 79.3 percent, three-tenths of a point above the May level.
Bond prices remained largely unaffected by today's figures, which had been foreshadowed by the Labor Department's report 10 days ago of a sharp expansion in the workweek.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said business inventories posted a broad decline of five-tenths of a percent in May, the fourth decline in a row and an indication that production would need to be stepped up to still higher rates if demand climbed. The report also said that business sales rose by 1 percent.
"People are selling out of inventory because demand is so strong," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
In addition to rising seven-tenths of a percent in June, to an index level of 106.9, industrial production was revised upward for the two preceding months. May's gain is now put at seven-tenths of a percent instead of the five-tenths initially estimated, while April's was raised to five-tenths of a percent, from three-tenths.
Although the figures published today cover only one-third of the economy, industrial output is intently watched because its components are generally those that are most susceptible to business cycle ups and downs. Much of the balance is accounted for by services.
For the second quarter, output rose at a 1.7 percent annual pace after falling steeply in the first quarter of 1991 and the fourth quarter of 1990 at rates of 9.7 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Still, production last month was down 2.9 percent from a year earlier.
Among consumer goods, output of such nonautomotive durables as appliances, furniture and carpeting rose markedly for the fourth straight month, but the Fed said output of nondurable consumer goods has risen only slightly in recent months.
Output of nonautomotive business equipment, which fell over the fall and winter, rose slightly in April and was unchanged in May and June, the Fed noted. Production of construction supplies, steel, textiles and paper rose sharply.
 
Gain in Manufacturing
 In manufacturing, the June advance was seven-tenths of a percent compared with five-tenths in May, with durable goods up eight-tenths and nondurables up six-tenths. Mining output rose 1.5 percent, aided in part by a rebound in coal. Utilities registered a drop of five-tenths of a percent, but this was considered minimal since it followed a 3.9 percent jump in May that reflected exceptionally hot weather that raised demand for air-conditioning.
With today's report the Fed began publishing a set of indexes showing, with one-month lags, the percentage of industries with production increases over the latest one-month, three-month and six-month periods. The three-month index of output reached 50 percent in May, up from 41.6 percent in April and from a recession low of 27.7 percent calculated for January.
Before seasonal adjustment, today's report also showed, industrial production rose 4.2 percent in June, to 108.7 percent of its 1987 average.

HEADLINE: NCR Profits Are Off 13.9%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, July 15

 BODY:
Lower international orders and the recession resulted in reduced second-quarter revenue and a 13.9 percent profit decline at the NCR Corporation, the computer company said today. The company attributed the decline in orders to the stronger dollar.
NCR, which agreed in May to merge with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, said profit for the three months ended June 30 totaled $99 million, or $1.51 a share, compared with a record $115 million, or $1.66 a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. 
 Per-share earnings in the latest quarter were reduced by 5 cents because of special charges of $6 million related to the pending merger.
Revenue totaled $1.57 billion, down 2.5 percent from a record $1.61 billion a year earlier.
"The decline in worldwide orders was broad-based across most major product lines," said Charles E. Exley Jr., chairman and chief executive. "The continued U.S. recession, together with the weakening business environment in Europe, were major contributors to our disappointing order results in the second quarter. These poor business conditions, coupled with the stronger U.S. dollar, make it unlikely that we will achieve the record levels of revenue and earnings per share attained in 1990."
The merger is pending approval by Government regulators and by NCR's shareholders at a meeting planned for the fall.

HEADLINE: The Bank Merger;
For New York, A Loss of Jobs And Revenues

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
The merger of Chemical Bank with Manufacturers Hanover may make a lot of banking sense, because the two weak banks, by combining, have a chance to emerge as a stronger, more vibrant lending institution.
But for New York City and other communities, this merger and the larger consolidation in the banking industry will bring a lot of pain as institutions slim down, trying to determine the number of branches and employees that will make them more profitable and bring them into the new banking era. 
 In the near term, however, the merger of the Chemical Banking Corporation with the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation means the loss to New York City of as many as 5,900 jobs, fewer tax dollars paid to a revenue-starved city and 70 branches and untold office space coming onto an already-glutted property market.
 
Industry Shrinking Faster
 The merger also signals a quickening in the pace of the banking industry's shrinkage -- a process that many analysts said was just beginning to get under way in New York City. While analysts think that Citicorp still has a lot of cost savings it can gain from simply streamlining its own operations, others looked to banking companies like Chase Manhattan, Marine Midland Banks and Bank of New York as potential merger candidates.
New York has long been home to some of the nation's largest and most prominent banking organizations. But a combination of soured loans to third world countries, greater competition for bread-and-butter corporate lending, and newcomers invading their turf from regional cities and abroad have made these titans' futures precarious.
Many banking analysts and economists viewed yesterday's merger announcement as just the beginning of a wave of consolidation. Indeed, Deputy Mayor Sally Hernandez-Pinero said yesterday that at a Gracie Mansion breakfast earlier this year, top bankers were in universal agreement that there would be more than one mega-merger before the year was out.
"I was shocked," said Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, who nonetheless admitted to being impressed that two such stalwarts in an industry known for its conservatism would finally decide to take such a painful step to insure their long-term survival.
 
Another Blow to City's Jobs
 A new round of layoffs in the banking industry will hit the city just as the well-publicized contraction on Wall Street seems finally to be abating. Although the banking and brokerage industries have each lost about 10,000 jobs in the last 12 months, the pace of those losses in the brokerage industry has slowed to a monthly rate of about several hundred in recent months, while those in the banking industry are running at about 1,000 a month.
"The banking industry's job losses will continue into the next year," said Rae D. Rosen, senior economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York. She said she expected the local recession to continue into 1992, with the economy showing no sign of growth until 1993 or 1994.
Coming on top of the 6,300 pink slips that were recently handed out to city employees, and the several thousand jobs that are expected to be cut from the Pan Am Corporation, this latest announcement is certainly not good news for the city.
 
Calls to Governor and Mayor
 In recognition of how important this development is to the local economy, John F. McGillicuddy, the chairman of Manufacturers Hanover, called Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York early yesterday, while Chemical's chairman, Walter V. Shipley, called Mayor David N. Dinkins. The response, Mr. McGillicuddy said, was not surprising.
"No politician likes to hear about job cuts," he said at a news conference later in the day.
The merger is expected to result in the loss of about 6,200 jobs, 95 percent of them in New York City. Those figures could be reduced still further, depending on the rate of attrition at the two banks over the coming months.
Although some senior-level jobs are likely to be lost because of the consolidation of overlapping administrative functions, most of the cuts are expected to come from the banks' clerical ranks and back-office workers. And that could have important social consequences.
 
Minorities and Women Affected
 "Over half of the jobs in banks are clerical, and in the past they have provided a significant source of upward mobility for minority employees, and especially women," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Aside from the job losses, New Yorkers will likely notice the closing or sale of 70 bank branches, which will be concentrated in Manhattan, especially downtown. There will be no closings of Chemical's branches in New Jersey or Texas.
Bank executives yesterday gave no specifics on which branches in New York City would be closed, and little detail about what criteria they would use, although they gave assurances that no neighborhood would be left bereft. The New York State Superintendent of Banks, Derrick D. Cephas, who has been on the job for one week, said that his department would have some contribution to the final decision-making process.
He noted that the closing of a branch that was next door to another branch would not matter, but that if there were only one branch in a neighborhood, "we would certainly take a different view," he said.
 
First and Third in Serving City
 According to a list prepared by the Department of Finance that ranks how well banks do in serving city neighborhoods, Chemical Bank was in first place and Manufacturers Hanover third.
Both banks have also been active in philanthropic efforts that benefit the city: Manufacturers Hanover with its sponsorship of the New York City Marathon and corporate challenge races, and Chemical with its sponsorship of the Metropolitan Opera's concerts in Central Park and other outdoor venues. A spokesman for Chemical said those commitments would not change.
The outlook is less bright, however, for the real estate market. The closing or sale of bank branches will put more pressure on the market for sublet retail space, which is already weak. In the 53 square blocks that make up the Grand Central business district, for instance, the vacancy rate for retail space is higher than 11 percent.
 
Effect on the Office Market
 Chemical's announcement that it intended to vacate its executive offices at 277 Park Avenue, at 48th Street, which it has leased until mid-1994, and to move into Manufacturers Hanover's headquarters across the avenue will also hurt the office market.
Chemical currently leases about 750,000 square feet in its Park Avenue offices, and real estate specialists said the sudden arrival on the market of that much premium office space would hurt landlords with space available in less attractive areas or in slightly older buildings.
"The impact on the city now will not be good in the short term," said Jerry L. Cohen, chairman of William A. White/Grubb & Ellis, a real estate firm. Further consolidation is expected in the two banks' back-office operations, situated in New York City, Long Island and New Jersey.
Still, large bank mergers have been anticipated by many in the real estate industry for some time. Salomon Brothers' real estate analyst, David Shulman, said that he had been assuming that a transaction like this would occur for so long that it had become a precondition, in his mind, to future improvement in New York City real estate. He said that he, too, expected another merger involving large New York banks and that as far as he was concerned, the sooner the city got the pain over with, the better.

HEADLINE: The Bank Merger;
From Wonder Boys to Survivors

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
As they emerged, smiles brimming, from the unveiling of the new Chemical Banking Corporation, the tall, youthful-looking chairman of the old Chemical, Walter V. Shipley, turned to the portly, silver-haired chairman of the new Chemical, John F. McGillicuddy, to offer a bankerly version of the athlete's high-five.
"Nice job, John," Mr. Shipley said. 
 "Congratulations, kid," Mr. McGillicuddy answered, before retiring to another floor of the Helmsley Palace Hotel for a big cigar.
The familiarity, say people who know both men, wasn't forced. Their differences of size, manner and shape -- even their new hierarchy -- belie a long personal relationship and common struggles that led them into sudden partnership in the country's second-largest bank.
Neither man has much difficulty recalling the days when they were considered banking's wonder boys. And attending to troubles that were emblematic of their industry's afflictions, both look today more like survivors.
At 60, an age that many senior banking executives might consider their prime, Mr. McGillicuddy, the last chairman of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, might be better described as battle-scarred.
Not five years ago, he could look down from his suite on the eighth floor of 270 Park Avenue at a bank saddled with more Latin American loans as a percentage of assets than any other major American bank, one of the country's heaviest energy-loan portfolios, and a higher percentage of bad loans than any competitor except Bank of America. Rating services downgraded big portions of the bank's debt and analysts gave the bank long odds to bounce back.
When the bank, known as Manny Hanny, was described as "the Wonder Bread of banks" -- nice, airy, not too substantial -- the moniker seemed not to go away. When it was said to be a nice place to work, that was not always meant as a compliment. And the bank's chairman and chief executive took a similar rap. Though one of the nation's more visible money-center bankers, Mr. McGillicuddy often appeared, smoking his cigar, in a seemingly somber mood.
Not long after he became chairman in 1978, the bank gained notoriety for a deal with the New York State Republican Party to pay the party $2.50 for every member it signed up for a Manufacturers Hanover Visa card. Later came the mess with the nation's money supply: accounting errors so huge by Manufacturers Hanover clerks that financial reporting for the entire country was mixed up. And in the days when "financially troubled" and "Chrysler Corporation" went together always, Manufacturers Hanover and Chrysler seemed to go everywhere together.
Mr. McGillicuddy's strategy was presumed to be one of beating competitors at their best game. But as the game played itself out, some analysts and investors believed that where misguided lending executives ventured -- be it in the direction of underdeveloped nations or oil tankers -- Mr. McGillicuddy's men followed. Where the bank played cautious, it missed some of the killings that its rivals made for a time in investment banking, trading and consumer banking.
 
Staying Power
 Throughout the hard times, though, Mr. McGillicuddy never quite lost his noted sense of humor or the confidence of the bank's directors or investors. In 1985, the bank's top management was shaken up and its operations decentralized, but Mr. McGillicuddy stayed on top.
When Mr. McGillicuddy finally brought his bank out of the shadow of its old-style business, he did so boldly, selling control of its CIT Financial Corporation to Japan's largest bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, and slashing costs in its overseas operations.
And when Mr. McGillicuddy and Mr. Shipley of Chemical first met to discuss seriously the possibility of a merger two or three years ago, Manufacturers Hanover's pending sale of a 60 percent interest of the CIT group was one of the major stumbling blocks, Mr. McGillicuddy said in an interview yesterday.
Not that Mr. Shipley didn't carry some obstacles -- and some scars -- of his own.
Now 55, the Chemical chairman, who will be president and chief operating officer in the new bank, jokes that he did not take command of his bank as quite the whiz kid that his new boss, who took over Manufacturers' presidency at 40, was. "I waited to the ripe old age of 47," Mr. Shipley said. (Mr. McGillicuddy did not become a chief executive until he was nearly 49.)
 
'Tempering Process'
 Mr. Shipley is quick to add that the crucible of the banking industry has been the period that coincides with his tenure that began in 1983. "I think we've both been through a very important learning and maturing and tempering process over these years," he said, including Mr. McGillicuddy.
Like Manufacturers Hanover, the Chemical bank of the 1980's weathered its share of turmoil from foreign loans. When he took over, Mr. Shipley said, about 40 percent of the bank's loans were international. Worse, its success at making money as a money center institution was waning. In late 1986, Chemical agreed to buy the Houston-based Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. for $969 million as the first out-of-state bank to venture into the oil patch that was then ablaze with losses.
Analysts groaned that Mr. Shipley had paid too much, and, indeed, the bank racked up years of losses. (Other Texas acquisitions included Government assistance.) A New Jersey bank acquisition in 1988, Horizon Bancorp of Morristown, has also been a loser, Mr. Shipley concedes.
Last year, fueled by rumors that the bank's bad loans were mounting and its commercial paper could not find takers, Chemical stock was plummeting. Some analysts described it as the weakest of the major New York banks.
Chemical's rebound, beginning with a first-quarter profit of $152 million last year, was clearly a precondition to yesterday's merger pact. But as they discussed the evolution of their deal in separate interviews yesterday, the two chairman also attributed considerable import to the chemistry between them.
 
'Culturally Similar'
 "Anybody in this town who's had his eyes and ears open has been cognizant of the potential economics of an in-market consolidation," Mr. Shipley observed. But he added, "You've got to have two chairmen who are willing to share responsibility. You've got to have two people who are culturally similar."
Or, as Mr. McGillicuddy put it, "It really started with us."
Although the two men are not close friends, they go back a long way. Early in their careers, both were hard-traveling lenders working in their banks' national divisions. They remembered meeting over dinner in a Kansas City steakhouse in the early 1960's, though they couldn't recall exactly when.
For privacy, the first meeting that led to yesterday's deal took place at the Intercontinental Hotel. Mr. McGillicuddy said that initially both men "were really testing each other.
Their deputies devised a cloak-and-dagger system of code words. Chemical was "Symphony," named for a software program used by the bank to analyze bank mergers, and Manufacturers Hanover was "Vanguard" a name it had used before.
From the beginning, Mr. McGillicuddy added, they agreed about who would be chairman. As for his new boss's head-patting yesterday, Mr. Shipley was philosophical.
"John refers to everybody as 'kiddo,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Considers Shorter Workweek To Save Some Jobs

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New York City's municipal hospital workers' union has proposed saving the jobs of hundreds of its laid-off members by temporarily shortening their workweek to three or four days at reduced pay, and the Dinkins administration has agreed to discuss the idea.
The decision to discuss the proposal was aimed mostly at averting a one-day work stoppage today by hospital orderlies and janitors to protest the layoffs. Last night the hospital workers' union voted to postpone the walkout. 
 The union is proposing that its members work fewer hours and be paid accordingly. It is not clear how much money such a plan could save, whether it would be attractive to other city unions, whose workers are better paid, or even whether the city will agree to it.
But concessions from municipal unions are how the Dinkins administration hopes to restore the worst of the service cuts and thousands of layoffs in its just-adopted budget. Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday called the talks with the hospital workers "substantial progress."
Negotiations with the main city workers union, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, have swung up and down in the last several weeks, with the city insisting on a comprehensive package of money-saving concessions before it considers early-retirement programs and a guarantee to rehire permanent Civil Service workers first.
Senior city officials said the talks with the hospital workers local showed promise. But if the city reaches a broader agreement on concessions with the 140,000-member District Council 37 -- the hospital union's parent organization -- any agreement with the hospital workers might become part of it. Negotiators for the city and unions are to meet again today.
 
Broad Demands on Table
 Neither side would spell out specifics. But Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, said his union and Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters were awaiting the city's response to a six-point list of demands they presented at their last session on Friday. It includes, he said, such issues as rehiring permanent workers first.
"If we come to an overall understanding, it would include the hospital workers, as well as everybody else, and make this unnecessary," one senior mayoral aide said.
 
'Not a Permanent Thing'
 James Butler, president of Local 420 of the hospital workers union, said any shorter workweek would be a temporary measure to restore the jobs of nearly 900 of his 14,000 members who have been laid off. He said he expected it to be necessary only until the economy improved or more Federal or state funds became available.
"It's not a permanent thing," Mr. Butler said. "It's like a relief. We've got members on the street and some who are about to be evicted. I'm concerned about protecting them and making sure they get some food in their belly and that they don't become homeless or go to a shelter."
If a shortened workweek is adopted, the city would seek to have the plan qualify under a state program in which employees might be eligible for state unemployment benefits for the portion of the week they do not work.
The program, known as Shared Work, basically allows employers who have to lay off a certain percentage of their workforces to reduce the employees' work schedules by the same percentage instead. But the program is governed by complex rules and cannot run more than 20 consecutive weeks, and the city might not qualify.
In effect, the program would be a variation on the unpaid furlough programs the city has been discussing for months but that the unions have resisted. City officials said a labor management team appointed by the Mayor was studying how much money might be saved.
Officials with other unions said they believed such a plan might not be so appealing to other unions. The hospital aides Mr. Butler represents are among the city's poorest paid workers. Many are one step away from welfare and they have a high turnover rate, so the union is especially concerned about protecting their jobs.

HEADLINE: For Haitians, Voyage to a Land of Inequality

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 12

 BODY:
Riding calm seas, with thunder crackling across a hazy night sky, 163 men, women and children jammed aboard a leaky Haitian fishing boat called Conail were 30 miles from Miami when they were stopped July 7 by the Coast Guard cutter Baranof on border patrol.
Following procedures, Coast Guard officers ordered the people off the Conail and on board the Baranof. Of the 163 people on board, 161 were Haitians trying to escape the grim poverty of their homeland. The other two were Cubans whose flimsy raft had been plucked from the water by the Haitians in a gesture of brotherhood. 
 But when the Cubans were allowed to stay while most of the Haitians were sent back, Haitians living in the United States were infuriated and called attention to a double standard in United States immigration policy.
The incident has reopened a longstanding dispute over the favored treatment that Cuban refugees have enjoyed in the United States since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. Simply put, Cuban refugees are treated differently from immigrants of every other nation because the Cuban Government, unlike those of other nations, refuses to take them back.
The Cubans on the fishing boat that Sunday night, 26-year-old professors who are cousins, were brought to shore and were soon allowed to travel to New York to be with relatives. But all but 9 of the 161 Haitians, once so close to the United States that they could have seen the lights of Miami glowing on the horizon, were returned to Haiti by the Coast Guard.
Three of the nine are being considered for political asylum on grounds that they fear persecution if they return to Haiti. Six were so ill from the voyage that they were taken by helicopter to a Miami hospital.
"If this is a country of immigrants, then why are some immigrants treated like princes and others treated like dogs?" said Rolande L. Dorancy, executive director of the Haitian Refuge Center in Miami, a not-for-profit group that assists Miami's Haitian community. "The United States system is not our friend."
Immigration officials say they have no choice but to let the Cubans stay. The special treatment that only Cubans receive also extends to gaining residency. Under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Cubans who are not considered a threat to society are automatically granted permanent-resident status after being in the United States for one year.
Haitians, like Mexicans, Dominicans, Jamaicans, Salvadorans and the natives of other nations in the Western Hemisphere who arrive on United States shores illegally, all can be returned home. They usually are, unless they are granted political asylum here, which only a few manage to get.
The number of Haitians trying to enter the United States has dropped substantially since a democratic government was elected in Haiti in February. But after decades of dictatorship and poverty, many still make the risky voyage. At the same time, deteriorating conditions in Cuba have sent a wave of more than 1,200 refugees so far this year to Miami -- further inflaming the resentment of Haitians who watch their compatriots turned away while Cubans are given shelter.
 
Images of Inequity
 Such a policy sometimes creates searing images of inequity. Two Dominicans who recently survived being encased in a wooden shipping container for the passage from the Dominican Republic while six of their compatriots inside the container died, will probably be sent back to Santo Domingo, immigration officials said. But five Cubans who stole a crop duster and flew it to Miami last month are on the way to becoming permanent residents of the United States.
"If you compare Cubans to Haitians or to any other nationality in the world, they would not come out equitable," acknowledged Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. "There's nothing perverse or discriminatory about it. It's the law."
But many people question why such a law exists for one group of people and not for another. "Here they are, two relatively poor island nations, both a few hundred miles from the United States, both having had authoritarian governments," said Anne Fuller, associate director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, a nonprofit organization in New York. "There are so many parallels between Cuba and Haiti, and yet there's this difference in treatment. That's what's shocking."
Ms. Fuller said she believed that racism was partly to blame for the double standard, since many Cubans are white but all Haitians are black. She also said she thought that the Haitians were not protected because they lacked political power. Attempts in Federal courts to force the Government to change the policy have failed.
Estimates of the Haitian population in the United States range widely and often are inaccurate because so many immigrants do their best to stay hidden. But Ms. Fuller said the Haitian population in the United States exceeds 400,000. The largest community is in New York, where as many as 200,000 may live, Ms. Fuller said.
Miami's Little Haiti, about 200 city blocks of sun-bleached concrete buildings and an array of shops, is estimated to be 60,000 people.
Most of the Haitians in the United States are now legal residents. Some came through regular immigration channels and others who came illegally gained legal status under the recent immigration amnesty program .
In Miami, the Haitians are just one more group of immigrants in a city swept by waves of immigrants. So far the Haitians, separated by their color and their French-Creole language from many of Miami's Hispanic groups, have gained little economic or political power. Relations between the Haitians and the Spanish-speaking ethnic groups are often strained.
 
A Beating Is Protested
 Earlier this month, a group of 52 Haitian residents sued the City of Miami in Federal Court. They contend that police officers beat and unfairly arrested them a year ago when they demonstrated outside a Cuban-owned clothing store. They were protesting the alleged beating of a Haitian customer by the Cuban shopkeeper over alterations for a pair of pants.
Some Haitian residents said they believe tensions have worsened in Miami in recent years, especially between Haitians and Cubans, who often are seen as powerful and privileged.
"When I first came here, every people was happy," said Edward Ogeris, a 34-year-old dietician in a food-service department who came from Haiti in 1979, several years before the United States began to intercept the boats. "Today is a different story. Today, if there are 10 Cuban people and 10 Haitian people looking for a job, they make the Haitians fill applications and then never call them. The Cuban people fill the applications and get all the jobs."
With the exception of the massive Mariel boatlift in 1980, Cuban refugees since the Communist takeover have generally managed to fit into the United States. In 1988 a Cuban-American organization, the Cuban American National Foundation, entered a special agreement with the United States Government in which it essentially handles Cuban immigration policy.
 
Some Cubans Sympathize
 For the last three years, the foundation, with headquarters in Miami, has screened, selected and settled almost 8,000 Cuban "balseros," the name given to the desperate refugees who arrive in rafts, inner tubes, and anything else that floats onto the United States mainland. It was the foundation that, within a day of the arrival of the two Cubans on board the Conail, had interviewed them, located an aunt in New York and arranged for transportation and a job.
For most Haitians, the voyage to the United States is lined with fear and frustration. Those who are not turned away at sea are taken by immigration officials to the Krome Avenue Detention Center in Miami, where they can be kept behind barbed wire for months while their petitions for asylum are reviewed. Most are denied asylum and sent back home, but immigration officials said accounts of their fearful stays at Krome act as a deterrent to other would-be refugees.
After years of pressure from groups such as the Haitian Refuge Center, the Government recently changed some of its immigration policies. Starting last January, Haitians caught trying to come into the United States illegally have been given more extensive interviews, lasting about 20 minutes instead of 5 as before, to establish their claims for political asylum.
 
Asylum for Lucky Few
 In the 10 years before the change, some 23,000 Haitians were stopped as they attempted to enter the United States illegally, according to the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees. Of those, only eight were granted political asylum, even through the years when Haiti was ruled by the dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Since the longer interviews were begun in January, 17 Haitians have been identified as eligible for asylum. So far this year, six or seven Haitian boats carrying about 800 people have been intercepted, as against 1,196 in all of 1990, before democracy came to Haiti, and 3,368 in 1989, according to the coalition.
Many Haitians find a bitter irony in the changes coming now that Haiti for the first time has a democratically elected Government under Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But though the incident aboard the Conail has angered Haitians in Miami because it reminds them of the unequal treatment they receive, the new Government in Haiti, six months old and still full of promise, fills the shops and streets of Little Haiti with hope.
"Haitians know that surviving in Miami is tough," said Rev. Thomas G. Wenski, the Creole-speaking pastor of Notre-Dame d'Haiti Parish in Little Haiti. "The community has gone through a tremendous amount of things to be frustrated about. But the people are still on a little bit of a high because of their hopes for a Democratic Haiti."

HEADLINE: The Last Arms Accord?;
Both Sides Are Weary, and There Seems A Scant Constituency for Further Treaties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Even as the United States and Soviet Union near completion of a landmark arms treaty, the momentum for future and more radical arms control agreements seems to have dissipated.
 It is not that the strategic arms treaty is unimportant. On the contrary, it is a milestone in arms control. It will be the first accord to reduce, rather than limit, the Soviet and American long-range nuclear arsenals. It will establish verification arrangements that could serve as a framework for future accords, big or small.
 
Agreement After So Long
 But the strategic arms accord will also leave each side with a formidable nuclear arsenal. Because Moscow and Washington have found it so difficult to wrap up this accord, it is unclear whether they can muster the necessary enthusiasm for pressing ahead with more far-reaching agreements. 
 The predominant mood, in fact, appears to be one of relief that these talks are finally being brought to an end after nine years.
When the Bush Administration took office, it looked as if Moscow and Washington would wrap up the strategic arms treaty, which by then was largely complete, and then move on to a more ambitious agreement that would make deeper cuts. But the new, cooperative superpower relationship created a paradox: While arms control treaties seemed easier to negotiate, the need for them also seemed less urgent.
 
Why Moscow Balked
 As it turned out, completing the treaty took more than two years. In Moscow, a surge in the influence of the military and the departure late last year of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, limited Soviet flexibility, while political and economic crises distracted the leadership.
The Bush Administration, for its part, never appeared to make completion of the treaty its top arms control priority. Instead, the Administration focused on completing an agreement reducing conventional forces in Europe. The gulf war also diverted attention from arms control.
Another factor hampering the strategic arms talks was that the national security bureaucracies on each side lagged behind the political leadership. Administration officials say the military and civilian experts often maneuvered for advantages and treated concessions as potential risks to security.
The talks on the strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start, began in June 1982. By the end of the Reagan Adminstration, the framework of the agreement, and many of its detailed provisions, had been established.
Under the accord, the overall number of nuclear weapons in each side's arsenal will be cut by 25 to 30 percent. The American arsenal will be reduced from about 12,000 warheads and bombs to about 9,000, while Moscow's arsenal is to be reduced from about 11,000 to about 7,000.
In terms of overall weapons levels, the treaty would maintain the expansion that has taken place over the last decade. But the force of 308 heavy SS-18 missiles that Moscow had when the talks began would be cut in half. The SS-18 has long been deemed by the United States to be the most threatening Soviet nuclear system because of its accuracy and throw-weight, or payload-carrying capacity.
 
Not a Total Solution
 By itself, the agreement will not eliminate the threat that Moscow's arsenal poses to the American land-based missile force. By limiting the magnitude of the threat, however, it can make it more practical for the United States to take steps to make its arsenal of long-range weapons less vulnerable to attack -- by developing mobile land-based missiles, for example.
In completing the accord, Moscow has put aside its demand that Washington agree to strictly limit the scope of "Star Wars" tests. The Soviet move reflects an apparent calculation that Congressional opposition to a space-based defense and budgetary constraints will effectively limit any push to develop the "Star Wars" system.
Moscow may, however, issue a statement when the Start treaty is signed, putting Washington on notice that the development of a "Star Wars" defense would cause the Soviet Union to reconsider its commitment to reduce its strategic arsenal.
Now that the two sides are resolving their differences over a long-range arms treaty, however, it is not clear if they have the desire to press on.
In Moscow, Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh said in an interview with the Soviet press agency Tass that the agreement "is a fantastically complex penetration into the heart of strategic balances and technologies, and I cannot exclude the possibility that this is also the last treaty of its kind."
 
U.S. Initiative Rebuffed
 Bush Adminstration officials say there has been little recent discussion within the Government about a treaty to make greater reductions in the two sides' long-range arms. Early last year, they proposed a ban on land-based missiles with multiple warheads as a possible follow-on agreement, but the Soviets rejected it as one-sided and the proposal was put aside.
The difficulties the two sides have had in completing the arms accord, Edward L. Warner of the Rand Corporation said, "does not augur well for an immediate drive to another big treaty, which produces deeper reductions."
And Richard R. Burt, the former strategic arms negotiator, said: "I suspect neither side will want to rush into a negotiation right away. There will clearly be a pause for reflection."
The sense that the nuclear-arms-control process is losing momemtum has set off a debate in the United States over how actively to seek a further agreement making far deeper cuts.
Many experts outside the Government have suggested seeking further reductions, to a level of about 3,000 to 4,000 warheads and bombs. The withdrawal of Soviet conventional forces from Eastern Europe, the improvement in American-Soviet relations and the costs of supporting a sizable nuclear arsenal, they say, all point to the need to make further cuts.
The Bush Administration has never said how far it thinks the American arsenal could be cut without eroding the ability to deter a nuclear attack.
But some some Administration officials are skeptical about the proposals to begin a drive for much deeper cuts.
They say that because arms control is no longer the centerpiece of American-Soviet relations, there is not a pressing need for new talks that could prove to be as difficult as the old ones.
In addition, some officials argue that deeper cuts would not necessarily reduce the risk of war. As long as each side has a deterrent force that can survive an attack, they say, a deliberate nuclear strike is unthinkable. Future arms control efforts, they argue, should focus less on reducing weapons and more on ways to improve the political and physical control over nuclear weapons and prevent their accidental launch, a growing concern given the domestic crisis in the Soviet Union.
The new arms treaty, they suggest, might be the last of the comprehensive strategic arms accords worked out by teams of negotiators in Geneva to regulate the superpower competition. Instead, they suggest, a better course might be to seek occasional changes in this treaty to improve its terms, including possible reductions.
 
Little Enthusiasm Seen
 Mr. Burt said that he thought deep arms reductions could be achieved without jeopardizing the American ability to deter an attack. But he said that new talks would prove to be very difficult, given the determination by each side to restrict the other's main areas of strategic advantage.
"I think we could go down to as low as 3,000 on a side," he said. "I just don't see a lot of enthusiasm for doing it."
The emerging dispute over the future of nuclear arms control, as much as the technical terms of the agreement, will be a central issue in the debate over Congressional approval of the treaty.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Europe, has said as much, arguing that the agreement should be regarded as a stepping stone toward deeper cuts to be worked out at formal talks that have the high-level backing of leaders in Moscow and Washington.
"The treaty favors the United States, but still leaves the superpower with Armageddon arsenals that far exceed any rational need," he said.

HEADLINE: Fishing and Pollution Imperil Coastal Fish, Several Studies Find

 BODY:
FISH are disappearing at an alarming rate in United States coastal waters, and nearly one-third of all species have declined in population in the last 15 years, researchers say.
In separate reports, a Massachusetts agency and two national environmental groups have reached the same conclusion about the fish population off the coast: unless the National Marine Fisheries Service imposes stricter conservation measures and fishing regulations, many fish species may decline or be wiped out in the next decade. 
 "The plundering of our coastal waters has imperiled most fish species," said Amos S. Eno, director of conservation programs for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, a nonprofit conservation group in Washington, which recently issued a report on the management policies of the Federal agency.
From haddock and flounder off Georges Bank in New England to Spanish mackerel off the Gulf of Mexico to striped bass off California, many fish species are threatened by overfishing and an advancing tide of pollutants and urban development on the coastline that have degraded habitats and wetlands, which fish use as spawning and migrating grounds.
The National Marine Fisheries Service, which controls and regulates 2.2 million miles of coastal waters, says it is taking steps to control fish depletion, including tougher restrictions on net sizes and quotas.
"The bottom line is that there is a strong recognition that fish depletion has become a dire situation," said Roddy Moscoso, a spokesman for the agency. "The traditional belief that the fisheries are open to anyone with a boat does not work."
 
Fear Over Food Chain
 Scientists say that a change in the population of any one species of fish, particularly those at the top of the food chain, could have unforeseen effects on marine environments, disrupting ecosystems and affecting birds, marine mammals and smaller organisms that depend on fish and their habitats to survive.
Nearly one-fifth of the world's annual fish and shellfish harvests is caught within 200 miles of the United States coastline. Yet only 15 percent of those fish species are yielding stocks near their potential level, according to the report by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
At least 14 species found off coastal waters are in danger of being depleted, including Atlantic salmon, swordfish, Pacific Ocean perch, shad, California halibut, mackerel, cod, haddock and flounder, the three studies found.
In New England, overfishing has devastated so many species that most highly valued fish are being replaced by those of lower value, which are better able to survive, the study by the Massachusetts Offshore Groundfish Task Force found.
"The 1990's will definitely be a time of reckoning in the fishing industry," said Brian J. Rothschild, a biologist at the University of Maryland. "Technically, you can stop overfishing as quickly as you can snap your fingers. But nobody is doing it."
All three reports, by the Massachusetts task force, the Center for Marine Conservation, and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, recommend that the fisheries service restrict commercial catches to allow fish stocks to recover. It would take 5 to 10 years to recover depleted stocks with little or no fishing, said John P. Wise, author of the report by the Center for Marine Conservation, a nonprofit group based in Washington.
 
Pollution's Wide Effect
 Fish tend to be more resilient than wildlife, and few reach the point of extinction. But biologists say they are increasingly concerned about preserving habitats from pollution, development and energy projects.
Bays, estuaries and wetlands are among the most imperiled habitats. The study by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation found that pesticide contamination has been found in 21 of 78 estuaries -- the coastal bays, inlets and rivers where fresh water mixes with shallow salt water to provide a rich environment for marine life and to support most of the nation's commercial catch.
In Puget Sound, groundfish like cod, haddock, flounder and pollack have had an alarming incidence of cancerous liver tumors caused by pollutants. In San Francisco Bay, the population of striped bass has declined 60 to 80 percent because of contamination.
In the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds of North Carolina, low levels of dissolved oxygen in the water have suffocated hundreds of thousands of striped bass, crabs and eels.
Urban development continues its steady encroachment.
The Atlantic salmon, historically a vibrant denizen of wild, free-flowing rivers, had been eliminated from New England, except for Maine; its upstream passage to spawning grounds has been blocked by dams.
On the Connecticut River, Atlantic salmon must pass five dams before reaching good spawning grounds, and it is estimated that 40 percent of the fish never make it up stream.
Biologists are also tackling the problem of overfishing. They say that fishermen recognize they are just on the edge of destroying the marine environment and allowing it to survive.
In New England, overfishing has drastically changed the population of fish stocks, the the Massachusetts study found.
On Georges Bank, highly valued stocks like sole, pollack, yellowtail flounder and fluke, which composed 65 percent of all fish stocks in the 1960's, now make up only 25 percent of all stocks there. But now they have been replaced by lower-valued species like spiny dogfish, skate and shark, said Steven A. Murawski, head of population dynamics for the Northeast Fisheries Center in Woods Hole, Mass., a branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service, and an author of the Massachusetts study.
Mr. Murawski said that while fish populations tended to rise and fall in cycles, the current decline had permanently changed the dynamics of Georges Bank.
 
Scientist as Advocate
 "This isn't fiction, it's physics," he said. "It's uncomfortable for a scientist to be an advocate, but we are looking at the facts of a declining fish population."
Biologists are concerned that too many species are being depleted as factory ships tow large nets across the ocean, sweeping paths clean of all living creatures and leaving long, empty corridors in their wake.
In Alaska, once-abundant pollack populations have dwindled since the fish became popular in fast-food restaurants, where it is processed into fillets.
Anne Kinsinger, author of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation report, said:. "There is very little known about fish, how they survive and the effects on the ecosystems. Environmentalists don't want to touch the idea of fish conservation. People giggle if you talk about saving fish."
The report by the Center for Marine Conservation said that there were no biological or catch data for nearly 30 percent of all fish species, and that more species may be in decline but that there is little information on them.
Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service blame foreign fleets that raided the fishing grounds before Congress passed the Magnuson Act in 1976, which banned foreign fishing within 200 miles of the coast.
But the reports state that the rise in commercial fishing came about because the agency's eight regional councils are dominated by local fishing interests. Industry representatives say they are simply complying with Federal rules.
"There is much talk about the poor fisherman dying on the vine, but they have brought it on themselves," said Giulio Pontecorvo, an economist at Columbia University who has studied the effect of overfishing on the economy. "It is largely the inability of the National Marine Fisheries Service to get the industry under control."

Infestation by Worm Is Contained in Africa

 BODY:
A RAPIDLY growing, potentially catastrophic infestation by the New World screwworm in Libya has been contained by an emergency eradication effort, officials of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations say.
The infestation, the first ever outside North and South America, had raised alarms that the pest, if unchecked, would extend deep into the heart of Africa, devastating livestock and wildlife. 
 But an airlift of billions of sterile male screwworm flies, organized by the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization, has evidently stemmed the infestation, allaying the worst fears of an economic and environmental disaster.
"It looks as though we are going to succeed in stopping it in Libya," Patrick Cunningham, who heads the emergency effort, said in a telephone interview from Rome.
The New World screwworm, or Cochliomyia hominivorax, was once widespread in the United States and Mexico, attacking livestock and, less frequently, humans. Unlike less destructive varieties of screwworm, the New World adult fly lays an average 200 eggs in open wounds or breaks on the skin; after hatching, its larvae burrow into the flesh, causing sickness and eventually death.
American and Mexican officials announced last year that they had finally suppressed it after a 20-year, $750 million effort, but pockets of infestations remain in Central and South America.
The screwworm was found in Libya in 1989. Dr. Cunningham said that officials suspected it had arrived on sheep imported from South America, possibly Uruguay. The screwworms spread quickly, infesting sheep, cattle and camels in an area the size of Massachusetts surrounding Tripoli, on the northwest coast.
The eradication effort, aided by 20 nations, including the United States, which has no diplomatic relations with Libya, began last December. Each Friday 40 million sterile males have been flown on a specially equipped chartered flight from a laboratory in southern Mexico and dispersed in Libya and parts of Tunisia.
The sterile males mate with the fertile females, creating sterile offspring. Since the weekly airlifts began, the number of infected animals has fallen from a high of nearly 3,000 in September 1990 to one in April and none since. The flights will continue until October "to be absolutely sure there's no residual," Dr. Cunningham said.
"If it were to escape from Libya and spread to the rest of Africa, the cost would be incalculable," he added. "It would inevitably be fatal to large populations of wildlife," which could never be inspected or treated.

Skidmore Architect Firm Names Its First Chairman

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, one of the world's biggest architectural and engineering firms, has announced the election of the first chairman in its 55-year history.
He is David M. Childs and will serve for a two-year period. The 50-year-old architectural design specialist will continue to be one of the firm's design partners. 
 The decision to create the new post of chairman came about, Mr. Childs said, because the firm has grown, with offices and projects under way in many foreign countries as well as at home.
"But the slowdown in the domestic and overseas economies has made this a challenging time for every firm related to the real estate, design and construction industries," he said.
Given this situation, Mr. Childs continued, "our partners decided to place one partner in a lead role so that the firm could respond rapidly to new opportunities and adapt to changing conditions."
Among his current projects, Mr. Childs said in a telephone interview from the firm's New York headquarters, is the redesign of the Columbus Circle project, which has been held up by a dispute between community groups, New York City and the developers. He is also redesigning the Riverside South development, another project on the West Side of Manhattan involved in a controversy over its size, and is involved in redesign and expansion of Dulles International Airport near Washington.
The firm is known for design and engineering work on Lever House, an office building on New York's Park Avenue. Skidmore, Owings has also received many awards for its Sears Tower and John Hancock buildings in Chicago, and is currently involved in what may become the world's largest airport terminal under one roof. The 108-acre terminal is under construction in Jidda, Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
A Painful Parting: Giants Waive an Injured Bavaro

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLORHAM PARK, N.J., July 15

 BODY:
In a move untypical for the Giants, who have traditionally been generous with injured players, the Super Bowl champions today waived Mark Bavaro, their onetime All-Pro tight end.
Bavaro and his agent, David Fishof, characterized the Giants' move as an economic decision. George Young, the Giants' general manager, said it was a medical decision. 
 The move came on the opening day of training camp. Ray Handley, the Giants' new head coach, confirmed that Bavaro had failed his preseason physical examination last Friday. In January 1990, Bavaro underwent reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Last February, he underwent another operation to replace dead bone in the knee with bone taken from his hip.
The Giants' announcement to the other National Football League clubs said they had dropped Bavaro by asking for "waivers -- failed physical." That was a warning to other teams that Bavaro was physically unsound, something those clubs knew.
 
Other Clubs Can Claim Him
 However, any club can claim Bavaro by 4 P.M. Tuesday. A club that takes him must pay his salary of $750,000 in what is the last year of a four-year contract. If Bavaro goes unclaimed, he can sign with any club for any salary he and the club agree on.
Bavaro said he intended to continue rehabilitation and wanted to play again, probably next season. If another club claimed Bavaro or signed him as a free agent, it could place him on the physically-unable-to-perform list until he was ready to play.
The Giants could have placed him on that list, too, but had they done so, they would have had to pay him his full salary. They could also have renegotiated Bavaro's contract, offering less money while retaining his rights. Instead, if no other club claims him, the Giants must pay him only a standard disability fee of $65,000.
"The doctor advised him against playing football again," Handley said. "The doctor didn't say he couldn't play football again."
Handley said that if Bavaro's knee became sound again, the Giants would be interested in signing him next year. Would Bavaro be willing to rejoin the team?
"Sure he would," said Fishof, his agent.
In his six seasons with the Giants, the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Bavaro became a prototype of the modern tight end. He was a fierce blocker and a sure pass receiver. He played despite frequent injuries, and last season he played on a swollen knee that left him in constant pain. Each week, he skipped a few practices to rest the knee.
Bavaro was soft-spoken today as he addressed the action taken by the Giants.
"These six years have been the best of my life," he said in a statement. "I have captured the American dream."
He has tried diligently to regain strength in the left knee. However, arthritis has caused the knee surface to flake off, the way asphalt flakes off a highway. The knee joints swell when Bavaro works on rehabilitation, and he is being treated with anti-inflammatory drugs.
Dr. Russell Warren, the Giants' orthopedic surgeon, conducted the examination Friday. For some time, Warren has urged Bavaro to retire and save the knee for normal living.
 
'No Chance to Play'
 The announcement of Bavaro's departure came at Handley's first training-camp news conference. Handley said the Giants were waiving Bavaro because "our medical people felt he had no chance to play this season."
Then Bavaro, who had stood behind Handley, read a statement:
"It was fairly obvious I wouldn't be ready for the season. I thought the Giants would let me rehabilitate. The Giants did not share that thought. I'd like to think they're cutting me more out of concern for my well-being than paying me for the last year of my contract."
In the statement, Bavaro thanked many people and had special praise for Bill Parcells, the head coach during his entire pro career.
"He was a man I sometimes hated but always respected," Bavaro said. "He took me in as a boy and made me a man."
When Bavaro finished the statement, he walked away before questions could be asked. So questions remained about his football future.
 
'Should Have Kept Him'
 Fishof said Bavaro was unhappy over the Giants' move.
"Mark feels the Giants should have kept him and put him on physically unable to perform," the agent said. "He thinks the Giants should have offered him a minimum of 50 percent of his contract. . . . Where most players would have quit last year, he played injured. The least the Giants could have done was pay part of his salary."
In recent years, the Giants have given contracts to such injured and ill players as Karl Nelson, Doug Kotar, Dan Lloyd, John Tuggle and Kevin Belcher. Of that group, only Nelson played for them again.
Young said the Giants waived Bavaro "for his well-being, not for financial reasons."
"The doctor said it was in his best interests to retire," Young said. "We have consultations with our medical staff and we make decisions."
With Bavaro gone, the holdover tight ends on the Giants are Howard Cross, who is unsigned, and Bob Mrosko.
Phil Simms, the Giants' quarterback during all of Bavaro's career, seemed sad about losing a favorite target.
"After the 1986 Super Bowl," Simms said, "I said the greatest tight end who ever played is a player for the Giants right now. I never saw Mike Ditka play, but a lot of people think if Mark continued to play at that pace, everyone would be compared to him."
 
 
 
EXTRA POINTS
 The Giants opened training camp minus 12 unsigned veterans, three unsigned draft choices and five signed players who failed to report on time. They did sign STEPHEN BAKER , the starting split end. They said they had also agreed to a contract with ZEKE MOWATT and expected him on the practice field Tuesday. Mowatt, a free agent, played tight end for the Giants from 1983 to 1989.
The unsigned veterans were JEFF HOSTETLER , OTTIS ANDERSON , DAVE MEGGETT , MARK INGRAM , STACY ROBINSON , HOWARD CROSS , JUMBO ELLIOTT , WILLIAM ROBERTS , PEPPER JOHNSON , MYRON GUYTON , REYNA THOMPSON and JOHN WASHINGTON . The unsigned draft choices are the first three picks: JARROD BUNCH , KANAVIS MCgHEE and ED McCAFFREY .
The signed players who missed Monday's meetings and wind sprints included LAWRENCE TAYLOR , STEVE DeOSSIE , ERIK HOWARD and LAWRENCE McGREW . LARRY MEDICE , a rookie free-agent guard, also did not report and did not pick up his plane ticket. Taylor arrived in the evening. He said he was delayed on a golf course, but he was not upset. He said he shot a 75.

HEADLINE: Summit in London;
Leaders of Wealthy Nations Open Conference in London

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 15

 BODY:
The leaders of the some of the world's wealthiest democracies began their 17th annual summit conference today with discussions of problems in Yugoslavia, the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, South Africa and most conspicuously the Soviet Union.
Prime Minister John Major of Britain, the host country for the three-day meeting, opened it with a ringing appeal for common efforts to "build a world partnership and strengthen international order." His key proposal called for "a stronger United Nations that is more of a peacemaker than a peacekeeper," which could respond more effectively to crises like that in Kurdistan this spring. 
 President Bush and his aides sought backing for his threat to bomb Iraq if it failed to destroy its nuclear-weapons installations. France endorsed the United States' position on Sunday, and Japan, Germany, Italy, Canada and Britain, the other conference participants, seemed ready to fall into line.
After a dinner meeting tonight at the Tower of London that marked the opening of the summit meeting, President Bush said he believed there "there would be strong, strong support" for military action to keep President Saddam Hussein from acquiring a nuclear arsenal.
 
'Terrible Danger'
 Although he cited only France and Britain as voicing public support for such action, he said he believed that "most countries, recognizing the terrible danger of this man going forward with a nuclear program, would be of the same mind."
British officials said the draft of a political declaration by the summit participants that will be released Tuesday would say that they note "the urgency and overwhelming nature of the humanitarian problems in Iraq" and that "they cannot stand idly by."
"As for the Iraqi people," the draft goes on, "they deserve the right to choose their leader openly and democratically."
Moving to exploit what President Bush described tonight as a Middle East "breakthrough" -- Syria's generally positive response on Sunday to American efforts to promote a peace conference -- the White House said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would travel to the region next week for the fourth time in recent months. The United States hopes to persuade Israel to rethink its opposition to a conference in light of Syria's latest declaration.
 
Last Obstacle to Arms Treaty
 While still here, Mr. Baker is expected to make one more attempt, in a meeting with Foreign Minister Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh of the Soviet Union, probably on Tuesday, to resolve the final issue delaying agreement on a strategic arms treaty. If he succeeds, senior American officials said, Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev might well be able to conclude arrangements when they talk on Wednesday for a meeting in Moscow late this month or early in August. Striking an optimistic note, Mr. Bush said the treaty was "99 percent of the way there."
"It's a close call," a ranking American official said when asked to assess the chances of reaching agreement, "because the last remaining technical question has significant political overtones for our side."
The question involves the definition, for treaty purposes, of what constitutes a new missile, and Mr. Bush and his political advisers want to make sure that the final language does not expose them to criticism, in the Senate and the electorate, if the Soviets develop a powerful new weapon.
Mr. Gorbachev's arrival late Tuesday, his luncheon with Mr. Bush on Wednesday and his expected appeal to the nations meeting here for help for his stricken economy has overshadowed other economic and political questions.
Japan, Canada, the United States and Britain are reluctant to commit much money to help Moscow and have expressed disappointment with the lack of specific commitments in the 23-page letter they received last week from Mr. Gorbachev outlining plans for liberalization. The Germans, French and Italians -- the big continental democracies that might have the most to fear from civil unrest or economic collapse in the Soviet Union -- are more eager to help.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said in his arrival statement that "an outbreak of instability in the Soviet Union cannot be in our interest."
The problem facing the Western leaders was how to resolve their differences, which almost certainly will mean minimal direct aid, while still sending Mr. Gorbachev away from London with his credibility intact at home.
According to officials of several countries, that will include limited membership of some sort in the International Monetary Fund, technical assistance and perhaps several other elements. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, briefing reporters tonight, said that the summit communique might call Soviet I.M.F. participation something less demeaning than "associate membership," which had been the original nomenclature.
Also under discussion were possible mechanisms for keeping track of Soviet progress toward a market economy, as an assurance to Moscow that the West was truly engaged in the question and ready to help as liberalization took hold. Canada proposed increasing the amount the Soviet Union would be permitted to borrow from the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Develoment.
Aides to Mr. Gorbachev stepped up the pressure on the leaders in advance of the Soviet President's arrival, with Yevgeny M. Primakov, a key Soviet envoy, declaring that his country faces the prospect of a "social uprising" if the rich Western countries do not help it. He also said on a British Broadcasting Corporation television program that failure here would weaken Mr. Gorbachev.
 
'A Grave Matter'
 Vitaly N. Ignatenko, Mr. Gorbachev's spokesman, went further, warning at a news conference that while no one expected "President Gorbachev to come away from this meeting with these black limos filled to the brim with money," it would be a grave matter if he was sent away empty-handed.
"If we do not achieve close cooperation, there could be turmoil not only in the Soviet Union but elsewhere," he said in an apparent suggestion that the Soviet armed forces and other right-wing elements might react badly. "There could be turmoil in the whole world. The internal situation in the Soviet Union would be rendered more complicated without Western help."
Vladimir I. Shcherbakov, the Soviet First Deputy Prime Minister, also said that in order to guarantee convertability of the ruble in the early phases of liberalization, so that foreign investors could export their profits, the Soviet Union would need a fund of about $10 to $12 billion from the West. He gave no details of how a fund would work.
Mr. Brady said there had been no previous discussion of such figures, even in the Gorbachev letter.
 
Dinner at Tower of London
 An American official who took part in today's discussions said the "range of differences has narrowed dramatically" between the United States and the continental Europeans on Soviet aid. But he conceded that "a certain ditch, if not a gulf" remained to be bridged.
Giulio Andreotti, the Italian Prime Minister, was quoted by aides as having said at the afternoon session, "No one wants to have it on his conscience that we didn't help" the Soviets.
"Nobody wants to send President Gorbachev away discouraged because we have all benefitted so much from the process of reform and want it to continue," commented Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary. "But equally I don't think anyone wants to start writing checks at this meeting."
Almost every delegation was pressing a pet political project. The Japanese, for example, were lobbying their allies for backing in their campaign to win control of disputed islands from the Soviet Union. Several countries proposed a register, under the control of the nations represented here, to keep track of arms sales, but the French reportedly resisted that.
Mr. Major's United Nations proposal, co-sponsored by the Germans, would set up an office to coordinate disaster relief, headed by an Under Secretary General reporting directly to the organization's chief.

HEADLINE: Syria's Reply Buoys Bush, Who Now Looks to Israelis

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 15

 BODY:
President Bush said here tonight that Syria's response to his proposal for convening a Middle East peace conference represented a "very positive breakthrough" and could pose "a good test" of Israel's desire to negotiate peace with its Arab adversaries.
Mr. Bush made his remarks late tonight as he left dinner at the Tower of London with the leaders of six other major industrial democracies, who are gathered here for their annual economic summit conference. 
 A few hours earlier, the White House announced that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would return to the Middle East on Thursday to seize any new momentum generated by Syria's acceptance of Mr. Bush's proposals.
 
'A Coming Forward'
 In hailing the Syrian reply to his peace initiave, Mr. Bush cautioned that there could still be hitches. But he said Syria's decision to accept the President's compromise represented "a coming forward" by President Hafez al-Assad.
Although the text of the Syrian acceptance letter has not been made public, those familiar with its contents say that Damascus has in effect accepted the principle of direct negotiations with Israel. But that acceptance hinges on the terms under which any peace conference is convened -- itself an area of deep dispute between Arabs and Israelis.
And as an intially negative response by the Israeli Government quickly made clear, word of a "positive" step by Syria, as filtered through an Admnistration eager to push the Mideast process forward, is not the stuff of which instant bargaining sessions are made.
The effort for a compromise began in June, when President Bush sent Israel and Syria a plan aimed at bridging differences over how to convene and give shape to any regional peace conference.
First, Mr. Bush proposed that the United Nations be represented at any conference by a single observer, who would not be allowed to speak or actively participate. Israel has insisted that the United Nations have no role, deeming it biased against Israel, while Syria had demanded that the organization sponsor the entire conference.
Second, Mr. Bush suggested that the conference, which would be co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union, should open with a ceremonial session, to be followed by separate bilateral meetings between Israel and the Arab parties. Then, at periodic intervals, and if all parties agreed, the full conference would reconvene to hear reports from the separate negotiating groups.
 Before reportedly accepting the Bush compromise, the Syrians had sought a conference with a formal opening and a permanent status, so that neither side could stall without any pressure for results.
Israel has said it wants any conference to have a purely ceremonial opening, with any subsequent direct talks between Israelis and Arabs evolving at their own pace. This way, there would be no outside authority empowered to monitor or assess the progress of the talks.
While Israel quickly rejected the new Bush Administration aproach, Syria spent the last six weeks asking Washington various questions to clarify the proposal. In a commentary on Syrian television on Sunday, President Assad was said to regard President Bush's proposals and the subsequent clarifications as "positive and balanced" and the "acceptable basis for achieving a comprehensive solution and a peace process in the region."
In Jerusalem today, Israel reasserted its earlier rejection of President Bush's peace plan, setting the stage for a possible new collision between Washington and Jerusalem when Mr. Baker arrives in Israel to try to persuade the Government to reconsider.
But Mr. Bush said tonight that he hoped that Israel would "get on board naturally."
He said Israel had "been wanting to talk with people in the area, and if all goes well here, that is exactly what will happen."
"They have made statements to us of wanting to do these things," he said, "so here will be a good test."
The Syrian move also puts pressure on Jordan and the Palestinians to form a single delegation for any peace conference.
In a letter delivered to the American Ambassador in Damascus on Sunday, President Assad said the American proposal constituted an "acceptable basis for achieving a comprehensive solution."
The text of the Syrian letter has not been released, and Mr. Baker said on Sunday that there were some points, which he did not specify, that Washington must still explore with Damascus.
Administration officials said in Washington that while the Syrian letter posed questions on various issues, it appeared to attach no conditions to accepting the American plan. The Administration does not plan to make the letter public, the officials said.
Mr. Bush also said today that his efforts to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union on reducing long-range nuclear weapons was "99 percent of the way there," and that a summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could still be held this month if a disagreement on a highly technical issue was ironed out.
Mr. Bush did not rule out resolving the issue during the London conference, where he will meet with Mr. Gorbachev and the other leaders, but he said he did not want arms control matters to overtake the summit agenda, which is primarily economic.
After his visit to the Middle East, Mr. Baker is expected to travel as scheduled next week to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to attend a meeting of Southeast Asian nations.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Estimate Is Lowered

BYLINE: By DAVID ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
The Bush Administration said today that the Federal budget deficit in the current fiscal year would be somewhat lower than was forecast in January, but it predicted a $348.3 billion deficit next year, far and away the largest ever.
Much of the change has little economic consequence because it represents the method of accounting for the costs of the war against Iraq and a shift of spending for the savings and loan bailout to next year from this year. 
 But the Administration, in its annual midyear budget review, also said tax receipts were now expected to be about $20 billion lower in both fiscal years than was previously thought and more than $40 billion less each year by the middle of the decade.
Administration officials had no explanation for the drop in tax collections this year and next, but one White House economist said it had to do with "technical re-estimates" and not the state of the economy. The estimates of lower revenues in later years, a Treasury official said, resulted from rewriting computer programs to take account of new tax data.
The projections still show the deficit falling steadily after next year, but the Administration is no longer forecasting a surplus by 1996, potentially President Bush's last full fiscal year in office.
The new budget rules the President and Congress agreed on last fall make the deficit much less important politically than it used to be.
Under the old rules, a specific deficit ceiling was set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law, and across-the-board spending cuts were required if the deficit was projected to be above the limit. As a result, changes in the overall economy and unforeseen costs like the savings and loan failures touched off crises almost annually.
The new rules are intended to achieve a lower deficit. But instead of focusing on the deficit figure itself, they set precise spending limits and require that additional spending be offset by cuts elsewhere or tax increases.
Last year at this time, budget negotiations between the White House and Congress were deadlocked. Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and other top Administration officials held a news conference predicting dire consequences if the deficit could not be cut.
This year, reporters were handed copies of the report. Mr. Darman had no statement and was not available for interviews, and other Administration officials who deal with the economy would speak only off the record.
The report also contained the Administration's latest economic forecasts: increases in the gross national product of eight-tenths of 1 percent this calendar year and 3.6 percent next year; an inflation rate of 3.4 percent this year and 3.9 percent next year, and an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent this year and 6.3 percent next year. The figures represented very slight changes from the January forecasts.
 
War Costs Estimated
 The report estimated the cost of the war against Iraq at $42.2 billion through May, with an ultimate cost of over $61 billion, Allies have pledged to contribute about $54 billion through the end of this year, and $44.5 billion has been received, the report showed.
The Administration now forecasts the deficit for the current fiscal year to be $282.2 billion, less than the $318.1 billion that was predicted in January. For the fiscal year 1992, which begins Oct. 1, the $348.3 billion deficit now projected compares with a January estimate of $280.9 billion.
The largest deficit ever was $221 billion in the 1986 fiscal year.
Part of the change results from the fact that contributions toward the war are being being received this year and counted as income, but much of the money will not be spent until next year.
Not counting the war and the deposit insurance costs, the deficit is expected to be about $200 billion through the 1993 fiscal year and then fall below $100 billion by 1996.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Keeneland Sales Proceed Cautiously

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky., July 15

 BODY:
M. C. Hammer and his two brothers weren't there, but Sheikh Maktoum bin Rashid al Maktoum and his three brothers were there monitoring developments on closed-circuit television as the first gavel fell today on the world's most important sale of thoroughbred horses.
It was the opening day of the July sale of yearlings at Keeneland race course, a kind of economic summit of the breeding and racing business and the surest barometer of the state of the horse business, which has been depressed for a half-dozen years. 
 During the first two days of the sale, 317 "selected yearlings" will be auctioned, and they are rated the prize pupils. On Wednesday, 150 other yearlings with less glamorous pedigrees will follow them into the ring.
The sale was expected to give the first clues to the ability of the horse business to bounce back from both the recession and the war in the Persian Gulf.
Sheikh Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, directs a horse empire that spent $60 million for thoroughbreds last year in the United States alone.
Most horse people did not predict any radical turn in the slumping domestic market for horses this week. And none developed in the opening two sessions, when 113 yearlings were auctioned at an average price of $306,759, about $1,600 more than last year's first-day total. By contrast, seven years ago the yearling Seattle Dancer was sold for a record price of $13.1 million.
 
Million-Dollar Purchases
 Today, the first plunge of the sale was made by Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum after eight yearlings had been sold for as low as $125,000. He bid $1.2 million for a King Ranch colt sired by Mr. Prospector. After nine more were sold at lower numbers, D. Wayne Lukas bid $1.15 million for a colt owned by Dr. William O. Reed and sired by Alydar.
But the day of the $13 million yearling is history, and horse people now are looking abroad for cash and comfort.
Even the catalogue listing the 467 horses was printed in Arabic, Japanese, French, German and English. And Keeneland distributed biographical sketches of Sheikh Maktoum and his brothers and of other "principal buyers," notably Prince Khalid Abdullah of the royal family of Saudi Arabia, Robert Sangster of Britain, Vincent O'Brien of Ireland, Zenya Yoshida of Japan, Dr. Koichiro Hayata of Japan, Lukas of California and the newest force in the business, the family of the rap singer M. C. Hammer. (Although members of the singer's family had said they intended to attend the sale, none were in sight on the first day.)
"All the major players are here," said James E. Basset 3d, chairman of the board of the Keeneland Association. "The strongest sales factor is that Keeneland horses are winning races all over the world. But we don't know how the sales will be affected by the recession or the war or even by the decline of Calumet Farm. You know, people may get into some gamesmanship, feeling out Calumet to see if they're vulnerable because they know Calumet's in no position to take their horses home."
Calumet, the most successful breeding and racing farm of the last half-century, bent under the weight of $93 million in debts last week and filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy laws. The farm's rise and fall gave an anxious tone to the market, and the farm offered only nine yearlings for sale.
But the most important sire at Keeneland this week was the Calumet champion Alydar, who died last November at a time when he was commanding stud fees that totalled $20 million a year. Twenty-seven of his offspring were being sold for various owners, more than any other sire.
People in the horse business were still betting that the Maktoum family and other foreign investors would sustain the horse sale, even at the low level of the last few years.
In 1984, at the peak of the horse market, the average price for a yearling in Keeneland's July sale was $544,681; last year the average was $352,009. Total sales in 1984 reached $175 million; last year, $82 million.
 
Glamour Still There
 Even so, the sale has kept its glamour. Two auctioneers in black tie sat on a high platform at the head of a plush auditorium, taking turns calling for bids in the chanting tobacco-auction style, while uniformed grooms led the yearlings into the ring before a high-level audience of 810 persons, who sat in reserved seats and gave hand-signals to raise the bids.

HEADLINE: Merging Police to Cut Costs: The Rub Is, Who's Boss?

SERIES: Common Solutions: Governments Cooperating -- Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEA GIRT, N.J.

 BODY:
This little seaside community and its neighbor across Wreck Pond, Spring Lake Heights, have started talks about merging their tiny police departments. And Tom Phillips, an 83-year-old resident of Baltimore Boulevard here, has a very basic question:
"Who will be in charge of setting the budget and deploying the cops?" 
 The inability to answer that question helped doom three other proposed police mergers in New Jersey recently. Now the bumpy search to resolve the question picks up here, with the debate echoing discussions taking place throughout the New York metropolitan area as governments seek economy and efficiency in such basic services as garbage collection, education and law enforcement.
Sea Girt, a square-mile image of oceanfront opulence with grand homes and broad lawns trimmed with flowers, has a nine-member police force. Spring Lake Heights, more middle class with an equal number of houses, condominiums and garden apartments in its 1.5 square miles, has 13 police officers.
 
Savings Would Be Shared
 Right now the plan is for Spring Lake Heights to send its officers to Sea Girt's department, along with enough money for their salaries and the cost of patrolling Spring Lake Heights. Savings, still uncalculated, would be shared equally, officials said. They promise no layoffs and no cuts in service.
But William Fury, the Police Chief in Spring Lake Heights, is angry, even though one of the borough's Councilmen, John E. Tully, an accountant, proposed the idea. The merger, Chief Fury says, would leave his department and community without a voice in future police planning. And he is fretting about what will happen to his department's three sergeants.
"They happen to have seniority over Sea Girt's two sergeants," Chief Fury said. "Will Sea Girt give them their seniority? Or are they going to be patrolmen?"
Sea Girt is noncommittal. "We want to do the fair and equitable thing," says Edward H. Ahern, Sea Girt's head of public safety and chief negotiator on the issue.
"What does fair and equitable mean?" responds Chief Fury. "That's no job guarantee."
 
Police Symbol Is Prized
 So goes the debate as the two shore towns, with 7,500 residents, nine police cars and minuscule crime rates, take on one of the most difficult problems of regionalization, itself never a simple matter. The uniformed police officer is a visible and coveted symbol of a community's safety, security and identity. Residents, and consequently mayors and other governing officials, abhor giving up "their own" departments, even though they are often the most expensive item in budgets, regional planners say.
Consequently 493 of New Jersey 567 communities have their own police departments. State police patrol the others.
Of the 493 communities, fewer than a dozen have tried police mergers. None got beyond the talking stage. The failed attempts involved Jamesburg, Spotswood and Helmetta in Middlesex County; Bridgewater and three neighbors in Somerset County; and Ridgefield and Fairview in Bergen County.
 
Other Mergers Studied
 Besides Sea Girt and Spring Lake Heights, governments now studying police mergers are Belmar and South Belmar, two small coastal towns near here, and Princeton Borough and Princetown Township.
It's not just attachment to home rule that can doom police merger plans. The logistics of merging police departments is far more complicated than an agreement to share a snow plow or a recycling center.
Which department's training regulations and hiring and promotion policies will be used? Which department's pay scale and health benefits package? Which radio frequency? Whose communications gear? Whose headquarters? Whose weapons, if one department uses .38-caliber revolvers and the other 9-millimeter automatics? Which chief will step aside for his colleague, usually his good friend, next door? And what will the merged department be named?
 
No Firm Guidelines
 "There is no book you go to that says 'this is how you do it,' " said Lars Oyen, the Police Chief in Ridgefield, N.J., and an advocate of regionalization on a limited scale. "I know a lot of the questions. But I don't have any answers. You have to have someone with the wisdom of Solomon to solve it."
Earlier this year Chief Oyen proposed merging Ridgefield's department with Fairview's in Bergen County. Fairview countered with a proposal to include three other towns. Chief Oyen considered a five-town merger far too complicated and pulled out.
"I told them, 'You call me back when the five mayors and the five councils merge and I can deal with one,' " he said.
Chief Fury of Spring Lake Heights is interested in a multi-town merger nonetheless, because he believes the current plan favors Sea Girt. He is trying to broaden the talks to include South Belmar and Spring Lake. He would lose his Chief's job in the proposed takeover plan, but he said he planned to retire in a year or two anyway.
His opposition to the merger with Sea Girt is centered on what will happen to his sergeants and his town.
"Our residents don't have any representation," he said. "Sea Girt will control where the cars go and how many men are on duty. They'd also dictate who's hired, fired and disciplined."
 
Insistence on Control
 Mr. Ahern, Sea Girt's Public Safety Director, said he had no objection to creation of a planning committee with a seat for Spring Lake Heights. But he said Sea Girt would insist on being in control and would reject any reversal of roles that would make Sea Girt's Police Department subordinate to that of Spring Lake Heights.
"It wouldn't be a popular concept in town, and it certainly wouldn't be a popular concept with me," he said.
Mr. Ahern said he would not approve any plan with annual savings of less than $150,000 for each town. Councilman Tully said that costs would increase slightly in the second year of a merger but that he expected them to drop after five years to 1991 levels as older officers retired and were not replaced and duplicated services, like dispatching and excess cars and communications gear, were eliminated. Mr. Ahern and Mr. Tully both insist police services would not be reduced.
The 1991 police budget for Sea Girt, which has 2,100 residents, is $548,000, nearly 22 percent of the borough's budget of $2.5 million. Spring Lake Heights, with 5,400 residents, spends nearly $783,000 for its police, or 25.2 percent of its 1991 borough budget of $3.1 million.
 
Filling in Gaps
 A merger could help fill gaps in Sea Girt's command structure. In April 1990 its police captain, lieutenant and a sergeant were arrested by state narcotics agents on charges of participating in a marijuana and cocaine ring here and in nearby shore towns. Spring Lake Heights would provide the men -- and the money -- to fill those still-vacant positions, a major plus for Sea Girt.
But Sea Girt might lose its police headquarters, old, cramped and hemmed in by pretty homes at Baltimore Boulevard and Fourth Avenue, in favor of Spring Lake Heights's newer and roomier headquarters building along busy Route 71.
That switch would be practical, said Richard K. Fruin, a retired New York City police lieutenant hired to rewrite Sea Girt's training and operating manuals in the wake of the drug arrests. But, anticipating grumbles, Mr. Fruin added: "People in Sea Girt might say, 'If we're taking over, why not house the headquarters here.' "
At this tentative stage of planning, residents seem at least open-minded about a joint force.
 
'There's Duplication'
 "It makes a lot of sense," said Mary Johnson of Sea Girt. "I'm sure there's duplication of a lot of things, especially administratively, that could be reduced."
Another Sea Girt resident, Deirdre Badach, said she favored the savings that a merger would produce but worried that new police officers in town might be less friendly and attentive.
"It's a nice small-town atmosphere here," she said. "That's what I'd hope would stay, but I don't know if they could do it."
In Spring Lake Heights, Tom Brahn said:, "As long as the protection's there and they don't lay anybody off, I don't mind."

But William Fury, the borough's Police Chief, wonders what will happen to his sergeants: "Will Sea Girt give them their seniority? Or are they going to be patrolmen?"; Richard K. Fruin, hired to rewrite Sea Girt's training manuals, feels there might be grumbling about where to house the department after the merger. (Photographs by William E. Sauro/The New York Times) (pg.

HEADLINE: Patients of AIDS Dentist Seek Tests

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Deborah A. Brower, a 33-year-old nurse's aide from Long Island, saw her dentist three times in the last four months. Today she has a fourth medical appointment, this time to find out if the dentist infected her with the AIDS virus.
Ms. Brower is one of at least 200 patients who fear they were exposed to the AIDS virus by Dr. Philip M. Feldman of Coram, L.I., who died of pneumonia last month. The New York State Health Department has set up hot lines and clinics to offer counseling and testing to his patients and is investigating reports that Dr. Feldman did not follow proper infection-control practices, like sterilizing or disinfecting dental instruments between patients. 
 Publicity about Dr. Feldman's case, which was first reported in Newsday last weekend, coincided with yesterday's announcement by the Federal Centers for Disease Control of guidelines for health-care workers who are infected with the AIDS virus.
But the new Federal standards, which rely on the workers' willingness to voluntarily be tested for the virus and disclose their infection to patients, drew angry responses from people like Ms. Brower, herself a health-care worker, who said that testing should be mandatory and that those infected should be prevented from practicing.
"What dentist, what surgeon can you trust if there are people like these who allowed people to come in and bring their children in when he knew he had AIDS?" she asked. "I'm disgusted. I'm terrified."
But Dr. David E. Rogers, chairman of the New York State AIDS Advisory Council, said mandatory testing would consume "enormous amounts of money" for a very low yield, considering the low risk of infection from health-care workers to patients. The guidelines, he said, "put the emphasis where it should be, which is, what kinds of procedures are HIV-infected people using in taking care of patients?"
The inquiry into Dr. Feldman's practice is the first such official investigation of a health-care worker in a state with the highest number of reported AIDS cases in the country, 718 of them among health-care workers, state health officials said. The vast majority of these cases involved doctors, nurses and other medical personnel who do not perform the types of procedures that could lead to transmission of the virus, they said.
And even as they seek access to Dr. Feldman's records to insure that all patients are notified of the available help, the health officials called the risk of dentist-to-patient infection "exceedingly low" and said they did not expect to find a single instance in this case. Any patient who tests positive would be evaluated to rule out other known risk factors, such as sex with an infected partner, they said. Suffolk County health officials said 147 of the dentist's patients have scheduled tests and counseling. Those seeking appointments can call (516) 348-2749.
 
Special Evaluations
 In a statement released yesterday, the New York State Health Department said that the new Federal guidelines were similar to those that have been in place in the state since January for health-care centers and HIV-infected medical personnel. Both call for voluntary, rather than mandatory testing, and both recommend special evaluations of infected workers who engage in high-risk medical work such as dental and surgical procedures to determine whether they should continue performing them.
Department officials said they did not know the extent to which the guidelines were followed.
"The C.D.C. and the New York state guidelines set up a standard for a doctor to follow so one would expect health-care workers to follow standards that are explicitly stated," said Dr. Lloyd F. Novick, the State Health Department's director of community health and a consultant to the centers on the issue of HIV infection among health-care workers.
"What is the alternative?" he said. "The only other way to approach this is to know the HIV status of every health-care worker who's performing invasive procedures and to know it at repeated intervals. We've rejected that approach as unworkable because it would require repeated testing and would not give full assurances that the health-care worker is free of infection."
The department requires the state's 260 hospitals to adhere to infection-control procedures issued by the centers and violations are punishable with fines, said Frances Tarlton, a department spokeswoman. She said that hospitals had generally complied.
The state, however, does not have authority over individual practitioners, she said.
"The best protection for both patients and health-care workers is rigid infection control. Patients can make sure that dentists are wearing gloves. They can ask about their infection-control practices," Ms. Tarlton said.
"Anyone can ask point blank if the person is infected with HIV," she said.
Still, many say protection should not be left up to the patient.
"If they say testing is not economically worthwhile, do they realize the economic devastation to my family," asked Paul A. Pallmann, a 48-year-old exterminator whose wife and two sons, ages 22 and 14, were Dr. Feldman's patients.
" What about the human cost? People aren't replaceable with money."

HEADLINE: Forgive Debt, Finance Nature

 BODY:
Latin America owes the world billions of dollars -- much of which it can't repay. The world wants Latin America to stop destroying its priceless rain forests, ancient nurseries of life that also serve as a natural sink for greenhouse gases. These two conditions invite a deal -- debt-for-nature swaps that would channel some of Latin America's debt into conservation.
Swaps involving more than $100 million owed to private banks have already been arranged. And just a few weeks ago, Brazil gave the debt-for-nature idea a huge boost when it agreed to devote $100 million each year to saving the Amazon rain forest if banks would discount its debt. 
 The Bush Administration likes the idea and is backing a bill that would add money owed the Federal Government to the debt-for-nature pot. The bill is floundering in the Senate, and needs a timely push from the White House.
Debt-for-nature swaps sound complicated, but the mechanism is simple: Conservation groups, using private funds, buy foreign debt owed to banks. Since the debt may be uncollectible, the banks are happy to unload it at a fraction of its face value. The conservation groups then turn around and offer to forgive all or part of the debt in exchange for a pledge by the debtor nation to use the windfall for environmental purposes.
In the first swap, in 1987, Conservation International paid $100,000 to Citicorp for an uncollectible $650,000 owed to Citicorp by Bolivia. Conservation International then agreed to forgive the entire debt in return for Bolivia's promise to protect four million acres of tropical forests. Since then, 15 similar swaps have been carried out with a half-dozen countries.
These private ventures are modest in global terms. That's why Mr. Bush included debt-for-nature swaps in his 1990 "Enterprise for the Americas" initiative, an effort to pare debt, liberalize trade and boost investment in Latin America. Under his plan, a slice of $12 billion in Latin America's foreign aid debt would be forgiven; interest payments on the rest would flow to local environmental projects instead of the U.S. Treasury.
The payments would be made in local currency, enabling debtor countries to use their scarce hard currency for imports. The payoff for the U.S.? Debtors would have to streamline their economies, pledge to reduce their debts with other big creditors like the World Bank and open their borders to outside investors on favorable terms.
The House passed a bill similar to the Bush plan last month. The problem is in the Senate. A bill sponsored by Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, includes the swap idea but dilutes the potential impact by allowing debtor countries to spend the money on child nutrition, anti-drug efforts and secondary education.
These are worthy causes. But the Administration argues that they are already financed by existing A.I.D. programs, whereas environmental causes are not. Unless conservation is specifically targeted, debtor nations are likely to spend the money on projects with a quicker political payoff.
Still, the Dodd bill is better than no bill at all -- and it could be reshaped in a House-Senate conference. But first the Senate must act. At stake is a promising extension of an innovative way to reduce debt -- and enrich the planet in the bargain.

HEADLINE: New Aid to Israel Can Only Hinder Peace;
Economy Gains

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I disagree with Robert Loewenberg, who states in "Why Prop Up Israeli Socialism?" (Op-Ed, June 24), "Israel's economy is stagnant because of the perpetuation of an antiquated socialist system, propped up by United States aid and Jewish philanthropy."
Mr. Loewenberg's description of Israel hardly reflects that Intel (United States) is adding a $95 million expansion to its $100 million investment in Israel. National Semiconductor (United States) is adding $50 million to its investment. Twenty-eight United States companies have recently selected Israel for research and development with Israeli companies. 
 Despite Mr. Loewenberg's criticism of the Israeli system, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is experiencing its biggest boom since the early 1980's. The share index of the largest companies, Tel Aviv's Dow Jones industrial average, has risen more than 50 percent since January.
These financial results negate fears that Israel is going down the tubes because of an "antiquated socialist system."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Competition In a Hothouse

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IF the smaller fry in the long-distance phone business cannot keep pace with A.T.& T., is it Washington's job to fix the race?
When the Justice Department forced the breakup of the national telephone monopoly in 1984, the Federal Communications Commission assumed that less competition would eventually mean more -- that A.T.& T. needed to be hobbled, lest it reach out and crush someone. 
 But both time and ideology are undermining the case. Fed up with rules that have made it easier for U S Sprint and MCI Communications to lure away some of its biggest accounts, A.T.& T. is asking the commission for equal footing in the market for business services. And with enthusiasic support from the White House, the F.C.C.'s chairman, Alfred Sikes, is inclined to go along.
The best guess now is that the commission will grant some of A.T.& T.'s wishes at its Aug. 1 meeting, and punt on the rest. This will give both sides a chance to claim victory. But it will not resolve the issue of when -- if ever -- Uncle Sam will let consumers decide the fate of the phone rivals.
The commission has come a long way from the days of hands-on, rate-of-return regulation in which every change in phone rates was weighed for its impact on phone company profits. Since 1989, A.T.& T.'s services have been lumped into broad baskets. The company need not ask for permission to raise or lower individual tariffs. But the average price within each basket remains capped, checking potential monopoly power and making it impossible for the phone giant to favor businesses at the expense of residential consumers.
The commission also responded to A.T.& T.'s plea to offer customized services to big clients at negotiated prices. The company has made roughly 80 of these "Tariff 12" deals, which now generate more than a billion dollars in revenue annually.
But the playing field is hardly level. U S Sprint, MCI and some 200 niche companies providing specialized services are effectively free to charge what they want to whomever they want, without making cost information available to rivals.
A.T.& T. is not challenging this asymmetry in the regulation of services for residences and small businesses. It is, however, asking for deregulation of the high-end market, where its share of the business has eroded to about 70 percent. Specifically, it wants an end to the price controls on big-business services, plus freedom to add "800" number services to customized business packages.
A.T.& T. would also like the commission to dump the obscure "equal charge rule" that requires local telephone companies to bill every long-distance carrier at the same minute-by-minute fee for connection to their exchanges. If charges were instead based on costs, A.T.& T. would save upward of $500 million annually. Costs for its smallest rivals, which make far greater use of local exchange equipment, might double or triple.
The F.C.C. will almost surely eliminate price controls on high-end services. And it will probably streamline disclosure regulations on customized offerings, denying U S Sprint and MCI the luxury of matching A.T.& T.'s deals before the big company has a chance to clear them with the commission. But partial deregulation of "800' number service will probably be delayed. And in an apparent bow to House Democrats inclined to fine-tune competition in the long-distance market, Mr. Sikes has decided not to touch the equal charge rule.
Big customers will pay less, little customers will not pay more and A.T.& T.'s rivals will live to fight another day. What could be wrong with that?
Nothing, perhaps. But it begs the question of when the economic logic of the Ma Bell breakup will be allowed to play out. The idea was to spin off local regulated phone monopolies, and then let long-distance companies flourish in more fertile competitive ground. But A.T.& T.'s two main rivals lobby hard for protection, and it is an open question whether Washington will ever be able to say no to these multibillion companies whose profitability -- and perhaps survival -- depends on a continuing regulatory edge.
Then there is the question of equal treatment under the law. So far, the phone giant has pushed for less regulation all around -- what Peter Pitsch, a former F.C.C. staff member and sometime consultant to A.T.& T., calls "good symmetry." But if it loses patience with the pace of change, A.T.& T. may well demand more regulation for rivals rather than less for itself.
That possibility is more than speculation. The F.C.C. ignored just such a warning from A.T.& T. a few years ago, and the company chose not to litigate. If A.T.& T. changes its mind, free marketers may be forced to abandon the dream of a truly competitive market in long-distance phone calls.

HEADLINE: In Likud, Levy Is Often Odd Man Out

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 16

 BODY:
David Levy says he never set out to be the one moderate in a Government whose other members are all staunch right-wingers.
As Israel's Foreign Minister, he is forever butting heads with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and others, and is attacked and maligned for trying to push Israel an inch forward here, another inch there, toward the American proposal for regional peace. 
 In the Prime Minister's office, officials like to say Mr. Levy is committing political suicide. After all, a moderate is a rare bird in the Likud. On occasion, Mr. Levy is forced to proclaim, "I am not a dove!"
In fact, Mr. Levy could hardly be described as a leftist. He supports the growth of West Bank settlements and holds the Likud party view that Israel should never give up the occupied lands. But he wants to offer concessions so the peace process can move forward, though no one else in the Government seems so inclined.
 
Success Tied to Israeli Peace
 On Monday he praised Syria's reported acceptance of President Bush's compromise proposals for a regional peace conference, again bringing himself into conflict with almost everyone else in the Government. They were trying to find fault or declare Syria's response a cynical bluff.
Mr. Levy, who was born in Rabat, Morocco, 54 years ago. is involved in a high-stakes gamble. He is an open candidate to be Prime Minister whenever Mr. Shamir steps down. And his chances depend in large part on whether he succeeds in his present job.
For his rivals, Housing Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense Minister Moshe Arens, success in their jobs is easy to measure. They need only build more homes and stop more terrorists. But for the Foreign Minister to succeed, he must lead Israel to peace. And with this Government, that might prove impossible. As it is, his fellow ministers rebuke him at every turn.
The best-known example came during one of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's recent visits here. Mr. Levy told him that, in one crucial matter under debate, Israel would allow the proposed regional peace conference to reconvene once every six months -- if all the parties agreed.
 
'They Changed Their Mind'
 But as soon as Mr. Baker had left, some other ministers began grumbling that Mr. Levy had gone too far. Soon Mr. Shamir joined them, even though he had approved the idea at first. And two days later the Government formally retracted Mr. Levy's commitment to Mr. Baker.
"They changed their mind," Mr. Levy said, showing a charitable side that was not in evidence at the time.
Mr. Levy has few friends in the Government. But that's not surprising; neither do most of the other ministers. As Foreign Minister, particularly a conciliatory one, Mr. Levy has become the favorite target.
Mr. Shamir and Mr. Levy have been rivals or enemies for a decade, or longer, and in another political system Mr. Shamir probably would have dismissed him long ago. But Mr. Levy holds a significant bloc of support in the Likud Central Committee, which chooses the party's leader. If Mr. Shamir were to dismiss Mr. Levy, he would be endangering his own position.
 
Rampage at Unemployment
 Some accuse Mr. Levy of hypocrisy. Now, speaking of Mr. Baker, the Foreign Minister likes to talk of "my friend Jim." But it was only a little over a year ago that he was a member of the "constraints troika," one of the three ministers who were bent on saying "no to Baker" and his effort to bring Israel's peace plan into action.
Mr. Levy says it is Mr. Baker who has changed. Whatever the truth, Mr. Levy's new attitude has given his enemies even more ammunition when they already had quite a lot. For years Mr. Levy's humble background and relatively unsophisticated manner have made him the target of ridicule.
As soon as the Levys arrived from Morocco 35 years ago, they were sent to Bet Shean, a scrub town in the north that was home only to immigrants who did not know any better. His wife worked as a housekeeper, and he was unemployed, when one day he went on a rampage, turning over desks in the unemployment office because he could not find a job. For that he spent 12 days in jail.
For several years he was a construction worker. Then he campaigned for the rights of immigrants from North Africa and the Middle East, the people known as Sephardim. This led to his election to the Bet Shean City Council. When Likud took power, Prime Minister Menachem Begin noticed Mr. Levy and made him Minister of Absorption, then Housing.
Still, the nation's Ashkenazim, whose roots are European, made fun of him. They pointed to his 12 children. They snickered at his relative lack of education; he finished high school in Morocco and that's all. They ridiculed his sermon-like public speaking manner and the fact that he was the only Government minister who did not speak English. In fact, David Levy joke came to be a common currency of urban dinner parties.
Much of that has changed now, though the television still likes to poke fun at him.
He was in London this spring, meeting with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, and Israeli television seemed to glory in showing the footage of Mr. Levy's arrival. Both men were standing there, smiling for the cameras. A cameraman shouted, "Now shake hands, won't you!" Mr. Hurd immediately stuck out his hand, but Mr. Levy did not see it and had not understood. So he stood there smiling, unaware, for several excruciating seconds.
But it looks as though Mr. Levy might have the last laugh. He has a natural constituent base, Israel's Sephardic majority. And he appears to be counting on a notion that many other Likud politicians seem unwilling to grasp, that the largest portion of Israel's population is somewhat more moderate than its Government.
A public-opinion survey published this month showed that 69 percent of the public would be willing to exchange at least some part of the West Bank in return for peace. So Mr. Levy may be more cunning than he appears. In the end, will he be Israel's leader one day?
"Nothing is certain," he said with a shrewd smile. "We shall see."

HEADLINE: Volcano Stills City by Base In Philippines

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANGELES, the Philippines, July 16

 BODY:
This once-thriving city of nearly 300,000 people has begun to look like the ghost town that many residents fear it is now destined to become.
Hastily scrawled "For Sale" signs are set in the windows of shops and restaurants that have been shuttered since early last month, when a volcano showered Angeles with a dense layer of ash and forced the evacuation of the area's largest employer, the American-run Clark Air Base. 
 Now comes word from American officials that the United States plans to abandon Clark entirely because of the damage caused by Mount Pinatubo, a move that would mean economic catastrophe for Angeles and other cities and villages that have grown up in the shadow of the 89-year-old base.
"If the Americans close the base, I must close up my school," said Rolando Cataquian, a 32-year-old teacher whose school provided high-school level tutoring to the Philippine wives of American servicemen stationed at Clark. All but 3 of his 33 students in the summer term have been evacuated from the Philippines, and Mr. Cataquian says he will soon be forced out of business.
 
'People Will Suffer'
 "Some people say it will be a good thing if the Americans leave Clark," he said. "I can tell you that people in Angeles do not believe that. If the Americans leave, there will be so many people out of work. People will suffer."
Most of the 15,000 Americans have already left, driven away by Mount Pinatubo. With scientists saying eruptions may continue for several years, the economy of Angeles is already in grave peril. But a permanent shutdown of Clark would cost the jobs of 40,000 Filipinos employed at the base before the eruption and result annually in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to local businesses.
The Philippine Government once proposed that Clark be replaced by a civilian airport or by an industrial park, but those plans have been put on hold because of Mount Pinatubo.
Angeles has long had a reputation among American servicemen as a city of vice -- of massage parlors and 24-hour honky-tonk bars -- and to some degree that reputation is deserved.
The main streets of the city are lined with businesses that cater exclusively to the licentious pleasures of American air men. It is for that reason alone that some prominent Filipinos, appalled by the prostitution and public drunkenness around the base, are pleased at the prospect of an American withdrawal. Others see the bases as an unwelcome vestige of the days when the Philippines were a United States colony.
 
Streets Clogged With Ash
 Yet a walk through the city, along wide streets still clogged by the talc-like volcanic ash, would suggest that few critics of the base are to be found among the residents of Angeles. Directly or indirectly, most Filipinos who live here depend on Clark for their livelihood, and they are frightened by the American threat to pull out.
"The Americans have brought influences that are good and bad," said Carlos de la Cruz, secretary of the Clark Field Baptist Church, which is a few hundred yards from the entrance to the base, and a block from a cluster of saloons and a massage parlor.
"Personally, I believe there is much more good because of the Americans," he said. "Isn't it good that the Americans can provide jobs?" Since the eruption, the church has lost the American half of its 300-member congregation, and Sunday offerings are down from $1,500 a week to less than $300.
The church's American pastor has gone home to the United States, and it is not clear whether a permanent replacement will arrive. Mr. de la Cruz said the church may soon have to lay off some of its six Philippine workers.
Because of jobs created by the base, Angeles has long been an affluent city in a nation in which the per-capita income is less than $1,000 a year.
 
Pizza Hut and Dunkin' Donuts
 The American influence is everywhere in the city. There is a McDonald's, a Pizza Hut, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Dunkin' Donuts, a Bank of Boston branch office, a Goodyear auto center. All employ many Filipinos.
"I am very pro-bases," said Len Medina, a 27-year-old Angeles native who is the day supervisor at the Pizza Hut. "These are good jobs we have."
Residents of Angeles are conversant in the details of base negotiations between the Philippines and the United States. They seem well aware that the United States is closing military bases at home, and that many Americans are losing jobs because of Pentagon cuts.
But Mariz de Jesus, a 35-year-old hostess at the U & I Canteen, said the plight of Filipinos would be far more bleak. "It is not the same," she said. "If the Americans leave from Clark, there is no hope for us. We cannot go someplace and look for better jobs. There are no other jobs."

HEADLINE: Net Falls 21.7% At Honeywell

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, July 16

 BODY:
Honeywell Inc., citing a weak market, today reported a 21.7 percent drop in its second-quarter net earnings, to $77.6 million.
The international controls maker, based in Minneapolis, said its earnings per share totaled $1.10, compared with earnings of $99.1 million, or $1.29 a share, for the second quarter of last year, which included $6.7 million from discontinued operations. 
 The 1990 second-quarter results also included an adjustment for a significantly lower annual effective income tax rate in connection with the sale of a Honeywell unit's common stock.
Honeywell's worldwide sales in the second quarter were $1.52 billion, down 2 percent from $1.55 billion in the second quarter of last year. Excluding results from businesses divested that year, sales increased 5 percent.
"Some of our business units, such as commercial flight systems and industrial systems, are doing well despite the economy," said James J. Renier, Honeywell's chairman and chief executive. "Others, such as industrial components, and residential and commercial buildings, are impacted by the recessionary conditions in their markets."
The stock of Honeywell, which provides products, systems and services for homes and buildings, industry and aviation, declined on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $60.125, down $1.125.

HEADLINE: U.S. Indian Colleges Get First Big Corporate Gift

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Struggling against isolation and inadequate government financing, Indian tribal colleges are about to receive substantial help from corporate America.
The colleges, most of them situated on remote reservations in 12 Western and Midwestern states, will receive a total of $1 million in assistance this year from the USWest Foundation, the charitable arm of United States West, a telecommunications corporation. 
 Financial help for the colleges from the Denver-based foundation will total $2 million by the end of next year, said Richard D. McCormick, president of United States West, in announcing the program in Washington yesterday.
With most of them established in the past decade, the colleges are too new to have attracted help from private foundations or from companies more accustomed to supporting prestigious universities. So a major aim of the USWest initiative is to enable the American Indian College Fund, which represents 27 of the tribal colleges, to mount a national fund-raising campaign.
 
'Competent and Professional'
 "The American public, if they think of Indians at all, largely has the perception given to them by Hollywood," said Jane Prancan, executive director of the USWest Foundation. "We know the Indians to be self-reliant, competent and professional and the tribal colleges are further developing these attributes. We hope the fund-raising campaign will portray the tribal colleges as we know them."
The 27 colleges served by the college fund have about 12,000 full-time or part-time students and range in size from 80 to 1,800 students. Most are two-year schools and are chartered by their respective tribes.
All the colleges are primarily financed by the Federal Government, which was authorized under a 1985 law to pay them $5,820 annually for each full-time student. But the actual appropriation of funds for the growing enrollments of the colleges was just above $3,000 a student last year, having dropped to less than $2,000 a student in the late 1980's.
Congress appropriated $20.9 million in 1990 for all of the tribal schools, with the biggest share, $6 million, going to the Navajo Community College in Tsaile, Ariz. Established in 1968, it is the largest of the tribal colleges. Senator Daniel K. Inouye, the Hawaii Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs, said yesterday in a statement that the colleges are severely underfinanced and that Congress should increase their money for 1992.
The Bush Administration has urged the colleges to look for financial support from private sources, but until recently most have had little success. The MacArthur Foundation gave $3 million in 1989 to 18 colleges run by Indian tribes and the Bush Foundation of St. Paul, Minn., created by the chairman of the the 3M Corportion, Archibald Bush, has given $1.5 million to tribal schools.
"I would be surprised if more than 1 percent of all philanthropy is directed toward the tribal colleges," said Dr. Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
In 1989, a two-year study of tribal colleges by the Carnegie Foundation underscored the financial predicament of the schools. "Most of the colleges operate on a little bit of nothing from the Federal Government," said Paul Boyer, who wrote the Carnegie study. "What USWest is doing could be part of a movement creating a partnership between the philanthropic community and the colleges desperately needing their support."
A number of presidents of tribal colleges said the Carnegie report helped increase interest among foundations. But the philanthropic community has generally not given much money to American Indians.
The country's top 472 foundations, which account for 44 percent of all philanthropy in this country, provided $3.2 billion in charitable grants in 1989, the most recent year studied by the Foundation Center in Washington. In that year, American Indian causes received only $16.1 million of all grants of more than $5,000 each, and that total included funds for education, housing, civil rights, the arts and economic development.
To secure a larger share of support, the American Indian College Fund has been created, modeled on the United Negro College Fund. It hopes to raise $10 million in the next two years in the fund-raising campaign designed by the advertising agency Wieden & Kennedy of Portland, Ore., said Barbara Bratone, its director. The organization began full operation in 1989 and so far has raised $2 million, including the grant from USWest.
It also has received a $75,000 three-year grant from the Exxon Education Fund and smaller amounts from other corporate foundations. Among private foundations, its support has come mainly from the Ford, Rockefeller and Andrew Mellon Foundations, Pew Charitable Trusts and the Lilly Endowment. The Knight Foundation of Miami, Fla., gave $150,000 earlier this month.
The USWest grant will provide $732,000 to 19 tribal colleges to help improve computer services and libraries, strengthen curriculums and help students to transfer successfully to four-year colleges. The American Indian College Fund itself will receive $70,000.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Optimistic On Economic Outlook

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, named last week to another four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, gave Congress today one of the most optimistic assessments of the economy he has offered in years.
He proclaimed the recession over, reported "promising signs of a slowing in inflation," predicted "marked progress on the deficit" and said he expected the debt of individuals and companies to flatten out after the surge in the 1980's. 
 "At this stage," Mr. Greenspan told a House subcommittee, "we are well on the path of actually achieving the type of goals which we've set out to achieve: a solid economic recovery with the unemployment rate moving down to its lowest sustainable, long-term rate, with growth at or close to its maximum long-term sustainable pace, with inflation wholly under control."
 
'Rather Limited' Evidence
 Typical of Mr. Greenspan, who talks publicly about the economy with the precision of the Oracle at Delphi, not all of his news was glowing. At one point, for example, he said that "convincing evidence of a dynamic expansion is still rather limited," and that "we must remain alert to the chance that the recovery could be muted or could even falter."
He also characterized the Fed's current policy as "a posture of watchful waiting," presumably meaning that changes in interest rates are not in the offing soon. The Fed has not touched the rates it controls since it last cut them in April.
But by and large, Mr. Greenspan, the Government's most important economic policy maker, has rarely been so upbeat, and he looks fit and healthy. He was hospitalized overnight last weekend after he suffered dizzy spells, but his staff said he was released after tests proved normal.
 
No Surprises in Forecasts
 Mr. Greenspan appeared before the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy to testify, as required by law every six months, about the state of the economy and the outlook for monetary policy. His economic forecasts contained no surprises.
He said that he and other Fed officials expected the gross national product to rise between three-quarters of a percent and 1 percent this year, inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index to rise 3 1/4 percent to 3 3/4 percent and the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter to be 6 3/4 percent to 7 percent. The Bush Administration's most recent forecast, released Monday, is within those ranges.
For next year, the Fed is slightly less optimistic than the Administration, projecting a G.N.P. rise of 2 1/4 percent to 3 percent, compared with the Administration's prediction of 3.6 percent.
Nonetheless, Mr. Greenspan's forecast and the tone of his comments could hardly have been sweeter music to a President gearing up for a run for re-election in 1992. He also put in a good word for Mr. Bush's grasp of economic matters. "He's very knowledgeable about these issues," the chairman said. "A lot of times you think you're giving him new information, and he's heard it 10 times before, and he often knows a good deal more about certain issues than you do."
Although Mr. Greenspan and top Administration officials have occasionally been at odds over the chairman's refusal to allow interest rates to fall as fast or as far as the other officials want, Mr. Greenspan has never made bones about being a partisan Republican.
He confirmed last week's reports that Fed policy makers had voted early this month to maintain growth of the money supply, as measured by M-2, at between 2 1/2 and 6 1/2 percent next year. M-2 consists primarily of checking, savings and money-market accounts and small certificiates of deposit.
 
Ideal Money-Growth Rate
 In answer to a question, Mr. Greenspan suggested that the ideal long-term growth rate of M-2 would be about 4 percent a year. That would accommodate economic growth of about 3 percent and inflation of about 1 percent. In theory, growth in the money supply should equal the rates of economic growth and inflation, but that is not always the case over short periods of time.
An inflation rate in the neighborhood of 1 percent is necessary, Mr. Greenspan said, because the quality of products in the United States improves each year. One reason the West overestimated the strength of the economy in the Soviet Union for years, he added, was that American economists did not take account of the fact that the quality of Soviet products did not improve the way American products did, and thus Soviet inflation was more serious.

HEADLINE: New York at Work;
Rats Are His Bread, Roaches His Butter

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Now that he has annihilated millions of cockroaches and rodents, not to mention preposterous quantities of silverfish, cereal mites, carpet beetles, bedbugs, ants, wasps, termites and a few snakes, Sam Bloom figures he knows a thing or two about pest control. Don't serve beer to the cockroaches. Make sure the rats don't get into the bulldozer seats. Stick your empty soda cans in the dishwasher.
Mr. Bloom runs Standard Exterminating in Long Island City, one of the city's oldest exterminators. It will gladly eradicate pests anywhere within the five boroughs. Occasionally, it will dispatch someone into the suburbs for a good flying ant or earwig problem. "And we don't really charge anything for our service," Mr. Bloom likes to say. "Just a dollar apiece for the little funerals." 
 Exterminating is one of the hardiest professions in New York, for the simple reason that New York pests are impressively obstinate. Yet over the years, the war on bugs has got appreciably more refined, as Standard Exterminating, enemy of insects since 1929, knows well. Exterminators don't even like to be called exterminators anymore. They prefer pest-control technicians.
 
They're Everywhere
 There's no mistaking a pest-control technician's office. Just study the walls. Exterminators usually don't go in for those pictures of fruit or verdant farm fields. They like pest art. As you enter the offices of Standard Exterminating on Steinway Street, there's a fairly flattering portrait of a cockroach next to a picture of a good-looking silverfish. Down the way a bit come the rat drawings. At home, Mr. Bloom continues to add to a sizable collection of mice and rat figurines. "To other people, they're pests," he said. "To me, they're bread and butter."
Mr. Bloom, a cheerful, roostery man 67 years old, got into exterminating in 1960, when he took over Standard from his father-in-law. He runs it with his son, Gil, and employs 16 technicians. He's treated every imaginable place where creatures crawl -- air-traffic control towers at Kennedy International Airport, funeral parlors, sports stadiums, the lower deck of the George Washington Bridge. He wiped out fungus gnats inside the vaults of a jewelry company.
"No facility is pest-proof," he said the other day while holed up in his office. "If it were, and you walked in there with a cup of coffee in a paper bag, you just breached that pest-proof area. Because there is probably a roach inside the folds of that paper bag."
Cockroaches, which inhabit New York in infuriating density, remain the leading opponent of exterminators. They have been around for some 400 million years, give or take a few million, and each can bear thousands of offspring in its two-year lifespan. Roaches develop immunity to poisons, and thus scientists must concoct fresh poisons to combat them. Standard puts down a variety of organic phosphates and boric acids, and since the mid-1980's, amidinohydrazones have become popular for their success in abbreviating cockroaches' lives.
Still, the exterminating profession has some slipshod practitioners, known for waddling into an apartment and spraying along the bottoms of the walls and hoping for the best. They are mocked as "baseboard jockeys."
"You have to put the spray where the roaches are," Mr. Bloom explained. "That means in the cracks and crevices, not just along the baseboards.
"One of the things about this business today is you find roaches in places you didn't find them before," he said.
Mr. Bloom has encountered roaches in television sets and in the linings of a refrigerator. He has sprayed lottery machines at candy stores. Roaches are not fussy eaters. They can survive on toothpaste. They savor the grease from a refrigerator motor. They will settle for a decent toupee. If nothing tastier turns up, they'll eat the newsprint of the article you're now reading.
Mr. Bloom is all for recycling, but in his line of work recycling has meant aggravation. Garbage bags and empty cans make splendid homes for roaches. "People keep 30 or 40 bags lying around," Mr. Bloom said. "The glue that glued the bags together is food for roaches. There could be spilled coffee in a bag. As far as I know, roaches don't drink coffee, but they eat the sugar in the coffee. And the bag is warm and dark, just what roaches like.
"Empty cans are breeding grounds, too. No one washes the food residue out of empty cans. You're not going to put empty cans in the dishwasher, though you should. Beer cans are the worst. Roaches love beer. It's full of dense carbohydrates and roaches are big on heavy carbohydrates."
The blazing sun suffused the interior of Joe Entler's Chevy truck. He was heading east on the Grand Central Parkway, working the Jamaica-Queens Village route for Standard Exterminating. How does it compare with other areas? "It's full of bugs," he said.
Mr. Entler came to exterminating 13 years ago, after shimmying under cars as a mechanic for Mercedes-Benz. He admits it takes a while to become hardened to the life. When he began, he used to have recurrent "crawly" dreams, and he would dart home during the day to take showers. Now he's mellow about all the creatures he meets.
He does chafe at the environmentalists who denounce the chemicals exterminators put down. What's more, it annoys him that people are always holding their noses when he comes along, and yet they expect him to stampede over at 4 in the morning if they spy an ant crawling on the floor.
"You get nutty stuff in this job," Mr. Entler said. "Not with the insects. With the people. Last week, I went to a woman's house and she's screaming at me, 'Look at all the roaches crawling over the floor.' I look down and I see one roach. I tell you, a lot of this is public relations."
One change in extermination has been a shift toward low- or no-odor chemicals. The noisome odor of pesticides used to be a problem. The lack of odor is also a problem. "After we put down a no-odor spray, people call up and complain that, hey, nothing was done," Mr. Entler said. "They say we're just spraying water. So we have to explain that odor doesn't kill bugs."
 
A Bedbug Boom
 He rolled up to a recycling center, where he threw down poison for rats and mice and slapped down a few glueboards. If a mouse happens to scamper across a glueboard, it won't be going anywhere for a while.
Standard also treats construction sites. Rats like to dine on the seats of tractors and bulldozers in pursuit of the salt in the sweat of the operators who had been sitting on them. Bulldozer seats are not cheap.
Recently, Standard has seen a rise in bedbugs. "Bedbug jobs almost disappeared for 10 or 12 years," Mr. Bloom said. "In the last three years, we've seen a rise. It's a deterioration in personal hygiene -- not washing yourself and not washing your clothes."
Mr. Entler pulled up to a psychiatric hospital, where the head of maintenance was worrying. He had ants in one room, a wasp nest "big as a basketball" outside a third-floor window and wasps or bees or who knows what swarming around an entrance.
"Maybe they're cicada killers," Mr. Entler suggested.
"What?" the man said. "Psychotic killers?"
Just when you think you've got a building licked, you run into the holdouts. Standard calls these "reservoir apartments" because they become reservoirs of infestation. There are people who refuse to have their bugs wiped out because it is against their religion. Then there are individuals who are rather fond of pests. There was a man who used to cook food for the mice in his apartment. He would put music on for them.
Pigeons, squirrels and raccoons are also formidable New York problems. Sticky repellants that pigeons detest walking on will often ward them off. Squirrels and raccoons have to be trapped; Mr. Entler favors cat food as a bait. Standard treats a potato-chip company that receives large wooden crates of potatoes. Every now and then some snakes come along as a bonus. Glueboards spoil their day.
Mr. Entler stopped at a good-sized apartment house with a potential termite problem. He stalked through the basement, where, sure enough, termites had been holding a banquet on the wooden window frames. The building itself was brick, but if left untreated, the termites were likely to nibble away at the wood floors of the apartments. People on the fourth floor might wake up on the third floor. Standard has discovered termites in steel-and-glass skyscrapers, dining on phone books and toilet paper. In fact, termites will chew the label off a bottle of wine, polish off the cork -- and not even take a sip of the wine.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts a Slight Rise After Greenspan Comments

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose in cautious trading yesterday, supported by comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, but held in check by fears of central bank intervention.
Gold prices edged lower. In New York, gold fell 20 cents to close at $368.90 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $368.75, unchanged from Monday. 
 Mr. Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee yesterday that the United States central bank would not move interest rates lower in the near future. He also said he found no evidence to suggest the recovering economy might slip back into recession.
His comments helped lift the dollar, which is strengthened by higher interest rates that increase foreign demand for American investments.
 
Threat of Intervention
 Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager with the Bank of New York, said traders made a mild attempt to push the dollar higher, but that they were mindful that central banks, which intervened in the market on Friday to stop the dollar from surging, could band together again should the currency climb too much.
The market nudged the dollar past 1.800 German marks, but did not press further, and the dollar ended the day in New York at 1.8000 marks, up from 1.78895 on Monday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.7980 marks from 1.7895.
The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen. In New York, the dollar advanced to 137.25 yen, from 136.935 on Monday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 136.95 yen, down 0.05 yen from Monday's close, and in London, it closed at 137.11 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.64305 in New York, from $1.65375 late Monday. In earlier London trading, the pound fell to $1.6458 from $1.6510.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with Monday's late prices, included: 1.56275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5483; 6.1070 French francs, up from 6.0745; 1,339.25 Italian lire, up from 1,332.00, and 1.1474 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1462.
In the precious metals market, gold fell in London to a late bid of $368.50, from $368.85 late Monday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $368.60, from $368.80 late Monday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $1.08 an ounce to close at $368.77.
Silver rose 1.5 cents to close at $4.367 a troy ounce. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.37, from $4.38 late Monday.

HEADLINE: Nationwide Revolution in Education Is Giving Handicapped a Headstart

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
In a landmark expansion of an educational mission that traditionally begins with kindergarten, all the states but two have committed themselves to providing extensive free preschool programs for handicapped children from 3 to 5 years old.
From Hawaii to Maine, school districts are identifying children who need special help and putting together teams of specialists to provide it. By July 1, all the states but Oregon and Alabama had qualified for Federal subsidies that will deliver millions of dollars to help pay for special classes and other services for children with learning disabilities, speech or language impairments, retardation or severe physical or emotional problems. 
 Many states, their budgets strained by recession, are having trouble coming up with their share of the money for these programs. And many schools are having trouble finding specialists to provide the services. Another problem is that diagnosing developmental problems in children so young is an inexact process, and it is therefore difficult to make decisions about precisely what services mildly handicapped children need.
But despite these obstacles, states are moving to comply as fully as they can because they are in danger of losing Federal financing if they do not.
 
A National Strategy
 Dr. Ernest L. Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, in Princeton, N.J., called the addition of the preschool program "a dramatic advance and the final step in a national education strategy that has been developing for over two decades" for disabled children. Dr. Boyer is chairman of an advisory committee to the National Governors Association on reaching the first of President Bush's six education goals: that by the year 2000 all children should start school ready to learn.
"Not long ago," Dr. Boyer added, "children who needed the most help were ineligible for any help. Now we've come full circle and children with handicaps are getting more help than other children."
As a result, Dr. Boyer and other educators predict, the widespread compliance with Federal law on preschool programs for the handicapped may be a milestone on the road to an even more ambitious goal: free and mandatory preschool education for every 3- through 5-year-old in the country.
The Federal preschool program also pushes public education further into the private domain. Until now, mandatory public education in this country began with first grade for 6-year-olds. Rather than start their own preschool programs, most school districts needing to serve handicapped children who are 5 years old and younger have contracted with private preschool programs to include those children in their regular classes. Visiting therapists and specialists then provide the children with extra help.
Decades of research show that the sooner a handicapped child receives help, the better off the youngster and the school budget are likely to be. Early intervention speeds recovery, reduces the need for special education services later and improves a child's chances of success in school and life. According to a 1985 study of Head Start, the Federally subsidized preschool program for poor children and handicapped children, every dollar invested in Head Start returns almost $5 in public savings.
But finding the money to begin with can be daunting. In Philadelphia, for example, the city and state are disputing which of them should pay for preschool programs for the handicapped, and city officials are openly advising parents to sue the state if they want a preschool program for their children.
"I don't want to sue the state -- I want a preschool for Nicholas," said Maria Sol Antonoulis, whose 3 1/2-year-old son is developmentally delayed in speech and motor skills.
Even though state and Federal laws now entitle Nicholas to a free preschool program, including sessions with speech, physical and occupational therapists, Philadelphia has nothing to offer. Mrs. Antonoulis and her husband, Constantinos, a restaurant manager, pay $270 a month to send their son to a private preschool program, but they cannot afford any therapy. They are considering moving out of the city to a suburban county that provides a complete program.
Such programs are expensive. In Pittsburgh, a local school district pays $7,000 a year to send Hailey Erdlen, a 4-year-old with Down syndrome, to a private preschool program for disabled children. "We would never have been able to afford preschool," said her mother, Lynn A. Erdlen.
 
A Proven Record Of Helping Disabled
 Private preschool programs have such a proven record for helping disabled children and saving education dollars in the long run that states have been phasing in the programs at an increasing pace since 1986. That year Congress greatly increased the financial incentives for establishing preschool programs, incentives first provided in the Education of the Handicapped Act of 1975.
Some pioneering states, including New Jersey, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska, using mostly their own funds, have provided preschool services to all disabled preschool children for more than a decade. But until now most states provided mandatory aid only to severely impaired 3- and 4-year olds, and limited supplementary assistance to disabled 5-year-olds in regular kindergarten classes.
To continue receiving Federal financing, states had to enact laws by July 1 that entitled every developmentally delayed or disabled child from 3 through 5 years old to a full range of therapeutic and preschool programs. These range in annual per-pupil cost from $5,800 a year for a typical state like Iowa to $14,700 in New York State, which has the nation's most expensive program. In the last year alone, 26 states enacted these laws, making the states eligible to receive about $1,100 a year per handicapped child in combined Federal grants.
Early help for handicapped children is considered by experts to be so critical that the 1986 Federal disability law also provided incentives for states to evaluate and treat children, from birth through 2 years old, who are deemed at risk of developmental delays or disabilities. All states are now phasing in this early intervention program and, within three years, states must offer comprehensive therapy to all eligible children to continue receiving Federal subsidies.
 
A Million Children May Be Eligible
 Nationwide, about 10 percent of all school-age children are enrolled in special education programs for the handicapped. Although no official estimates have been given for the number of preschoolers who will be eligible for the new comprehensive programs, if a similar percentage applies, about one million children would be eligible.
In the 1989-1990 school year, states provided some kind of services to 388,000 handicapped preschoolers, according to the latest Government report, which counted as services everything from a half-hour a week of speech therapy at home to full-day kindergarten programs.
Most states provided programs to whatever extent funds permitted; now states must provide each child with every service that a team of specialists prescribe in each child's individual education plan. States are required to seek out eligible children and provide services promptly, usually within 60 days of a parent's initial inquiry to the local school district.
States vary considerably in the number of disabled preschoolers they serve, but none reach 10 percent of the preschool-age population. Only Kentucky and Idaho served more than 6 percent of children of preschool age. Of those states with preschool programs for the handicapped, Hawaii served the fewest children, 752 preschoolers or 1.5 percent of the age group, and California, which mandated services just last year, served the most children, 37,000, or 2.6 percent of its preschool population.
Educators in a half-dozen states acknowledged that efforts to publicize the program had ranged from spotty to nonexistent. "In some parts of Texas people are not informed about what services are available," said Al Stewart, a spokesman for the state division of special education.
But Mr. Stewart also said that school districts served relatively few 3- and 4-year-olds, in part because parents tend to deny that their young children have impairments, and in part because it is difficult for specialists to identify mild impairments in such immature children.
 
Issue of Enforcement Touches Off Debate
 Advocates for the handicapped, who have lobbied for these preschool programs for years, applaud the Government's leadership. But they also criticize Federal officials for not authorizing stringent enforcement procedures.
"There is a long history in special education of nonenforcement by the Feds," said Thomas K. Gilhool, a former state secretary of education in Pennsylvania and a lawyer who specializes in issues concerning children with disabilities.
"I am sorry to disagree," said Robert R. Davila in response to Mr. Gilhool's criticism. Mr. Davila, the assistant United States Secretary of Education for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, said: "States are scrambling to make whatever modifications and changes are required to come into compliance. And if a state is found in noncompliance, we will withhold funds for any part of the law that the state is not complying with."
Mr. Gilhool characterized as a "mirage" some state plans, including Pennsylvania's, to provide appropriate services to all eligible preschoolers.
Some states are beginning the program with so little money that it raises questions about whether their efforts will comply with Federal law. In South Carolina, the state's Department of Education requested $10.4 million for the preschool program this year, and the Legislature provided $1.6 million."We're just going to do the best we can," said Mary E. Ginn, a preschool consultant to the state's Department of Education.
California, which faces a $14 billion budget deficit for the fiscal year 1992, has started the mandatory preschool program, but gave itself an escape hatch if the program gets too expensive: a state law links state funds for the program to adequate Federal financing.
Congress has already shortchanged the states by providing only $293 million for the program this year, or about $60 million below target levels written in the 1986 Federal law, said Paul D. Hinkle, a spokesman for California's Division of Special Education. "Our Legislature is leery about getting into this program," he said.
Two states were so leery that they declined to participate in the program this year.
Oregon legislators, who are mopping up after a property tax revolt at the polls last November left the state education budget $630 million short, decided to postpone offering the full preschool program until after July 1992. The postponement will save the state $29 million, but force it to lose about $4 million in Federal grants. The state's program is now limited to severely disabled children, said Mike Bark, coordinator of the state's Early Intervention Services.
In Alabama, state legislators are still debating whether to mandate a statewide preschool program. Many school officials, still suffering from a 6.5 percent midyear reduction in state aid, oppose any expansion of preschool programs. "Our feeling is that if we can't fund the programs we already have, then maybe we don't need to begin a new program," said Don Fulbright, Superintendent of Schools in Clay County in central Alabama, one of the state's poorest school districts.
Even if states had no financial problems, they would be unable to provide adequate preschool programs to all handicapped preschoolers because of a nationwide shortage of special education teachers and therapists.
Government reports for the 1988-89 school year, the latest available, show that more than one in seven financed positions for special education preschool teachers is vacant, and there are very high vacancy rates, up to 60 percent, in positions for occupational, physical and speech therapists.
"Nothing much has changed since then because there hasn't been a lot of money put into university training programs," said Gloria L. Harbin, the associate director for the Carolina Policy Studies Program, a research organization at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that is under Government contract to monitor the states' progress in providing services to preschoolers.

HEADLINE: 2 Merging Banks Turn to Consumer Questions

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Now that Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover have decided to merge, they are beginning to deal with the issues that concern consumers, such as what interest rate to charge on bank credit cards (Chemical's are lower) and how much will a customer have to keep on deposit to have a no-fee checking account ("Manny Hanny's" $1,500 minimum or Chemical's $3,000.)
"We don't have any idea yet how we'll answer these questions," said Alan M. Silberstein, Chemical's executive vice president for consumer banking. 
 Such issues will not be settled until the banks officially merge early next year, the banks said. But just 24 hours after the merger announcement, customers calling hot lines yesterday were getting a few answers. Bank spokesmen sometimes referred to a question-and-answer sheet put together in anticipation of the biggest consumer concerns.
 
Deposit Insurance Questioned
 One answer was for the depositor who kept, say, $70,000 at Chemical and $60,000 at Manufacturers. The total once the banks merge -- $130,000 -- will exceed the $100,000 maximum amount covered by Federal deposit insurance. Neither Manufacturers Hanover nor Chemical wants the $30,000 excess to migrate to another bank, so they explained how deposit insurance could be preserved.
"We are telling people to put the money in different family names," said Judy Walsh, a Manufacturers spokeswoman. Under present law, a husband can have $100,000 insured in his name, his wife another $100,000 in her name and jointly they can keep on deposit still another $100,000 that is also insured. But these changes need not be made immediately; the law says that deposits insured before the merger will continue to be covered until six months after the merger is completed, or at least until mid-1992.
The really difficult issues arise from the natural tendency of neighboring banks to try to steal each other's customers by offering better deals. Thus Chemical Bank's credit cards -- Chem Plus, Chem Gold Card and a no-frills card -- currently charge interest rates ranging from 16 percent to 18.4 percent. The Manufacturers Hanover range on cards is 17.8 percent to 19.8 percent. Manny Hanny, on the other hand, requires that a customer keep only $1,500 on deposit to avoid a monthly checking-account fee, while the Chemical minimum is $3,000.
Rates on home equity loans, car loans, mortgages and many similar commercial loans also differ. Any long-term loan or certificate of deposit still outstanding on the day the two banks actually merge will be honored, terms unchanged. Only the rates and rules for new business "will have to be ironed out in the merger process," John Meyers, a Manny Hanny official, said.
 
What About Checks?
 Other problems are more easily solved, such as what to do when Manufacturers Hanover ceases to exist early next year and a customer still has 1,000 Manny Hanny checks with his name and address printed on them. Go right on using them until they are gone, then reorder. That is standard merger practice.
"Two or three years from now, checks with Manny Hanny's name will still be valid and still floating around," Mr. Silberstein said. "Many banks have gone out of existence in the last few years, and their checks still clear."
Mr. Silberstein said some callers were asking whether their local bank branch would be among the 80 to be closed, and if so, what should they do. The answer: Their accounts will automatically be transferred to a nearby branch, with no change in account number or password for Automatic Teller Machine cards.
Some 60 percent of depositors at Chemical and Manny Hanny use A.T.M. cards that work in either bank's machines, and many of them rarely visit a branch officer, the banks said.
Finally, the banks must figure out how to merge their back offices. Which one's computer system wil generate the monthly bank statements, the credit card bills and the numerous other calculations involved in banking?
"We haven't any idea," Mr. Silberstein said. "We have teams of people waiting to get together, as soon as they get the signal, to compare how the two operations work and to make suggestions to senior management."

HEADLINE: G.E. Net Climbs by 3.7% Despite Weakness at NBC

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The General Electric Company reported an earnings increase of 3.7 percent in the second quarter, bucking the recession and weakness at its NBC broadcasting network.
Earnings rose to $1.13 billion, or $1.30 a share, from $1.09 billion, or $1.22 a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Sales in the quarter increased 2.8 percent, to $14.8 billion from $14.4 billion. 
 The per-share earnings were slightly better then analysts' consensus forecast of $1.29 a share. Nevertheless, the company's stock price declined $1.50 a share, to close at $73.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.
John F. Welch Jr., G.E.'s chairman, attributed the increase to strong performances by the company'selectrical equipment, jet engine, medical device and financial services units. "Despite the U.S. recession and a weakening global economy, G.E.'s operating margin of 12.9 percent equaled the record margin recorded for the second quarter of 1990," Mr. Welch said in a statement.
 
Financial Services Unit
 He said the company's GE Financial Services unit increased earnings 16 percent over the 1990 quarter.
But he also said NBC was a drag on the company. "NBC had a significantly negative quarter-to-quarter comparison reflecting lower ratings and the weak advertising market," Mr. Welch said. The company said the unit remained profitable, however, and enjoyed "a modest increase in revenues" as a result of broadcasting the professional basketball playoff games.
G.E.'s earnings per share in the period were up 7 percent as a result of a stock buyback program announced a year and a half ago. The company said it bought back 2 million shares in the second quarter.
A company statement said the jet engine, electrical equipment and medical instrument segments had all received major orders in recent weeks. Orders for $4 billion in commercial jet engines were booked in the last 60 days and orders for medical instruments are running 15 percent ahead of the comparable period in 1990. The backlog for electrical equipment totaled $8.4 billion on June 30, compared with $7.8 billion at year-end 1990.
Profits at all three divisions were reported to be higher than last year.
G.E. said the strong results posted by financial services were assisted by "improved performance" by its Kidder Peabody and Employers Reinsurance units.
Profits from the home appliances division were reported to be "flat" on lower revenues as a result of a slump in demand in the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Little Changed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The semiannual report by Alan Greenspan to Congress on the economy and monetary policy, normally an event of some note in the credit markets, was greeted with a yawn yesterday, and prices of Treasury securities were little changed in very slow trading.
In his remarks to a subcommittee of the House Banking Committee, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board painted a portrait of an economy climbing out of recession while inflationary pressures continued to moderate. 
 "He basically recapped what is a fairly broadly held consensus on the economy and inflation trends," said Joseph Liro, senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "The fact that he didn't break any new ground meant that his comments were not a catalyst of any significant change in the bond market."
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed in conducting monetary policy "has adapted a posture of watchful waiting" as economic data have increasingly suggested the economy is recovering.
 
Short-Term Interest Rates
 Traders interpreted those comments to mean that the Fed was highly unlikely to lower -- or raise -- short-term interest rates in coming months, and perhaps not for the balance of the year.
"He said that it's starting to look like a recovery, but that's what we want, and we won't try to abort it," said Robert Barbera, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
With Mr. Greenspan's testimony containing few surprises, traders said the market's focus shifted to the release today of consumer price data for June, as well as coping with huge amounts of new Treasury securities.
"In the next six weeks we either have an announcement of a new debt sale, or an auction," one government securities trader said. "That adds up to a lot of supply. And coping with that supply will be the issue confronting the market."
Today the Treasury is expected to announce the size of two-year and five-year note auctions to be held the week of July 22.
Between now and the end of the month the Treasury will sell another issue of new one-year notes, and will tell market participants how many securities it intends to sell at its quarterly refunding auctions in early August. All told, over the next six weeks the total could add up to more than $72 billion in new bills, notes and bonds.
"It's a big, big number," the trader said.
But the looming supply had little noticeable impact yesterday on price movements in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the day, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96 15/32, unchanged on the day, to yield 8.44 percent, the same level as late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 9/32 in late trading, up 1/32, to yield 8.25 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 1/4, up 1/32, to yield 6.85 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved modestly higher.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.57 percent, up three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a like amount, to a late rate of 5.71 percent.
In other developments, the Resolution Trust Corporation priced its second offering of mortgage-backed securities through an underwriting group led by the First Boston Corporation.
The $579 million issue consists of adjustable rate mortgages from three California-based institutions in RTC conservatorship, the Columbia Savings and Loan Association, County Bank FSB and the Santa Barbara Savings and Loan Association.
The securities were sold in two parts, and for the first time were priced off the one-month London interbank offered rate, a feature that underwriters said allowed the securities to be offered to a broader investor base, including overseas buyers.
The first $437 million worth of the securities, which carry an average life of 2.1 years, were priced at 55 basis points above the prevailing one-month Libor rate at the time of pricing.
The remaining $142 million of securities, which have an average life of just over five years, were priced at 68 basis points above the prevailing yield on one-month Libor.
Rates on the securities will be reset monthly. The issue is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors Service and by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Investment-Grade Bonds
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, South Carolina Electric and Gas offered $145 million worth of 15-year first mortgage bonds through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 percent bonds were priced at $99.55, to yield 9.055 percent, 80 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricig.
The securities, which mature July 15, 2006, are noncallable for life. The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said an unexpectedly large increase of $1.029 billion in Citicorp's loan-loss reserves had a negative impact on prices of the banking company's outstanding debt obligations. Prices of some Citicorp securities fell by as much as 1 3/4 points after the company released its second quarter earnings report.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to up about 1/8 point.

HEADLINE: Yields Off Slightly At Banks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields were down slightly on certificates of deposit and money market accounts for the week ended yesterday.
According to The Bank Rate Monitor, an interest rate publication based in North Palm Beach, Fla., the midyear economic recovery so many had expected has not come, despite some rosy economic indicators. "A full recovery is still six to nine months away," said Robert K. Heady, the publisher. 
 Bank depositors may only experience a gradual or faint rise in rates during this period, analysts said.
 
Rates Narrowly Down
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction on Monday, average discount rates were narrowly down. The three-month bill slipped two basis points, to 5.56 percent, while the six-month bill slipped a basis point, to 5.70 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The largest yield change at New York area banks this week was at the Bank of New York, which cut the yield of its money market account by 11 basis points, to 5.23 percent. The commercial bank also cut 16 basis points from its three-month certificate of deposit, to 5.55 percent. The Anchor Savings Bank raised the yield on its six-month certificate by 18 basis points, to 5.65 percent.
Among commercial banks, an average money market account fell by two basis points, to 5.15 percent, with three-month certificates off by a similar amount, to 5.45 percent. The longer, six-month certificate fell only by one basis point, to 5.64 percent.
 
Down by a Basis Point
 This week, depositors at savings institutions saw the average yield on a money market account and three-month certificate fall by one basis point, to 5.54 percent and 5.74 percent, respectively. The yield on a longer, six-month certificate did not change, remaining at 6.01 percent.
By comparison, at 20 large banks around the country, all of which are outside the New York market, the average money market yield was down two basis points, to 5.25 percent, while the average yield on a six-month certificate fell one basis point, to 5.70 percent.

HEADLINE: STRAUSS OPPOSES BROAD SOVIET AID

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Robert S. Strauss, the Ambassador-designate to Moscow, said today that he was opposed to providing the Soviet Union with a large-scale aid program, arguing at his Senate confirmation hearing that the Soviet Government remained too unwieldly to digest large amounts of assistance.
At a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing marked by joviality and soft questioning, the former Democratic Party chairman gave a skeptical assessment of the prospects for a smooth Soviet transition to democracy and capitalist development. He stressed that American business executives were justifiably cautious about investing in the Soviet Union. 
 "The economy is in free fall," Mr. Strauss said. "The bureaucracy is in decay. There is disillusionment among the people." Under such circumstances, "pouring money in there without something stronger in place would be like pouring it down a well."
"However," he added, "if they do begin to make the hard choices necessary to get economic reform on track, and if they keep democratizing and maintain their policy of cooperation, then I believe we should be prepared to respond, step by step, with assistance."
 
'Create Some Sprouts'
 Although he said "the U.S. Embassy ought to help American businesses make capital investments," Mr. Strauss rejected the view that there were business opportunities waiting to be seized on by imaginative American entrepeneurs. "What I hope to do is help start tiny projects where we can create some sprouts," he said. "That's the best I can hope to do."
Mr. Strauss has promised to step down from seven corporate boards and sell his stock in Pepsico and Archer Daniels Midland, two companies with substantial investments in the Soviet Union, should he be confirmed.
The 72-year-old Mr. Strauss, a former Carter Administration envoy responsible for trade and Middle Eastern affairs, conceded that he lacked expertise in Soviet affairs. "I do not speak Russian or any other native language of the Soviet peoples," he said. "I am not a specialist in Russian and Soviet history and culture. I have not traveled widely in the Soviet Union."
But Mr. Strauss suggested that he would be an activist Ambassador who would seek to broaden contacts with opposition figures, including leaders of the Baltic republics, whom he pointedly referred to as "heads of state." His priorities, he said, would include speaking out against "intimidation in the Baltics" and Soviet "support for Castro's brutality in Cuba."
Some senior Democrats have expressed disappointment that the former chairman of the their party would accept the diplomatic post just as the Democratic Party is revving up a difficult presidential campaign. Sen. Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, said: "Republicans have been trying to stop Bob Strauss from raising money for the Democratic Party for years. I think we now have finally done it."

HEADLINE: Riegle Offers A Third Bill On Banking

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee introduced a plan today to revive the ailing banking system that would keep far more contraints on the industry than either the version proposed by the Bush Administration or the bill adopted last month by the House Banking Committee.
The outlines of the legislation emerged last week, but today Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, provided details, which he said represent "a consensus that accommodates the broad views of many of my colleagues." 
 The three measures would dramatically rearrange the banking landscape.
Mr. Riegle's measure is considerably more sympathetic to smaller banks, bank consumers of modest means and the insurance industry than either the House or Administration measures. It is harder than the other versions on money-center banks and many large investment banks.
 
Would Curb Interstate Moves
 The Senate measure, like the Administration and House banking versions, would eliminate barriers to interstate banking. But in the Senate measure, state lawmakers can, if they act within three years, forbid out-of-state banks to open branches in their jurisdictions.
Many of the key elements of Mr. Riegle's legislation have been embraced by the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee, Senator Jake Garn of Utah, although Mr. Garn is said to prefer giving regulators more authority to decide how to bail out banks. He also opposes a number of consumer-oriented provisions in the Riegle legislation that would require banks to offer basic services to poor people and cash checks issued by the Government, like those for medical benefits and Social Security.
So far this year, however, banking issues in Congress have generally not been decided along party lines. Anticipating that some committee members will want to change portions of the complex 559-page package, Mr. Riegle told reporters that he had not yet decided when the committee would vote on it.
"I'd like to do it before the August recess," he said, "but I don't know whether we will be able to do it or not."
 
Administration Cautious
 Giving the Administration response to the Riegle measure, Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber said, "We think it's good that it's as comprehensive as it is," but added, "Obviously there are elements that we would like to see changed."
The Federal banking laws under attack by the Administration and the House Banking Committee go back more than six decades, and were aimed at eliminating the speculative excesses that led to the banking crisis of the 1930's.
The Riegle measure would eliminate the Depression-era restrictions, imposed by the Glass-Steagall Act, that prevent commercial banks and investment banks from merging. But as a practical matter this would have limited impact on Wall Street because the measure upholds current restrictions on industrial ownership of commercial banks, and a number of Wall Street's largest investment banks are owned by industrial enterprises.
 
Special Assessment Proposed
 Mr. Riegle's legislation would also hit the money center banks, notably J. P. Morgan, harder than other banks by changing the formula for contributions to the rapidly dwindling fund that insures bank deposits. By some accounts, that fund is already virtually insolvent. Mr. Riegle has proposed that the first $10 billion that the fund borrows from taxpayers be repaid through a special assessment on banks that would be based on foreign deposits, as well as domestic deposits.
The proposed legislation also differs from the other versions by ending the Government's policy of bailing out banks considered "too big to fail." It would adopt other measures intended to discourage the Federal Reserve from lending money to ailing banks through the discount window.
Treasury officials are particularly unhappy with the Riegle provision that would remove from Treasury the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings associations, and convert them into a new independent agency.
"It would be a mistake," Mr. Glauber said. "The public expects the Government to have some influence over the reglators. This would strip it away."
For individual depositors, Mr. Riegle decided to abandon his earlier view of imposing some modest restrictions on the current law, which protects deposits of up to $100,000 but permits families to increase their coverage substantially through the use of joint and trust accounts.
The House bill also retains the existing law on individual coverage. The Administration had proposed eliminating the use of joint and trust accounts to increase coverage beyond $100,000 plus retirement accounts of up to $100,000 per person per bank.

HEADLINE: A New Commodity to Be Traded: Government Permits for Pollution

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Ever searching for new ways to make markets and money, commodity exchanges have broadened their horizons from familiar products like soybeans and wheat to concepts like Eurodollar futures contracts that only a business school graduate could love. Now the nation's largest commodity mart has gone a step further, approving trading in Government permits to pollute.
The Chicago Board of Trade voted yesterday to create a private market for rights to emit sulfur dioxide. The rights are to be issued to electric utilities by the Environmental Protection Agency as part of Washington's strategy to reduce acid rain. 
 Besides providing a service to the electric power industry, such a market would allow trading by individuals, letting them stake investment money on a rise or fall in the value of pollution rights, much as they now speculate on stocks and bonds.
 
Offshoot of Clean Air Act
 Such a market was made possible by the Clean Air Act of 1990. In a departure from traditional regulatory practices, Congress gave polluters the right to meet sulfur emissions standards by buying and selling allowances that the Environmental Protection Agency will allot to individual plants.
While Federal officials are unwilling to comment on the Board of Trade initiative before they examine the details, there is every reason to believe the Bush Administration will hail the board's action.
Free-market proponents say they think the new market will make it cheaper and easier for utilities to do their part in reducing acid rain. "We are anxious to establish a bona fide private market," said William G. Rosenberg, an assistant administrator at the E.P.A. Initially, no Government approval is required for the trading.
 
Could Serve as a Model
Many environmental analysts say, moreover, that the new market could serve as a model for least-cost controls on other pollutants -- notably the smog-producing chemicals that bedevil most American cities. And it could presage a far more ambitious effort to limit emissions of gases that are widely thought to be warming the earth's atmosphere.
The Clean Air Act limits total emissions of sulfur dioxide gas from 110 power plants in 1995. Five years later, a much more stringent limit will force the industry to reduce emissions to less than half of the 1991 level. Dan Dudek, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund who helped to draft the rules, argues that by allowing polluters to trade their emissions allowances, individual utilities in different markets with different types of power plants will not be locked into a single cleanup strategy.
One company may find that it pays to install smokestack scrubbers on aging coal-fired boilers, bringing its emissions below the requirements, and then sell the surplus allowances. Another may leave untouched a heavy sulfur polluter that is otherwise efficient, and will buy allowances to cover the excess emissions. Still another may subsidize customers' purchases of energy-efficient appliances and lighting equipment, thereby cutting electricity demand and permitting it to shut down its offending boilers.
But Richard Sandor, an executive managing director of Kidder, Peabody & Company, notes that the freedom to buy and sell allowances will not yield the maximum possible benefits unless utilities have an easy way to exchange them at a price that reflects the lowest possible cost of removing sulfur from the air. That is where the Chicago Board of Trade's initiative fits in.
 
Trading to Start in 1993
 Under the plan, the exchange will begin trading "cash forward" contracts in 1993 -- simple agreements to deliver allowances after they are issued in 1995. It will also ask the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for permission to establish a continuing "futures" market, permitting anyone to gamble on emissions rights in standardized 25-ton allotments up to three years in advance.
A utility might, for example, buy 100 contracts due in 1997, thereby nailing down the right to spew an extra 2,500 tons of sulfur dioxide that year. The seller might be another utility that is planning to close down an old coal plant in 1997. Or it might be a mutual fund run by a brokerage house, whose manager thinks the price of allowances will fall, and is prepared to risk clients' money on the bet.
Mr. Sandor estimates that contracts will initially trade at about $400 a ton and will fluctuate with factors ranging from the demand for electricity to the state of scrubber technology. The price could not rise above $2,000 because utilities always have the option of exceeding their legal emissions and paying a fine of $2,000 a ton.
Not everyone is convinced that the plan will work smoothly. John Palmisano, the president of Aer-X, a Wash ington firm that is a pioneer in the private trading of local pollution allowances for smog-creating chemicals, says he thinks the market will be hard to establish. Most of the exchanges in sulfur allowances, he suspects, will be made directly between utilities, in large blocks. He worries, moreover, that some state regulators will balk at allowing utilities to participate in a national market for pollution rights.
The volume of trading may be light by the standards of the Board of Trade, acknowledges Mr. Sandor, who drafted the proposal along with Philip Senechal, chief executive of the Bellefonte Lime Corporation in Bellefonte, Pa. On a typical day, futures representing 200,000 bushels of corn and 150,000 bushels of soybeans are traded on the exchange.
But computerized trading could be used to match buyers and sellers at low cost. And in any case, notes Jim Thompson, the former Governor of Illinois who, along with Mr. Sandor, served as co-chairman of the exchange committee analyzing emissions allowances, noted that "the Board of Trade has social benefits as well as members' profits in mind."
Those benefits could spill into market-based approaches to environmental regulation that are just now reaching the public agenda. Southern California regulators are pondering the wisdom of creating a computerized market for business permits to emit volatile organic chemicals. Dozens of other cities, hard-pressed to meet Federal air-quality standards, will also be seeking the least intrusive ways to regulate emissions of these smog-producing gases.
 
A Head Start
 Mr. Sandor said the Board of Trade's venture might prove invaluable both in designing these local markets for emissions permits and gaining legitimacy for the concept with local regulators. It would also give them a head start in producing computer software for operating such markets cheaply and fairly.
The experience could pay even greater dividends, should Washington decide to limit emissions of greenhouse gases as part of a global commitment to slow atmospheric warming. The principal greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and refrigeration chemicals -- are emitted in large quantities by thousands of businesses. The possible means of mitigating their effects, everything from energy conservation to planting trees that trap carbon, are many and varied.
Mr. Dudek of the Environmental Defense Fund says that strategies for controlling greenhouse gases that try to second-guess private efforts are bound to be wasteful. His group is now pressing for legislation to limit utilities' emissions of carbon dioxide -- which could become more fodder for the Board of Trade.

HEADLINE: Dispute Over '90 Census Heads for Courts, Again

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
In 1988, New York City went to court to force the Federal Government to adjust the 1990 census count using a procedure that had never been tried. Today, the city is back in court, but this time as an advocate of a procedure that has now been found by Government experts to improve the count for most of the nation.
While Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher was making his rounds on Capitol Hill, defending his refusal to adjust the census before a friendly panel of Senators and a somewhat more skeptical House subcommittee, lawyers for New York and other cities were beginning their review of a new mountain of material that may bolster their case that their clients have been shortchanged in the census. 
 Mr. Mosbacher and the executive branch had their say on the issue on Monday. The Democrats who control Congress, including two important subcommittee chairmen, are split into unlikely factions by the politics of the numbers and seem unable to trump this decision with a veto-proof bill ordering an adjustment. That leaves the Federal court system as the final and most important stage, the place where the arcane and important drama of the census will have its denouement.
 
No Changes Soon
 Some things will not change, at least not soon. Mr. Mosbacher's decision makes it clear that 1992 Congressional and state legislative races, and the three state legislative races that take place in 1991, will be conducted on the basis of the raw census counts.
Any of the Federal funds given out to states and cities on the basis of population counts will use the original census figures, which showed that 248.7 million people lived in the country on April 1, 1990. Those funds are estimated to be about $59 billion annually, said Michael P. Murray, a professor at Bates College in Lewiston, Me.
The Census Bureau estimates that its counts are missing about five million people, but Mr. Mosbacher and his top aides at the Commerce Department say the missing people cannot be located with certainty and that this uncertainty makes it too risky to change a count based on the traditional methods.
The Constitution calls for an "enumeration" of the population. Wendell Willkie 2d, the Commerce Department's general counsel, told the Senate subcommittee on government information and regulation today that laws and court cases offer "very little guidance" on the legality of statistical adjustment of the count.
 
Plenty of Plaintiffs
 While a settlement was reached in 1989 on the cities' request for an injunction to force the Federal Government to prepare for an adjustment, the underlying suit was never withdrawn or dismissed, and now will be rejoined.
This means the plaintiffs and their lawyers now step back into leading roles in the drama, which has enough actors for a Cecil B. De Mille extravaganza.
The original list of plaintiffs was not small; it included New York City, the State of New York, Los Angeles, the State of California, Houston, Chicago, Dade County, Fla., the National League of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and eight individuals.
As the problems with the original census became widely publicized, cities that feared undercounts lined up to join the fray. Joining the suit were the states of New Jersey, Florida and Texas and the cities of Phoenix; Cleveland; Denver; New Orleans; Oakland and Pasadena, Calif.; Philadelphia; San Antonio; San Francisco; Broward County, Fla., and Inglewood, Calif. -- by census measures, the most undercounted city in the country.
 
Next Step May Be Trial
 Peter Zimroth, a lawyer with the New York offices of the Washington law firm Arnold & Porter, said the next step was getting Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin of Federal District Court to agree to a trial on the issue.
The Justice Department has opposed a trial, and the legal discovery proceedings that would allow the plaintiffs to make extensive inquiries about the decision-making process. The department says that the judge should be able to rule on the basis of the voluminous material already submitted and the new record on which Mr. Mosbacher based his decision.
That material, about 15 pounds of documents released by the Commerce Department this afternoon, shows that seven people of a nine-member panel of census experts recommended adjustment and that Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant also told the Secretary that "I believe that statsitical adjustment, while far from a perfect procedure, will on average increase the accuracy of the 1990 census."
But she said there remained "2 percent of the population who cannot be reached by enumeration efforts."
Can those missing 5.3 million people be accurately located around the country through use of a post-census survey of 400,000 people? According to the calculations made by bureau experts and Michael R. Darby, Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at Commerce, two-thirds of the country lives in jurisdictions that would be made more accurate by adjustment.
Even so, "in my professional opinion," Mr. Darby wrote in his recommendation, "we do not have the tools at this point to improve the distribution" of the population over the original count.
His calculations and the bureau's showed that an adjustment would give some of the cities involved in the lawsuit -- including New York, Chicago, Phoenix, Houston and San Antonio -- more than their fair share of population and that their final counts would be less accurate than the original undercount.
One of the issues on which Judge McLaughlin will probably be asked to rule is whether the relative unfairness of such overcounts, the result of adjustment, is better or worse than the relative unfairness of the acknowledged undercounts.

HEADLINE: Dow Stocks Slip by 6.71; Volume Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks edged lower yesterday, but trading picked up sharply.
Even the bank stocks, which enjoyed a one-day flurry Monday after Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover announced a merger plan, gave way. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6.71, to 2,983.90, while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fell 0.85, to 381.54. Both declines were so inconclusive as to suggest that investors were not enthusiastic about either buying or selling.
Trading activity rose to 183 million shares, from 161.8 million the day before, but only 250,000 shares of yesterday's volume came in the additional hour of trading added in June. Big Board advances narrowly led declines, with 840 stocks rising in price while 755 fell.
Traders said that in view of the lagging economy, they wanted to get a better idea of second-quarter earnings before moving more heavily one way or the other.
 
Looking to Greenspan
 Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to whom investors look for guidance on interest rates, had little new to say in testimony before a House banking subcommittee yesterday, and as a result had only a minor impact on the market.
In remarks interpreted to mean that the Fed would not cut interest rates to stimulate the economy further, Mr. Greenspan said that on monetary policy, the central bank had "adopted a posture of watchful waiting as economic indicators have pointed increasingly toward recovery."
David M. Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said, "Almost everything he said was anticipated in the bond market, so there was no follow-through to stocks."
"The economy's recovering," Mr. Jones said, "and that's what Greenspan emphasized. But we already knew that."
The Dow was choppy for most of the day, setting up a volatile market dear to the pocketbooks of Wall Street's program traders. The blue chips rose at the opening bell, immediately fell back, and rose again. By a little before noon, the Dow was in negative territory for the second time, but it steadily began fighting back. By 2:30 P.M., the Dow managed to edge into positive territory, only to drop precipitously in heavy program selling.
Birinyi Associates, which monitors computer-activated programs, spotted three selling waves that clipped the Dow 18 points. In the biggest wave, the Dow slid 12.5 points in a 27-minute selling spurt that began at 2:59 P.M.
Among the banks, Wells Fargo, which rose 6 1/4 on Monday in the euphoria over other possible bank mergers, lost 3 1/8, to 73 1/2. It reported substantially lower second-quarter profits. Most of the others changed only slightly, but Chase Manhattan, regarded as one of the strongest merger contenders, rose 3/8, to 20 1/4, after Monday's 1 7/8-point gain.
Chemical, whose name will survive in its merger with Manufacturers Hanover, fell 7/8, to 25 3/4, giving up part of its 2 3/4-point gain on Monday.
After the merger announcement, George Salem, banking analyst for Prudential Securities, recommended both Chemical and Manufacturers, and the Reuters news service quoted him as saying he had not recommended buying either in 20 years.
 
Big Percentage Gain
 In one of the biggest percentage gains on the Big Board, Triton Energy rose 4 3/4, or 19 percent, to 29 3/4, with 2.5 million shares changing hands. It rose 3 1/2 last week and 1 1/2 on Monday. Last Friday, British Petroleum told analysts of a big new oil discovery in Colombia in which Triton has a 20 percent interest. Monroe Helm of Morgan Stanley said the price could go to $38.
Steel stocks were strong, with Lukens, which reported record second-quarter profits, rising 3, to 47 1/8. Geneva Steel rose 2, to 19 1/4, after an Oppenheimer recommendation, and USX-U.S. Steel rose 1, to 24 5/8.
 
New I.B.M. Low
 Technology stocks had another bad day. I.B.M. fell 2 5/8 in heavy trading, to 96 5/8. It also sank during the day to a 52-week low of 96. Thomas Rooney of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette recommended sale of the stock before its second-quarter earnings report on Friday. He forecast that the company could report a loss by the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Summit in London;
Gorbachev's Big Gamble

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 16

 BODY:
In his special plea to the world's industrial powers, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is attempting one of the most ambitious strategies of an adaptive career: he is trying to move the withered economic heart of the Soviet domestic agenda into the theater of global politics, where he flourishes.
He has no such touch at home, where he faces cynicism toward himself and his reconstruction program. In turning to the world forum, he is seeking a morale lift from the world at large for the sagging national spirit, as much as traditional foreign aid. 
 With varying degrees of sympathy, the Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies will sit as a capitalist Round Table to hear out the irrepressible guest from the east, who was reported still pondering and editing his ultimate plea to the economic summit meeting as he arrived tonight.
In an advance token of the Group of Seven's concern, the group announced that it would introduce annual meetings between its chairman and the Soviet President. The group thus created a special status for Mr. Gorbachev, whose chief point in demanding an audience was that the Soviet Union retains superpower potential in a world of intermeshed economies.
 
Economic Hedges and Caveats
 But at that, President Gorbachev's credibility was being called into question even before he landed. His advance summary letter to the Group of Seven was criticized by some as being a sweeping but vague mix of free-market promises and imprecise timetables, lacking the substance to right a national economy now estimated by some Western experts to be reeling under an annual inflation rate in excess of 100 percent.
It is a rapidly shrinking economy of plummeting production, ballooning deficit and lost credibility symbolized by the tattered ruble. It is an economy haunted by the separate pressures from the nation's 15 republics to find greater power sharing and free market opportunities with Mr. Gorbachev's cooperation or without it.
"The rate of decline is fantastic," said Stanley Fischer, an economist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is involved in pressing on the Kremlin a high-speed plan for a radical free-market shift. Not even in the Great Depression in America was there a rate of collapse to rival what is now taking hold in the Soviet Union, according to Dr. Fischer, who warned that there is no time for further procrastination and well-meaning study by either Mr. Gorbachev or the Group of Seven.
On Wednesday, the Soviet President has the audience he pleaded for. The overnight mood of expectancy here was riveted on the mind of Mr. Gorbachev: Will he retreat from the critical free-market leap of faith, as he did last year, or will he come up with a convincing plan for dealing with the declining Soviet economy?
When last heard from, Mr. Gorbachev's enthusiastic talk of joining the world economy was hedged with several caveats about fully introducing private property and shackling the remains of the bureaucratic monolith of the Communist economy.
But perhaps the best indication of Mr. Gorbachev's intentions was the aide who did not accompany him to London tonight -- Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the free-market economist whose standing with Mr. Gorbachev is watched by the world as a kind of litmus test of whether the Soviet President has shed his past proclivity for compromising too much with Communist tradition in making his vows for a free-market future.
 
Sense of Urgency
 At last report, Mr. Yavlinsky chose to stay in Moscow in what was seen as a protest.
But Mr. Gorbachev first made believers of the world when he stepped up to the global table and began making disarmament credible. Now he is back at the table with a different agenda, the need to make the end of economic Communism believable in order to finally lead his mammoth nation away from collapse and toward a share of the world's prosperity.
His task touches countless factors beyond the terrible reality of the careering Soviet economy. Those range from the complex political needs of the Group of Seven leaders -- their separate budget constraints and electoral anxieties -- to the simple image of the beggar's bowl that one Soviet newspaper depicted poignantly waiting for Mr. Gorbachev amid a banquet table set sumptuously for seven.
All that, plus an undeniable sense of urgency, is in the air as Mr. Gorbachev gets his audience.
"No one can say what the results will be, but even now we have achieved a great result in the very fact of Gorbachev meeting with the G-7," said Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir I. Shcherbakov. "This is a historic achievement."

HEADLINE: Coalition to Aid Dinkins Seems To Break Away

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
A liberal, labor and minority coalition that began several weeks ago as an effort to strengthen Mayor David N. Dinkins's hand in dealing with the newly empowered New York City Council and the city budget is now apparently breaking with the Mayor because of his budget cuts affecting city workers and social-welfare programs.
Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union -- a coalition leader, along with his close friend, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch -- has said the group "is not a Dinkins coalition." 
 The group, he predicted, "will come forward with programs inconsistent with the Dinkins administration," including proposals for higher commuter taxes, no layoffs and the taxing of Columbia University and other institutions that are tax exempt.
Unlike the outspoken Mr. Rivera, many City Council candidates, still collecting nominating petitions due to be filed by next Monday, were wary of antagonizing City Hall and thus cautious in assessing the impact of the Mayor on the coming primaries and elections.
 
'Very Divisive'
 Some privately agreed with Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens that Mr. Dinkins would be a political albatross for them. But others, particularly in minority areas, echoed Mr. Lynch, who contended that the Mayor's support would be an asset.
"To some degree, the Mayor will be very divisive," said Mr. Rivera who was a major figure in the Dinkins mayoral campaign. He said the hiring of Hulbert James, a City Hall aide of Mr. Lynch, as the coalition's executive director was not further evidence of a Dinkins connection. "He was an activist long before he was associated with David Dinkins," Mr. Rivera said.
The coalition had billed its formation as an effort to elect enough pro-Dinkins members to the expanded Council to give the Mayor more leverage against Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and his mostly middle-class Democratic organization allies in the Council.
Now, the coalition leaders are confronted with the political and fiscal reality that the Mayor and Mr. Vallone teamed up to pass a budget that represented a compromise. It struck a balance between higher taxes on income and real estate that most affect the middle and upper economic classes, and cuts in social-welfare programs and municipal worker layoffs, whose impact is primarily on the lower end of the economic spectrum, the constituents of the coalition -- particularly labor and minority leaders.
Even before the coalition's distancing from the Mayor, some critics questioned whether the group is a paper tiger. Henry Stern, president of the nonpartisan Citizens Union civic group, noted the absence of such politically influential unions as District Council 37 of the municipal workers' union, the teachers' union and the teamsters' union that were critical elements of the Dinkins victory in 1989.
"It's puzzling to announce a coalition that just calls attention to how many of the old partners aren't there," he said.
The informal coalition, which includes Borough President Ruth W. Messinger and Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, both of Manhattan, and Representative Major Owens of Brooklyn, is putting together a liberal policy statement to emphasize restoration and expansion of social-welfare programs and city services and serve as a platform for Council candidates to be endorsed and helped by the group.
Ms. Messinger, citing the "grueling budget process," said the coalition would de-emphasize the Mayor and concentrate on electing "a more diversified, full-time Council interested in solving the city's long-term problems."
 
'Very Dangerous Position'
 Coalition members and critics acknowledged that identification with the Mayor could be a handicap to Council candidates in many districts. "The Mayor would be in a very dangerous position if he turned this into a referendum, " Councilman McCaffrey said.
Sam Meyers, president of Local 259 of the United Automobile Workers, conceded that there "has been some shifting" in the coalition goals. "If we're going to fault the Council, we can't allow Dinkins to go without criticism," he said.
Another coalition labor leader, Arthur Cheliotes of the Communications Workers, said he was "troubled with the ongoing relationship with Bill Lynch," who is so closely identified with the Mayor. He and Mr. Rivera agreed that Mr. Lynch might be put in the position of choosing between the Mayor and the coalition.
Mr. Lynch said his choice would be the Mayor, but he hoped "we can work out any differences" with the coalition.
Two other major labor leaders in the Dinkins mayoral campaign -- Stanley Hill of the municipal workers' union and Barry Feinstein of the teamsters -- have refused to join the coalition, contending that they are satisfied with the Council and its leadership.
"They've been doing fine," Mr. Hill said.
"I would fight any attempt to make the Council beholden to the Mayor," Mr. Feinstein said. He added that he still considered the coalition a Dinkins front despite the new disclaimers. "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck," he said.

HEADLINE: Weicker Goes On TV to Press For Income Tax

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 16

 BODY:
In an unusual prime-time televised speech from the Governor's mansion, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. conceded tonight that his budget plans had failed to win over the legislature and appealed to residents to end Connecticut's drawn-out fiscal crisis by pressuring their representatives to accept an income tax.
He appeared to be digging in his heels in his battle with the legislature and gave no hint that he was ready to drop his insistence on a plan that most of the lawmakers have never even come close to accepting. 
 He urged state residents and lawmakers to accept the "bitter pill" of his budget plan, even though the non-income-tax alternatives offered by the legislature might seem more appealing on the surface.
"The choice is between what works and what feels good," he said.
 
'A Fair Compromise'
 He also offered what he called "a fair compromise" to automatically end the income tax in December 1993 and threatened to impose deep but unspecified spending cuts if lawmakers insisted on passing over his objections a "dishonest" budget.
"What you insist upon will happen," he told residents in a sometimes angry and emotional 15-minute address. "Families and friends of Connecticut, you're not out of the loop on this budget business."
But the speech appeared to fall flat among lawmakers, who administration officials said earlier in the day were one of the main targets of the address.
Leaders in the legislature, including even some of those sympathetic to Mr. Weicker's views on the tax system, dismissed the speech as contributing nothing new or providing no help to resolve the crisis that has gripped the state government since July 1 without a budget. Others said the Governor's harsh criticism of the legislature, which he called "the gang that couldn't count straight," would damage whatever good will he still has among lawmakers.
"The Governor has taken his one last shot at trying to convince somebody," said the House minority leader, Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., Republican of Bristol, an income-tax opponent. "The public will certainly reject this latest proposal as well."
 
Too Little, Too Late
 The Speaker of the House, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat who supports the income tax, said the so-called sunset provision for ending the tax at the end of 1993 was "nothing new" and said the proposals were really too little, too late. "I don't really see it going anywhere," he said. "I wish I were wrong."
In many ways it was a crucial speech for Mr. Weicker, given at a moment that hangs heavy with possible long-term implications for both the state and his six-month-old administration.
Just 24 hours earlier, Senate Democrats killed what many lawmakers believe was the last possible budget compromise that would include an income tax. And as the lawmakers continued their meetings at the Capitol today, there was a palpable sense of despair in many voices and renewed resignation that the only way out may be to simply thwart Mr. Weicker and override his most recent budget veto.
 
Revenue Overhaul
 Mr. Weicker has vetoed two non-income-tax budgets over the last six weeks, most recently on July 1, when he killed the legislature's budget as his first official act of the new fiscal year. He proposed earlier this year a sweeping revenue overhaul that would lower most of the state's existing taxes as a way to stimulate the economy, then make up the difference with a 6 percent flat income tax, later amended to a 6.75 percent progressive-rate tax.
Connecticut is one of only 10 states with no tax on wages, though it does tax income earned from dividends, interest and capital gains.
An override vote, which would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, would avoid the income tax and resolve the state's huge revenue shortfall instead through a huge expansion of the existing revenue system. The 8 percent sales tax in particular, already the highest statewide rate in the nation, would be applied to millions of new transactions, from car repairs to dry-cleaning services and taxi rides.
 
An 'Unemployment Act'
 The plan includes about $1 billion in new taxes. Mr. Weicker has called it an "unemployment act" that would cripple the state's already weak economy.
Lawmakers say that overriding Mr. Weicker's July 1 budget veto would also resolve in the bitterest possible way the tensions that have simmered for months between the Democratic-controlled legislature and Mr. Weicker's independent third-party executive branch and would kill perhaps for years the hopes, especially among many Democrats, to overhaul a tax structure that they say is unfair to the poor. Next year is an election year for almost every member of the 187-member General Assembly.
"I don't think anybody at this point has any new twists," said the Senate President pro tem, John B. Larson, an anti-income-tax Democrat from East Hartford. He said he would push to override the veto as early as Thursday.
The House Speaker, Mr. Balducci, said he believed that many lawmakers would be "upset" by the critical tone directed at the legislature. He said that the sunset provision ending the income tax was considered months ago and dismissed, but that, in fairness to the Governor, he would bring it forth again on Wednesday at the party caucuses.

HEADLINE: Summit in London;
7 Nations Voice Support for Gorbachev

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 16

 BODY:
On the eve of their potentially pivotal meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the heads of the seven leading industrialized democracies voiced support today for his reform efforts, agreed to special status for Moscow in the International Monetary Fund and promised that their chairman would meet each year with the current Soviet leader.
But as Mr. Gorbachev arrived in London, reportedly with fresh economic proposals in his briefcase, Western leaders were still divided on just how far they were willing to go to help the Soviet Union, short of immediate large-scale infusions of cash, which they have all ruled out as impractical. 
 The very fact of Mr. Gorbachev's coming in search of help from his erstwhile adversaries has made this a unique meeting, something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.
 
Moscow's Main Backer: Germany
 Germany, which has been the Soviet Union's main supporter during the summit conference here, kept pushing for more than technical aid.
The Germans were backed by France and Italy, but others were less enthusiastic, and a senior British official said the United States was "behaving in a most obstinate way, making it hard to assemble a package."
What has been agreed to so far, said Gianni De Michelis, the Italian Foreign Minister, "is not enough" to match so momentous an occasion. He insisted at a briefing tonight that "we must launch some new signal" of commitment to Soviet well-being and, by implication, to Mr. Gorbachev's political survival.
 
Few Specifics From Baker
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d responded that Mr. Gorbachev "will not leave empty-handed," but he offered few specifics other than promising expert advice and small grants from the West to help the Soviet Union reform its archaic food distribution system, attract investments in oil and gas and convert its defense industries to civilian use.
In their annual political declaration, the seven leaders set out a number of proposals designed to foster "a peaceful, just, democratic and prosperous world." Most of the proposals grew out of the war in the Persian Gulf and reflected the successful use of the United Nations, once seemingly moribund, as a vehicle for joint international action. [Excerpts, page A10.]
The seven called for a stronger peacekeeping role for the United Nations as well as improved United Nations relief services and urged the establishment of an international register of arms sales, but stopped short of advocating even a temporary ban on such sales in troubled areas. The group also backed United States efforts to promote a Middle East peace conference and to insure that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq cannot develop nuclear weapons.
"We are going to make sure, one way or another, that Iraq does not become -- does not even create the danger of becoming -- a nuclear power," said Douglas Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, in presenting the group's declaration. Asked whether that meant his country would join the United States in military action if needed, he answered, "Yes, it does mean that."
At their meeting this afternoon, the leaders took up environmental questions, with Prime Minister John Major of Britain pressing Mr. Bush hard to set targets for reductions of carbon dioxide emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial pollution, which the President has so far been unwilling to do. Mr. Major also called, amid some skepticism, for all the leaders to agree to attend next year's United Nations summit conference on the environment.
 
Sparring Over Trade
 The seven nations -- France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Britain, Germany and the United States -- also continued to spar over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Negotiations to expand and strengthen GATT have been stalled for years, and no more than a plea for redoubled efforts to get an agreement in the next 12 months is likely to emerge from here.
After the final formal session of the summit conference on Wednesday, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will sit down for lunch together, and American officials hope that they will be able to agree on a date for a superpower summit meeting in Moscow later this month or early in August. That will depend in part on whether Secretary of State Baker and Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, can find a way at their talks, also on Wednesday, to resolve the last technical issue barring a strategic arms reduction treaty.
Mr. Baker cautioned that there was no guarantee that a deal could be concluded here this week.
Praising Mr. Gorbachev's goals of political and economic change, the document issued by the seven leaders said, "Our support for the process of fundamental reform in the Soviet Union remains as strong as ever."
In a 23-page letter sent last week to the conferees, Mr. Gorbachev said he was "pinning high hopes on the upcoming meeting in London." He said he feared that without Western aid, the bleak Soviet economic outlook could lead to "major social conflicts and pose a threat to democratic reform."
 
Gorbachev's Plans Criticized
 But the plans for introducing a market economy outlined in the letter have been criticized as too nebulous to justify Western aid by several of the governments represented here. Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the co-author of a more ambitious reform program, said in Moscow that he had refused to accompany Mr. Gorbachev to protest what he termed the "imprecise nature" of the plans.
Leonid M. Zamyatin, the Soviet Ambassador in London, said Mr. Gorbachev would "add many things" to his written text once he sat down for three hours of conversation with the seven leaders on Wednesday. The diplomat added, "He will answer their questions, and he will ask some of his own."
Membership for Moscow in the International Monetary Fund, of a limited character still to be worked out, and access to larger loans from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were among the gestures to the Soviet Union that the leaders reportedly discussed in detail today. Dieter Vogel, the German spokesman, said that only the United States and Japan had argued against increasing the Soviet borrowing quota from the European bank.
"There is still disagreement about how to follow up" with direct financial support, the German Finance Minister, Jurgen Mollemann, said late this afternoon. The Germans want to set up a working group within the 24-nation Organization for European Cooperation and Development in Paris to coordinate support for the Soviet Union, but the United States opposes that on the grounds that it would create pressure for assistance before that was wise.
 
Dispute Over Fund Membership
 The United States was also reported by the Europeans to oppose promising the Soviet Union now that it would soon be given full membership in the monetary fund. With evident exasperation, Mr. De Michelis said tonight that he and his continental European colleagues could not understand why the United States insisted on denying full membership to the Soviet Union when "107 other countries already are in."
In proposing a broader role for the United Nations, the seven leaders said the world organization "showed during the gulf crisis that it could fulfill its role of acting to restore international peace" and argued that "the international community must now build on this new spirit of cooperation not only in the Middle East, but wherever danger and conflict threaten."
The conferees pledged themselves to make "preventive diplomacy a top priority" within the United Nations and urged the appointment of a high-level official at the organization to make its relief operations more effective.
In the postwar Middle East, the seven nations declared, sanctions should be maintained against Iraq not only until it had met the terms of United Nations resolutions, but also until "the people of Iraq as well as their neighbors can live without fear of intimidation, repression or attack." That seemed to imply that the sanctions would last until President Hussein had been ousted.
 
Putting Pressure on Israel
With Mr. Baker planning to return to the Middle East later this week on his fifth trip since the war ended, the leaders stepped up the pressure on Israel, urging it to join Syria in agreeing to peace talks. They also said that the Arab boycott of businesses trading with Israel should end and called for the end of Israeli settlements in occupied territories.
The proposal for an international arms register was included in a separate statement, reflecting the difficulty in reaching agreement. France, which has historically resisted turning the Group of Seven into anything even vaguely bureaucratic or institutional, held out until Mr. Major agreed to drop any role for the group in setting up or monitoring the register. Instead, the group supported a United Nations register of all arms sales to "alert the international community to an attempt by a state to build up holdings of conventional weapons beyond a reasonable level." Another Iraq must be avoided, members said.
But the problems with such a register would be numerous. Cheating would not be difficult for secretive and often duplicitous arms dealers, and no means of enforcing notification to the register were specified. Moreover, "a reasonable level" of armaments would be a highly subjective judgment.
 
Argument Over the Environment
 Some of the hottest exchanges reported by officials present at the closed sessions today dealt with the environment. Mr. Bush has already come under attack in Britain from Michael Heseltine, the Environment Minister, for resisting stricter curbs on carbon dioxide emissions, and today Laurens Binkhorst, the European Commmunity's Director General for the Environment, said the United States, "which emits twice as much CO 2per capita as anyone except the Eastern European countries," needed to rethink its position in the next few months.
The Bush Administration, and especially John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, have expressed deep suspicions about the contention, accepted by the European governments, that carbon dioxide is the principal factor in causing global warming. Hoping to avoid being branded anti-environment, the United States has circulated brochures here listing its accomplishments in the last year.

HEADLINE: SENATE COMMITTEE DELAYS HEARINGS ON C.I.A. NOMINEE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The Senate Intelligence Committee today delayed until mid-September confirmation hearings on the nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, a serious but not necessarily fatal setback for Mr. Gates.
The committee said the postponement was needed for it to investigate whether Mr. Gates, President Bush's deputy national security adviser, knew more than he has acknowledged about the Iran-contra affair when he served as deputy C.I.A. director in 1986. The extra time also gives the committee a chance to examine other potentially troublesome issues that have surfaced in recent days. 
 The delay may prove costly to Mr. Gates because it exposes him to two more months of questions and the potential for new disclosures while he waits until September to make a formal, sworn response before the committee.
 
Embarrassment for Bush
 For Mr. Gates, a further loss of momentum toward confirmation raises the possibility that his support in the Senate will wither and that he will face the same fate he suffered more than four years ago when he withdrew his nomination for the same post amid unanswered questions about his role in the then-unfolding Iran-contra affair.
The postponement was reluctantly agreed to by the White House, but was an embarrassment for Mr. Bush, who has severely criticized the committee for foot-dragging and lobbied its members to confirm Mr. Gates quickly. Mr. Bush has argued, correctly so far, that there is no hard evidence to automatically disqualify Mr. Gates from winning confirmation.
Senior Administration officials acknowledged that the White House and crucial Republican lawmakers had been split on how wise it was to push for early hearings and that today's decision by the committee leaves them divided about what strategy to pursue now.
"There are many explanations about what the delay means," said a senior Administration official involved in the process, "but certainly it's not a positive development or the best scenario for Gates. There are those who believe that it's over except for the fat lady singing, that we've given in to these guys. There are others who say that we just have to let the committee work for another few weeks and then press forward again. The only strategy we have forged for now is to wait."
In announcing the delay after a closed-door meeting of the committee this afternoon, the committee chairman, Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, said the decision was made with the concurrence of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gates. "The committee's scheduling decision should in no way imply a negative attitude toward the nomination," Mr. Boren said, "but simply reflects the committee's responsibility to the Senate and the American people to be as thorough as possible."
 
'A Covey of Quail'
 The announcement came just four days after Mr. Bush demanded "fair play" for Mr. Gates, arguing at a news conference in Kennebunkport, Me., that a delay in the confirmation hearings was improper because it allowed time for rumors and innuendo.
Mr. Bush's attack on the committee, particularly his accusation that its members should not "panic and run like a covey of quail" when confronted with new allegations, was in sharp contrast to his laudatory remarks about the committee on May 14 when he announced Mr. Gates's nomination.
The President's criticism continued today, committee members said, with a statement read to the panel that complained of an unnecessary "start and stop" delay on the hearings.
Senator Dennis DeConcini, an Arizona Democrat who sits on the committee, said, "The President has put the nomination in more trouble, and it might not have happened if he hadn't started calling us names for no good reason."
Accusing Mr. Bush of "boisterous demagoging" and playing politics, Mr. DeConcini added, "If he had read all the testimony we have, he would concur that we have not stonewalled and we are not a covey of quail."
Mr. Bush's official statement to the committee was released later today in London, where the President is attending a meeting of the seven major economic powers. Its tone was milder than that of the draft read to the committee, said Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio.
 
Long Interval for Nominee
 The official statement explained that although the White House concurred in the decision to delay the hearings there were still "concerns" that a drawn-out confirmation process would be unfair to Mr. Gates, and it urged the committee to move forward "expeditiously and without interruption."
The interval between Mr. Gates's nomination and completion of the confirmation process already promises to be one of the longest, if not the longest, since the C.I.A. was established in 1947. Most nominees for Director of Central Intelligence have been approved by the Senate within a month to six weeks of their selection by the President. Those who have withdrawn in the face of opposition, including Mr. Gates in 1987 and Theodore C. Sorensen, who was named by President Jimmy Carter in 1976, have done so quickly.
If the committee begins its hearings in mid-September, it would be four months after Mr. Bush nominated Mr. Gates, with further delay possible before the panel votes and the nomination is taken up by the full Senate. William H. Webster, the current Director, has said he will remain on the job until a successor is confirmed.
The date for beginning the hearings was a compromise between the White House and the committee after lengthy consultations that included lawmakers on and off the committee, Administration lawyers and Mr. Gates.
The committee resisted the President's request to vote on Mr. Gates's nomination before Congress's August recess. But it essentially agreed that if Mr. Bush insisted it would begin the hearings this month, with the understanding that they would probably have to be interrupted so crucial witnesses could be called to testify. When it became apparent that the committee would not agree to complete the hearings or vote until sometime in the fall, the White House was faced with a dilemma: have a lengthy, indefinite gap in the midst of the hearings or agree to a delay.
Some lawmakers, like the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, argued for the hearings to begin immediately. "I feel strongly that Bob Gates is a victim," Mr. Dole said. "It's unfortunate that the hearings will be postponed."
 
Comparison With Tower
 But the view of other senators, particularly William S. Cohen, Republican of Maine, prevailed. In discussions with Mr. Gates, senior White House officials and committee members, Senator Cohen, who until January was vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, argued that to begin a process that would have to be interrupted would subject Mr. Gates to the same kind of problems that plagued John G. Tower when he was under consideration as Secretary of Defense.
"I argued that Gates could be left twisting in the wind for months," said Mr. Cohen, who is no longer on the committee. "In effect what you'd be doing is putting Bob Gates out there like in the Tower nomination, which just went on and on and on with more allegations and no prospect of it being completed in a reasonable timeframe."
As part of its effort to gather as much information as possible about Mr. Gates's knowledge of the Iran-contra affair, Mr. Boren said, the committee also voted today to grant immunity from prosecution to Alan D. Fiers Jr., the former C.I.A. official who pleaded guilty last week to withholding information from Congress about the secret arms sales to Iran and the illegal diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.
Mr. Boren added that the committee would also subpoena two officials whom Mr. Fiers said he told about the arrangements: Clair E. George, who was deputy of operations for the C.I.A. at the time, and Jerry Gruner, a C.I.A. official who was chief of the agency's Latin American division.
Mr. Gruner now serves in an overseas post for the agency, and until today he had not been clearly identified in connection with the Iran-contra affair. Mr. George has left the agency and is working as a security consultant.
 
A New Allegation
 The committee had originally hoped to begin hearings last Monday, and the delay has already produced new allegations that touch Mr. Gates.
Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, for example, urged today that the Senate defer action on the nomination until the C.I.A. answered questions about its involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was seized this month by international regulators. He said Senate investigators learned that in 1988 Mr. Gates, as deputy director of the C.I.A., released to the United States Commissioner of Customs an agency memorandum about the bank's activities.
Mr. Kerry said Mr. Gates had "apparent knowledge about the bank's activities" like money-laundering before law-enforcement agencies did.
Mr. Gruner did not testify to Congress during its investigation of the Iran-contra affair. But lawyers closely following the investigation said that in appearances before a grand jury in 1987 and earlier this year he has acknowledged that Mr. Fiers told him about the diversion. Mr. Gruner has said, however, the discussion with Mr. Fiers occurred later, in October or November.
Mr. Gruner's lawyer, William Hundley, said today: "We would very much like to cooperate the the committee. But we would urge the committee to hold off as long as they can until my client's status is clear with the independent prosecutor."

HEADLINE: Profits Fall At Citicorp In Quarter

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
As a second wave of big banks reported earnings yesterday, results for the second quarter continued to be generally weak. Citicorp, the nation's largest bank, said that its earnings for the period plummeted 83 percent.
On the West Coast, Wells Fargo and Security Pacific also reported sharp declines for the three months. Meanwhile, Banc One, a big Midwest bank, showed a gain. 
 Despite the relative weakness of the earnings, Ronald I. Mandle, a bank analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the industry's nonperforming assets might finally be reaching their high point.
Following are the details of the banks' results:
 
Citicorp
 Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, said its second-quarter earnings fell to $43 million, after a $48 million charge related to the sale of its municipal-bond insurance division.
The earnings compared with profits of $248 million, or 64 cents a share, in last year's second quarter.
When dividends on preferred stock are deducted from the final net income, however, Citicorp had a $9 million loss in the quarter.
A big factor was a hefty addition to Citicorp's loan-loss reserves of $1 billion, up from $473 million in the comparable quarter last year. The latest addition, together with chargeoffs of $1.68 billion, much of which were needed to cover problem loans to the third world, brought the bank's total loan-loss reserves up to $3.9 billion.
But the earnings news did not hurt the price of Citicorp's stock, which closed up 12.5 cents, to $14.875 a share, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts pointed out that Citicorp, based in New York, had reduced operating expenses by about $113 million, or 4 percent, in the second quarter from the same quarter last year. Analysts said aggressive cutbacks had reduced worldwide employment at the bank by about 5 percent.
 
Wells Fargo
 Wells Fargo said it earned $14 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with $232 million, or $4.40 a share, in the second quarter of 1990. Last year's quarter included a $69 million extraordinary gain related to a joint venture with Nikko Securities.
Although Wells Fargo had predicted that its second-quarter performance would be poor, the market expressed its displeasure. The stock fell $3.125 a share yesterday, to $73.50, on the New York Stock Exchange. Continued speculation about possible mergers in the banking sector caused the stock to rise $6.25 the day before.
Of greatest concern to investors seemed to be the $400 million increase in nonperforming assets at Wells Fargo, which brought the bank's total to $2 billion. Loan-loss chargeoffs, the amount the bank actually has to write off in any quarter, also shot up in the second quarter, to $183 million, from $45 million in the period last year.
The chairman and chief executive of the San Francisco bank hinted of more bad news to come. "Because of continuing uncertainties in the economy and the banking environment, we cannot be sure that further significant increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required," Carl E. Reichardt said in a statement.
 
Security Pacific
 The Security Pacific Corporation, also afflicted by weaknesses in its loan portfolio, reported earnings of $46.7 million, or 30 cents a share, down 76 percent from the $195.2 million, or $1.59 a share, it reported a year earlier.
In addition, the Los Angeles-based bank said it had added $409 million to its loan-loss reserves, versus the $161 million it set aside in the same quarter of 1990. Nonperforming assets rose to $3.9 billion, up sharply from the $2.4 billion it reported a year earlier and the $3.2 billion it had in the first quarter.
Over all, the earnings came very close to what the bank had predicted.
"The nonperformers were in line with what they said they'd be, but the loan-loss provision was a bit higher than what they'd said," said Mr. Mandle, of Sanford Bernstein.
The company's stock fell 75 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, to $23.875.
 
Mellon Bank
 Quarterly earnings for the Mellon Bank Corporation were $70 million, or $1.20 a share. That compared with a profit $142 million, or $2.80 a share, in the quarter last year. The 1990 figures include a $74 million gain related to the sale of a consumer finance company.
The results exceeded many analysts' estimates, and the stock rose 12.5 cents, to close at $32.875 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
"We were looking for $1.05, so they beat our estimate handily," said Kenneth Puglisi, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who revised his 1991 per-share projection from $4.40 to $4.90.
Analysts were impressed that the bank, which is based in Pittsburgh, had roughly sustained the higher net interest margin that it had reported in the first quarter, a ratio that reflects the difference between the bank's cost of funds and the price of its loans. The bank now makes 3.83 percent on its interest-earning assets, versus 3.16 percent in the second quarter last year.
 
Banc One
 The Banc One Corporation, based in Columbus, Ohio, reported earnings that were slightly ahead of estimates. Second-quarter profits were $131 million, or 79 cents a share, up from $104 million, or 70 cents a share, in the comparable period last year.
The stock moved up 12.5 cents yesterday, closing at $42.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts credited the performance to the company's well-entrenched position in the profitable consumer finance business.

HEADLINE: A New Getaway: Bed, Breakfast, Spirituality

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL

 BODY:
You say you've had your European tour, your Caribbean cruise, your Club Med, your spa. You say you've bed-and-breakfasted New England, barged through Burgundy, hiked the Rockies. And now, you say, your Lewis and Clark response to summer vacation is interrupted by recurring visions of Walden Pond.
You are not alone. Thousands of Americans are packing for a different kind of journey this summer. Destination: a higher spiritual plane. 
 Guest rooms in abbeys, convents and monasteries across the country are tightly booked. "It's gotten to the point we can't handle the number of requests for individual retreatants," said Don George, director of La Casa de Maria, a Roman Catholic retreat in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Jangling reservation lines are piercing the silence of an austere Zen monastery in the Catskills, at a Trappist monastery in Colorado, at an Episcopal monastery perched on the Hudson River. Hyatt, Holiday Inns and the rest aren't exactly sweating the competition. There are fewer than 2,000 guest rooms in monasteries across the country, as against 3.1 million hotel and motel rooms, according to Lodging Industry Profile, a publication of the American Hotel and Motel Association.
But travel experts say that monasteries now have a lower vacancy rate than hotels. And while there are no statistics for the number of guests at religious retreats, clerics and travel agents say they have seen a dramatic rise in the requests for rooms.
"Everybody is posing Camus-type questions," said Dena Kaye, whose cable television program, "A Sense of Place With Dena Kaye," is broadcast daily on the Travel Channel. "It depends," she said, "on whether you want to think it out on a superyacht or someplace a little simpler."
Most monasteries offer tidy, quiet rooms, three home-cooked meals a day and all the spirituality you want for about $50 a day. Some have such secular pleasures as tennis courts or swimming pools. But most appeal to the spirit more than the senses, offering austere tranquillity.
"Every time there is a crisis, we fill up," said Mr. George, who retired from a lucrative business career to volunteer at La Casa de Maria. "There is a pretty close parallel between Las Vegas and retreat centers. People know there is something wrong. They need to get away. They need hope."
Of course, religion in the summertime is nothing new. Church retreats, tent revivals and religious camps are as much a part of the nation's landscape as amber waves of grain. But the new hospitable monasteries eschew evangelism in favor of solitude and scenery. For the monasteries, guests are an economic shot in the arm, and a chance for a low-key ministry.
There are about 600 small monasteries in the United States with guest rooms. Some are training grounds for the newly frocked, while others house retired clerics or religious communities. A handful of modern refuges were once grand homes that are now dedicated to hospitality.
"These aren't preachy places," said Marcia Kelly, who, with her husband, Jack, has written "Sanctuaries" (Bell Tower, 1991), a guide to lodging in monasteries in the Northeast. "They are time out from a driven, aggressive world." The book -- which began with a serendipitous stop -- is becoming the Michelin guide of the retreat set.
"We were visiting a friend at Big Sur and fell for a monastery there," said Mr. Kelly, who calls himself a "retired Catholic" (his wife is Jewish). The sojourn set the couple monastery-hopping, and they have now visited more than 200 retreats.
Some offer solace in their setting. The Carmelite House of Prayer in Oakville, Calif., a former family mansion with 11 guest rooms, sprawls between the terraced ripples of the Napa Valley. "I come up here to hear myself think," said Jason Erlicsohn, a 37-year-old banker from San Fransisco. From his spartan room he can also hear water that dances from a Versailles-like fountain in the monastery's backyard, the gentle clang from the belfry, the chirp of sparrows.
"I used to go over to the health spa when I got stressed out," he said. "Now I just sit here and listen. I end up in better shape after a weekend."
Other retreats do their soothing through a stubborn connection to bygones. The contrast of modern, secular life with ancient, contemplative ways is clear as one steers along the Tokenekee Trail to the Convent of St. Birgitta in Darien, Conn. The road weaves through a land of tennis courts and horses, of designer weekend wear and $2,000 weekday commuter garb. Nearing the convent, time loops back. Gray robes flapping, black veils billowing under starched white crowns, the Sisters of St. Birgitta look like Beguines welcoming returning crusaders as they run to greet arriving cars.
In addition to taking vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, the nuns pledge themselves to "hospitality as an ecumenical effort," said Sister Dolores, mother superior of the convent. Along with seven other sisters, her days begin at 6:15 A.M. with community prayers.
For guests who haven't risen for early prayers, the day begins around 8 with breakfast: steaming bowls of cereal, eggs cooked to order, homemade muffins, waffles, a compote of fresh fruit and an elegant, never-empty silver coffee urn. The 16 guests gather around the formal dining table and are served as if in a home of the butlered gentry.
"I feel well cared for," said Julia Macbeth, a retired librarian who lives in Brooklyn and says she has visited the convent for weekends and vacations for 10 years. "The sisters can't do enough for you."
Between cooking and serving, polishing the convent's museum-quality furniture and tending the nine acres of grounds, the nuns gather to sing prayers in the convent's chapel. Guest attendance is optional. But after several days of quiet attention and home-cooked meals, even the least inclined are drawn from their reading or from walks along Long Island Sound to the lilting chants. "After a few visits you start to hear a calling," Miss Macbeth said.
Another clarion call for inner peace is sounded at Holy Cross Monastery, a rambling red-brick mansion perched on a grand knoll in West Park, N.Y., overlooking the Hudson. "People are soothed by living in harmony with an ongoing religious order," said Brother Timothy, prior of the Episcopal monastery, which has 39 guest rooms. Noting that except for honoring "the Great Silence," from 9 P.M. to 8:15 A.M. daily, participation in all religious service is optional, he said. "If guests hear a calling, it is the part of themselves that modern society has forgotten."
In contrast, guests can't help hearing the call at Dai Bosatsu Zendo, a Zen monastery that looks like a relocated chunk of traditional Japan at the end of a 10-mile dirt road outside Livingston Manor, N.Y., in the Catskills. Other than the gentle brush of bare feet against the monastery's well-polished wood floors, often the only sound heard is the gong that announces the chanting and meditation sessions or a meal. Joining in is not mandatory, but it is the rare camper who chooses the comfort of his futon over participation.
"Sitting," a kneel-squat position that is assumed for two to four hours of meditation, is the central activity for guests. Some of the best sitters, like Junpol Dennis Kelly, vice abbot of the Catskill monastery, study yoga to develop endurance for sitting; he urges the newly initiate to "stay with the uncomfortableness" as a means of transcendence.
A crick in the knee, a strain in the back, the frustration of chopsticks ferreting a lentil stew from a lacquer bowl -- these eventually conquer the anxiety of the type-A existence that most visitors are retreating from. "Sometimes it's the foreignness of what we do that allows Americans to get past their distrust of organized religion," said Mr. Kelly, who greets about 4,000 guests a year. "That opens the door for inner peace and true relaxation."
For some retreats, the public quest opens the door for fiscal growth as well. "A lay person left us this mansion and we need to take in more guests to support it," said the Rev. David Costell, standing in the grand foyer at the Carmelite House of Prayer under the scaffolding that he and three other priests are using to repair a leaking roof and peeling paint.
Throughout Europe, insolvent monasteries are often turned into luxury hotels. The prestigious Relais & Chateaux group has half a dozen former monasteries in France. Rina Annousi, president of the Travel Business in New York City, represents four plush former monasteries in Spain and several in Italy. "In Europe, the most sophisticated traveler who wants expensive luxury with character might ask for room in an old monastery," she said. "The people who call about American monasteries usually have free tickets from frequent flier."
Jack Kelly says that he's met "stock brokers, bank executives, school teachers and social workers in monasteries." Most are looking for the same thing: "They are trying to get past the coat-and-tie-on-Sunday mentality and to bring a spiritual element back to their daily lives," he said. The Kellys are working on a second volume about monasteries in the West and Southwest.
The proliferation of former voyagers who have become seekers poses some problems inside religious communities.
"We are a quiet community," said Brother James, a spokesman for the New Skete Communities, an Eastern Orthodox refuge in Cambridge, N.Y., that takes in a small number of guests. In declining an interview, he explained: "The phone rings so much that it would be hard to do our work and pray if we didn't place some limit."
Other ministers of hospitality worry about the nature of their success. The Rev. Thomas Keating, a Trappist at St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colo., developed Contemplative Outreach, a program aimed at helping weekenders and vacationers carry spiritual awareness back to their daily lives. His seminars are now offered at monasteries throughout the country and are wildly popular.
The response is gratifying, Father Keating said, but he has a horror of being seen as a sort of Howard Johnson of the Holy Host.
"We're not serving up some high-class tranquilizer," he said. "This is no vacation; it's a way of life."

A False Goddess: Thinness for Women

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In "The Famine Within," an eye-opening documentary about American women's collective obsession with body weight, Katherine Gilday makes a thorough and cogent case for the larger importance of this issue. "Every age has its own idea of perfect virtue for women," her film says, and it contends that our current ideal demands the triumph of will power over nature. Faith in weight loss, the film maintains, has for many women taken on the power of religious conviction. And yet the standard to which so many women aspire "really has less to do with beauty than with the deep cultural meaning of body type."
Ms. Gilday's film, which opens today at the Film Forum, is an effective mixture of sobering statistics, perceptive observations and desperately sad anecdotes. Chris Alt, the heavier sister of Carol Alt, the successful model, describes seeing a photograph of Karen Carpenter in the last stages of starvation and thinking "she was very lucky." Ms. Alt recalls having "wondered how I could get that skinny without dying." Another woman remembers dieting frantically as a teen-ager because she had a chance to meet Elvis Presley in Las Vegas and indeed being complimented by Elvis on her good looks. That accomplished, she ballooned back up to 200 pounds. 
 "In many respects it's a critical brain drain that we have," someone in the film observes, commenting on the amount of feminine energy and intelligence that are caught up in concern over weight loss. Various surveys cited here indicate that the majority of American women are more unhappy about weight than ever before, that they are happier about losing weight than about career advancement or success in love, and that they fear being fat more than they fear death.
Building her argument clearly and methodically, Ms. Gilday begins by examining the physical ideal that is celebrated by the media. It is radically different from the national norm. The average 5-foot-8-inch Miss America contestant weighed 132 pounds in 1954 and 117 in 1980; meanwhile, the average North American woman is about 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 144 pounds. The standard proportions for a good fashion model are "highly unusual among the general female population," the film tells us, as it watches models at work and remarks upon the enormous influence of the media and the fashion world. In contemplating the image of a single svelte high-fashion beauty, the film notes that "hours and hours of the collective effort of a large team go into the manufacture of the illusion."
The film moves on to consider the effects of such images on the general population. For instance, 80 percent of fourth-grade girls have already been on their first diets. It examines the aerobics craze, the stigma attached to obesity and the pathology of bulimia and anorexia. Ms. Gilday, who is as interested in the psychological and cultural aspects of such conditions as in the medical, calls upon interesting and articulate experts to provide analysis. "Sadly, the cult of the body is the only coherent philosophy of self that women are offered in this society," one says. A woman who lectures on these issues observes that when she discusses anorexia, someone in the audience usually turns up afterward to tell her, "I wish I could have that, just for a little while."
The film's ultimate point, which it develops very well, is that women struggling to balance careers and families have few useful role models and are desperate for control over their lives; this may lead them to banish the obviously feminine aspects of a full figure and emphasize the lean, masculine ideal. By dieting strenuously, one speaker says, "we are reassuring the culture that it still has the upper hand over us and over nature."
By comparison with Henry Jaglom's recent "Eating," a comic film on this subject, the speakers in "The Famine Within" sound a far more serious and less narcissistic note. The final effect of Ms. Gilday's persuasive and important film is to make the point that her subject goes far beyond vanity, and truly into matters of life and death.
On the same bill, and doing nothing to enhance the impact of Ms. Gilday's potent argument, is "We're Talking Vulva," a five-minute work of feminist art by Tracy Traeger and Shawna Dempsey, in which Ms. Dempsey wears a suit representing gigantic female genitalia and delivers a rap song. The lyrics, when audible, are notably lacking in wit. And anyway, it's a little early for Halloween.

HEADLINE: Iraq Steps Up Pleas to End Trade Ban

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, July 16

 BODY:
Iraq stepped up its campaign today to bring about some easing in the United Nations trade embargo imposed on this country. It made public a market survey showing that the price of many basic foods has risen by 2,000 to 3,000 percent on the free market since the sanctions took effect a year ago.
Saying poor Iraqis are simply unable to afford food at today's prices, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said at a news conference that the United States, Britain and France were trying to starve the Iraqi people into a revolt against President Saddam Hussein by refusing to let Iraq sell oil to buy food. 
 "The decision of the U.S., France and Britain is that all the Iraqi people should die," he said.
Iraq has asked the sanctions committee of the Security Council for permission to sell $1 billion worth of oil to finance the central imports of food and medicine. But the committee has not yet made any decision.
 
Prices Called Out of Reach
 The new survey, taken on July 7, compares the average price of basic foods in the free market with the much lower price charged by the state for the monthly food ration it has given all citizens since sanctions were imposed.
But this ration represents only 55 percent of the calories most people would consume in normal circumstances, forcing families to supplement it with purchases from the free market, the minister said.
But prices on the free market have soared since sanctions until they have passed out of reach of many people in Iraq, where the average salary is between 150 dinars and 200 dinars a month, equivalent to $450 to $600 a month at the official rate of exchange.
Prices are soaring because Iraq used to import some 70 percent of its food before the Persian Gulf crisis broke.
The Security Council has said Iraq could import as much food as it needed provided it notified the Council's sanctions committee in advance. The Trade Minister said that private businessmen are bringing in some food into Iraq.
But this has not been sufficient to prevent a price explosion on the free market because the Government cannot afford to import basic staples in order to raise the monthly ration to the level people need to live on, thus reducing dependence on the free market.
The Trade Minister said Iraq had already signed a contract to buy $1 billion worth of grain from Australia. But it cannot take delivery of this food because it does not have the money to pay for it unless the Security Council allows it to start selling oil again.
The survey shows that the cost of flour on the free market, for instance, is now 2,073 percent higher, at 2.5 dinars a kilogram or 2.2 pounds, than the price the Government charges for rationed flour, which is the same as it was before sanctions were imposed.
 
Rice and Baby Milk
 But the monthly flour ration is only eight kilograms or 17 pounds for each individual.
On the free market the price of rice is now 1,130 percent higher than the price charged by the state for ration supplies at 4 dinars per kilogram, or 2.2 pounds.
The same quantity of baby milk costs 2,500 percent more at 15 to 20 dinars a can than the single can provided each small baby every week by the Government as part of the family rations.
The price of cooking oil has now risen 3,070 percent on the free market since the imposition of the trade embargo, in which sugar is up 1,900 percent. Meat has risen 750 percent, chicken 550 percent and a half pound of detergent 650 percent.
Last week a United Nations team recommended that the Security Council allow Iraq to sell some oil to pay for urgently needed imports of food and medicine but said the United Nations should monitor these transactions to make sure the money was correctly spent and that the goods were fairly distributed in the country.
Alternatively, it said the United States and other countries holding some $5 billion of Iraqi Government funds in frozen bank accounts could release part of this money for such humanitarian purchases.
Only Switzerland has released some frozen Iraqi funds, but the $70 million made available in this way is not sufficient to make much difference, he said.
[In Bern, a spokesman for the Swiss Economics Ministry, Claude Gerbex, said he was not aware of any decision by the two Swiss departments concerned, economics and foreign affairs, to lift Swiss economic sanctions on Iraq, The Associated Press reported. The sanctions include freezing Iraqi assets. Mr. Gerbex said he doubted the banks would have acted on their own. ]
Members of the United Nations team confirmed that food prices had indeed risen by several thousand percent in the case of some basic staple. Elliot Richardson, a former United States Attorney General and a member of the United Nations mission, told reporters that he had met a woman in a suburb of Baghdad who had sold 1,500 dinars worth of gold jewelry to buy milk for her small child on the free market, because the Government ration was not sufficient.

HEADLINE: Climb the Jagged Mountain

BYLINE: By Clarence Thomas

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a commencement speech that Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee to the Supreme Court, gave at Savannah State College on June 9, 1985.
I grew up here in Savannah. I was born not far from here (in Pinpoint). I am a child of those marshes, a son of this soil. I am a descendant of the slaves whose labors made the dark soil of the South productive. I am the great-great-grandson of a freed slave, whose enslavement continued after my birth. I am the product of hatred and love -- the hatred of the social and political structure which dominated the segregated, hate-filled city of my youth, and the love of some people -- my mother, my grandparents, my neighbors and relatives -- who said by their actions, "You can make it, but first you must endure." 
 You can survive, but first you must endure. You can live, but first you must endure. You must endure the unfairness. You must endure the hatred. You must endure the bigotry. You must endure the segregation. You must endure the indignities.
I stand before you as one who had the same beginning as yourselves -- as one who has walked a little farther down the road, climbed a little higher up the mountain. I come back to you, who must now travel this road and climb this jagged, steep mountain that lies ahead. I return as a messenger -- a front-runner, a scout. What lies ahead of you is even tougher than what is now behind you.
That mean, callous world out there is still very much filled with discrimination. It still holds out a different life for those who do not happen to be the right race or the right sex. It is a world in which the "haves" continue to reap more dividends than the "have-nots."
You will enter a world in which more than one-half of all black children are born primarily to youthful mothers and out of wedlock. You will enter a world in which the black teen-age unemployment rate as always is more than double that of white teenagers. Any discrimination, like sharp turns in a road, becomes critical because of the tremendous speed at which we are traveling into the high-tech world of a service economy.
There is a tendency among young, upwardly mobile, intelligent minorities to forget. We forget the sweat of our forefathers. We forget the blood of the marchers, the prayers and hope of our race. We forget who brought us into this world. We overlook who put food in our mouths and clothes on our backs. We forget commitment to excellence. We procreate with pleasure and retreat from the responsibilities of the babies we produce.
We subdue, we seduce, but we don't respect ourselves, our women, our babies. How do we expect a race that has been thrown into the gutter of socio-economic indicators to rise above these humiliating circumstances if we hide from responsibility for our own destiny?
The truth of the matter is we have become more interested in designer jeans and break dancing than we are in obligations and responsibilities.
Over the past 15 years, I have watched as others have jumped quickly at the opportunity to make excuses for black Americans. It is said that blacks cannot start businesses because of discrimination. But I remember businesses on East Broad and West Broad that were run in spite of bigotry. It is said that we can't learn because of bigotry. But I know for a fact that tens of thousands of blacks were educated at historically black colleges, in spite of discrimination. We learned to read in spite of segregated libraries. We built homes in spite of segregated neighborhoods. We learned how to play basketball (and did we ever learn!), even though we couldn't go to the N.B.A.
We have lost something. We look for role models in all the wrong places. We refuse to reach back in our not too distant past for the lessons and values we need to carry us into the uncertain future. We ignore what has permitted blacks in this country to survive the brutality of slavery and the bitter rejection of segregation. We overlook the reality of positive values and run to the mirage of promises, visions and dreams.
I dare not come to this city, which only two decades ago clung so tenaciously to segregation, bigotry and Jim Crowism, to convince you of the fairness of this society. My memory is too precise, my recollection too keen, to venture down that path of self-delusion. I am not blind to our history -- nor do I turn a deaf ear to the pleas and cries of black Americans. Often I must struggle to contain my outrage at what has happened to black Americans -- what continues to happen -- what we let happen and what we do to ourselves.
If I let myself go, I would rage in the words of Frederick Douglass: "At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. Oh! Had I the ability, and could reach the nation's ear, I would today pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind and the earthquake."
I often hear rosy platitudes about this country -- much of which is true. But how are we black Americans to feel when we have so little in a land with so much? How is black America to respond to the celebration of the wonders of this great nation?
In 1964, when I entered the seminary, I was the only black in my class and one of two in the school. A year later, I was the only one in the school. Not a day passed that I was not pricked by prejudice.
But I had an advantage over black students and kids today. I had never heard any excuses made. Nor had I seen my role models take comfort in excuses. The women who worked in those kitchens and waited on the bus knew it was prejudice which caused their plight, but that didn't stop them from working.
My grandfather knew why his business wasn't more successful, but that didn't stop him from getting up at 2 in the morning to carry ice, wood and fuel oil. Sure, they knew it was bad. They knew all too well that they were held back by prejudice. But they weren't pinned down by it. They fought discrimination under W. W. Law [a Georgia civil rights leader] and the N.A.A.C.P. Equally important, they fought against the awful effects of prejudice by doing all they could do in spite of this obstacle.
They could still send their children to school. They could still respect and help each other. They could still moderate their use of alcohol. They could still be decent, law-abiding citizens.
I had the benefit of people who knew they had to walk a straighter line, climb a taller mountain and carry a heavier load. They took all that segregation and prejudice would allow them and at the same time fought to remove these awful barriers.
You all have a much tougher road to travel. Not only do you have to contend with the ever-present bigotry, you must do so with a recent tradition that almost requires you to wallow in excuses. You now have a popular national rhetoric which says that you can't learn because of racism, you can't raise the babies you make because of racism, you can't get up in the mornings because of racism. You commit crimes because of racism. Unlike me, you must not only overcome the repressiveness of racism, you must also overcome the lure of excuses. You have twice the job I had.
Do not be lured by sirens and purveyors of misery who profit from constantly regurgitating all that is wrong with black Americans and blaming these problems on others. Do not succumb to this temptation of always blaming others.
Do not become obsessed with all that is wrong with our race. Rather, become obsessed with looking for solutions to our problems. Be tolerant of all positive ideas; their number is much smaller than the countless number of problems to be solved. We need all the hope we can get.
Most importantly, draw on that great lesson and those positive role models who have gone down this road before us. We are badgered and pushed by our friends and peers to do unlike our parents and grandparents -- we are told not to be old-fashioned. But they have weathered the storm. It is up to us now to learn how. Countless hours of research are spent to determine why blacks fail or why we commit crimes. Why can't we spend a few hours learning how those closest to us have survived and helped us get this far?
As your front-runner, I have gone ahead and taken a long, hard look. I have seen two roads from my perch a few humble feet above the madding crowd. On the first, a race of people is rushing mindlessly down a highway of sweet, intoxicating destruction, with all its bright lights and grand promises constructed by social scientists and politicians. To the side, there is a seldom used, overgrown road leading through the valley of life with all its pitfalls and obstacles. It is the road -- the old-fashioned road -- traveled by those who endured slavery, who endured Jim Crowism, who endured hatred. It is the road that might reward hard work and discipline, that might reward intelligence, that might be fair and provide equal opportunity. But there are no guarantees.
You must choose. The lure of the highway is seductive and enticing. But the destruction is certain. To travel the road of hope and opportunity is hard and difficult, but there is a chance that you might somehow, some way, with the help of God, make it.

HEADLINE: Milk Quotas for U.S. Dairies Make No Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Can you imagine the United States Government requiring the registration of every dairy farmer in the nation for the purpose of assigning quotas that dictate how much milk each one can sell? The Livestock, Dairy and Poultry subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee has just approved such a bill. In exchange for this Government-imposed straitjacket, dairy farmers would receive a 25 percent increase in the milk-support price. 
 A little history is in order to understand what is going on here. The Federal Government supports the price of milk by maintaining an open-ended commitment to buy all surplus butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese offered to it at the support price. Historically, the support price was kept low to discourage surpluses.
But in 1977, under pressure from the dairy lobby, Congress changed policy and dramatically increased the support price. The support price rose from $8.26 a hundredweight of milk in 1977 to its peak of $13.49 in 1981. Predictably, high milk prices coupled with a guaranteed government market caused tremendous overproduction.
In 1981, Congress and the new Reagan Administration realized they had a monster on their hands, and they began to reduce the support price gradually, as well as to sponsor voluntary milk supply reduction programs. It took nearly seven years, but by mid-1988 supply and demand were in close balance.
Then the Middle West drought occurred, temporarily reducing the supply of milk. The market responded by increasing production, and the production increases outlasted the temporary shortage caused by the drought. The market demanded an adjustment in the milk supply, so milk prices collapsed last October. The last nine months have been difficult for dairy farmers and thus the pressure on Congress to do something about milk prices.
The good news is the milk supply has been adjusted. The price of cheese and nonfat dry milk is substantially above the support price, and farm milk prices are beginning to recover. The market works, and we should not be surprised by that. The adjustment probably would have happened sooner, but with Congress flirting with the milk quota idea, dairy farmers were reluctant to reduce production, and thereby reduce the quota they might receive.
Congress should resist the dairy lobby's attempt at self-destruction. Having the Government interfere in the marketplace and arbitrarily raise milk prices at the cost of putting all dairy farmers in a straitjacket will probably always be popular with some down on the farm. But as history has shown, when Congress forsakes market-oriented economic principles for the quick fix, the country ends up with a mess. Let's hope the full House will see the foolishness of the dairy subcommittee's action.

HEADLINE: Greek Chief Hopes Bush Will Help on Cyprus

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, July 17

 BODY:
Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis says he is looking to President Bush to settle the 17-year-old dispute between Greece and Turkey over Turkish military occupation of part of Cyprus. After two discussions about the issue, Mr. Bush has agreed to help, he said.
Mr. Bush will arrive here on Thursday from the summit in London. He will then travel to Turkey on Saturday. 
 The Prime Minister said that at a time of great instability in Yugoslavia and growing international concern over the volatile Balkan region, it is vital to settle the feud between the two NATO allies.
"The problem is now ripe to be solved," Mr. Mitsotakis said. "The role of the United States can be determining, and Mr. Bush can be the catalyst." A settlement could be reached soon, he added, "maybe by this fall."
Mr. Mitsotakis will also be seeking United States support for his new proposal to create a demilitarized zone along the common borders of Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, an effort to lessen tensions in a region where the three neighbors have long kept large concentrations of troops and offensive weapons. Bulgaria, he said, immediately responded "warmly" to the five-day-old proposal, but no reply has yet come from Turkey.
While Greece has put the Cyprus issue at the top of its agenda, American officials have tried to play down speculation that the United States has a master plan to deal with the bitter feud that has defied many previous mediation efforts. Mr. Bush has publicly said that he is ready to help but that the United States has "no magic wand."
Since the Turks invaded Cyprus in 1974, in the midst of a Greek effort to take over the island, it remains cut in half by a United Nations-patrolled line that separates about 170,000 Turkish Cypriots in the north from almost 650,000 Greek Cypriots in the south.
The continuing tensions between Athens and Ankara have long troubled Washington because the two nations make up the eastern flank of NATO.
It is also a longstanding irritant to the European Community, in which Greece, a full member, has often tried to press it partners into adopting positions against Turkey, which has associate membership. Many United Nations mediation efforts on Cyprus have failed, and Mr. Bush, a former United States delegate to the United Nations, is said to know the issue well.
Speaking in his residence here on Tuesday night, Mr. Mitsotakis argued that the time for a settlement is now.
"We have just gone through the gulf war, and the attention of the world and particularly of the United States is toward this part of the world," he said. "The war was waged by all to protect the international order and carry out the United Nations decisions. Now is the time for these principles to be applied in Cyprus as well. Seventeen years has been too long."
The Prime Minister has just visited Nicosia, the Cypriot capital. "It's the only place now where there is a dividing wall," he said of the sandbags and barbed wire that run through the city. The Turkish troops, north of the dividing line, he said, "are now the only occupation army left in Europe."
Referring to the two occasions when he has discussed Cyprus with Mr. Bush, Mr. Mitsotakis said: "I asked his assistance in solving this problem, and I explained to him that the United States can play the primary role. This is certainly the case today, after the gulf war that has left the United States the undeniable and only superpower. President Bush said he will help, and that's extremely important."
The main sticking points in Cyprus are how much land will be returned to the Greek Cypriots who were forced out of the occupied zone by Turkish troops and what form of government and what rights for the two groups will be acceptable.
The Bush visit is the first by an American leader since President Eisenhower's in 1959. It will be a boon to Mr. Mitsotakis, who took over in April 1990 from Andreas Papandreou, the Socialist who was a critic of American policy. The conservative Prime Minister has since been mending fences with Washington and is rolling back the role of the state in favor of a market economy.

HEADLINE: All Eyes on Cuba at Ibero-American Summit

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUADALAJARA, Mexico, July 17

 BODY:
Setting aside his domestic troubles for two days in the diplomatic limelight, President Fidel Castro of Cuba is to make a rare foreign appearance at an international summit conference here this week, seeking to shore up regional support for his Government.
The first Ibero-American Summit Conference, which will bring together leaders from 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries on Thursday and Friday, has been billed as an important new vehicle for regional cooperation and economic integration. The list of confirmed participants includes President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua, King Juan Carlos of Spain and President Alberto Fujimori of Peru.
 
Castro the Focus of Attention
 But ever since Mr. Castro announced his intention to attend, preparations have been dominated by speculation about how the Cuban leader will be received by regional leaders whose friendship now looms as a vital lifeline for the weakened Cuban economy. 
 "This is a crucial opportunity for him to reach out, practically and symbolically, to the rest of Latin America," a foreign diplomat in Mexico City said. "It is the only important base he's got left." As Cuba's network of Communist allies and trading partners around the world has collapsed, forcing Havana to impose strict rationing of basic goods, regional trends toward greater democracy and more conservative economic policies have left Mr. Castro increasingly estranged from the new generation of Latin American leaders.
Cuba's isolation has been encouraged by the Bush Administration, which has missed few opportunities to impress its Latin American allies with its demands that the Castro Government accept broad democratic changes and free elections before it receives help in its current crisis.
But for heads of state like President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, who has made his reputation on tight fiscal discipline and closer ties to the United States, Mr. Castro's presence is a useful demonstration of diplomatic neutrality and regional independence.
Mexican officials, who see a politically and economically valuable role for their country as Cuba's link to the outside world, have repeatedly rejected any suggestion that the summit meeting be used as a tool for forcing Mr. Castro to change.
Emphasizing their commitment to what they describe as diplomatic diversity, Mexican officials have responded to criticism of their ties with Mr. Castro by noting that the summit talks will also include President Guillermo Endara of Panama. Mr. Endara's Government has been kept at arm's length by Mexico, which withdrew its Ambassador from Panama after the United States invasion in December 1989.
Strapped by enormous debt burdens and regionwide economic difficulties, Latin American nations are not in a position to offer direct aid to Cuba. Regional diplomats say points for possible discussion will include closer trade ties, support for Cuba's crash efforts to encourage tourism, and demonstrations of warmer diplomatic relations.
The meeting is envisioned as the first in a series of annual events. Spain is to play host to next year's conference as part of its celebration of the 500th anniversary of the arrival of Spanish explorers in the New World. The 1993 conference is to be held in Brazil.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off as Traders Study Summit-Talk Implications

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell slightly yesterday as traders awaited further signals about the economy and the Group of Seven industrial nations' stand on exchange rates.
Gold prices rose, with a troy ounce climbing 80 cents in New York to close at $369.70 on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $369.30, up 55 cents. 
 Analysts said the dollar continued to trade in a narrow range, with profit taking responsible for the currency's lower levels.
Jeff Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange for the Continental Bank in Chicago, said traders were "waiting through the summer months to see the ultimate outcome of G-7, the implications of their meeting, which aren't known now."
 
Leaders End Meeting
 Leaders of the Group of Seven nations, including President Bush, concluded their three-day meeting in London today. Their talks on economic issues, including foreign exchange rates, were overshadowed by their agreement to provide assistance to the Soviet Union.
If the nations want the dollar held in check, the central banks of the seven countries could enter the markets -- as they did last Friday -- to keep the currency from advancing.
Mr. Mondschein said currency traders were also waiting for further clues about where the United States economy was headed and whether the Federal Reserve might ease interest rates. The direction of interest rates are crucial for the dollar, which like other currencies is supported by higher yields.
Overseas dealers said the dollar was hurt by fears that the German central bank would intervene to hamper its ascent.
The British pound gained against the dollar. In New York, sterling rose to $1.6495, from $1.64305 late Tuesday, and in earlier London trading the pound rose to $1.6515 from $1.6458.
The dollar fell to 136.95 Japanese yen, from 137.25 late Tuesday in New York. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar rose 0.22 yen, to 137.17 yen, and in London it closed at 136.85 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell in New York to 1.79135 marks from 1.8000.
Other late rates for the dollar in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5557 Swiss francs, down from 1.56275; 6.0780 French francs, down from 6.1070; 1,331.15 Italian lire, down from 1,339.25, and 1.14805 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1474.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Jumps to Highest Level Since Last Days of the War

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The price of oil jumped yesterday to its highest level since the final days of the gulf war, surprising traders, who said a mix of news, rumors and speculation stirred the rally.
"It's kind of like the domino effect -- one thing starts building up, then another kicks in," said Victor Yu, vice president of futures at Refco Inc. 
 Crude oil for delivery in August settled at $22.14 a barrel, up 49 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude oil for next-month delivery had not closed that high since Feb. 14, when the final price was $22.32 a barrel.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery in August settled at 64.66 cents a gallon, up 1.34 cents. Home heating oil for delivery in August settled at 59.83 cents a gallon, up 0.60 cent.
Market analysts said the buying had come on rumors of various oil production problems around the globe, as well as in reaction to an American Petroleum Institute report released Tuesday night that showed the nation's supply of gasoline shrank last week.
That was taken as an indication that demand could be building, after staying sluggish for months because of the recession.
Once the prices started moving higher, traders began making deals intended to push prices up even further, enabling them to rack up quick profits by buying oil and selling it shortly thereafter.
"The market moved a lot higher on speculation," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
But the intensity of the rally surpised many participants.
"I'm still skeptical in the sense that volume is nothing exceptional," Mr. Blakeslee said. In any financial markets, price movements can be exaggerated in thin volume.
Some of the strong buying began at the International Petroleum Exchange in London, which helped bolster prices in New York. North Sea Brent blend crude oil for delivery in September settled there at $20.21 a barrel, up 49 cents.
At the mercantile exchange, natural gas futures finished mostly higher, with contracts for delivery in August settling at $1.235 for 1,000 cubic feet, up 3.0 cents.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Looking for Clues In Options Prices

BYLINE: By Sylvia Nasar

 BODY:
LIKE David W. Mullins Jr., a governor of the Federal Reserve who is studying the prices of Treasury bond options for clues about inflation expectations, individual investors and corporate treasurers may also benefit by studying options price movements.
Because the options market measures traders' changing perceptions of an asset's volatility, investors can use the measure to spot changes in the relative riskiness of the assets -- stocks, bonds, foreign currencies -- in their portfolios. 
 Keeping an eye on implied volatility is "a way for investors to get a free ride on options traders' expertise," said Steven P. Feinstein, an economist at Boston University. "If you know how to read the forecast out of options prices, you can figure out what the pros are forecasting."
Mr. Mullins watches an indicator based on weekly price changes in Treasury bond options. Expressed as a percentage, the measure indicates the expected amplitude of price swings over a period of several months up to a year.
Broadly speaking, a 10 percent implied volatility means that options investors believe that most of the time the asset's price will fluctuate within bounds that are 10 percent higher or lower than today's price. Investors or corporate treasurers can use the measure to help them buy options when they are cheap and postpone buying when options are unusually expensive.
In the market for Treasury bond options, the indicator's current low reading makes options look like a bargain. Implied volatility has been around 8 percent lately, about one-third below its average level. Over the last 10 years, implied volatility has been higher about 90 percent of the time," said David Lerman, manager of options at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
By contrast, the implied volatility of the S.& P. 500 index is slightly higher than average. Buying stock options last summer after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait would have been like "buying disaster insurance after the disaster," Mr. Lerman said. "The time to buy options is in anticipation of increased volatility, and sell in anticipation of decreased volatility."
Of course, all this doesn't mean that an investor can necessarily make money buying options when they are cheap. Traders often bet that unusually high or low volatility signals an imminent return to average values. That is not always the case. Implied volatility of Treasury bonds stayed below 9 percent for nearly a year and a half, beginning in 1989 until the Iraqi invasion last August.
Someone trying to decide whether to shift funds among investments like cash, bonds or stock can get a better handle on the riskiness of each investment. Given comparable rates of return, most investors would probably prefer to invest in an asset when its implied volatility is low. "If you see relative risks change," Mr. Feinstein said, "that could influence your decision on where your money ought to be." It is not, incidentally, possible to compare risk across classes of assets just by looking at the options price. That is because options prices also depend on other variables, namely the strike price, the expiration date, the market interest rate and the price of the underlying asset.
Implied volatility may be a better guide than actual past volatility. "What you need is a forecast of future risk, not an estimate of how risky the investment was in the past," Mr. Feinstein said. "Implied volatility is almost always forward looking."
Implied volatility data are available from brokers, electronic data bases or even the Chicago options and futures exchanges for everything from T-bond options to D-mark options to S.& P. 500 index options. Investors can purchase software and make their own calculations from daily closing prices of options, if they wish.
Here are the whys and wherefores of the implied volatility measure: Options are rights to buy or sell assets -- D-marks, T-bonds, stocks -- at a specific time and price. Companies, banks and individual investors use them like insurance to protect themselves against unfavorable price changes. "When the environment gets riskier the price of insurance goes up," Mr. Feinstein said.
Two University of Chicago finance professors, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, invented a formula in 1973 for how much this insurance, the option, had to cost based on how risky the environment was. The wider the range that investors expect an asset's price to fluctuate, the more volatile, hence riskier, the investment and the more costly the insurance.
Even sophisticated investors and corporate treasurers are often unaware of the indicator. "Two-thirds of the calls I get are from people who either don't know anything about implied volatility, but should, or people who want to know more," said Mr. Lerman at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Wendell Cherry Is Dead at 55; Hospital Leader

BYLINE: By GLENN FOWLER

 BODY:
Wendell Cherry, vice chairman of Humana Inc., operator of a nationwide chain of hospitals and provider of health insurance for 1.6 million people, died on Tuesday at his home in Louisville, Ky. He was 55 years old.
He died of lung cancer, said a spokesman for Humana. 
 Mr. Cherry, who founded Humana in 1961 with David A. Jones, had many interests outside the health-care field. He owned the Kentucky Colonels basketball team and was president of the American Basketball Association before its absorption into the National Basketball Association. He was also an art collector who once paid $5.3 million for a self-portrait of Picasso and a Broadway producer whose shows included "The Secret Garden," a Broadway musical this season.
Born in Kentucky's rural Hart County, he was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and its law school. In 1959 he began practicing law in Louisville and taught economics at the University of Louisville.
 
Chain of 82 Hospitals
 Two years later, he and Mr. Jones founded Humana, which operates 82 hospitals and is one of the world's largest providers of integrated health-care services, with annual revenues of $6 billion.
Over the years Mr. Cherry was identified with many activities in Louisville. He was the lawyer for a group of Louisville sportsmen who sponsored the boxer Cassius Clay, a Louisville native. The boxer went on to win the world heavyweight championship in 1964 and later became Muhammad Ali.
In the late 1960's Mr. Cherry headed a campaign to finance a number of Louisville projects, including rebuilding of the Louisville General Hospital into the Humana Hospital-University of Louisville, one of four Humana medical centers in that city.
He was a pivotal figure in raising $13.5 million to build the Kentucky Center for the Arts, which was completed in 1983, and served as its board chairman from 1980 to 1987.
Mr. Cherry's interest in art resulted in what some critics have called the greatest collection of 20th century sculpture being placed in Humana's headquarters and the neighboring Kentucky Center for the Arts. Included are Henry Moore's "Reclining Figure," Alberto Giacometti's "Large Standing Woman II" and Alexander Calder's "The Red Feather."
At a Manhattan auction in 1981, Mr. Cherry outbid other collectors and paid $5.3 million for the Picasso self-portrait "Yo," at the time the highest price ever paid for a work by the artist.
Mr. Cherry is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy O'Connell; two daughters and two sons from a previous marriage, Angela Gehegan of San Diego, Alison Alvarez of Charlotte, N.C., Andrew of Louisville and Hagan, of San Diego; his mother, Geneva, of Bowling Green, Ky.; a stepdaughter, Jennifer Morton of Yarmouth, Me.; two stepsons, Jonathan and Timothy Morton, both of Louisville; two sisters, Ruth Ann Holland of Montclair, N.J., and Sue Ellen Lloyd of Bowling Green; a brother, Layman of Alvaton, Ky., and three grandchildren.

Years ago, before the perils of dumping poisonous chemical wastes were well known, some of the nation's largest industrial corporations disposed of them in hundreds of municipal landfills around the nation.
Now, after more than a decade in which the Federal Government has been singling out these polluters and making them pay for cleaning up those landfills, the companies are trying to force cities and small private businesses to share the costs. 
 In 14 cases, the corporations are suing towns, school districts and small businesses that dumped garbage in the same landfills. The corporations, among them Exxon, Du Pont, B. F. Goodrich and Weyerhaeuser, want them to pay based on their share of the volume of wastes that were dumped. The defendants say toxicity, not simple volume, should be the criterion.
Recognizing the nationwide problem, the Environmental Protection Agency announced yesterday that it would develop guidelines on municipal liability by this fall, after holding a conference on the issue. "We do not seek to exempt municipalities entirely," Mary Mears, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, told The Associated Press. "We in no way want to grant blanket exemptions to anybody."
One issue is how dangerous ordinary garbage is compared with toxic wastes. At stake are billions of dollars. The amount in dispute at one California site is more than $650 million, and the liabilities some towns face could cause them to default. For example, Alhambra, Calif., which has a $55 million annual budget, could be liable for $20 million over a decade.
The corporations argue that even garbage contains hazardous materials, and that if a landfill has to be cleaned up, any business or governmental body that dumped there should help.
Many cities and towns have banded together to bring the issue before Congress. They argue that less than 1 percent of municpal wastes are considered hazardous by the Environmental Protection Agency. They say it was not their waste that turned the landfills into toxic dumps, and therefore they should not have to pay. It will not be clear for some time how much cities and towns will have to pay in light of the agency's announcement yesterday, or what effect the announcement will have on the lawsuits.
The companies have complained about the Federal "Superfund" law, which requires cleanups of toxic dump sites, since it was passed in 1980. Advocates for the towns say this latest tactic is a way the big polluters hope to get the attention of Congress in their drive to weaken the law.
The large corporations have ample motivation: they know that some 1,300 toxic-waste sites, one-third of them the municipal disposal sites in question, have been identified, and that the E.P.A. expects another 700 toxic-waste dumps to be identified by the end of the decade. The average cost for cleaning up a site is $25 million to $30 million, the agency says.
Local government officials are furious. "All we did was send ordinary garbage to one dump, and we are sued as though we were equal partners in the toxic pollution," said Gerald Lucas, the first selectman of Killingworth, Conn. His community is one of 24 being sued for more than $50 million of the $70 million it will cost to clean two landfills in Naugatuck Borough.
Killingworth, a town of 4,814 with a $1.6 million annual budget, has spent $45,000 in two years defending itself. If the towns lose, its share of the liability would be about $1 million, a figure based on the volume of refuse it dumped in the early 1970's.
A Federal judge hearing the case has given a partial victory to B. F. Goodrich, the Upjohn Company, General Electric and Atlantic Richfield, the companies suing the 24 towns. Although the case is still pending in some respects, the ruling in January said that the towns were partly responsible for landfill contamination.
 
What Congress Intended
 The principal author of the Superfund law says such findings are not what Congress had in mind. "The very clear intent of the law is that corporate polluters are to be made responsible for cleaning up toxic wastes," said Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, who served in Congress from 1975 to 1990 and wrote the law. "Congress never contemplated that solid municipal waste was toxic and municipalities would be responsible for cleanups."
"This is just one more tactic corporations are using," Mr. Florio added.
In the 11 states where suits have been filed, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the defendants face agonizing choices -- to settle, or to spend huge amounts on legal fees.
The 1980 law, officially the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which set up requirements for cleaning up toxic dumps and established a "Superfund," financed by polluters and the Government, to pay for it.
The law, enacted shortly after the Love Canal environmental disaster near Niagara Falls, N.Y., was in response to threats to public health and the environment from industry's most poisonous byproducts, left in waste lagoons, hidden disposal sites and abandoned dumps. The bulk of these poisons were disposed of in legal, if unregulated, ways from the mid-1940's through the mid-1970's, before the dangers became widely known.
 
The Definitions Are Crucial
 As the Superfund program has evolved, it has become clear that some of these wastes also were disposed of in ordinary landfills, where cities dump their trash and garbage. Some 400 locations where industrial toxic wastes were mixed with municipal refuse have been discovered.
The cities may be vulnerable because of the broad liability provisions and the equally broad definitions of hazardous waste in the Superfund law.
"The law says that anybody who sent hazardous waste to a dump, regardless of their size or economic viability, can be held liable for cleanup costs," said Stanley M. Spracker, a lawyer in Washington who has represented industrial clients in cases involving the Federal law. "If Joe's Pizzeria sent hazardous material to a dump site, they are just as liable as Chevron."
If the industrial plaintiffs are successful, virtually every city in the country and tens of thousands of small businesses could be liable. Critics of this tactic have expressed fears that ordinary homeowners might also be dragged into legal struggles, although the E.P.A. yesterday said that it would make formal its longstanding policy not to sue homeowners "unless they in some way have contributed to the contamination" at a Superfund site.
 
'Unintended Consequences'
 Declaring that he will introduce legislation to amend the Superfund law, Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, said the lawsuits by big companies are "a case of unintended consequences taking precedence over the intent."
At issue in all but one of 14 Federal Court cases around the country is whether ordinary trash and garbage are hazardous wastes under the definitions of the 1980 law.
In 1989, the E.P.A. said that less than 1 percent of municipal wastes were hazardous, so it would not sue cities for cleanup costs. But corporate lawyers say that the Superfund law broadly defines 700 to 800 chemicals as hazardous, and that its broad liability provisions can be used against cities and small businesses if their wastes contain any of those chemicals.
The corporations argue that some municipal trash contains toxic chemicals, and they say municipal practices often worsen the problem, for two reasons: first, cities manage many landfills, and haphazard management may contribute to toxic pollution; second, the municipal wastes act as a sponge, absorbing hazardous liquids dumped by the large companies.
The case that corporations hope will be a model, and that defendants and potential defendants fear most, is unfolding in upstate New York. This year, 41 towns and school districts and more than 400 private small-business owners in and around Utica agreed to pay $1.8 million, subject to judicial review, to settle a lawsuit brought by Chesebrough-Pond's USA, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, and Special Metals Corporation, a maker of metal components. Both companies were sued by the E.P.A. to help pay for a $9 million project to clean up a landfill in Clayville, near Utica, where the companies had for years dumped toxic wastes, and where cities disposed of refuse.
In Southern California, 64 companies, including Shell, Exxon, Chevron and McDonnell Douglas, are suing 29 cities in a case involving one of the most polluted sites in the country, the Operating Industries Landfill in Monterey Park. The 200-acre dump was used by the cities to dispose of millions of tons of municipal refuse and by the corporations to dump 300 million gallons of toxic wastes. The E.P.A. sued the companies for the cost of restoring the land, estimated at $600 million to $800 million. The companies are seeking to compel the cities to share the cost.
One defendant is the City of Alhambra, a suburb of Los Angeles. City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said that if Alhambra and the other defendants lose, it could be liable for $20 million to $30 million over the next decade. Alhambra has spent $180,000 defending itself.
 
Give In or Spend on Fees
 Eighty-five percent of the defendants in the Utica-area case have settled. Louis S. Petrone, the industrialists' lawyer who sued 603 defendants, said those settling include the owner of a pizzeria and a food store.
Among the defendants that did not settle was the New Hartford Central School District, which plaintiffs say should pay $28,000. "They're fighting it because they feel they didn't do anything wrong," said Alan S. Burstein, a lawyer in Syracuse who is defending the school district. "Dick and Jane's school lunch isn't hazardous."
Eighty-six cities have formed American Communities for Cleanup Equity to lobby for amendments to the Superfund law that would end their liability. Rena Steinzor, the group's Washington representative, said the lawsuits against cities were "designed to make Superfund a joke."
The Superfund's slow pace and high costs have periodically raised Congressional interest. The Superfund law was last amended in 1986.
Although $11.2 billion has been spent in 11 years, just 63 waste sites have been cleaned up.
"More money is being spent on lawyers and administrative costs and endless studies than is being spent for cleanup, and if it continues this way it will be the death knell of the Superfund act," said Mr. Torricelli, who helped to update some of the law's provisions.

HEADLINE: Profits Are Down by 92% at AMR

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Second-quarter earnings of the AMR Corporation, the parent company of American Airlines, plummeted 92 percent, to $10.3 million, from $129.2 million a year earlier. While the sharp decline underscored the continuing weakness of the airline industry, analysts said they were not surprised and predicted gradual improvement in the industry beginning later this year.
AMR's earnings, reported yesterday, reflect an $11 million charge relating to the retirement of Boeing 737's. 
 Earnings per share for the Dallas-based corporation fell to 15 cents, from $2.05 for the comparable 1990 period. Revenues in the quarter rose 7.4 percent, to $3.19 billion, from $2.97 billion a year earlier.
For the six-month period, AMR reported a loss of $185.3 million, in contrast to earnings of $109.9 million, or $1.75 a share, in the 1990 period. Revenues came to $5.96 billion, up from $5.66 billion.
 
'Very Unsatisfactory'
 Acknowledging that the results were "very unsatisfactory," Robert L. Crandall, the chairman of AMR, cited a combination of factors, ranging from widespread discounting, the lingering effect of a year-end labor dispute, the continued absence of more than 200 pilots serving in the Persian Gulf war and the reallocation of equipment required to fly recently acquired routes to London.
"Those factors have prevented us from using our assets as efficiently as we'd like," Mr. Crandall said. "However, we now expect to have all our pilots home by mid-September and expect that the adverse effects of all these changes will ease substantially by the end of the third quarter and be eliminated by year's end."
Paul Karos, an airline analyst at the First Boston Corporation, said that AMR's earnings were "pretty much on target" with analysts' expectations and that a gradual recovery appeared under way. "I expect to see modest profits at United, Delta and Southwest, and a loss at USAir," he said. "I think the third quarter will be better, although the year over all will be nowhere as robust as I thought a few months ago."
Philip Baggaley, an airline analyst at Standard & Poor's, said he did not find AMR's results "terribly alarming," because of the pending economic recovery. "But unfortunately," he added, "the industry has already sold discount tickets for much of the summer, its strongest period."
 
Stock Declines
 Shares of AMR, however, fell $2.625, to $61.25, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
AMR's poor financial performance reflects the troubles that began for the industry with last year's economic downturn and the turmoil in the Persian Gulf, which caused aviation fuel prices to double. By year's end the industry had lost $4 billion, including AMR's loss of $36.9 million, resulting in the worst business year ever for United States airlines.
Air traffic fell 5.5 percent through May of this year, compared with the period a year ago. Since last fall, five United States carriers, which account for about 25 percent of combined systemwide capacity, have gone into bankruptcy or default, and Eastern Airlines ceased operations altogether last January.
The International Air Transport Association recently reported that airline industry losses worldwide in 1991 already total $2.5 billion just through March, the latest month for which figures are available.

HEADLINE: Stung by Prostitution, Town Shames Customers

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WYANDANCH, L.I.

 BODY:
Many residents of this struggling hamlet have come around to feeling sorry for the prostitutes who haunt its streets and, desperate for crack money, charge less than $20 for their services. But that sympathy does not extend to the men who come from out of town looking for sex.
"It's upsetting to the point where it's like a disrespect of you," said Daria Cooper, telling how she avoids even walking to the store because the out-oftown men often assume that any Wyandanch woman on the street is a prostitute. For a neighborhood straining to pull itself up from a morass of poverty, drugs and crime, such an attitude is more than many residents can bear. 
 Tired of the prostitutes on the corners and the men propositioning their daughters, and frustrated by police sweeps that have not solved the prob lem, the Wyandanch Civic Association took a drastic step this winter. Using a list provided by the police, it sent letters to the homes of 63 men arrested for soliciting prostitutes, with the words "Patronizing a prostitute" written in bold red ink on the envelope and, inside, a copy of the police report, with the accused man's name highlighted.
"This is to let people know that we do not want you to use our community as a playground," said Muriel Simmons-McCord, secretary of the civic association.
Humiliating the clients of prostitutes as a way to attack prostitution is a controversial tactic that has been used with limited success in the past. In 1979, in one of the most publicized instances, Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York directed the city's public radio station, WNYC, to broadcast the names of men arrested for soliciting prostitutes. But the plan was dropped after one day because so many people complained.
After receiving the letters from Wyandanch, many of the men telephoned members of the civic association to complain that their rights and privacy had been violated. One man, calling himself "John," appeared on the Sally Jesse Raphael television show to declare that he was a sex addict struggling to reform and that the letter had made him miss the chance to confess to his wife. (She wasn't too pleased, either; she left him for six weeks.)
"It's one thing if you're going to be arrested, and it's another thing if they're going to be harassing you at home," said Samuel Ackerman, who received one of the letters. Mr. Ackerman, who lives in the nearby community of Plainview, said prostitution should be legalized but acknowledged that his is an unpopular view here. "This was embarrassing, to say the least," he said.
But residents wonder whose dignity is more important -- theirs or that of the prostitutes' customers.
"This is Long Island; you're supposed to be able to enjoy your privacy, and it's being invaded on a day-to-day basis," said Daria Cooper, who grew up here when Wyandanch was a typical middle-class suburb of homeowners. But now, she says, she is struggling to hang on, as her block falls prey to pros titutes, drug dealers and transient welfare recipients who rent from absentee landlords.
How can she instill pride in her children, she asked, when outsiders treat their home with such disdain? "It's like it's O.K. to come into Wyandanch and dishonor it and then go home to your own neighborhood," she said.
The letter-writing campaign was one of the first actions taken by the civic association, founded last year to deal with deteriorating conditions in Wyandach. An unincorporated village, meaning that it has no government of its own and depends on services from the town of Babylon, the once mostly white community grew rapidly in the 1950's and 1960's, when blacks from New York City moved into inexpensive prefabricated houses built during Long Island's boom years.
As the blacks moved in, the whites moved out. Now the community is about 75 percent black, with a large Hispanic population and a small minority of whites. And, residents say, Wyandanch became a dumping ground -- for unpopular civic projects, like the town incinerator, and for a disproportionate number of welfare families who brought down its tax base and drove up unemployment, crime and drugs.
 
Matter of Race
 A group of residents is fighting to incorporate Wyandanch as a village, hoping for greater control over its future. And there are other signs of a renewed spirit, the most tangible being the new $1.4 million public library on Straight Path Road in the middle of town. But it is something of an oasis. The librarian, Wendell Cherry, can look out his windows and see drug dealers on one corner, prostitutes on another.
The residents are trying to play down the racial aspect of the anti-prostitution efforts, saying that they just want prostitution to end, no matter who is doing it. But race suffuses their thinking, and the members of the civic association recently parted company with its former president, Elizabeth Layton, who is white and who organized the letter-writing campaign, saying that she could not serve as a good community spokeswoman because of her color.
Ms. Layton says the community should focus on the prostitution, not on race, and that she has long served as an advocate for both blacks and whites in Wyandanch. But many of the black members of the civic association say that Wyandanch would not be disdained by outsiders if it were a white community. Nor, they feel, would white men assume they could proposition women at will.
"These white men feel it is no different from the slave days, when they kept their women at home and at night they would go out back to the slave quarters and take their pick," said Clyde Davis, co-director of the civic group. "These are the same people who will go back to their neighbors and say, 'Those niggers -- they're worthless, they're lazy.' "
Ms. Simmons-McCord, who said her 15-year-old daughter had twice been propositioned by a black man, said that she was reluctant to bring ace into it but that it was inevitable because so many of the men were white.
Trying to gauge the usefulness of the letter-writing campaign, Inspector John Compitello, the commanding officer of Suffolk County's First Precinct, which takes in Wyandanch, acknowledged that traditional police sweeps often did little to address the problem. The prostitutes just move to another corner, and their customers return later.
Civil libertarians said they deplored what they considered an invasion of privacy, especially for people who had not been convicted, but they said they did not think the civic association was acting illegally.

HEADLINE: Oil Use Slumps by 4.1% In Sharp 6-Month Drop

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
With the economy in recession, oil demand was 4.1 percent lower for the first half of this year than in the 1990 period, the American Petroleum Institute reported yesterday.
Bucking recent trends, production rose slightly in the first half and imports fell. 
 Although June was stronger than the earlier months, the decline in consumption, to 16.3 million barrels a day from 17 million, was the sharpest for a six-month period since 1983, said the institute, the industry's main trade association. Gasoline consumption hit a five-year low.
 
Recession Is Main Reason
 There were several factors but recession was the biggest, said Edward H. Murphy, director of finance, accounting and statistics at the institute. "If we were growing at the same rate as the first six months of last year, with no price changes, the decrease would have been eight-tenths of a percent," he said. Another factor in the decline in demand was the spike in crude oil prices earlier this year, caused by the war in the Persian Gulf.
 Prices have been lower since the war ended, but in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, crude oil for delivery next month hit $22.32, up 49 cents, the highest level since the war ended. In the longer term, however, oil company executives have recently been predicting stable prices.
The results for the first half of this year were not affected much by weather. The weather was warmer than usual for the first half of this year, which normally cuts the demand for heating oil and for oil for utility boilers, but in this case weather was not a factor, because the weather was warmer than normal in the first half of 1990, too.
Mr. Murphy, in a telephone interview, said that oil demand would not increase unless economic growth reached about 3 percent a year. "Some people are forecasting growth in that range, and others are not, but it's fair to say that even when the recession ends -- or if the recession has ended -- that very minor growth in the economy will not lead to growth in oil," he said.
Over all, according to the institute, the American economy now consumes 1.45 barrels of oil for each $1,000 of goods and services produced. In 1978, the figure was 2.2 barrels. Part of the reason is increased efficiency; for example, the mileage of the car fleet is increasing by 2 to 3 percent a year, because cars built in the 1990's are replacing those built in the 1970's. Also, industries continue to substitute natural gas or coal for oil.
With the trend in cars and in industry, the chairman of the Amoco Corporation, H. Laurance Fuller, said in an interview yesterday that "over all the demand for liquid fuel will not show much increase in the United States."
 
Domestic Output Up
 But this will not mean self-sufficiency for the American economy, he added, because over time domestic production will continue to decline and imports to rise.
In the first half of this year, however, domestic production rose, by six-tenths of a percent, to 7.43 million barrels a day from 7.39 million. Driven by high prices and the threat of more interruptions from the Persian Gulf, producers pumped everything they could in the early part of the year. This was in sharp contrast to the trend of the prior five years, during which time domestic production declined 18 percent.
With demand down and production up, imports fell sharply, by 13.3 percent, compared with the first half of 1990, to 7.34 million barrels a day from 8.47 million. Imports had been nudging the 50 percent mark, but were down to 45 percent for the first half.
The sharpest drop in demand was in heavy fuel oil, the kind used in factories and utility boilers, as well as in heating large buildings. It was down 11.3 percent. Deliveries of home heating oil and diesel fuel, which are essentially the same material, were down 4.5 percent, and gasoline was down 2.1 percent, the institute said.
 
Jet Fuel Down
 Jet fuel was down by 5.5 percent, the first six-month drop in nine years, the institute said. Among the factors was Eastern Airlines' ceasing of operations, said the institute, which concluded that passengers were finding empty seats on other airlines, with few flights added.
Gasoline prices, the institute said, were up 7 to 8 cents above the level at the middle of last year. But that includes a Federal tax increase of 5 cents, and state tax increases that average an additional penny, the institute said. It added that the rest of the increase, the part realized by oil companies as revenue, was far smaller than the increase in crude cost.
Since the beginning of this year, prices have fallen about 10 cents a gallon, the institute reported.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Note and Bond Prices Decline

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A report showing that conditions in the housing industry improved more than expected in June, and concerns about coming auctions of new securities prompted credit market participants to sell Treasury notes and bonds yesterday.
The housing report, which showed that housing starts rose 5.2 percent in June, to slightly more than a million units at an annual rate, was somewhat stronger than most economists had forecast, though analysts noted that the improvement did not suggest that housing was undergoing a robust recovery. 
 "The fact that housing starts showed an increase is somewhat surprising," said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders, which issued the report.
 
Price Report Discounted
 Traders said consumer price data issued yesterday showing that inflation at the retail level rose by just two-tenths of 1 percent last month was not a big factor in trading.
Despite the favorable overall number, the so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in June, slightly higher than economists had anticipated.
Even with the increase, the core rate of inflation rose by just 3.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, well below the annual rise of 6.8 percent of the first quarter.
If anything, the housing and inflation numbers seemed to conform with the view of a mild economic recovery accompanied by low inflation. Those factors are often the catalyst for a bond market rally. The fact that yields remain high is worrying to some portfolio managers.
"Given the confluence of reasonably good news on inflation, slow money growth and the economy, the bond market has had every reason to see yields move below 8 percent," said Thomas J. Steffanci, director of fixed income at the Fidelity Management and Research Company in Boston. "The fact that yields have not fallen to those levels should worry bond investors."
 
An Simple Explanation
 Traders say the explanation for why yields have not fallen is fairly simple.
"The market has nothing to focus on except supply," said David R. Duerson, manager of trading at the Security Pacific Corporation. "Under those conditions, the market needs to back up a little bit in order to absorb the new issues."
Attention to the expected flood of new issues began in earnest late yesterday, when the Treasury announced it would auction $12.5 billion of new two-year notes on Tuesday and $9.25 billion worth of five-year notes on Wednesday.
In when-issued trading after the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.94 percent, and the five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.94 percent.
While traders are concerned about bidding on what is likely to be an ever-increasing supply of new Treasury issues over the next 12 months, some analysts predict the new issues will be absorbed quite easily, and that yields will fall.
"We think bonds are cheap, and that the Federal deficit will be easier to finance than most people currently believe," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at the Paine Webber Group. "We will see enough money around at the auctions. Dealers will see better demand than they currently expect. But it will take time to overcome their current worries."
 
30-Year Yield Rises
 By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 96, down 15/ 32, to yield 8.49 percent, up from 8.44 percent late Tuesday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 1/32, down 1/4 point, to yield 8.29 percent. And the 7 5/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 100 14/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.47 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates inched slightly higher. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.58 percent late yesterday, up one basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 5.72 percent.
 
Philadelphia Bonds
 In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, roughly $1 billion in new securities were priced. Among the issuers was the cash-short City of Philadelphia, which came to market with its first offering of general-obligation bonds since May 1990.
Philadelphia offered a total of $224 million worth of securities at negotiated bid through an underwriting syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody & Company.
More than $170 million of the bonds were insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation and the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company.
However, $50 million worth of 25-year bonds maturing in 2016 were not insured, and carried no debt rating. The insured pieces of the offering were rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
The uninsured securities carry an 8 5/8 percent coupon and were priced at 97.719, to yield 8.85 percent.
"We came to the market with the objective of pricing the last series of bonds at less than 9 percent, and we were successful," said Ben Blakney, Philadelphia's treasurer. "It seems the market feels the city is on the road to recovery."
Underwriters said the issue had been oversubscribed.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were narrowly mixed.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most securities dipped by about 1/8 point, according to market participants.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.2% in June

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose modestly in June, the Government said today in a report indicating that the economic recovery was causing few inflation problems.
The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index was up only two-tenths of 1 percent, after a three-tenths of 1 percent rise in May. A decline in energy costs helped to offset a sharp gain in the prices of fruits and vegetables. 
 Some analysts said they were concerned because prices outside the volatile food and energy categories rose four-tenths of 1 percent, but others noted this "core rate" was driven in part by a jump in tobacco prices and other factors that were not directly connected to the state of the economy.
 
Weekly Earnings Up
 "I consider these price trends very favorable," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
The mild price rise helped to lift the inflation-adjusted weekly earnings of United States workers by nine-tenths of 1 percent in June after a 1 percent increase in May.
"For a stronger recovery, two things are required," Ms. Shaber said. "One is more jobs, and one is better prices. This is one of those two major elements."
The inflation report, along with a Commerce Department report that housing starts rose 5.2 percent in June, supported the optimistic view that was presented to Congress on Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. He pointed to "compelling signs that the recession is behind us" and "promising signs of a slowing in inflation."
For the first half of 1991, consumer prices increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent, well below the 6.1 percent advance for all of 1990, which was the worst in eight years.
The price swing from 1990 to 1991 was largely attributable to oil prices, which fell steeply after surging when Iraq invaded Kuwait last August. But the Labor Department said food prices and prices excluding food and energy were also advancing at a slower rate this year.
In June, food prices rose five-tenths of 1 percent after no change in May. A 6.1 percent jump in fresh fruits and vegetables accounted for 95 percent of the advance.
 
Weather Factors
 Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa., said orange and avocado prices were still affected by a freeze in California early this year. Lettuce and tomato prices have been hurt by excessive rain in the Southeast, and rain has washed out the cherry crop in Washington state.
Energy prices fell 1 percent, with declines registered for gasoline, fuel oil and natural gas and electricity. In the first half of the year, petroleum-based energy costs fell at an annual rate of 30 percent, after rising 35.4 percent in 1990.
The various changes left the Consumer Price Index, before adjustment for seasonal variations, at 136 in June, 4.7 percent higher than the 129.9 level a year ago. That means a market basket of goods and services costing $136 last month would have cost $129.90 in June 1990.
Here are some details concerning the June prices:
*New car prices edged up two-tenths of 1 percent, and used-car prices jumped 1.1 percent. These were somewhat offset by a 1.8 percent decline in automobile financing charges.
*Airline fares rose six-tenths of 1 percent in June after dropping 9.7 percent over the previous three months.
*A six-tenths of 1 percent increase for women's and girls' clothing was offset by lower prices for jewelry, watches and footwear.
*Medical care expenses were up six-tenths of 1 percent, in line with the usually steep increase in that area. Costs were 8.8 percent higher than a year ago.
*The prices of home furnishings and toiletries each fell six-tenths of 1 percent.
*Out-of-town lodging expenses jumped 1 percent, tobacco prices climbed 2.1 percent and tuition and school fees were up eight-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Utility Pressed by Creditors

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHOENIX, July 17

 BODY:
The Tucson Electric Power Company, the struggling Arizona utility, said today that it was unnecessary for creditors to have filed petitions seeking to force the company to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Six creditors filed the petitions on Tuesday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix. The case has been transferred to Tucson. 
 The company has 30 days to respond to the petition, said George Miraben, Tucson Electric's vice president.
The filing will not affect service, staff or payments to creditors, Mr. Miraben said. State regulators have said they are concerned about the possible effect on Tucson Electric's 270,000 customers, especially regarding the utility's rates.
The utility, facing $2.7 billion in bank debt, supply contracts, leases and additional obligations, has been in default on payments to some creditors since Jan. 31.
Analysts say Tucson Electric's problems stem from actions by earlier management, which sold off some electricity-generating plants and used capital to diversify into other industries, like real estate and automobile financing. The diversified investments have fared poorly in the recession, and Tucson Electric is shedding them.
The utility, which has been trying to avoid a Chapter 11 filing, said on Tuesday that the filing was premature and unnecessary.
Ira Adler, its senior vice president and chief financial officer, said the filing would be more costly.
The six creditors named in the petition were the Emerson Finance Company, the IBM Credit Financing Corporation, the Philip Morris Capital Corporation, Harvey Hubbell Financing Inc., the United States Trust Company and the Ford Motor Credit Company.
Jon Harmon, a spokesman for Ford Motor Credit, said that since the company was unable to meet its many interests under a reorganization plan, "an organized bankruptcy procedure under Chapter 11 is the best way for all those needs to be met."

HEADLINE: Gephardt Makes It Official: He's No '92 Candidate

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Citing the press of duties as House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt announced today that he would not seek the 1992 Democratic nomination for President.
In a two-page letter sent to his Democratic colleagues in the House, Mr. Gephardt said President Bush could be defeated in 1992, but that someone else would have to do it. 
 "In the end, how a public servant can best serve the causes in which he or she believes cannot be determined by polls, and cannot be resolved even with the best intentioned advice of others," the Missouri Congressman wrote.
In an interview later, Mr. Gephardt said he made his decision in the last few days after being persuaded to "take one more look" at the possibility of running.
Mr. Gephardt's announcement ended months of speculation about his future plans. He had repeatedly said that he was not running for office and that it was impossible to do his job as majority leader and run for President at the same time. But Mr. Gephardt had continued to raise money for and solicit advice privately about the wisdom of another campaign.
 
Gore Considering the Race
 Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic consultant in Washington, contended, "If he had run, he clearly would have been the most formidable candidate in the race."
At a breakfast meeting with reporters today, Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who also sought the Presidency in 1988, said he is seriously considering running again and would make a decision by September.
"I honestly believe that this time around, the conventional wisdom right now is dead wrong," he said. "I think that President Bush is not only beatable, I think that he is going to start a decline in the polls that will last up to the November election. And I think he deserves to be beaten."
Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the Speaker of the House, said he would have supported Mr. Gephardt "enthusiastically" had he chosen to seek the Presidency.
"But from the standpoint of the House, this is a decision in which all Democrats can take great pleasure," Mr. Foley said. The decision would lend "continuity, stability and exceptional leadership" to the chamber.
In recent weeks, the top Democratic leadership has been reshuffled in the aftermath of the decision by Representative William H. Gray 3d,, the House majority whip, to leave Congress.
Mr. Gephardt, 50 years old, sought the Presidency in 1988 in a grass-roots effort and on a platform that emphasized trade issues. He dropped out of the race in March of that year after he was badly beaten in the 20-state Super Tuesday primaries.
 
Shifting Role for Gephardt
 The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Ronald H. Brown, said in a statement that Mr. Gephardt's decision would only shift his role in the Presidential nominating process, not eliminate it.
"As majority leader, he will continue to spearhead the Democratic effort to provide economic recovery for America and leadership to those most hurt by George Bush's extreme policies," Mr. Brown said.
Only one Democrat has announced his intention to challenge President Bush next year, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts.
Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia have said they are exploring the possibility of running. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York are also considered possible candidates.
Mr. Gephardt said that holding a leadership position in the House had changed his priorities this year and he felt the House was the best place to lay the groundwork for domestic issues that the Democrats would need to challenge President Bush.
 
Easier Decisions for Others
 "I don't understand how leaving now and destalizing the place would help that end," he said.
Mr. Garin speculated that Mr. Gephardt's announcement would help crystallize the decision-making process for other Democrats who are considering running.
"The fact that he's not running means this will be very much a wide-open affair now," Mr. Garin said.
Mr. Gephardt said he would help Democratic Presidential candidates "shape, define, and advance the Democratic message" on economic, education and productivity issues.
An aide to Senator Rockefeller said Mr. Gephardt called him at noon to inform him of his decision. Mr. Rockefeller praised the majority leader and said he expected Mr. Gephardt to "continue to contribute ideas and to shape the debate" within the party as the Presidential campaign season begins.

HEADLINE: Senate Backs Bill Allowing Abortion Counseling

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
The Senate voted today to overturn a Federal regulation that prohibits abortion counseling in federally financed family planning clinics. But the voice vote, conducted in a rush with only a few senators on the floor, was an inconclusive indicator of whether the measure would survive a Presidential veto.
The bill, sponsored by Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, would bar the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the regulations, which it wrote in 1988. Those regulations were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in May. 
 But the measure passed today raised nearly as many questions as it answered. Two amendments approved by the Senate take opposite approaches to the issue of whether parents of minors seeking abortions should be notified before the procedure is performed.
One version, sponsored by Senator Daniel R. Coats, Republican of Indiana, would force clinics to notify the girl's parents; the other, sponsored by Senator George J. Mitchell, the Maine Democrat who is the majority leader, would allow adults other than the parents to determine whether a girl is mature enough to make the decision on her own.
 
Similar Bill in House
 The House has passed a similar measure allowing abortion counseling as part of a larger appropriations bill. But the House has not addressed the issue of parental notification.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Energy Subcommittee on Health and Environment, which is considering a separate bill to allow abortion counseling, said today that the Senate vote "created much confusion."
Referring to the current ban on abortion counseling, Mr. Waxman added: "But amidst all this confusion, one thing is also clear. The Congress is determined to overturn the gag rule."
 
Why a Voice Vote?
 The vote today on the Chafee bill was also less than decisive because of the last-minute negotiations that led to an agreement to hold only a voice vote. Both sides gained from a voice vote. Supporters of abortion rights had been sure the Chafee bill would pass, but less confident they would receive the two-thirds majority needed to override a Presidential veto. Abortion opponents had been worried that they would be badly beaten on a roll-call vote after an Administration alternative was defeated 64 to 35 on Tuesday.
That alternative, sponsored by Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, would have continued to ban abortion counseling at federally financed clinics but would have allowed patients to be referred to other hospitals or clinics that performed abortions.
"The thought was, Seek result; get it passed," Mr. Chafee said today.
The Chafee bill gained additional support today when it was amended to exempt seven states that already have parental notification laws from the effect of the Coats and Mitchell amendments. Those states are California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Florida, Oregon and Wisconsin.
Mr. Chafeee said reaching a two-thirds majority on the bill today would not have guaranteed that senators would override a veto.
At least two Republicans, Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Jesse Helms of North Carolina, said today that they had talked by telephone this morning with John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff who is in London with President Bush at the economic summit meeting. Mr. Hatch said Mr. Sununu assured them that the President still intended to veto the counseling measure if it passed.
 
Reaction to Vote
 Lobbyists on both sides of the issue expressed disappointment and confusion about the outcome.
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, praised the Senate for what she described as a decision to "renounce Government intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship." But she said the conflicting parental notification provisions "raise serious concerns about the health and well-being of young women facing crisis pregnancies."
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, said he was hopeful that a Presidential veto might be sustained and that the Senate passed the Coats parental notification amendment. But he also called it "regrettable" that the Senate passed the Chafee bill, which he said would "require promotion of abortion as birth control in federally funded clinics."

HEADLINE: Earnings Up at United Telecom and Pactel

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
United Telecommunications Inc. said yesterday that its second-quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago, largely because of better earnings at its U S Sprint long-distance phone company.
Separately, the Pacific Telesis Group reported a 10 percent rise in its second-quarter profit but said most of the increase resulted from one-time gains. Meanwhile, Ameritech, another regional phone company, said its profit slipped 14 percent. 
 Following are details of the results:
 
United Telecom
 United Telecom said net income increased to $89 million, or 41 cents a share, from $41 million, or 18 cents a share, in the quarter last year.
In the period a year earlier, United Telecom's profit was reduced by a one-time charge of $72 million. The charge primarily covered the cost of a restructuring at Sprint that included the elimination of 1,000 jobs.
Revenue totaled $2.21 billion in the second quarter, up 7 percent from $2.07 billion in last year's comparable period.
United Telecom's' shares rose 50 cents yesterday, to $29.125, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sprint's operating income rose to $73 million on revenue of $1.36 billion. That was in contrast to an operating loss a year earlier of $42 million, after the $72 million charge, on revenue of $1.24 billion.
"We're pleased with the improvement in Sprint's operating results," said William T. Esrey, United Telecom's chairman and chief executive officer. "We remain focused on improving Sprint's margin and containing costs."
 
Pacific Telesis
 Pacific Teleis earned $316 million, or 80 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $287 million, or 72 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1990.
The results of the San Francisco-based company were helped by the sale of cellular telephone holdings, the settlement of a lawsuit in St. Louis and the sale of the company's stake in Microtel, a communications partnership in Britain.
The one-time gains amounted to 7 cents a share. Without them earnings would have been up a penny, about 1 percent.
Revenue was $2.52 billion, up 4 percent from $2.43 billion in 1990's second quarter.
Sam Ginn, the chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased by the results, calling them solid in spite of the sluggish economy.
Pacific Telesis stock closed unchanged, at $40.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Ameritech
 Ameritech, based in Chicago, said it earned $303.9 million, or $1.15 a share, in the second quarter, down from $352.3 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose 2.2 percent, to $2.74 billion from $2.68 billion.
William L. Weiss, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the earnings decline to increased costs, particularly for higher depreciation and support of increased levels of business. Among the costs was the installation of a new customer billing system.
Ameritech stock rose 25 cents, to $58.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: HOUSE VOTES LIMIT ON HIRING IN STRIKE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17

 BODY:
By a substantial but less-than-veto-proof majority, the House today passed a bill that would prohibit employers from hiring permanent replacements for union members on strike.
The vote followed five hours of debate in which Democrats repeatedly contended that the right to strike was disabled if employers could permanently take strikers' jobs away, and Republicans argued that the bill would tip the labor-management balance toward unions, cause more strikes and diminish American competitiveness. 
 The vote 247 to 182, with 230 Democrats, 16 Republicans and one independent in favor and 33 Democrats and 149 Republicans opposed. The total in support was 43 short of the 290 required to override a veto if all House members vote.
Throughout the debate, Republicans reminded the House that President Bush had threatened to veto the bill. "Everybody in this chamber knows H.R. 5 is going nowhere," insisted Representative Tom Ridge, Republican of Pennsylvania.
 
Bill Seen as 'Detrimental'
 Both Lynn Martin, the Secretary of Labor, and the Office of Management and Budget said again today that the President's senior advisers would urge him to veto the bill. Ms. Martin said the bill "would be detrimental to the nation's economic health." She said it would destroy the balance that now exists by "insulating employees from the traditional risks that have checked strikes."
Representative William D. Ford, the Michigan Democrat who heads the committee on Education and Labor, insisted "the survival of collective bargaining in the United States is at stake." Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the bill was necessary to change the law to make it match what most Americans thought it already provided: "You can't get fired for striking."
Democrats argued that even though the hiring of permanent replacement workers had been approved by the Supreme Court in 1938, it had not been a widespread practice until the 1980's, when the airlines began using it frequently. Mr. Ford said "more and more employers each year are turning to the threat or use of permanent replacements as a way to coerce and intimidate union workers."
Republicans disagreed. Representative Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, said the bill "will hasten the closedown of many businesses." Representative Don Ritter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the bill made strikes easier. He said the country needed fewer strikes if it was to "meet the global competitive challenge."
For the American Federation of Labor and Congres of Industrial Organizations, this bill remains one of its two or three most important legislative priorities. Bob McGlotten, director of the federation's Labor Department who lobbied outside the House chamber, said the measure "goes to the heart of the labor movement's existence."
The bill, the Workplace Fairness Act, would prohibit employers from permanently replacing union workers who are striking over wages, benefits and working conditions. Temporary replacements during a strike would be allowed. Employers would also be barred from giving any advantage on the job to a striking worker who returns to work.
Current law prohibits the hiring of permanent replacements in strikes over unfair labor practices or illegal conduct by employers.

HEADLINE: Three Big Military Contractors Report Profits for Quarter

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 17

 BODY:
The General Dynamics Corporation and the Northrop Corporation, two of the nation's largest military contractors, reported higher profits today for the quarter ended June 30. Another big aerospace company, the Rockwell International Corporation, posted a decline in earnings.
General Dynamics said its net income for the quarter was $211 million, or $5.04 a share, compared with a $240 million loss in the corresponding period last year. Reflecting the decline in Pentagon spending, sales for the quarter were down almost 7.7 percent, to $2.42 billion from $2.62 billion. 
 The results for this year's quarter were helped by a one-time gain of $140 million from a favorable tax adjustment. Results for the quarter last year reflected a charge against earnings of $330 million to account for troubles on two big military contracts.
General Dynamics, based in St. Louis, said the tax adjustment stemmed from the completion of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service of its results for 1977 through 1986. The company said it would be permitted to use certain investment tax credits, research and developments credits and other tax credits. As a result, General Dynamics said, it was able to reduce its reserves for income taxes by $140 million, giving it a gain of that amount in the quarter.
Like most military contractors, General Dynamics is concentrating on wringing more profits from the weapons programs it has and on avoiding costly technical risks. Like many of its competitors in recent quarters, General Dynamics's earnings looked good compared with the quarter a year ago simply by not having any write-offs for technical problems and delays.
General Dynamics also benefited from improved profitability in its tank-building division and its Cessna small airplane business.
The company's stock gained 50 cents on the New York Stock Exchange today, closing at $44.
Following are the details of the other companies' results:
 
Northrop
 Northrop said its net income for the quarter was $36.2 million, or 77 cents a share, a 23.5 percent increase over the period last year, when the company earned $29.3 million, or 63 cents a share.
Northrop's sales for the quarter declined by 6 percent, to $1.33 billion from $1.41 billion.
Northrop, based in Los Angeles, said its earnings for this year's quarter included an after-tax charge of $8.4 million to settle accusations that it had defrauded the Air Force by improperly testing missile components. The financial charge amounted to $21.8 million on a pretax basis and included $11.8 million to replace hydraulic fluid in the guidance devices for the Air Force's cruise missiles. Northrop has acknowledged that the fluid may freeze at temperatures higher than those demanded by Air Force specifications.
Northrop attributed the decline in sales to a slowdown in deliveries on the F/A-18 fighter program, the end of the company's effort to win a new Air Force fighter contract and decreased demand for military electronics. The declines were partly offset by higher sales of missiles and of components for the Boeing Company's 747 jetliner.
Northrop's shares closed at $28.625 on the Big Board today, up $1.
 
Rockwell International
 Rockwell International said its earnings for the quarter, the third of its fiscal year, declined 11.6 percent, to $151.4 million, or 65 cents a share, from $171.2 million, or 71 cents a share. The company has fewer shares outstanding this year because of a share-repurchase program.
Rockwell said its sales fell 4 percent, to $2.99 billion for the quarter, from $3.13 billion in the similar period last year.
The company, based in Los Angeles, said earnings in its electronics segment declined 18 percent, largely because of lower demand for industrial automation and avionics products. It said the automotive components business was weak because of depressed worldwide markets, as was its graphics business, but that earnings in military electronics and aerospace remained strong.
Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman, said the company now expects its earnings for the year to dip slightly from last year, excluding a one-time gain from the sale of a business, primarily because of the national recession.
"We do not now see our businesses benefiting significantly from an economic recovery in this fiscal year," Mr. Beall said.
Rockwell's shares lost 12.5 cents on the New York Stock Exchange, closing today at $27.125.

HEADLINE: Mixed Earnings Picture Is Presented by Banks

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As the nation's banks report their second-quarter earnings, a mixed picture is emerging. Earnings are generally down, hurt by the banks' need to set aside money for future bad loans. But a few banks appear to have put their worst problems behind them.
Two banks reporting lowered earnings are among those involved in the recent spate of mergers. The Fleet/ Norstar Financial Group yesterday reported quarterly earnings of $28 million, or 23 cents a share, down from $54.1 million, or 47 cents a share, in the 1990 period. And the C&S/Sovran Corporation, engaged in merger talks with the NCNB Corporation, reported earnings of $64 million, or 45 cents a share, off from $79.8 million, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 C&S/Sovran's earnings announcement came late Tuesday night after the bank's chairman issued a statement indicating that his directors were still not fully committed to the NCNB merger. Bennett A. Brown, the bank's chief executive, repeated that statement yesterday and said that C&S/Sovran's board had "not made a decision to depart" from its "strategy of being an independent institution" and that there were "still important issues" between the two institutions to be "negotiated and resolved."
 
Real Estate Troubles
 C&S/Sovran has been plagued by a large number of nonperforming real estate loans, particularly in the Washington area. During the quarter, nonperforming assets increased by $153.8 million, to $1.3 billion. At the same time, the bank set aside $169.5 million for future bad loans, compared with $183.3 million in the first quarter and $123.6 million a year ago.
What happened at C&S/Sovran, is a tale retold at some -- but not all -- banks that reported yesterday: Bad real estate loans and third world debt are forcing banks to set aside more money for future loan write-offs, which cut into earnings. Only a few strong banks appear to have bucked this trend.
"It's really mixed," said Michael Starr, an analyst at Duff & Phelps in Chicago. "Industry earnings are down. But what we see is that at higher-quality banks, some of the problems seem to be subsiding. At the lower end, we still see a deterioration in loan quality that is impairing earnings."
C&S/Sovran's stock gained 62.5 cents yesterday, closing at $25.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The following also reported earnings yesterday:
 
Fleet/Norstar
 Fleet/Norstar Financial Group's quarterly earnings do not include results from its acquisition of the Bank of New England, which is still being integrated into the company. A spokesman said the bank may begin to report earnings on a consolidated basis in the next quarter.
On its own, J. Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman, said the bank was "still feeling the effects" of the recession. Still, he said he was "particularly encouraged" that the growth in nonperforming assets during the quarter was the smallest of the last seven quarters.
During the quarter, nonperforming assets rose $57 million, to $1.5 billion. The bank set aside $114.5 million during the quarter for bad loans, up from $89.7 million a year earlier.
The bank's shares gained 25 cents, to $25.625.
 
First Interstate
 First Interstate Bancorp, the largest bank in Los Angeles, reported yesterday that it was taking a $295 million provision for bad loans, and as a result had a large loss for the quarter -- $80.3 million. "We are truly disappointed with these results," said Edward M. Carson, First Interstate's chief executive.
The loss is in contrast to a profit of $95.1 million, or $1.42 a share, in the 1990 second quarter. In that period, the bank set aside $117 million for future bad loans.
Mr. Carson said the bank's total nonperforming assets decreased slightly, to $1.8 billion.
First Interstate's shares were unchanged at $31.
 
Republic New York
 Results were brighter at the Republic New York Corporation, where earnings rose slightly, to $56.4 million, or $1.48 a share, from $52.6 million, or $1.43 a share, a year ago.
At the same time, the bank's board authorized a 3-for-2 stock split, which will be put before shareholders in September. During the quarter, the bank increased its provision for loan losses by $16 million. The bank has total nonperforming assets of $183.2 million.
The bank's stock closed at $64.50, up $1.25.
 
Continental Bank
 The Continental Bank Corporation in Chicago also had a positive report, with second-quarter earnings of $31 million, or 41 cents a share, in contrast to a 1990 second-quarter loss of $57 million. The bank took several one-time charges in 1990.
Compared with the 1990 first quarter, when the bank earned $28 million, or 35 cents a share, however, Continental's performance was relatively flat.
"Due to the impact of the recession on our customers, we have incurred higher loan charge-offs, and, continuing to be prudent, we further increased the provision to bolster the reserve for credit losses," the chairman and chief executive, Thomas C. Theobald, said.
The bank has $770 million in nonperforming assets. In the quarter, it set aside $63 million for future bad loans.
Continental's shares added 12.5 cents, to $13.50.
 
Shawmut National
 The Shawmut National Corporation, one of New England's leading banks, lost money, but less than in the first quarter. The bank lost $58.7 million, in contrast to a profit of $30.2 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. In the first quarter of 1991, it lost $116.7 million.
The bank set aside $101.6 million during the quarter for bad loans, almost four times the $25.9 million in the 1990 second quarter. The bank's nonperforming assets declined slightly, to $1.6 billion.
Shawmut's stock gained 25 cents, closing at $6.125.
 
Barnett Banks
 In Florida, Barnett Banks Inc. reported that earnings fell to $29.2 million, or 42 cents a share, in the quarter, from $58.5 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. During the quarter, the bank's loan-loss provision totaled $85.6 million, up from $45.6 million a year earlier.
The bank's shares lost 87.5 cents, to $29.

HEADLINE: Loss for Apple; Record Profit at Intel

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 17

 BODY:
Apple Computer Inc. today reported increased revenues but a net loss for its third fiscal quarter because of lower profit margins and charges associated with layoffs and reorganizating.
Apple also said that while growth in shipments of its Macintosh personal computers remained strong, the growth rate fell to 60 percent, from 85 percent in the quarter a year earlier. 
 In its second-quarter report today, the Intel Corporation reported record revenues and earnings, defying the slowdown affecting many of its computer industry customers.
For its third fiscal quarter, ended June 28, Apple had a loss of $53.1 million in contrast to earnings of $119.8 million, or 96 cents a share, in the comparable period last year. The loss reflected a one-time restructuring charge of $224 million, or $138.9 million after taxes. Revenues rose 12 percent, to $1.53 billion, from $1.36 billion in the third quarter of the 1990 fiscal year.
Doug van Dorsten, an analyst with Shearson Lehmann Brothers in San Francisco, said it was clear from Apple's second-quarter results that estimates for this year and next would have to be adjusted downward, but he said the company was still on track.
"The charge was staggering, but it isn't for anything bad, like obsolete inventory or equipment," Mr. van Dorsten said. "They're still growing at way greater than the industry rate," which is 8 to 10 percent compared with Apple's 60 percent, he said.
Apple shares closed at $42.50 today, down $1.25. The earnings were announced after the market closed.
Apple laid off 900 employees during the quarter and plans to lay off about 600 more as part of efforts to reduce costs. While unit shipments of the Macintosh have continued to grow, the growth has mostly come from the low-priced Macintosh Classic model, which is sold at a lower profit margin. Sales of Apple's high-end models have been sluggish, putting further pressure on profits. Apple said its restructuring and cost reduction efforts would continue over the next 12 to 18 months.
"Apple's market share is growing as we continue to post significant increases in unit shipments and revenue," John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Now, we are taking important steps to lower our costs because success in this industry in the future will depend on increasingly cost-effective operations in addition to technological and market leadership."
Mr. Sculley said that Apple's restructuring, while painful in the short run, would make the company more competitive. In another effort to increase its competitiveness, Apple recently announced plans to collaborate with the International Business Machines Corporation in software, microprocessor and multimedia technology.
"The personal computer industry is undergoing fundamental changes that will shape the global information economy far into this decade," Mr. Sculley said. "We are committed to redesigning Apple's infrastructure and financial model so that they are both sustainable advantages within the dynamics of this changing industry."
 
Intel
 For the quarter, Intel had earnings of $230.8 million, or $1.10 a share, up 35 percent from $170.7 million, or 84 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenues rose 29 percent, to $1.25 billion, from $968.3 million in the second quarter of 1990. Per-share figures reflect an increase in shares outstanding to 209.8 million from 203.8 million.
Intel shares fell $1.50, to $44.25, in over-the-counter trading. Analysts said the decline might have resulted from Intel's hints that demand was easing for its 386 DX and 386 SX microprocessors. Intel's share price had dropped three weeks ago when some semiconductor distributors said they had an oversupply of 386 chips.
"It appears we're catching up with demand for our Intel 386 DX and SX microprocessors," Andrew W. Grove, Intel's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "As this occurs, we're moving more capacity to our new Intel 486 and Intel 386 SL microprocessors, which are still supply-constrained." He added that expanded output had eased the tight supply of 386 DX and SX chips.
Intel has also faced its first competition on the 386 with the introduction earlier this year of 386 clones made by Advanced Micro Devices Inc. While sales of these chips have helped revive Advanced Micro's results, analysts say they have not shipped in sufficient numbers to have a significant impact on Intel.
Millard Phelps, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist, said the quality of Intel's results was a matter of perception. "There are probably an equal number of people raising and lowering numbers out there," he said, referring to estimates for the third and fourth quarters. "I raised mine."
Mr. Phelps added that the easing of demand for the 386 did not appear to have bloated inventory levels and that the company was successfully shifting customers to the 486.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Multimedia Profits Up; Tribune and Others Off

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Three big media companies -- the Tribune Company, McGraw-Hill Inc. and the Pulitzer Publishing Company -- reported declines in second-quarter profits yesterday, but Multimedia Inc. reported a 50 percent increase.
Most media companies have been hurt by the recession, which has depressed demand for broadcast and print advertising. 
 Following are details of the results:
 
Tribune
 Tribune, based in Chicago, said second-quarter profits declined 4 percent, to $53.7 million, or 77 cents a share, from $56.1 million, or 78 cents a share, in the quarter last year. Revenues dropped 18 percent, to $540 million, from $656 million last year.
Operating profit rose 1 percent, to $102.4 million, but net interest expense rose 43 percent, to $12 million.
The newspaper division's operating profit was up 11 percent, to $60.4 million. Results a year earlier included losses at The Daily News in New York, which was sold to the British publisher Robert Maxwell in March.
Second-quarter advertising revenue was down 9 percent, including a 16 percent drop in classified ads, while circulation revenue rose 5 percent. Comparable results a year earlier do not include those of The News.
Operating profit dropped 9 percent, to $45 million, in the broadcast and entertainment group, and dropped 20 percent, to $2.4 million, in newsprint operations.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Tribune's stock gained 12.5 cents a share, closing at $45.75.
 
McGraw-Hill
 The publishing, broadcasting and business-information company based in New York earned $34.9 million, or 71 cents a share, down 6.2 percent from $37.2 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter slipped two-tenths of 1 percent, to $456.9 million, from $457.8 million a year earlier.
Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive, said the recession's impact in key markets was a major factor. The financial services unit, which includes the Standard & Poor's Corporation, a credit-rating service, was the only unit to post a significant gain in revenue and profit for the quarter.
Operating profits in information and publication services, including Business Week magazine, fell 28.2 percent, partly because of a weak ad marketplace. Operating profit in broadcasting fell 3.9 percent, and was off slightly in educational and professional publishing.
On the New York Stock Exchange, McGraw-Hill's stock lost 25 cents a share, closing at $58.75.
 
Pulitzer
 The publisher, which is based in St. Louis, said second-quarter earnings dropped 12.3 percent, to $4 million, or 39 cents a share, from $4.6 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $102 million from $103.9 million.
Full-run advertising linage was down 14 percent at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and 7 percent at The Tucson (Ariz.) Daily Star, the company said.
Pulitzer's broadcasting revenue declined 4.4 percent, reflecting generally weak advertising demand, particularly in automotive and political advertising.
Pulitzer's stock gained 50 cents a share in over-the-counter trading to close at $22.50.
 
Multimedia
 The company, based in Greenville, S.C., earned $14.4 million, or 39 cents a share, in the second quarter, up 50 percent from the $9.6 million, or 26 cents a share, earned in the quarter last year. Revenue rose 8.6 percent, to $134.6 million, from $123.9 million a year earlier. The 1990 results included an extraordinary loss of $3.1 million on debt refinancing.
Newspaper revenue was down 4.6 percent in the quarter, to $34.6 million, but revenue was up 11.3 percent from broadcasting, to $42.4 million; 14 percent higher from cable, to $33.7 million, and climbed 17.7 percent from entertainment, to $25.5 million.

HEADLINE: Reed Sees No Big Problem If Citicorp Falls From No. 1

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, said yesterday it was quite possible that the merger trend among large regional banking companies would eventually knock Citicorp from its position as the nation's largest banking company.
But Mr. Reed also said at a meeting of Wall Street analysts that a drop in rankings "because of regional combinations would be of little importance to us." What would be worrisome, he said, would be an erosion in Citicorp's share of the national consumer banking market or its position as the leading international bank. 
 Despite the rapid growth of regional banks, their business has been limited to local consumers and businesses. None have emerged as challengers to Citibank as the only banking company to have a large enough consumer operation to afford national advertising or a brand identity.
Speaking of the bank's position as the leading international bank, Mr. Reed added, "That is a great economic benefit to us." As other banks have retreated from foreign operations, he said, businesses are finding fewer alternatives.
 
Lead in Consumer Banking
 He saw little impact on Citibank, except in the New York consumer market from the merger announced earlier this week by Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover, which would create the nation's second-largest banking company with $135.5 billion of assets. He noted that Citibank, which has overall assets of $217.3 billion, would remain the largest consumer bank in New York by a narrow margin, but would fall to second place if lending to small businesses were included.
Trading of foreign exchange and arranging complicated interest rate swaps and related financings is another area where the No. 1 ranking is important, but not threatened by the growth of regional banks, he said.
On other matters, Mr. Reed said the peak in the banking company's troubled loans "still lies ahead of us." Although troubled commercial loans, which are not accruing interest, rose only $21 million in Japan, Europe and North America, down from a $752 million increase in the first quarter, he warned that such loans would probably increase by a larger amount in coming quarters. He said Citicorp's internal measures of troubled loans showed problems increasing in California and other Western states.
Mr. Reed said the company was 40 percent of the way toward achieving its goal of cutting expenses by an annual rate of $1.5 billion by the end of 1992. Expenses were $113 million less in the second quarter than a year earlier, and he said the decline was the first he could recall in his 26 years at the company.
 
Expenses Are Being Cut
 To cut expenses further and improve the company's financial strength, Mr. Reed said there were still "12 to 15 entities around the world which we are trying to get rid of."
Thomas Johnson, Citicorp's chief financial officer, said the second quarter's $225 million gain on securities sales, without which Citicorp would have shown a large loss for the quarter rather than a profit of $43 million, came from investments held by the holding company under the direct control of Mr. Reed.
Mr. Johnson declined to elaborate, except to say that there were substantial remaining investments with an unrealized profit.

HEADLINE: Health-Care Companies Post Gains

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Reports of double-digit profits growth during the second quarter continued flowing in from pharmaceutical companies yesterday, lustrous in the sea of earnings declines pouring out of banks, chemical companies, paper companies and airlines, among others.
Wall Street analysts were not surprised, however, by the 17.3 profit increase at the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company and the gains by three smaller phramaceutical concerns. 
 "This isn't an unusual quarter," said Steven Gerber, who follows the pharmaceutical companies for Oppenheimer & Company. "Pharmaceuticals are a predictable growth industry."
 
Trend of Higher Profit
 The profit increases reported yesterday ranged from 14.9 percent at the Warner-Lambert Company and 16.2 percent at the Schering-Plough Corporation to 24.6 percent at Marion Merrell Dow Inc. The trend is expected to continue when Merck & Company, the industry leader in prescription drugs, and a number of other concerns report their second-quarter results.
Baxter International Inc., the leading hospital-supply company, also continued to prove itself recession-proof for many of the same reasons as the drug companies, reporting a net income gain of 28.2 percent.
Analysts say a stream of new products, the ability to increase prices steadily at modest rates and the aging population in the industrialized world all contributed to the pharmaceutical industry's success in recent years.
Regulatory and pricing pressures are growing, but the pharmaceutical industry is also beginning to pay much closer attention to the efficiency of its operations. Savings in manufacturing and distribution are offsetting the pressures on earnings.
Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb
 Bristol-Myers Squbb, the largest domestic company in the health-care industry, earned $489.5 million, or 94 cents a share, in the quarter that ended June 30, up 17.3 percent from $417.3 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenues grew 9.9 percent, to $2.73 billion, from $2.48 billion in 1990.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's gains were fueled by strong domestic sales, which rose 12 percent, double the rate at which overseas sales grew, said Richard L. Gelb, the New York-based company's chairman and chief executive. Mr. Gelb said sales of prescription drugs and medical devices were particularly strong.
Bristol-Myers Squibb sells a variety of cardiovascular, antibiotic and anticancer agents, but it is best known to consumers for products like its Excedrin pain killers, Miss Clairol cosmetics and Windex glass cleaners.
The company's shares lost 50 cents yesterday to close at $82 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Baxter International
 At Baxter, thanks to lower interest payments and cost-cutting measures, second-quarter net income rose to $141 million, or 48 cents a share, up 28.2 percent from $110 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating income, however, increased just 11 percent. Sales increased about 10 percent, to nearly $2.2 billion, from $2 billion in the 1990 quarter.
"Our revenue growth continues to be strong, and gross profit margins have improved as a result of better pricing and manufacturing efficiencies," said Vernon R. Loucks Jr, chairman and chief executive of the Deerfield, Ill., company. The increase in operating income was below the 15 percent to 18 percent that Mr. Loucks predicted last year the company would achieve through 1993, but he described the Baxter as "on track with that projection."
Sales of hospital products and services were up 8 percent, to $1.08 billion. while its home health-care group reported sales had grown 19 percent, to $539 million.
Baxter's shares gained 75 cents, to $34.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Schering-Plough
 Schering-Plough's net income rose to $167.4 million, up 16.2 percent from $144.1 million a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were up 5.7 percent, to $912.9 million, from $864 million in the 1990 quarter. Schering said revenues would have been up about 14 percent it it had not divested its Maybelline cosmetics business a year ago.
Earnings per share rose 20.3 percent, to 77 cents, from 64 cents a year earlier, because the company repurchased eight million shares.
Schering's domestic drug sales were led by strong gains from its Proventil asthma treatment and anti-cancer drugs. Sun-care products and antifungal products also did well. The Madison, N.J., company's Wesley-Jessen vision-care products posted lower earnings, said Robert P. Luciano, the chairman and chief executive.
Schering's shares fell $1, to $51.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Warner-Lambert
 Warner-Lambert posted a 14.9 percent gain in net income on sales increases of just 7.2 percent, led by successes in its prescription drug lines. Net income grew to $154.6 million, or $1.15 a share, from $134.5 million, or $1 a share a year earlier. Sales for the quarter rose to $1.24 billion, from $1.15 billion in 1990.
The 13 percent increase in prescription drug sales, to $425 million, was led by Lopid, a cholesterol regulator, which had sales of $112 million, up 18 percent from 1990. Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive, who is scheduled to retire Aug. 1, said the Morris Plains, N.J., company would rely on prescription drugs to fuel future growth. Several analysts say the company is probably too small to support the research necessary for such a strategy in the long run and is a leading candidate for a merger.
Warner-Lambert said its Halls cough tablets were the leading performer in its over-the-counter health-care business, which includes Listerine mouthwash and Rolaids antacids. Overall sales for the business rose just 3 percent, to $372 million. Sales of gums and mints, led by Clorets and Trident gum, grew 4 percent, to $288 million. Other products, including Schick razors and blades, grew 8 percent, to $153 million.
Warner-Lambert's shares fell 50 cents, to $67.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Marion Merrell Dow
 Led by strong gains for its Seldane antihistamines, Marion Merrell Dow earned $162 million, or 57 cents a share, in the second quarter, up 24.6 percent from $130 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. The Kansas City, Mo., company's sales for the quarter rose 14.1 percent, to $718 million, from $629 million in the second quarter of 1990.
"Marion Merrell Dow products are showing excellent growth in our newer markets and those that are in more mature markets are holding their own very well," said Joseph G. Temple Jr., chairman and chief executive. Sales of Seldane were up 31 percent from a year earlier.
The results included the performance of Nordic Laboratories Inc., a Quebec-based pharmaceutical manufacturer that has been 85.6 percent owned by Marion since April. A year ago, Marion owned just 50 percent of the Canadian concern and did not consolidate its earnings. Nordic added about 1 cent a share to net income in the recent quarter.
Marion Merrell Dow's shares rose 87.5 cents, to $36, on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Chemical Company owns about 69 percent of the stock.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris Profits Up 21.6% in 2d Quarter

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest consumer-products company and the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, reported yesterday that profits in the second quarter rose 21.6 percent, to $1.15 billion, or $1.24 a share, from $948 million a year earlier, or $1.03 a share. The rise was at the low end of analysts' expectations.
Much of the revenue and profit rise was attributed to last year's $4.1 billion acquisition of Jacobs Suchard A.G., a giant Swiss company that makes coffee and expensive candies like Toblerone. 
 Aided by sales of discount cigarettes, Philip Morris's tobacco business continued to grow, especially internationally. But the company's domestic food business was relatively sluggish, as expected, because of the recession.
The company's Miller beer business turned in an unexpectedly strong performance, despite higher prices resulting from new excise taxes. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday Philip Morris fell $1.625, to $66.625.
One unexpected factor in depressing an otherwise strong performance was a slight rise in Philip Morris's tax rate to 43.7 percent, from 43 percent in the quarter a year ago. The tax rate of the company will vary because of its wide variety of foreign suppliers and markets, where tax rates may change more rapidly than those in the United States.
Quarterly revenue rose 15.9 percent, to $14.77 billion, from $12.74 billion a year ago.
At Kraft General Foods, the nation's largest food company, with scores of familiar trademarks in nearly every category of the supermarket, results were mixed. Operating profit rose at Kraft USA.
Lawrence Adelman, an analyst who follows Philip Morris for Dean Witter Reynolds, estimates that while food profits rose 19 percent, excluding the Jacobs Suchard acquisition, food profits rose only 10 percent, a still relatively strong gain. Philip Morris had told analysts that it hoped for an 11 percent gain in food profits.
In the company's mainstay cigarette business, international growth, especialy last year's sale of huge quantities of cigarettes to Russia, was nearly double the rate of revenue growth for the still strongly profitable domestic market.
Foreign tobacco sales grew 23.6 percent in the quarter, to $3.13 billion, and foreign tobacco profit grew 24.3 percent, to $440 million.
But domestic cigarette sales in dollars, including the powerhouse Marlboro brand, rose 12.7 percent, to $3.19 billion, and domestic profit rose 16 percent, to $1.3 billion. Volume was relatively flat, as it has been for years, with a two-tenths of 1 percent rise in volume of actual cigarette packs sold.
Sales of discount cigarettes accounted for much of the maintenance of sales, as higher excise taxes encouraged smokers to trade down to cheaper brands.
Miller beer appeared to be benefitting from higher taxes on beer, as higher prices announced at nearly the same time as the excise taxes appeared to be accepted by most beer customers. Beer dollar sales rose 17.6 percent, to $1.13 billion, and beer profit rose 20 percent, to $108 million.
Mr. Adelman of Dean Witter estimates that actual sales of Miller six-packs rose 3 to 4 percent in the quarter, about triple the industry rate.

HEADLINE: Chapter 11 For Taj Mahal

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a prearranged deal with creditors to reduce its $675 million "junk bond" debt.
Under the debt reorganization plan, filed Tuesday in Camden, N.J., Mr. Trump will give up half his ownership in the casino in exchange for lower interest rates on its junk bonds.
The plan also calls for a reduction in the interest rate on the casino's first-mortgage bonds from 14 percent to 11.35 percent, with some interest paid in additional bonds instead of cash.
The $1 billion Taj Mahal, which opened last year, is the largest of Mr. Trump's three casinos in Atlantic City. It was his first Chapter 11 filing.
The plan still must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court in Camden.

HEADLINE: Housing Starts Rose 5.2% in June

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Builders broke ground for new houses and apartments at an annual rate of 1,040,000 in June, the third straight increase and the first million-plus month since November, the Census Bureau reported today.
The 5.2 percent advance included a sharp rebound in the Northeast, albeit from very depressed levels, with the West being the only region to show a decline. 
 At the same time, permits for future construction rose 4 percent, to a annual pace of 1,002,000, the fastest since last August.
 
'A Mild Recovery'
 But while the rise in activity was somewhat stronger than expected, analysts continued to view housing as a relatively subdued contributor to an economic rebound that itself is likely to be lackluster.
"The housing market continues to improve, but it's improving slowly, and it's improving by less in this recovery than in previous recoveries," said David W. Berson, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. He said housing would "lead" the economy in coming months but, with starts at about two-thirds the pace of the mid-1980's, would not be strong enough to "pull" it.
"This fits with our preception of a mild recovery," added Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
Today's housing figures were published as the Labor Department reported that consumer prices last month rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent over all, but a mildly unnerving four-tenths of 1 percent excluding food and energy. [Page D10.]
This was seen as consistent with modest economic reovery and not as grounds for the Federal Reserve to either relax or tighten monetary conditions.
June's 1,040,000 pace of housing starts consisted of 868,000 single-family homes and 172,000 multifamily units, according to the bureau. The total compared with 989,000 in May, a pace revised upward from the 982,000 that was initially reported.
 
No Trend Established
 The Northeast posted a sharp increase to an annual rate of 148,000, a pace 29.8 percent faster than May's 114,000 rate. Government and private analysts cautioned, however, that monthly starts figures were highly erratic and that it may take three months or more to establish even a national trend.
At their June pace, starts in the Northeast returned to the levels of last October and November.
Starts climbed 17.5 percent, to a 255,000 rate, in the Midwest and by 6 percent, to 389,000, in the South. In the West, the decline was 14.8 percent, to 248,000, offsetting a May surge.
During the first half of the year, there were 487,700 starts, 25 percent less than for the same period of 1990.
Without seasonal adjustment, nationwide starts were 104,100 last month, about twice the January low of 52,500.
 
Permits Up in All Regions
 All four regions posted gains in permits at a seasonally adjusted annual rate -- to 115,000 from 105,000 in the Northeast; to 231,000 from 221,000 in the Midwest; to 392,000 from 379,000 in the South, and to 264,000 from 261,000 in the West.
For the first six months of 1991, 470,200 permits were issued, 26 percent under the comparable period last year.
Today's report also showed that manufacturers shipped mobile homes at a 174,000 annual rate during May, 1,000 fewer than in April and 16,000 fewer than in May 1990.
Early this month, the Government reported that sales of new single-family houses fell to an annual rate of 474,000 in May. This is little more than half the level of single-family starts this year, the apparent discrepancy is explained by the fact that sales figures do not include custom-built homes for which sales contracts are signed in advance.

HEADLINE: 6 Industrial Companies Report Declines in Their Earnings

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Industrial companies continued to report generally depressed second-quarter earnings yesterday. Most of them cited the effects of the recession as the primary cause.
Some executives, however, said they saw signs of an upturn during the remainder of the year. 
 Following are the details of the companies' results;
 
Georgia-Pacific
 The Georgia-Pacific Corporation, a lumber, paper and building products company, based in Atlanta, reported that its earnings declined 69.2 percent, to $33 million, or 38 cents a share, from $107 million, or $1.25 a share. Sales were down 15.3 percent, to $2.98 billion from $3.52 billion.
The current earnings were improved by a one-time gain of $29 million, or 34 cents a share, from the sale of 49,000 acres of timberland near Bellingham, Wash.
"Pulp and paper markets weakened during the second quarter, but there are some encouraging indications business is beginning to improve," said T. Marshall Hahn Jr., Georgia-Pacific's chairman. In addition, he said, there have been price increases in some wood building materials as a result of a "modest increase" in new home construction and reduced logging. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Georgia-Pacific closed at $55, unchanged.
 
Owens-Corning
 The Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation, based in Toledo, Ohio, reported a 61.5 percent decline in net income to $15 million, or 34 cents a share, from $39 million, or 92 cents a share. Sales declined 3.4 percent, to $745 million from $771 million.
"These results reflect the continued weakness in most of our major markets in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Brazil," said Max D. Weber, company chairman.
Like some other building products company executives, Mr. Weber said that it appeared as if the worst of the housing slump had passed and that modest increases in sales of those products have been recorded. He said a housing recovery in Canada seems somewhat stronger but that conditions in Europe and Brazil remain lackluster.
Sales of reinforcement materials the company supplies to the automotive and pleasure boat are expected to improve in the second half, as automobile production is expected to increase, Mr. Weber said. Owens-Corning's stock gained $2.50, to $29.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
TRW
 TRW Inc., based in Cleveland, reported that earnings declined 61.9 percent, to $24 million, or 39 cents a share, from $63 million, or $1.02 a share. Sales declined 5.7 percent, to $1.98 billion from $2.10 billion.
The company said the major cause of the earnings decline was the divestiture of its European piston ring and cylinder sleeve business, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $18 million, or 29 cents a share. It also cited "continued weak market conditions" in the automotive component and information services business it operates.
"While our space and defense segment continues to perform well, the recession has been difficult for our automotive and information businesses," said Joseph T. Gorman, the company's chairman.
The company said sales of its automotive segment fell 2 percent, to $1.04 billion, and operating profit declined 63 percent, to $31 million from $84 million. Space and military were down 11 percent, to $746 million, while operating profits were reported up slightly, to $62 million. Sales of information services rose 1 percent, to $192 million, but operating profit was down 17 percent to $15 million from $18 million. In Big Board trading, TRW's stock closed at $44.25 yesterday, up $1.
 
Maytag
 The Maytag Corporation, based in Newton, Iowa, said net income declined 38.2 percent, to $18.8 million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $30.4 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Sales were down a little over 1 percent, to $777 million from $788 million.
The company said the quarter's performance was affected by a one-time charge of $10 million in connection with the closing of a plant that made vending machine equipment.
Daniel J. Krumm, the company's chairman, said he was encouraged by the fact that the second-quarter's sales exceed the $738 million recorded in the first quarter. But he warned that economic recovery in this country "is likely to be a slow, gradual process" and noted that recessions continue in other countries, including Canada and Britain.
The company said its major appliance sales in North America declined eight-tenths of 1 percent in the quarter, to $475.2 million from $478.9 million, while European sales increased 9 percent, to $122.1 million from $110.7 million. The company sells appliances under the Maytag, Magic Chef, Hoover, Jenn-Air, Admiral, Hardwick and Norge brands. Maytag stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $15.625, up 87.5 cents.
 
Champion International
 The Champion International Corporation, a pulp, paper and wood products producer, based in Stamford, Conn., reported that earnings plunged 92.9 percent, to $4.5 million from $63.5 million, or 61 cents a share. Because of preferred stock dividend requirement, the slender profit for the quarter was reported as a loss of 2 cents a share of common stock.
Sales fell 6.3 percent, to $1.18 billion from $1.26 billion.
The company said price weakness for pulp and a broad spectrum of paper grades led to the poor results. "Our mills ran very well, but we've been hammered on pulp and paper prices due to the overall weakness of the economy and new industry capacity," said Andrew C. Sigler, the company's chairman.
The company said income from operations in its paper segment was down 56 percent, to $33 million from $75 million. The company said pulp prices were soft, that uncoated papers continued to decline and that its newsprint operations has a "slight loss."
Operating income of the wood products segment was down 34 percent, to $11.6 million from $17.8 million. The company said timber shortages were helping firm prices in that market. In Big Board trading Champion's stock closed at $28.50, up 37.5 cents.
 
United Technologies
 The United Technologies Corporation of Hartford said earnings declined 79.1 percent, to $43.4 million, or 28 cents a share, from $207.5 million, or $1.52 a share. Sales declined 5.4 percent, to $5.38 billion from $5.69 billion.
"The weak economy continues to affect our core businesses even though we have made substantial progress in reducing costs," said Robert F. Daniell, the company's chairman. "Our cost-cutting efforts will continue, despite some early signs that the econmomy might be picking up."
Mr. Daniell cited expected increases in airline passenger traffic and automobile production as indicators of a possible upturn.
The quarterly results include a one-time, pre-tax charge of $148 million some restructured contracts which was partially offset by $100 million in added fees at the company's Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division.
Operating profit at the company's power segment, which includes Pratt & Whitney, declined 54 percent, to $123 million from $266 million. The flight systems segment reported a loss of $72 million, compared with a profit of $19 million, as a result of the contract difficulties.
Income at the company's building systems segment declined 10 percent, to $124 million, largely as a result of lower profit margins at the Otis elevator operation. The company's industrial segment was off 52 percent, to $28 million, as a result of lower car and light-truck output in North America and reduced revenues because of businesses divested last year.
United's stock closed on the Big Board at $46.75, up 25 cents.

HEADLINE: Summit in London: Reporter's Notebook;
Leader of the Free World, or Just Plain 'Geoffrey'?

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 17

 BODY:
George Bush tried not to let it bother him that Mikhail S. Gorbachev was getting the lion's share of attention at the London talks, but on Tuesday night, the President's ego took a real blow.
At Queen Elizabeth's dinner at Buckingham Palace for the seven world leaders attending the talks, Bush aides recounted, the wife of a foreign minister came up to the President and greeted him warmly. 
 "Oh, Geoffrey," the woman said. "It's so nice to see you."
"I'm George Bush, the President of the United States," Mr. Bush replied.
"Well, you sure look a lot like Geoffrey," she sniffed, drifting away.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d did not let Mr. Bush forget today that even the leader of the free world can fail to make an impression. They called the President "Geoffrey" all day.
 
Off With His Headline!
The British press had a field day reporting President Bush's "royal gaffe" today, printing pictures of Mr. Bush sitting down before Queen Elizabeth at a photo session preceding the dinner at Buckingham Palace.
The papers reported that the Queen was "not amused" and glared at Mr. Bush until he got up, allowed her to sit and then formally requested permission to take his seat by her side.
After a thorough investigation of the Case of the Missing Royal Protocol, the question arises: did the Queen set up the President?
The Queen was embarrassed on her recent trip to Washington when she was dubbed "the talking hat" after Mr. Bush failed to pull out the box that would have let the 5-foot-4-inch monarch stand properly at the White House lectern. As it was, newspapers and television showed the Queen's hat bobbing above the lectern, but not her face, and the British press called it a slight by the White House.
The Queen has been known to do tit-for-tat. When the Union Jack was flown upside down on her visit to San Francisco to see Ronald Reagan in 1983, she flew the Presidential flag upside down when Mr. Reagan visited her on her royal yacht, Britannia.
The First Lady told inquiring Bush aides that her husband told her that the Queen had invited him to sit down before her. He did, but got up again when he realized that no one else was ready to sit down. Elementary, Watson: A gaffe for a gaffe.
 
Better Read Than Dead?
But for President Bush, the most embarrassing moment of the summit meeting came at his news conference today with the Soviet President at the United States Ambassador's residence.
White House sound engineers pushed the wrong mixer button and the Russian translation, which was supposed to go to Soviet television, was accidentally sent to the American and British networks. A booming Russian voice drowned out the President's English, and confused anchormen were left scrambling to explain.
"It was mortifying," moaned a senior aide to Mr. Bush. "The President of the United States speaking Russian in front of the whole Western world."
After all, it was Mr. Gorbachev who was supposed to be coming around to Western ways, not the other way around. "Friendship is one thing," deadpanned Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman. "But we're not doing Berlitz school."
 
Mikey Likes Babs
Asked at the embassy news conference after his lunch with Mr. Bush whether he was looking for "a bundle of cash," Mr. Gorbachev made a noise of disgust and ended the session abruptly, barking "spasibo," or "thank you" in Russian.
The Soviet leader left a surprised President Bush standing at the lectern and walked over to kiss Barbara Bush. He spoke to the First Lady in Russian and she replied in English. Asked what Mr. Gorbachev had said, Mrs. Bush reported that he had made a date for the Moscow meeting later this month.
"He said he's going to take me to a lot of nightclubs," she said. Mrs. Bush later confessed that she was kidding. "I said, 'Give my love to Raisa,' and he said, 'She's having another schedule today.' I mean, we knew what each other said. That's sort of what happens in these meetings."
 
Gorbachev Agonistes
Was it a laughing harrumph or a harrumphing laugh? Was it a snort, a grunt or a guffaw? Was his voice tinged with irony or ire? Was the cast of his face serene or sullen?
It was a day for taking Mikhail Gorbachev's temperature, and the new arms control agreement was not analyzed more closely than the Soviet leader's sighs and whispers.
The frantic efforts of the other world leaders to stop Mr. Gorbachev from stealing the show was futile, of course. All anyone wanted to know was, Is "Gorby" going home on Friday strutting or slouching?
Indeed, it was less an Economic Summit than an Economic Bar Mitzvah for Mr. Gorbachev, a coming-of-age ritual in which the seven industrial powers officially allowed the Soviet leader into the capitalist tribe.
"He is crawling before he walks, moving out toward privatization," Mr. Bush said, sounding like a proud uncle and adding that Mr. Gorbachev had sounded "pretty darn positive -- let's rejoice!"
The London tabloids portrayed Mr. Gorbachev as a tattered beggar this week, and the cover of the satirical magazine Private Eye depicted him flying into town and importuning, "Got the price of a cup of tea, Guv?"
But the Soviet leader was swathed in so much respect and promises of support that while he didn't cart away cold hard cash, he was able to play statesman more than supplicant. At his news conference this evening with Prime Minister John Major of Britain, Mr. Gorbachev was not cadging a cup of tea. Rather, he observed grandly, "Whether you help us or not, that's not the point."
 
Fed Up, but Well Fed
Before his lunch with Mr. Bush at the American Embassy, Mr. Gorbachev offered reporters his philosophy: "In my position I have to be optimistic. I have to be optimistic. Otherwise, I wouldn't endure this." After lunch, the glasses of red and white wine sat, nearly full, at each place on the table in the elegant dining room.
The lunch had not been particularly liquid and the two Presidents did not talk liquidity or other nitty-gritty economic problems as they ate with their top advisers. After clinching the arms control agreement, they got right to the heart of the superpower relationship and talked about fear.
In a rare spate of listening, the usually didactic Mr. Gorbachev asked Mr. Bush, "What do you want of us?"
President Bush told Mr. Gorbachev that he wanted the Soviet Union to become a country that Americans were not afraid of, and that he wanted the United States to become a country that the Soviets were not afraid of.
Mr. Bush said he wanted to reach the point where no missiles were "staring at New York," and where Mr. Gorbachev could not show him a map of the Soviet Union encircled by American military bases.
"You're success is paramount to us," Mr. Bush told Mr. Gorbachev, according to Mr. Bush's spokesman, Mr. Fitzwater. "We care about your success. We want to reach the point where neither of us truly believes that the other would push the button."
The two men banished their fears enough to relax at the dinner at 10 Downing Street tonight. Little of substance was discussed. Some of the leaders sang tunes, off key, that they heard the night before at the Buckingham Palace dinner. And the leaders traded menus autographed with all their names, including that of the newest member of the economic club.

HEADLINE: SUMMIT IN LONDON;
PACT IS REACHED TO REDUCE NUCLEAR ARMS; BUSH AND GORBACHEV TO MEET THIS MONTH; 7 POWERS GIVE SOVIETS NEW ECONOMIC ROLE

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 17

 BODY:
After nine years of negotiation, the Soviet Union and the United States reached agreement today on a strategic arms treaty, the first to mandate reductions by the superpowers, and President Bush immediately agreed to meet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow late this month.
Then Mr. Gorbachev, the proud leader of the nation where Communism first flowered, sat down with the heads of the seven most powerful capitalist nations and asked them for help in reforming an economic system that has all but collapsed. Almost 75 years after the Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet President's pleas represented an admission of economic failure. 
 Mr. Gorbachev laid his plans before the Western leaders in what another participant described as "an eloquent performance." Officials taking part in the closed meeting reported that Mr. Gorbachev insisted that Soviet progress toward a market economy and private ownership of property was irreversible, but that he made no new proposals.
 
Gorbachev's Courage Hailed PHE>
 Nevertheless, Mr. Gorbachev won praise from the leaders of the seven countries -- the Group of Seven. Mr. Bush said the Soviet leader had shown "enormous courage" in pushing ahead with reforms.
"It's not going to be quick or easy to implement change in the Soviet Union," Mr. Bush said after the meeting, "but we believe President Gorbachev has made an irrevocable commitment."
Britain's Prime Minister, John Major, who played host to the group's 17th annual economic summit meeting, said: "This has been a day I believe that history may well see as a landmark. It will be seen as a first step toward helping the Soviet Union become a full member of the world economic community." [Excerpts from the Bush-Gorbachev and Gorbachev-Major news conferences, and from the summit's economic declaration, are on pages A10 and A12.]
The Moscow meeting was tentatively scheduled for July 30-31.
Under the provisions of the arms treaty to be signed there, the overall number of nuclear weapons in each side's arsenal will be cut by 25 to 35 percent. The American arsenal will be reduced from about 12,000 warheads and bombs to about 9,000, while Moscow's stockpile is to be reduced from roughly 11,000 to roughly 7,000.
While Mr. Gorbachev made no specific requests for immediate financial assistance, officials of several nations said, and left little time for questions, he asked the group to "take a step forward" in developing greater cooperation with his country.
"The ice has started moving; the icebreaker is on its way toward renewal," the Soviet leader told reporters later. But he quickly added, "There is need for movement from the other side," meaning the West.
Mr. Gorbachev came away with the prospect of a bit more Western aid than had seemed likely a few days ago, including pledges of a "special association" with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, extensive programs of technical assistance and an early visit to Moscow by the group's finance ministers to discuss further measures. But he won no promise of major infusions of cash.
In addition, German officials promised that they would invite the Soviet leader to attend next year's economic summit conference in Munich, and President Francois Mitterrand of France said that he favored ultimately asking the Soviet Union to join the club, making it a Group of Eight.
At the news conference tonight, Mr. Major said the meeting had established "a partnership with the Soviet Union on a new and better footing," as a first step toward Moscow's integration into the world economic system.
Mr. Gorbachev called the three-hour session "one of the most important meetings of our time."
"Today has meant a lot," the seemingly weary Soviet leader said.
"It's been a good day for the United States," Mr. Bush replied.
 
A Qualified Success
 Merely by winning admission to the forum of capitalist leaders this week, Mr. Gorbachev can claim a victory. But some things that most of the participants would have liked to give him, including full membership now or soon in the International Monetary Fund and greater drawing rights at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, were blocked by the United States and Japan.
Mr. Gorbachev had to overcome American opposition and that of hard-liners in his own country to gain an invitation to London. Still, some members of the Gorbachev delegation expressed open disappointment today with what he had achieved. One said that "the Soviet Union doesn't understand Western economics, and the Western nations don't understand Soviet politics."
Still, the arms accord is likely to help Mr. Gorbachev with his increasingly restive people, as it will free scarce resources for domestic concerns.
By the time that the strategic arms reduction treaty is carried out, probably in 1999, the number of American warheads on weapons that can reach the Soviet Union will drop by about 25 percent, and the comparable Soviet total will fall by about 35 percent. The treaty puts sub-limits on various weapons systems and is particularly tough on the Soviet SS-18 missile, the most powerful in either arsenal.
For two days, the prospect of Mr. Gorbachev's arrival here had hung over those attending the conference -- the leaders of Britain, the United States, France, Canada, Italy, Germany and Japan. Today, as his motorcade of Zil limousines flashed across central London from one meeting to another, he utterly dominated the scene, eclipsing and in some cases eliminating debate on other issues.
The summit conference never really came to grips with the environment, referring discussion of global warming and the rain forests to a United Nations conference next year on the subject and thus avoiding an all-out clash between the United States and the Europeans, especially Britain.
 
Tariff Issue Deferred
 On another difficult matter, described by everyone as crucial, the group merely pledged to complete by the end of the year the current round of talks designed to bring up to date the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is precisely what was promised in Houston a year ago and not delivered.
Mr. Major, who presided over this week's sessions in a bright and breezy way that contrasted sharply with the stern, hectoring manner of his predecessor, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, said it had been "a friendly and very frank summit." He added, "People did speak their minds clearly and comprehensively and on occasions in an unforgettable way."
Much of the groundwork was laid before today. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Foreign Minister, had resolved all outstanding questions on the all-important arms treaty, except one technical issue, at a series of meetings in Washington that ended Sunday. That related to the definition of a new missile, in terms of its throw-weight, or destructive capacity, for treaty purposes.
White House aides said Mr. Bessmertnykh asked this morning for a meeting with Mr. Baker just before Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were to meet for lunch at the United States Ambassador's residence. A senior American official said the Foreign Minister brought new proposals, and after a flurry of conferences, the President and his advisers agreed that the final obstacle had been overcome.
 
'Our Hospitality'
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev spent most of their lunch discussing economic and other matters, then slipped into an adjoining room to ratify what had been agreed to on arms.
Beaming, the two men met briefly with reporters, Mr. Gorbachev saying that his country was "ready to give our hospitality to the President of the United States and Mrs. Bush." He had sought the Moscow meeting for the last year.
"Before you change your mind, we accept with pleasure," replied Mr. Bush, who had held out for the treaty as a condition for making the trip.
Neither side was willing to specify what the final arrangement was, because neither wanted to appear to have made the final concession, lest it be seen as soft by the legislative hard-liners in Washington and Moscow whose backing will be needed if the treaty is to be ratified.
British and American experts said the difficulties in reaching agreement were more political than military. The Soviet Union is believed to be developing a more advanced, more powerful version of one of its missiles.
The Administration wanted to head that off, remembering the deployment of the SS-19 after the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty. Critics of the 1972 agreement charged that its negotiators had failed to get tight enough language.
 
Gorbachev Explains His Country
 At his meeting with the Group of Seven, Mr. Gorbachev made no specific requests for monetary aid.
"He really was trying to explain more what was going on inside the Soviet Union, what the pressures were, what he was up against in terms of history, if you will," Mr. Bush reported. "He really stopped short of what some predicted might be on his agenda."
Mr. Major reportedly opened the meeting by telling the Soviet leader: "You are among well-wishers. The challenges you face are formidable, but the opportunities are limitless."
He said candidly, however, that the West expected reform in property rights, market prices, the breakup of state monopolies and the establishment of a Western-style legal system.
Mr. Gorbachev, in turn, spoke of the need to dismantle barriers to the Soviet economy, including trade restrictions and lack of access to loans.
Daniel Bernard, the French spokesman, described the Russian's presentation as a "particularly rich" 30-minute speech that dealt with the relationship of the Soviet republics to the central Government in Moscow and with his own reform intentions.
A British official said Mr. Gorbachev's explanation of his economic policies today was not significantly different from the plan detailed in a 23-page letter he sent to the seven leaders last week.
According to one official, Mr. Gorbachev's one-hour opening statement this afternoon and his remarks at the news conference tonight were not "very specific on details."
He left unclear, this official said, the answers to such questions as exactly how the Soviets intended to privatize state-owned enterprises and liberalize controlled prices.
"There was movement in the right direction," an official said, adding that Mr. Major would try to get clarification during his talks with Mr. Gorbachev here Thursday.
In a briefing tonight, Mr. Gorbachev's chief spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko, disclosed few details of the private discussions today. He did say that Mr. Gorbachev had discussed the need to create a stabilization fund to bolster the ruble, as a way to more quickly complete the conversion of the ruble on international currency markets. However, he did not seek Western aid for such a fund. "Today was not the occasion" for that, Mr. Major explained.
 
Status of Soviet Republics
 Mr. Ignatenko said Mr. Gorbachev spoke at length about the relationship between the central Government and the republics, and assured Western leaders that he had a mandate to speak for all the Soviet Union in his attempts to press forward with an agenda of economic reform.
A six-point program of assistance was ultimately agreed on, but some of the points struck economists as imprecise and redundant, an attempt to make a small package look bigger. The Western summit partners committed themselves to these goals:
*Setting up the special relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, leaving it up to the institutions and the Soviet Union to negotiate the terms.
*Urging other international organizations to make their knowledge and skills available to Moscow.
*Offering technical assistance to help the Soviets exploit energy resources, improve food distribution, increase nuclear safety, make their transportation system more efficient and convert military industries to civilian ones.
*Helping expand trade with the West and with Eastern European nations.
*Sending Mr. Major to Moscow before the end of the year to check on the progress of reform and, if appropriate, to recommend further Western aid.
*Sending the finance ministers' group to Moscow very soon.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, which has supplied most of the Western aid to the Soviet Union in the last year, had hoped for bolder action. But he spoke of "a good start."
Mr. Mitterrand said "we must, really must, reach out," and his aides said that he, too, would have liked to do much more to help the beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev than was agreed to in London.

July Sales Were Down, but Not Spirits

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Racing officials reported yesterday that prices were down nearly 11 percent in the final tally of the prestigious July sale of selected yearlings at Keeneland race course in Lexington, Ky.
But they expressed relief that there had been no worse decline in a market that had already plunged 40 percent in the preceding five years. 
 They also acknowledged again that the market was still being saved by heavy spending by investors from the Arab nations and Japan, who once more dominated the two days of auction sales that closed Tuesday night.
 
Encouraging Message
 The three brothers of the ruling Maktoum family of the Persian Gulf oil emirate of Dubai combined to buy 50 of the 231 yearlings sold and spent close to $25 million of the $73.5 million grossed in the auction.
"Gloom and doom were forecast before the sale," James E. Bassett 3d, chairman of the Keeneland Association, said by telephone from his office at the track.
"There was much apprehension, reflecting the national recession. But good horses brought top prices. The sale serves as a barometer of public interest, and it should send a message of encouragement to the industry. The buyers were generally pleased at the stability of the sale."
 
231 Yearlings Sold
 "It was a quality-intensive market," said Leroy Jolley, the trainer of two Kentucky Derby winners and the star filly Meadow Star. "The good ones sell high; the others don't."
The bottom line after two days of auctions showed 231 yearlings sold for a total of $73.5 million at an average price of $319,578. Last year, 234 horses were sold for $82.3 million at an average price of $352,009. At the peak of the market in 1984, yearlings were bringing $544,681 on the average at the Keeneland sale.
Blockbuster sales also softened a bit. Nine of this week's yearlings commanded $1 million or more; last year, 11 went over $1 million.
This week's high price was $2.6 million paid for a colt whose sire was the French champion Nureyev and whose grandsires were Northern Dancer and Alydar. The colt was sold by William S. Farish's Lane's End Farm to the agent Morio Sakurai, who was representing Yoshio Asakawa, a developer and manager of golf courses in Japan.
Last year's highest price was $2.9 million; the record price paid for a yearling was $13.1 million in 1985.
The biggest spender at this week's auction was Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the Minister of Defense for both Dubai and the United Arab Emirates, who bought 35 yearlings for $18 million.

HEADLINE: Summit in London;
Clearing the Final Hurdles To a Strategic Arms Accord

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 17

 BODY:
In a brief encounter in the living room of the American Ambassador's residence off Regents Park, President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today ended one era in United States-Soviet relations and ushered in another.
Speaking through their interpreters, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev reached a compromise solution on a highly technical issue of throw weight on new missiles, the last remaining issue holding up the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty -- the first arms control agreement that will lead to an actual reduction in long-range nuclear weapons. 
 It was rather symbolic that, minutes after Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev sealed the deal, they immediately went on to the meeting between the Soviet leader and the leaders of seven major industrialized democracies to discuss Mr. Gorbachev's plans for economic liberalization and what the West can do to help. That is going to be the core issue in the coming era of Soviet-American relations. That is really what brought Mr. Gorbachev to London. That is why the Soviet leader wanted to get the arms treaty behind him.
 
A Different Soviet Union?
 Many American officials believe that the treaty could be the last nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, because by the time another major arms control accord is negotiated, the Soviet Union as it is now constituted, probably will no longer exist.
These officials feel that it will either be a smaller confederation of republics or a much looser confederation of independent republics, in which Moscow's ability to conclude sweeping nuclear and conventional arms control agreements with the United States will be greatly constricted.
This memorable day in United States-Soviet relations began at 9:30 A.M., when the telephone rang in Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's suite at the Churchill Hotel. It was the secretary of the Soviet Foreign Minister, Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, asking that Mr. Baker meet with Mr. Bessmertnykh for 15 minutes in Winfield House, the American Ambassador's residence, to share with him a "new position" the Soviets had come up with for resolving the last issue holding up the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
 
Definition of New Missile
 That issue was how to define what consitutes a nuclear missile's throw-weight. Throw-weight is critical to determining what will be considered a "new type" of missile under the treaty which, in turn, determines how many warheads could be deployed in a crisis.
Nine years of negotiations had failed to resolve this critical technical issue.
At 11:10 A.M. , according to American officials, Mr. Bush summoned his senior foreign policy advisers, including Mr. Baker and the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. The group sat around a white wrought-iron table in the backyard of Winfield House and went over their own "bottom line" position on the throw-weight issue and tried to guess what Mr. Bessmertnykh might come in with, a senior Administration official said.
At 11:40 A.M. Mr. Bessmertnykh arrived and laid out to Mr. Baker his country's new formula for settling the throw-weight issue, which was close to what the American side had been seeking. Mr. Baker told Mr. Bessmertnykh that he thought the Soviet proposal would probably be the basis for a "mutually satisfactory" solution.
 
Defusing Domestic Opposition
 The details of the Soviet proposal have not been disclosed, as each side has been anxious to cloud the issue of who gave the most at the end in order to avoid charges from their respective right-wing constituencies that they gave away too much to get a treaty.
One reason that Mr. Bessmertnykh was anxious to tie up the accord with Mr. Baker in Washington last week, he told American officials, was to avoid the appearance -- particularly in the eyes of the Soviet military -- that he and Mr. Gorbachev were trading the treaty for economic aid in London.
At 11:55 A.M., Mr. Baker walked back into the dining room in Winfield House and shared with Mr. Bush and Mr. Scowcroft the position outlined by Mr. Bessmertnykh, who was waiting in the hall. They agreed that this indeed was a basis for resolving the issue. Mr. Bush and Mr. Scowcroft then went out into the hall and confirmed with Mr. Bessmertnykh that as far as they were concerned the deal was done, pending final discussions with Mr. Gorbachev and pending a check with American arms control experts at home.
While Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev lunched around the American ambassador's dining table, American arms control experts in the Pentagon combed through the Soviet proposal and then telephoned Mr. Baker to tell him it met their concerns. Mr. Baker then slipped that message to the President. After Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev completed their lunch, to which both of their delegations were invited and which focused on economics, the two Presidents retired to a private living room alone -- save for interpreters -- and there, with a handshake, they confirmed the arms agreement.
Once the technical experts "signed off on it," Mr. Bush said later, "we got the thumbs up and we agreed that we had a deal."
Throw-weight is a formula that defines all those parts of the nuclear missile other than the booster rocket that sends it into space. The payload is essentially the missile nose cone, the guidance equipment that directs it to its target, as well as the individual nuclear warheads.
Under the treaty, the Soviet Union alone is committed to reducing the average throw-weight of all its missiles by 50 percent across the board. This is because the Soviets have many more of the heaviest, most lethal missiles, than the United States.
 
Shrinking Soviet Missiles
 As a result, since the beginning of the talks, the American side has tried to define throw-weight as broadly as possible -- as half the total launch weight of a missile -- since that would require Moscow to shrink its missiles that much more. The Soviets wanted to minimize the formula to spare their missiles -- especially some new ones they are now developing -- from being too sharply constricted by the treaty. In the end, they apparently somehow split the difference.
In addition, the throw-weight issue held up agreement on the treaty was because it was an essential ingredient in determining what would be defined as a "new type" of missile.
The treaty stipulates that each nuclear missile or bomber system will be allowed to carry a certain number of nuclear warheads. For instance, the Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missile, the SS-N-18, will be listed as carrying three nuclear warheads.
The treaty also says that neither side can test a missile with more warheads than it is listed as having in the treaty unless it is declared a "new type."
Once declared a "new type," the missile would be allowed to carry its own specific number of warheads, which would then be counted against the total number allowed for each side.
 
Counting Warheads
 This is important because if a missile listed by the treaty to be able to carry up to one warhead, for example, is slightly modified so that it can also carry three warheads both the modified missile and its old type would be automatically attributed as being able to carry three warheads. This is because the modification was so slight that in the event of a crisis, and one side wanted to break out of the treaty, it could easily quickly increase the number of warheads on that particular missile to three all across the board.
The only way for one side to avoid this problem and not have all of its existing missiles and their modified versions counted as carrying the same number of warheads, was if the modifications were more significant and therefore deemed more difficult to accomplish in any short period of time.
If, for instance, the throw-weight had to be changed significantly or the diameter of one of the rocket stages had to be expanded, then the missile would be declared a "new type," with its own specific number of warheads that applied only to it.
Therefore, Mr. Baker and Mr. Bessmertnykh spent a great deal of time wrangling over how significant must be the changes ina missile -- in its throw-weight and other dimensions -- to be declared a new type. They eventually agreed that it must have a 21 percent difference in throw-weight to be declared a new type, but they could not agree on what pieces of equipment should be counted as throw-weight.
This was akin to agreeing that a car's body had to be changed by 21 percent to be declared a new model car, but not being agree whether the body included the mirrors, the windows and the engine. The question was 21 percent of what? It was this "what" that the two leaders agreed on today, and in so doing brought nine years of negotiations to a close.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Bush's Faint Worries

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
With Desert Victory under his belt and a Start treaty on the verge, George Bush looks as if he might be able to walk rather than run to re-election next year. On Capitol Hill, however, troubles that now seem little bigger than a man's hand could blow into a political storm.
The most recent comfort for Mr. Bush was provided by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, who issued an optimistic economic forecast for 1992. A flourishing economy is virtually a prerequisite for Presidential re-election. 
 Mr. Greenspan said the recession was over and predicted a growth rate next year of 2 to 3 percent. That's slightly lower than the Administration wants but probably enough -- if such growth materializes -- to blunt Democratic economic criticisms.
One of the stronger potential opponents for Mr. Bush, meanwhile, was reported in The Washington Post to be about to announce that he would not run. Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, was not quoted; but the story said he had "indicated to friends" that he was "decisively leaning" against a campaign.
Mr. Gephardt's knowledgeable friends naturally left open the possibility that he might run. But these ectoplasmic confidants said he had polls showing Mr. Bush to be exceptionally strong, and feared defeat in 1992 would dim his chances for 1996.
Another of the usual suspects, Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, cast further doubt in a recent television interview that he would make a White House run next year. It's hard to see why he would, if he didn't in 1988.
That year, no incumbent President was running; next year, Mr. Bush will be a heavy favorite. Mr. Cuomo won overwhelming re-election in 1986, compared with his modest victory in 1990. Then, he had no debilitating problems in Albany to mar his record; this year, he has been constantly in acrimonious battle to close a huge budget shortfall.
He refused to enter in 1988, moreover, on grounds that he could not be Governor of New York and run for President at the same time. That's as true now as then, and more evident; and it would make little sense for Mr. Cuomo to resign a powerful office he already holds for another he might well not be able to take away from a strong incumbent.
That leaves Paul Tsongas, the former Senator from Massachusetts, as the only confessed Democratic Presidential candidate. Undoubtedly, more and stronger aspirants will enter later, but time's getting short to raise the necessary money and build the necessary organization. The longer Mr. Bush seems to have no strong opponent, the stronger he'll look himself, and the less eager any Democrat will be to take him on.
In Congress, however, more trouble may be brewing than now seems likely. Robert Gates, Mr. Bush's choice to be director of the C.I.A., has run afoul of plea-bargain stipulations by a former C.I.A. official. That reawakened interest in the Iran-contra scandal, which embarrassed the Reagan Administration and conceivably could threaten Mr. Bush.
The controlling Democrats now have delayed hearings on the Gates nomination until September -- which, for Mr. Bush, is getting uncomfortably close to his re-election year. And as Senator David Boren, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, pointed out, "No one can predict whether the nominee will be helped or hurt" by the delay. That goes for Mr. Bush too.
The Senate also has rejected White House attempts at a "compromise" on the Administration rule, recently upheld by the Rehnquist Court, that prevents federally financed clinics from giving clients information about abortion. As a result, Mr. Bush may be forced to carry out his threat to veto a bill to overturn the rule.
Such a veto might not be sustainable; the bill passed the House with 353 votes, enough for an override, and the compromise was rejected by 64 senators, just three short of two-thirds. But whether upheld or not, a Presidential veto would identify Mr. Bush more specifically than anything else he has done as a personal opponent of abortion rights -- an unwelcome development on the eve of his re-election campaign.
These concerns are only latent. But as Alan Greenspan conceded, despite his current optimism, recovery "could be muted or even falter" -- another way of saying that in the economy as in politics, anything can happen.

Yields Are Mixed on Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed for the week ended yesterday.
Bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds, were unchanged, at 5.25 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index. 
 Tax-exempt money fund yields took a moderate downturn for the week. The category remains under pressure by a supply-and-demand problem, which has lowered yields substantially. Portfolio managers in search of higher yields are now seeking longer maturities and the average number of days left to maturity in portfolios rose to 59, from 51 last week, analysts said.
 
Tax-Exempt Assets Fall
 Total assets of tax-exempt funds fell $1.4 million for the week ended yesterday, to $87.2 billion.
The seven-day average tax-exempt compounded yield was down 10 basis points, to 3.52 percent, with the simple yield down a similar amount, to 3.46 percent. During the same reporting period, the compounded and simple 30-day yields each fell by 5 basis points, to 3.75 percent and 3.68 percent, respectively.
For investors in the 28 percent tax bracket, the taxable equivalent for the current seven-day compounded yield is 4.88 percent, while the equivalent for investors in the 31 percent tax bracket is 5.1 percent.
Among the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's with assets of better than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market fund, which buys a fair amount of securities that for some investors may be subject to the Federal alternative minimum tax, continues to be the best performer for a string of 12 consecutive weeks. The fund is distributed by Strong/Cornelison Capital Managment Inc. Last week's return was 4.71 percent, down from 4.8 percent the previous week.
Assets of taxable funds fell by $1.3 billion, to a total of $451.3 billion.
Total assets of consumer funds remained unchanged, at $340.8 billion. Donoghue's analysts said they believed that last week's outflow from the funds was a seasonal factor and not related to interest rates, which are not expected to change significantly for a while.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield rose by a basis point, to 5.62 percent, and the seven-day simple yield was up a similar amount, to 5.47 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was unchanged at 5.63 percent: the 30-day simple yield was also unchanged, at 5.48 percent.

HEADLINE: California Stalemate Ends in a Budget

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 17

 BODY:
California's long stalemate over the largest budget gap ever faced by a state has ended with an unwieldy package of new taxes and cutbacks in a dramatic reversal of fortunes for a state that just three years ago was debating what to do with its surplus.
As a result, children must now pay taxes on candy, fees for the California State University system will rise by 20 percent, income taxes will go up for the very wealthy and for renters and the state will lay off large numbers of employees and cut back on services. 
 With only 16 minutes before a midnight deadline, the Legislature on Tuesday night reluctantly passed the last of $7.7 billion in tax increases needed to cover a $14.3 billion gap. Moments later, Gov. Pete Wilson signed the overall budget of $55.7 billion for the fiscal year that began July 1.
Thus, California avoids the kind of chaotic shutdown of services that occurred in Maine and Connecticut this month, but at a price that substantially raises the cost of living in what is already one of most expensive states at a time of recession.
 
Wilson Is Upbeat
 The potential political cost in the state that led the tax revolution 13 years ago can only be speculated on for now. Governor Wilson, a moderate Republican, now has the unwanted distinction of presiding over the largest tax increase in California history.
This morning, he put the best face on what he called "a very, very difficult budget" as Californians were grousing over confusing new levies that meant sales taxes on jellyrolls but not muffins, cheese puffs but not Saltine crackers, the latter in an almost metaphysical exercise in trying to tax "snacks" but not "foods."
"The bottom line," he told a news conference, "is that the Legislature and I, working together, have passed more reforms in one budget than all the cumulative reforms within recent memory."
The Legislature also agreed to Mr. Wilson's plan to reorganize California's environmental-enforcement programs. He signed papers today creating the California Environmental Protection Agency, a cabinet-level office brings under one unit the responsibility for air quality, toxic-substances control, pesticide regulation and environmental health-hazard assessment. These had previously been scattered throughout other agencies.
 
Reilly Watches Swearing In
 In the presence of William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, Mr. Wilson swore in the new California Secretary for Environmental Protection, James M. Strock, formerly with the E.P.A. in Washington.
The final budget package embodied only a few of the "structural" changes the Governor had demanded to control costs. To gain the cooperation of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, he retreated substantially on many priorities, like legislation pushed by business interests to reduce the number of stress-related claims under workers' compensation.
In the end, the budget was balanced by a combination of $7.7 billion in higher taxes, $5.1 billion in service cuts and various bookkeeping devices.
The new taxes include a 1.25 percentage point increase in the sales tax, which was also broadened to include snacks, newspapers and magazines; increases in vehicle registration fees; elimination of a renter's credit on income taxes for single persons earning more than $20,000 and couples earning more than $40,000 a year; and raising the state income tax rate from 9.3 percent to 10 percent for those earning more than $100,000 (or $200,000 for a couple filing jointly) and to 11 percent above $200,000 ($400,000 jointly.)
Fees for enrollment of state residents in the California State University system will increase by 20 percent in the fall, from $780 a year to $936. The Unversity of California system has increased its fees from 40 percent, from $1,624 to $2,724 a year.
 
Pain to Spread Around
 The cuts included a 4.4 percent reduction in welfare grants, along with elmination of cost-of-living increases for five years; reduction in contributions to state workers' retirement funds, and reductions for the state university systems that have meant a 40 percent increase in fees at many schools.
In all this, the Governor received scant support from his own party. In the final tax votes Tuesday night, only 9 of the 31 Republicans in the Assembly and 5 of the 13 Republicans in the Senate backed Mr. Wilson. Unlike almost all other states, budget matters require a two-thirds vote in both houses.
There was little enthusiasm from either party in the Legislature as the final pieces of the puzzle were jammed in. Many said the taxes were structured so that they would cause major new fiscal problems in three to five years.
"We never anticipated that we'd end up with a bill this bad from our own Republican Governor," said Kenneth L. Maddy of Fresno, the popular and influential Republican leader in the Senate. "This bill is in the tank in about the third year. We're in trouble."
 
'A Horrible Year'
 But Mr. Maddy said he would vote for it anyway. "What it comes down to is, we have only two hours left," he said. "This has been a horrible year. There's nothing we've done we've liked. I urge you to vote 'aye' so we can get out of here."
And over in the Assembly, it was also the Republicans who had the harshest words for the Republican Governor. Governor Wilson obtained a small concession from Democrats on workers' compensation, a provision that prevents stress claims during the first six months of employment, as part of his agreeing to increase income tax rates for those earning more than $100,000. Mr. Wilson had earlier vowed to veto any income tax increase.
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks, a staunch Republican foe of taxes, called the workers' compensation measure "a small fig to cover a very big tax increase."
"God help us if he ever sits across the table from the Russians in negotiations," Mr. McClintock said of the Governor.
 
'Windfall' for Business
 The Democrats were particularly incensed over the Governor's measure to aid businesses by extending a state law, due to expire Jan. 1, 1992, that allows a business to carry over losses in a bad year to future years to offset future profits when it comes to paying corporate income taxes.
The Governor's proposal, passed by the Legislature Tuesday night, prevents any use of this provision during the 1991-92 fiscal year. Therefore, it results in an estimated gain of $560 million this year, but $5.3 billion in tax losses from 1993 to 2000.
"Business is given an absolute windfall," complained Senator Daniel E. Boatwright, a Democrat from Concord, who said the bulk of the increases would be borne by lower and middle income people. "This recession does not automatically end today. You are going to face a budget crisis next year."
The added sales tax, according to the Senate Office of Research, will cost a family with an annual income of $49,900 an extra $218 a year, an increase of about 20 percent over the current $1,047. Also, the fee for registering a new car that cost $10,000 will rise to $200 from $170.
 
An Issue Is 'Elevated'
 By reviving the perennial issue of workers' compensation in the last two weeks, Governor Wilson risked upsetting the entire budget compromise. Business interests had demanded relief from what they consider excessive and fraudulent compensation claims for stress as a price for their agreeing to an income tax increase for the wealthy.
Mr. Wilson at first wanted to forbid such benefits unless the worker could prove that at least 50 percent of his psychological disability resulted from work, compared with the current standard of 10 percent.
The Democrats countered with a demand to eliminate a rule that they said unfairly guaranteed large profits for insurance companies by letting them add 33 percent of their overhead expenses to the premiums paid by employes. Ultimately, Mr. Wilson agreed to retain the 10 percent standard, but his press secretary, Bill Livingstone, said the debate at least "elevated the issue to the front pages," and that it would return later.
The entire budget package seemed near collapse Tuesday night in the Senate, where the first roll-call on the final package, for $2.3 billion in additional taxes, fell 10 votes short of the 27 needed. There followed nearly an hour of tense arm-twisting on the floor until one by one the 'aye' votes built up.
Finally, a call was placed to Senator William A. Craven, ill at home in Oceanside, near San Diego. He expressed his willingness to vote 'aye,' and one of his fellow Republicans who had voted no changed to 'aye' as a "courtesy" to Mr. Craven.
With that begrudging assent from his own party, the tax bill was sent downstairs to Governor Wilson, who signed it only eight minutes before midnight.

HEADLINE: High Rating For Weicker But Tax Goal Isn't Reached

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, July 17

 BODY:
The televised speech by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. on Tuesday night about the state budget crisis drew almost as many viewers as would typically watch "Entertainment Tonight," "Jeopardy" and "Hard Copy" combined, local television programmers said. It was a clear success in the ratings.
But the Governor's call for state residents to rise up and yell for the income tax, and thus avoid the no-income-tax budget being considered by the legislature, appeared to strike an ambivalent chord, at best. 
At WTNH (Channel 8) in New Haven, which pre-empted its top-rated "Jeopardy" game show for the 7:30 P.M. speech, the news department's switchboard began lighting up about 7:45.
 "The predominant feeling was anti-income tax," said the station's director of news operations, Larry Manne. "But people from all sides of the issue were calling just to vent."
 Around the state, Mr. Weicker's 15-minute address seemed to have stirred up emotions all over again on the issue of the income tax and the budget stalemate, which has now pushed the state 17 days into the new fiscal year without a permanent budget in place.
 Mr. Weicker, who proposed an income tax plan in February, spent much of the speech berating the legislature, which he characterized as "the gang that couldn't count straight." He said that unless residents rose up and made their voices heard in favor of the Governor's plan, the legislature's "sleight of hand" budget could take effect.
 The legislative budget would avoid the income tax and close the gap between the state's revenue and spending through a $1 billion package of increases in a variety of taxes. The 8 percent sales tax would be extended to previously exempt items and services like inexpensive clothing, car repairs and haircuts. The package also includes new taxes on residential mortgages and commercial leases.
 Mr. Weicker vetoed that plan on July 1, saying the tax increases would devastate the state's economy. But lawmakers in the weeks since have been unable to muster majorities for any budget based on an income tax in a form the Governor would approve. They have thus been meeting to move forward on a vote to override Mr. Weicker's veto and impose their budget over his objections. Late tonight, a preliminary count among House Democrats showed insufficient support for an override vote.
 A vote to override a veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and the Senate, and lawmakers said the margins would be close.
 "This is the same old Weicker," said Joseph Leavitt, a 32-year-old construction worker taking his lunch break on the town green in Fairfield. "He never bends. He digs in, the legislators dig in and the rest of us get buried in acrimony. Weicker has to pass a conventional budget and get on with it."
 "Weicker was trying to shake the tree in his speech," said Karen Daden, owner of Athena Photo, a film processing lab in Bridgeport. She supports the income tax, as long as it is coupled with business tax cuts proposed by Mr. Weicker. And she abhors the legislature's plan about as much as the Governor does. "Taxing everything won't get us out of this mess," she said.
 At the Capitol, few lawmakers seemed to be experiencing any new blizzard of pro-income tax calls, though some did report an increase in them. But several said Mr. Weicker's speech had put them on the defensive on the vote to override.
 
Sunet Provision
 Most agreed that the speech's central "compromise," to automatically end the income tax after two and a half years, was nothing new because the Governor had said months ago on several radio call-in programs that he would accept a sunset provision. "By throwing it onto the table, he looks like he's moderating," Senator George Jepsen, a Stamford Democrat, said. "It's a ball-in-your-court kind of thing."
 Mr. Weicker's office received 489 calls on the speech in just over eight hours today, with 331 calls in support and 158 calls in opposition.
 The Governor also said at a news conference today that he would not let up, even if "left in the dust" by a vote to override his veto, regardless of the public response. Lawmakers, he said, would be called back into session at the first sign that their plan was not raising enough revenue.
 "I am going to fight every step of the way," he said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment insurance rose slightly in the latest week, the Government said today, but economists said the overall employment picture continued to brighten.
The Labor Department reported that first-time applications for state unemployment benefits rose to 395,000 for the week that ended July 6, from 388,000 the previous week, when the number of claims was at a nine-month low. 
 The increase was the first since the week that ended June 8, when new claims rose by 47,000. But economists linked the latest increase to special factors tied to the start of the third quarter and said the figures did not change their outlook for a gradual improvement in the labor market and economy.
While the jobless claims figures jump from week to week, the four-week moving average, which tends to smooth out special factors, has continued to fall. In the latest report, the average fell to 409,250, from 422,500 in the prior four-week period.
"This is the ninth consecutive week the moving average has declined," said Douglas Schindewolf, economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. He also noted the average had fallen in 14 of the last 15 weeks.
The unemployment rate was at 7 percent in June, compared with 5.3 percent a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The Hidden Costs Of Mexico Plants

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
TO supporters of the proposed free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico, one of the primary benefits to American companies would be greater access to Mexico's low-wage work force. By moving some or all of their manufacturing and assembly operations to Mexico, the argument goes, companies could reduce their costs and become more competitive on a global basis, ultimately helping the economy in the United States.
To opponents of the proposal, any benefits would come at the cost of American jobs. They envision companies closing up in this country and rushing south of the border in search of inexpensive labor.
To George Baker, both sides are missing a key point. Mr. Baker, an economist who is a visiting scholar for the Program on Mexico at the University of California at Los Angeles, believes manufacturing in Mexico is not nearly so inexpensive or cost-efficient as the relatively low wage rate might make it seem.
Mr. Baker argues that looking only at direct labor costs -- the wages paid to workers by employers -- does not take into account many hidden costs of doing business in Mexico. By his accounting, actual labor rates in Mexico could exceed $15 an hour when ancillary costs are factored in, rather than the $1.50 an hour or less that opponents and supporters of the proposed accord presume.
"Companies are reacting prematurely in thinking they're going to cut labor costs by three-quarters," Mr. Baker said.
Officials of both countries began formal negotiations last month on the proposed agreement, which would eliminate almost all tariffs and other trade and investment barriers between the two nations. The talks also include Canada, which already has a free-trade agreement with the United States and would become part of a three-way agreement if a deal between Mexico and the United States is concluded. The proposed agreement is strongly supported by the Bush Administration and by President Carlos Salinas de ortari of Mexico.
Mexico is the United States' third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Japan. Many American companies, ranging from auto makers to electronics producers, are considering plants in Mexico if the agreement is completed.
They are interested both in getting better access to the Mexican market and in lowering their costs on products to be exported back to the United States or elsewhere. They would join nearly 1,800 American-owned maquiladora plants already operating in Mexico, employing half a million workers. Maquiladora plants are those owned by foreign companies. They enjoy lower trade barriers.
Gabriel Szekely, an economist at the Center for United States-Mexico Studies at the University of California at San Diego, said the problem of hidden costs in Mexico had long been of concern to American and other foreign companies considering opening plants there.
"The question is whether those hidden costs keep companies from moving to Mexico," he said. "The evidence is that they do not," Mr. Szekely said, noting the rapid growth in the number of maquiladora and other foreign operations in Mexico.
Still, Mr. Baker said, American companies need to understand that doing business in Mexico may be far more expensive than they expect.
Mr. Baker, who worked for two years for the NCR Corporation in Mexico during the mid-1980's and still consults for American companies with operations there, said moving an operation to Mexico involved considerable financial risk and costs that would be borne directly by the company and that should be considered part of the labor-cost equation, Mr. Baker said. They range from the costs of high employee turnover to inefficient mail service and a substandard telephone system, both of which decrease productivity, he said.
"Is it still cheaper to move to Mexico when you factor out social costs and include a risk factor?" Mr. Baker asked. "I'm trying to get U.S. manufacturing management to ask themselves that question."
Mr. Baker cites the example of a maquiladora plant in Chihuahua City, south of Texas. The plant, Mr. Baker said, claimed an employee turnover rate of 3 percent a month, relatively low at maquiladora plants. But even at that rate, nearly 800 of the company's 2,200 workers leave each year. It costs $333 to recruit and train a new worker, meaning the annual cost of employee turnover is $264,000.
Mr. Baker said there were other hidden costs at the maquiladora plant. The company pays the city for bus service for the workers and provides a subsidized cafeteria and on-site medical and dental care.
But those costs, Mr. Baker said, are only part of the story. "When you go into an area like this you have to apply a risk factor to reflect the fragility and inadequacy of the infrastructure," he said. "There are always unexpected delays and costs. Your budgets always have a shadow over them. You believe it will cost $100, but it could cost $300."

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Grows Slightly As Exports Remain Strong

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened slightly in May for the second straight month, the Government said today. But the $4.6 billion imbalance reflected strong exports and was the third-best showing in eight years.
The gap with Japan, long the largest segment of the deficit, narrowed to $2.4 billion for the month. The figure was the slimmest difference with Japan since a $1.8 billion gap in February 1984. In May, imports of Japanese cars dropped by $302 million from the previous month. 
 The Commerce Department report showed that the May imbalance was up 1.5 percent from a revised April gap of $4.5 billion. The April figure was originally reported at $4.6 million. The deficit had fallen to $4.1 billion in March, the lowest since it reached $3.96 billion in June 1983.
Exports in May were off nine-tenths of 1 percent, to $35.3 billion, but still posted their second-best showing on record after April's $35.6 billion pace. Imports totaled $39.9 billion, down six-tenths of 1 percent from the previous month and well below the $44.5 billion record set last October.
The Bush Administration and many private analysts look to exports to help pull the economy out of recession. Exports account for more than 16 percent of the United States economy and represented about 40 percent of its growth in 1990.
 
Strong Trade With Europe
 Some fear, however, that a weakening global economy will reduce foreigners' ability to purchase American goods. They also fear a stronger dollar, which makes American goods more expensive overseas.
But Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, cited the $1.3 billion surplus with Western Europe in May.
"Exports to Europe continue to lead the charge despite the recession in the United Kingdom and a slowing of European growth," he said.
Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington economic forecasting firm, agreed. "It's most impressive," he said. "Exports pretty much kept up their pace," despite the dollar and the world economy.
While the global economy may threaten exports, the weak United States economy apparently cut into American purchases of foreign-made goods. The sluggish economy "continues to hold imports down," Mr. Jasinowski said.
 
Under $100 Million for '91
 For the first five months of 1991, the overall deficit has been running at an annual rate of $62.5 billion, better than the $90 billion forecast by the Bush Administration earlier this year.
If the forecast proves true, it would be the first annual deficit under $100 billion since 1983. The trade deficit peaked at $152.1 billion in 1987 and totaled $101.7 billion last year.
Contributing to the slip in exports was an $800 million drop in capital goods exports, including $400 million in aircraft. Exports of consumer goods also fell. Exports of industrial supplies, motor vehicles and grain increased.
America's foreign oil bill rose 15.3 percent in May to $4.6 billion. The volume of oil imports was up 13.9 percent, while the price rose 15 cents, to $16.55 a barrel.
Also contributing to the decrease in imports were drops in purchases of capital and consumer goods and of motor vehicles, which fell $280 million over all.
 
Deficits With Taiwan, China
 In addition to its deficit with Japan, the United States ran an $800 million gap with Taiwan and a $700 million imbalance with China.
Some members of Congress are trying to force President Bush to remove China's most-favored-nation trade status until the country improves its human rights, trade and labor policies. Removing most-favored-nation status, would lift the prices of many Chinese goods, reducing United States imports. The trade deficit with China totals $3.6 billion so far this year.
In addition to Western Europe, the United States posted surpluses of $200 million with both Mexico and Egypt and $100 million with the Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
From Yale Days to Bank Lobbyist, a Friend and Adviser to the Bushes

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
At Yale, when George Bush was "Poppy" and Thomas William Ludlow Ashley was "Lud," they began their lifelong friendship.
When Mr. Bush began his first oil exploration company, Mr. Ashley was an investor. When the Bush children arrived, Mr. Ashley bounced them on his knees. And after George Bush became President and his son son Neil ran afoul of Federal regulatory agencies, Mr. Ashley was there with advice. 
 Mr. Ashley, 68 years old, an affable lobbyist and former Democratic Congressman from Toledo, Ohio, has been advising Mr. Bush since early 1989. That was shortly after the Office of Thrift Supervision began investigating what it said was Mr. Bush's "unsafe or unsound practices" as a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver. Silverado collapsed in December 1988, at a cost to the taxpayers estimated at $1 billion.
 
Coaching for Testimony
 Mr. Ashley, who is also a lawyer, coached the President's son before he testified before Federal investigators and the House Banking Committee, worked with Mr. Bush's lawyer to develop political and legal strategies, and even set up a legal defense fund to help him pay his expenses.
Mr. Ashley declines to discuss how much has been raised, by whom and from whom, other than that the contributions came from the Bush "family and close friends." Although he says that he manages the fund, he says the actual solicitations were made by others, whom he declines to name. The White House says that President and Mrs. Bush were not involved in setting up the fund and had made no contributions.
Mr. Ashley's expertise in guiding Neil Bush through his troubled times came through experience. He was a longtime member of the the House Banking Committee and is now president of the Association of Bank Holding Companies, which represents the nation's largest banks, including Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover and Morgan Guaranty.
 
Helped Bring a Light Penalty
 By all accounts, Mr. Ashley's tactics helped Neil Bush receive the lightest penalty that could have been imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The office merely ordered him to avoid future conflicts of interest in the banking industry. Mr. Ashley is also credited with helping settle a $200 million negligence suit against Mr. Bush and other Silverado directors in a manner that is not expected to bring Mr. Bush any significant out-of-pocket costs.
Did Mr. Ashley keep the President appraised of the progress of his son's cases? "He's entitled as a father to be kept informed," Mr. Ashley said, adding, "We're in regular touch."
Meanwhile, Mr. Ashley has been lobbying for the Bush Administration's bill, which he helped write, that would overhaul the banking system. Mr. Ashley is not unaware that some lobbyists resent his close relationship with the President. They say it gives him an edge not enjoyed by opponents of the Administration's bill, not to mention lobbyists for Medicaid recipients.
"Am I supposed to quarantine myself?" asked Mr. Ashley in a flat Midwestern voice laced with incredulity. "Of course some people have greater access than others. But I've known George Bush ever since college, and Neil Bush ever since he was a child."
 
Blurred Work-Social Lines
 Most lobbyists in Washington -- where blurred lines between social and professional life are an essential part of the fabric of work -- would mortgage their souls for Mr. Ashley's access. He not only maintains regular telephone contact with his college friend, Mr. Ashley said in an interview in his wood-paneled office with views of the Treasury, Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial, but also is an occasional guest at Bush family dinners at the White House; and he makes periodic visits to Camp David and the Bush family compound at Kennebunkport, Me.
The President has been known to invite his longtime friend, on short notice, to shmooze on topics ranging from Neil Bush to banking to politics and old times.
"People in Washington have a commonality of purpose," Mr. Ashley said. "It's just natural that your friends are people you've come in contact with professionally. Everybody has left home and hearth to come to Washington to pursue a purpose.
"Lobbying is part of bringing about change."
 
Small Banks Don't Like It
 Ed Yingling, head of government relations of the American Bankers Association, said, "Most people in the industry think it's good to have people who have access to those high places."
But the relationship between the lobbyist and the President troubles Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents small banks.
"What Lud brings to the White House, which the President has bought, is a very narrow approach benefiting a narrow constituency," Mr. Guenther said. "He has been a brilliant, successful lobbyist, to the detriment of the existing financial and economic structure of the United States.
"Since Lud has this very special relationship with the President," Mr. Gunther said, "we have to build broad Main Street coalitions to try to undo what the Bush-Ashley relationship has done."
"This century started with Teddy Roosevelt and his trust busters, and ends with President Bush working with his good friend Lud Ashley putting these same trusts back together."
Mr. Ashley insists that he has the President's ear on banking matters not simply because they are old friends but because they think alike on business and financial issues, and because Mr. Ashley represents a constituency that warrants respect no matter who is in the White House.
As to Mr. Guenther's assertions, he responds with a skilled smoothness. "One has to appreciate that Ken represents the smaller, independent community bankers," Mr. Ashley says. "He uses lovely purple language, but we aren't putting trusts back together, we're lifting 50-year-old restrictions that have strangled the industry.
"The fact is that the Texas banks have disappeared from the scene because they didn't have any outreach," he said. "Interstate banking has become a reality."
As for banking legislation, he said: "I'm in touch with the President on banking matters, but I'm also in touch with the Secretary of the Treasury. The Treasury people talk to me, not because I'm a pal of the President, but because I'm president of an association whose members represent 70 percent of the bank assets in this country."
And as for his help to Neil Bush, Mr. Ashley disputes those who lay it to the old school tie connection.
At a session with Federal regulators in December 1989, documents show, Neil Bush said that Mr. Ashley initially got in touch with him at "dad's request."
But Mr. Ashley insists that Mr. Bush's memory was faulty. "I called Neil," Mr. Ashley said. "Neil needed help. I said that I was available for advice and counsel, and I thought he was going to need some."
 
Liberal Democrat in House
 As an old hand in the capital, Mr. Ashley knew the territory. As a liberal Democrat who spent 13 terms in the House before his constitutents decided in the 1980 election that he had become more of a Washingtonian than an Ohian, Mr. Ashley had been chairman of a special committee that coordinated House action on President Jimmy Carter's energy legislation, played a leading role in persuading the House to provide funds to fiscally stricken New York City and championed subsidized housing.
It was part of the background that made him uniquely qualified to steer Mr. Bush through the treacherous shoals of bank regulatory agencies.
He recalled the summer of 1990, when Neil Bush had invited journalists to Denver to give his side of the story. "I told him, 'you can keep on talking to the press, or you can keep your (expletive deleted) mouth shut," Mr. Ashley said, making it clear that he had strongly urged the latter course, which prevailed.
 
'The Wisdom of His Age'
 When Mr. Bush testified before Mr. Ashley's former colleagues on the House Banking Committee, which was making political hay by investigating the son of the President, Mr. Ashley, who had coached him on his testimony, was in the audience.
Throughout, Mr. Ashley remained in contact with Jim Nesland, Mr. Bush's principal lawyer. "He gave me his input with respect to the overall political issues that were created primarily during the period of time that the House Banking committee was looking into this," Mr. Nesland said. "He has the wisdom of his age, and of somebody inside the Beltway, which is especially valuable to somebody far away and as young and inexperienced in politics as Neil and me."
Mr. Ashley said that he and the President were aware that their friendship could be misinterpreted.
"I wouldn't dishonor this friendship by mistreating it," Mr. Ashley said. "We are careful."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Issues Up a Bit in a Quiet Day

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in dull, thin trading yesterday.
The strongest activity took place late in the session, after the Federal Reserve Board reported that a key monetary aggregate posted a larger than expected decline of $6.9 billion during the week ended July 8. 
 Aside from the money numbers, credit market participants said the day's developments provided little reason to establish or liquidate positions.
"This was an absolutely typical summer day," one government bond trader said.
An increase in initial unemployment claims for the week ended July 6, the first weekly rise in nearly a month, provided a brief lift early, but prices later retreated.
Similarly, traders were unmoved by a widening in the nation's trade deficit or the decline in the dollar against most currencies, and a further slide in commodity prices. At other times, those factors might have spurred trading activity.
"The weakness in commodity prices should offer some support for bonds," said Ward McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. "But it hasn't really happened, even though in recent weeks the weakness has spread from agricultural to industrial commodities."
 
Decline in Money Supply
 In its weekly money supply report, the Fed reported that two of the three monetary aggregates it tracks declined during the week ended July 8. M-3, the broadest aggregate, rose by $300 million.
Analysts said the sharp $6.9 billion decline in M-2, the aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, was a source of concern. The drop was the third in succession, and placed M-2's growth since the fourth quarter at 3.1 percent, in the lower portion of the Fed's 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent target growth range for the year.
"One would think this would concern the Fed," said Wayne Smith, an economist at Reid Thunberg & Company, an investment advisory firm in Westport, Conn.
Given the declines in M-2 in the last three weeks, Mr. Smith said there was not likely to be any growth in M-2 in July. Sluggish money growth is another factor that could retard the pace of recovery, he added.
"Before last week, I was saying that if you had M-2 growth at 4 percent for the year, you conceivably could get about 1 percent real growth in gross national product for the year," he said. "As M-2 growth continues to slow, I am starting to question whether or not that will be the case."
M-2 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking acounts and non-bank traveler's checks plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds.
 
Fed Move Doubted
 Mr. Smith and other analysts said the money supply numbers made it increasingly unlikely that the Fed would move to tighten credit. That view was reflected in prices of short-term maturities.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at a price of 100 9/ 32, up 3/32, to yield 6.84 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 5.58 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday. Six-month bill rates fell by a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 5.71 percent. And one-year bill rates dipped by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 5.89 percent.
Among longer-dated Treasury maturities, the 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at 96 6/32, up 5/ 32, to yield 8.47 percent, down from a yield of 8.49 percent late Wednesday. And the 8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 18/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 8.27 percent.
A number of new long-term issues were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including $300 million worth of 30-year debentures for the UAL Corporation.
The 10 1/4 percent securities, which mature July 15, 2021, were priced at $99.134, to yield 10.343 percent, 1.85 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent 30-year bonds at the time of pricing.
The First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Baa-2 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
Goldman, Sachs & Company acted as lead manager on an offering of $250 million worth of 30-year debentures for the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The 9.45 percent debentures, which mature Aug. 1, 2021, were priced at $99.875, to yield 9.462 percent, 97 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing. The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and AA-minus by S.& P.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said prices of most issues were unchanged in light trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said prices of most actively quoted securities were unchanged to down about 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Weakened Kohl Frustrated by Summit Colleagues

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, July 18

 BODY:
For Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, who only a year ago seemed to be emerging as Europe's most powerful leader, the summit meeting here this week was a rude lesson in how quickly the world balance can change.
At the 1990 summit talks in Houston, Mr. Kohl was welcomed as the leader of a mighty nation on the brink of unification and superpower status. This year, he found himself much weakened and unable to win support for his most cherished proposals, chief among them a plan for vast Western aid for the Soviet Union. 
 Mr. Kohl's loss of power and status reflects his own deepening problems at home, but also the renewed strength of the United States. The London summit meeting made clear that, largely as a result of its success in the Persian Gulf war, the United States has recaptured the dominant world role that some thought it had lost.
In the 19 months since the Berlin wall fell, Mr. Kohl has become President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's strongest political ally. In that period, according to figures released by the German delegation here, Germany has provided 40 percent of the foreign aid sent to the Soviet Union and the nations of Eastern Europe. Japan and the United States were said to have provided less than 7 percent each.
 
Kohl's Diminishing Position
 "The balance is just not right," Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann said this week.
But there was no suggestion at the London summit talks that either Japanese or American officials share the German view. Chancellor Kohl realized several months ago that he was no longer in a position to press other leaders into approving a vast aid program for the Soviets. At the summit meeting, he confined himself to seeking more limited help.
But even those efforts proved less than successful. The world leaders who met here agreed to give the Soviets an undefined "special status" in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, but refused to commit themselves to giving the Soviets full membership at some future point, as Mr. Kohl had urged. Nor would the other leaders accept Mr. Kohl's proposal that the Soviets be offered new credits from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
The other area in which Mr. Kohl had hoped for greater support was protection of the global environment. He failed to win clear financial support for a German-backed pilot program intended to protect rain forests in Brazil. His plea for new actions to protect the earth's ozone layer also fell on deaf ears.
 
Slumping German Economy
 Commentaries in the German press today portrayed the London summit conference as a difficult moment for Mr. Kohl. The economic newspaper Handelsblatt called the summit meeting "anything but a success" for him, and asserted that his appeals on behalf of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had been greeted with "icy silence."
Next year's economic summit meeting will be held in Germany, and Mr. Kohl hopes to be in a position to press his views more forcefully there. But the aura of glory and success that surrounded him during the heady days of German unification appears to have faded.
Germany's economy, though still the strongest in Europe, is slumping under the burden of vast expenditures needed to rebuild the eastern part of the country. Mr. Kohl's personal popularity has been falling steadily, and his Christian Democratic Union has lost a series of local elections.
 
Fear of Total Soviet Collapse
 Over the last year, Mr. Kohl's Government has expended great amounts of money and effort trying to raise the former East Germany up from ruin. Aides say the Chancellor thinks that experience has given him a special understanding of how difficult it is to rebuild nations that lived for decades under Communism. That belief, as well as his unusually close political friendship with Mr. Gorbachev, has made Mr. Kohl the strongest and most vocal advocate of Western help for the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.
German leaders have been candid about their reasons for supporting Soviet appeals for Western help.
First and foremost, Germans recognize that without Mr. Gorbachev's assent, their nation could not have been unified last year. Second, they are acutely aware that 300,000 Soviet troops remain on German soil, and are eager for them to be withdrawn by 1994 as Mr. Gorbachev has promised. Third, they feel a lingering sense of guilt over Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union 50 years ago.
Finally, the Germans fear what would happen to their own country if the Soviet Union collapsed. At the very least, hundreds of thousands of Soviet refugees would pour across their borders. It is cheaper, they reason, to aid Soviet citizens in the Soviet Union than to wait until they flood into Germany.
At the London summit meeting, it appeared that the French and Italian leaders shared some of Mr. Kohl's sense of urgency. But they were easily outweighed by other leaders, especially President Bush, who say the Soviets have not made enough political and economic reforms to justify a major infusion of aid.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark But Gains in Yen Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed lower against the German mark yesterday, still recoiling from last week's concerted central bank intervention.
The dollar ended at 1.7745 German marks, down from Wednesday's close of 1.7910 marks. It closed at 137.65 Japanese yen, up from Wednesday's finish of 136.95 yen. 
 Last Friday, concerted dollar-selling by 15 central banks discouraged players from buying dollars. Since traders could not make money buying the United States currency, they decided to try selling it, said Bob Hatcher of Barclays Bank.
The dollar's fall through 1.7850 marks prompted stop-loss selling during European trading that accelerated the descent, dealers said. The dollar reached a low of 1.7650 marks in early United States trading before it recovered.
"The key question is whether that support at 1.7650 came from profit taking by speculators or real demand for dollars," Mr. Hatcher said.
The main issue now is whether a lower dollar will attract corporate players and investors to buy, he added.
Dealers said the currency market ignored the May trade data released yesterday. The Government reported that the deficit widened slightly to $4.6 billion in May from a revised $4.5 billion in April. Economists on average had forecast a $4.9 billion gap for May.
The Canadian dollar went into a tailspin after charges of fraud and obstruction of justice were brought by a private citizen against 16 high-level Canadian officials. The individual charged that Conservative politicians had asked for kickbacks on Government contracts.
The United States dollar ended at 1.1580 Canadian dollars, compared with 1.1480 on Wednesday. The Bank of Canada intervened to stem the decline.
The British pound closed at $1.6655, up from $1.6495 on Wednesday. The dollar ended at 1.5400 Swiss francs, compared with 1.5555 Wednesday. The dollar also closed at 6.0230 French francs, down from 6.0770 francs Wednesday.
Gold for August delivery rose 40 cents, to $370.90 an ounce, on New York's Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: In an Age of Bland Politics, Eccentricity Lives On in Louisiana

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BATON ROUGE, La.

 BODY:
For years, people have been predicting that Louisiana's political culture would one day become as bland and predictable as the sound-bite politics practiced everywhere else. But for better or worse, this is shaping up as yet another vintage year for Louisiana's reputation as a place where politics and theater seamlessly blend and where the past is never quite gone.
There has been talk of exhuming the remains of Huey P. Long's assassin. The Legislature is studying the idea of allowing New Orleans to secede from Louisiana. For months the political system, and now the legal system, have been convulsed by debate over the nation's most restrictive abortion law. 
 Still to come is a governor's race among a former Governor, Edwin W. Edwards; the current Governor, Buddy Roemer; a former Klansman, David Duke, and a cast of thousands. It is a campaign that is shaping up as a cross between "All the King's Men" and "The Gong Show."
Some say too much is made of Louisiana's reputation for outlandish politics.
 
A Place Apart
 "I don't think our politics are as colorful or as nasty and despicable as some outsiders would have you think," said Mr. Edwards, who is considered Louisiana's most influential politician since Mr. Long and is often cited as Exhibit A in the case for Louisiana as a place apart. "We never had three transvestites go on television and say they had sex with the Democratic candidate the way they did in Mississippi a few years back."
But the best description of Louisiana politics may still have come from the writer A. J. Liebling, who described Louisiana in the 1950's as "the westernmost of the Arab states" and said the state's politics were "of an intensity and complexity that are matched, in my experience, only in the Republic of Lebanon."
The result can be wildly contradictory. Thus, a state with a well-deserved reputation for a live-and-let-live ethos finds itself in the national spotlight over a restrictive abortion law. But if simple categorizations are hard to find, there is no shortage of explanations for the peculiarities of what Liebling, using the South Louisiana pronunciation, liked to call "the Gret Stet of Loosiana" or "the Gret Stet" for short.
Explanation No. 1 begins with the state's origins in French and Spanish rather than Anglo-Saxon explorations and the distinctive political and legal traditions that emerged from it.
"If you go back to 1811 and and 1812 and read the arguments about Louisiana becoming a state, there was a great argument in the House that they couldn't possibly allow that to occur because those foreigners would never make good Americans," said former Representative Lindy Boggs of New Orleans.
Explanation No. 2 goes back to the state's historic reliance on oil companies to pay the tax bills, leading to a political system in which no one got too upset about routine corruption.
"Up until 15 years ago, Louisiana had a government that was funded by the oil companies, not the people of the state," said Wayne Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State University. "So the government and the politicians could be less accountable. It wasn't Louisiana's money. It was Texaco's money. So what if they were playing around with it?"
Explanation No. 3 starts with the state's Balkanized population, roughly one-third black, one-third Cajun and one-third Bible Belt Baptist. There is distrust between Protestant northern Louisiana and Catholic southern Louisiana. There is distrust beween blacks and whites. And there is distrust between New Orleans and everyone else.
"We don't have a dominant ethnic majority in this state," said John Maginnis, editor of The Louisiana Political Review. "It makes a big difference. You can't really shoot for the middle. You have to figure out how to play the angles, the way Edwin Edwards does in putting the blacks and the Cajuns together."
Explanation No. 4 is the personality cult that has dominated Louisiana politics ever since Huey Long gained sole control of state government from his election as governor in 1928 until his assassination in 1935 in the State Capitol he built.
Worthy heirs to his notoriety, if not always his populist politics, have been Gov. Jimmie H. Davis, best known for warbling country ballads like his own "You Are My Sunshine"; Long's brother Earl, who spent part of his tenure as governor in a Texas mental institution, and Mr. Edwards, Louisiana's only three-term Governor and the only Cajun governor since Reconstruction, who was tried twice but never convicted of Federal fraud charges.
 
An 'Out of Step' System
 Also figured in is a decade of economic decline that has added an overlay of frustration and one of the lowest levels of educational achievement in the nation.
"All those things come together to create a political system that's just kind of out of step with everyone else," said Joe Walker, a political poll taker in New Orleans.
If Mr. Roemer, and his no-fun reformer's sensibilities, constitute an argument that the old era is ending, the governor's race figures to be Louisiana politics in its unadulterated form -- "The race from hell," in Mr. Maginnis's words.
The four main contenders are likely to be Mr. Roemer; Mr. Edwards; David Duke, a current State Representative and former Ku Klux Klan leader, and Clyde C. Holloway, a conservative who is strong supporter of the anti-abortion law. After Mr. Roemer switched from the Democrats to the Republicans, amid much rejoicing in the White House, Louisiana Republicans turned around and instead nominated Mr. Holloway for Governor.
Under Louisiana's unusual open primary, Mr. Roemer can run anyway. Candidates compete regardless of party designation in the Oct. 19 primary. If no one gets 50 percent of the vote, the two top finishers meet in a runoff on Election Day.
Like character actors in a soap opera, the supporting cast includes Kathleen Blanco, the Public Service Commissioner, and one of the few high-ranking women in state government; Fred Dent, a former state banking commissioner who is partial to seersucker suits and red suspenders a la Earl Long in the movie "Blaze," and Sam Jones, the Mayor of the small south Louisiana town of Franklin, who bills himself as the only candidate willing to take on Mr. Duke and is fond of saying the only difference between him and Mr. Duke is that "I've never had plastic surgery, I don't hate anybody and I work for a living."
 
Politics as Entertainment
 There is much to like in the state's traditions. Mr. Duke notwithstanding, Louisiana has less of a history of racial politics than most Southern states. Moreover, the entertainment value and populist tradition have kept interest in politics at a higher level than in most places in the country.
Mr. Jones, a 38-year-old former sheriff's deputy, will be lucky to get 5 percent of the vote, but when he checks at what's called the Little City Hall behind Oray Rogers' Radio Shack store in Franklin or the 2 O'Clock Coffee Club at the Holiday Inn in Morgan City there is no shortage of advice on how to hit the big time.
"People want a man who says I'm going to give you this, I'm going to give you this, I'm going to give you that," Nina Guzetta told Mr. Jones as they walked from the Holiday Inn. "That's what Huey Long did and what Earl Long did. You need to get on television and tell people you're going to take the tolls off the damn bridges."
But much has changed from the days of the Longs. Oil no longer pays all the bills, so there is less tolerance for corruption or spare change for Long-style state spending. The economic and environmental problems are so serious, that the fun and games often have a hollow ring. Mr. Maginnis says the Legislature has gradually become more responsible over time and campaign finance reforms pushed through by Mr. Roemer threaten to change state politics by making money harder to raise, adding to the power of incumbents.
 
No Money, No Fun
 "My theory is that Buddy Roemer is the death of Louisiana politics," Mr. Maginnis said. "He's wringing the money out of it. He's taking the fun out of it. We didn't realize that was part of the bargain."
And some say that although Louisiana maintains a surface eccentricity, its politics now diverge from the nation's more in style than in content, with an ugly undercurrent of race and a total inability to come to grips with festering economic, social and educational problems.
Still, if politics gets depressing, people in Louisiana can always take solace in the church. Testimony has begun in New Orleans in the $90 million libel suit between the rival preachers Marvin Gorman and Jimmy Swaggart, with its expected allegations of adultery, exorcism and other diversions.

Chart: "Kingfish & Company"
 
Memorable politicians from Louisiana's past.
 
Huey Pierce Long/1893-1935
The Napoleon of Louisiana politics. As Governor from 1928-32, came close to absolute power over the state. His projects to pave roads, control flooding and eradicate illiteracy earned him a reputation as a man of the people. His administration was accused of bribery and misapppropriation of funds, and he was threatened more than once with impeachment. "The Kingfish" moved on to the United States Senate and was planning to run for President, when he was assasinated in Baton Rouge at the height of his power, apparently by the son-in-law of an enemy.
 
Richard Webster Leche/1898-1965
A Huey Long protege who took over his political machine and became Governor in 1936. Better remembered for his time in prison than in office. Resigned in 1939 in a scandal involving graft, corruption and misuse of public funds. Convicted of mail fraud, sentenced to 10 years, released in 1943. Operated Bayou Gardens, a tourist attraction, until returning to practice law after an official pardon from President Harry S. Truman.
 
Earl Kemp Long/1895-1960
Governor 1939-40, 1948-52 and 1956-60. Brother of Huey, and an heir to his populist legacy: he raised spending for welfare and education, and abolished the Civil Service system. In his final term he had a mental breakdown, chronicled in the Paul Newman movie "Blaze"; his wife had him committed to the state hospital for the insane, but he used his power as governor to replace the director with a doctor who signed his release. Died of a heart attack 10 days after his election to the House of Representatives.
 
Sam Houston Jones/1897-1978
Governor 1940-44; in his first 60 days in office, he dismantled the extraordinary powers built by Huey Long and his political heirs. Increased social welfare payments 80 percent, teachers' salaries 30 percent and state aid to public schools 50 percent, yet slashed the cost of state government, leaving a $15 million surplus in the treasury.
 
James Houston Davis/1902-
 The singing Governor (1944-48 and 1960-64). A schoolteacher who began singing on a Shreveport radio station in 1938, he collaborated on "You Are My Sunshine," among other songs. May be the only governor who is also a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.
 
Russell. B Long/1918-
United States Senator, 1948-86. Son of Huey Long and heir to his father's name, reputation and valuable oil royalties. As longtime chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, an invincible supporter of the oil and gas industry; creator of the voluntary tax checkoff that finances Presidential campaigns and the earned income tax credit, which benefits the working poor.

HEADLINE: Search Is Long and Grim for Canada's Jobless

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, July 18

 BODY:
The lines start forming on the sidewalk well before the Danforth Toronto East unemployment center opens.
Bill Goller, who arrived in Canada three months ago from Lima, Peru, with his wife and two children, is one of the early risers. He has taken the train, bus and subway from the industrial suburb of Scarborough. 
 Bruce Caldwell, a former night worker in a candy company who was laid off 10 months ago, is also in line.
They are two of the 527,000 unemployed people in Ontario. The number has risen by 90 percent over the last year as Canada has experienced what is already at least the second worst economic slump since the Great Depression of the 1930's.
For the nation as a whole, joblessness is at 10.5 percent of the work force, 3.4 percentage points above the rate in the United States.
 
Despair Is Real
 The numbers resound here in anger, despair, loss of self-confidence, the atrophy of skills.
To survive, Mr. Caldwell lives at home with his parents on welfare checks of $240 a month. "It affects me really hard," he said. "The people who don't have it are down a couple of notches. It keeps you in your place."
Mr. Goller and Mr. Caldwell are in their early 40's and looking for work as general laborers. Mr. Goller had been a telephone exchange supervisor in Lima, but knows that that kind of work is unlikely here.
What brings them to the Danforth center, as opposed to the 17 other offices in Toronto, are the 10 computerized black boxes known as job banks, installed in January as part of a federal pilot program for speeding job information to the jobless.
Mr. Goller, Mr. Caldwell and hundreds of other men and women will hunch over the machines like gamblers in front of slot machines, pushing buttons in response to personal questions from the computer. For those who press the right buttons, job data is printed out with instructions on whom to call and the phone numbers.
 
Jostling Around Job Boards
 At the other centers, job notices are on bulletin boards, around which workers jostle each other to take notes. Moreover, Mr. Caldwell said, the posted notices "tend to disappear."
On a recent morning, the number of job opportunities in the system was only 2,100, said Charles M. Salonia, acting manager of the Danforth center. The new jobs just added totaled 127.
Only about 20 percent of the total jobs available go through the federal job placement machinery, and those tend to pay lower wages. For higher paying jobs, many employers use private agencies, or just word of mouth.
But for Toronto, with nearly 3 million inhabitants, the numbers, however stretched, are pitifully small.
Canada's basic economic statistics have recently turned upward. Lower mortgage rates pushed up home sales in June for the fourth straight month. Exports are stronger. In London during the summit meeting of industrialized democracies, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said, "We've had a tough recession in Canada, but we seem to be out of it now."
But at no unemployment office in Toronto, Canada's largest city, is there any sign of economic recovery. The Ontario Federation of Labor has counted 250,000 jobs in the province that it says are gone forever.
To Mr. Salonia and his deputies, the key to re-employment is now retraining.
The Danforth center expects to process 27,000 unemployment claims this year. They entitle workers to a maximum of $408 a week, usually for up to 30 weeks, after which they go on welfare. The center has its own retraining specialists, who are seeking more bookkeepers and data-entry operators.
Mr. Salonia is a product of retraining. A former floor trader on the Toronto Stock Exchange, he found himself on the street after a market crisis.
Like those in line, he went to one of the Canada employment centers.
"They told me they were looking for people like me to train as employment counselors," he said. "I grabbed the opportunity."

HEADLINE: 2d-Quarter Earnings Down At Nynex and BellSouth

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Two of the nation's seven regional phone companies, Nynex and BellSouth, said today that their profits declined in the second quarter.
Nynex earnings fell 3.3 percent from the comparable quarter last year and BellSouth net income dropped 17.9 percent. 
 Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
Nynex
 The Nynex Corporation said it earned $290.8 million, or $1.44 a share, in the second quarter, down from $300.6 million, or $1.52 a share, a year earlier.
Revenue totaled $3.36 billion, off 2.4 percent from $3.44 billion.
Results from the period a year ago included charges for an early-retirement program and other one-time events that reduced profit. Without the charges, the profit a year ago would have been $332.3 million, or $1.68 a share, and the decline in profit in the most recent quarter would have been steeper.
Nynex, owner of the New York Telephone Company and the New England Telephone Company, blamed the economy and an increase in interest costs for its profit drop.
Nynex shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose $1.50 yesterday to close at $73.
 
BellSouth
 The BellSouth Corporation, the Atlanta-based telecommunicatins giant, blamed regulatory activity, the recession and increased competition for lower earnings in the second quarter.
The company reported net income of $365.3 million, or 76 cents a share, down from $445.2 million, or 92 cents a share, in the corresponding period of 1990.
Revenue totaled $3.58 billion, down marginally from $3.62 billion.
John L. Clendenin, company chairman, said the same factors that influenced earnings so far this year appear to be in place for the rest of 1991.
"We remain on course for the long term, however, with a good cash flow, a healthy balance sheet and a leaner, more efficient operating structure," he said.
Mr. Clendenin said that the company plans to merge its telephone operating units -- Southern Bell and South Central Bell -- next year in an effort to streamline them. BellSouth has already combined its cellular units into one operation.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock fell 12.5 cents, to $47 a share.

HEADLINE: Texas Lawmakers Confront School Financing Issue Anew

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
After two decades of courtroom skirmishes over the financing of public schools, the Texas Legislature last spring finally produced a new formula intended to end the disparity in wealth between school districts.
But now the Legislature has been called into special session to confront more problems with the plan. This time, it is at odds with itself over how best to raise the money. 
 The effort in Texas, whose years of attempting to overhaul an outdated school finance formula have attracted national attention, is certain to be difficult. The plan will cost the state an additional $1.6 billion for the two-year period starting Sept. 1, yet Gov. Ann W. Richards and most other state officials oppose the creation of personal and corporate income taxes to support it.
And a group of prosperous school districts has filed suit against the state, calling the new plan a "Robin Hood" approach that skims property tax revenue from rich districts and gives it to poor ones.
 
Strains in Other States

In many ways, Texas reflects the difficult straits in which other states find themselves.
In Mississippi, another state where efforts at restructuring education have attracted national attention, the legislature similarly failed for a second time, in regular session this spring, to raise $150 million to support higher spending for more education programs.
New Jersey, which was forced by state courts to overhaul its school finance formula, is now back in court. In the new suit, critics maintain that the plan's redistribution of state money did not remedy the problem of disparate spending between rich districts and poor ones. A ruling is expected by late fall, school finance experts said.
All told, the school finance formulas of 19 states are at various stages of litigation, and prospects look dim, given the sour economic climate, that any of the states will be able to revamp school finance formulas without raising some taxes, school finance experts said.
Kentucky, however, remains an exception. That state's education overhaul and financing package, ordered by the state Supreme Court, is now entering its second year. Even though it resulted in higher state personal and corporate taxes, the Kentucky plan also required the participation of teachers, parents and politicians, and many say that is why it is proceeding reasonably smoothly.
"Kentucky worked because everyone felt like thay had a stake in its success," said Mary Fulton, a school finance analyst with the Education Commission of the States, a Denver policy research organization representing governors, legislators and state education officials. "When you have a Robin Hood approach like Texas, it leaves a sour taste in some people's mouths."
 
Headaches in Texas

Indeed, the plan approved by the Texas Legislature last March has created nothing but headaches for virtually everyone involved. Under the plan, the state created 183 education districts closely following county lines. Property tax revenue from all school districts within each education district is to be pooled, with poorer districts getting more money than they had previously and rich school districts actually losing some of their own tax revenue.
The plan also calls for more state aid to school districts overall, and the Legislature this spring was bitterly divided over how to best raise the $1.6 billion cost of the package. In the current special session, which began Monday, that problem is expected to be just as serious, given officials' opposition to adopting state personal and corporate income taxes.
Gov. Richards has repeatedly voiced opposition to both, and has said the money for the financing plan can be raised through spending cuts and consolidation of overlapping state agencies and services. That, the governor said through a spokesman, Bill Cryer, must occur before she will consider exploring additional revenue sources.
She would be happy to institute a state lottery, as well. But many religious groups in Texas oppose lotteries, and the Legislature defeated a proposal for one in its last session.
"School funding is going to be a down-to-the-wire issue," said Al Kauffman, a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which sued the state 23 years ago to repair the disparities in per-student spending between rich and poor school districts. "It's not going to be easy."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
A Marketing Expert To Run Laura Ashley

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
What does a former automobile and electronics salesman know about selling flowered frocks and perfumed potpourri?
"I know what a consumer is," says Jim Maxmin, 48 years old and the new chief executive of Laura Ashley Holdings, the beleaguered purveyor of genteel household furnishings, toiletries and clothing that evoke the style of an English country manor house. 
 Mr. Maxmin, an expatriate American who has lived in Britain since 1964, learned the marketing business selling soap door to door in London's East End. "That's tough -- every sale was a hard one," he recalled.
Reviving Laura Ashley could be equally tough. The company posted pretax losses of $11 million for its 1990 fiscal year ended Jan. 26, compared with a loss of $7.2 million the previous year. And it has laid off a fifth of its work force and closed seven factories in Britain and Ireland. The company blamed poor exchange rates, the recession and high inflation, but retailing analysts said it needed to update its image.
"Young women under 35 who have been working out and sweating buckets to slip into cat suits are not about to start wearing granny-length dresses in floral prints," said Alan G. Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report, a fashion and retail trade newsletter.
Mr. Maxmin disagreed, saying most Laura Ashley customers have remained loyal and introduced their daughters to the company. "That's the essence of niche marketing," he said. "You're not trying to reach everyone."
Nonetheless, Mr. Maxmin said his task was to protect the brand name and image while making sure consumers understand that every item in the Laura Ashley collection "doesn't have flowers on it."
He acknowledged that the company had had difficulty in its transition from a family-run business to a specialty retail chain of more than 500 company-owned stores and 200 franchised stores manned by more than 7,000 employees in 24 countries. Most of the stock is held by the family. A Japanese supermarket operator, the Jusco Company, holds a 15 percent stake.
Mr. Maxmin's strategy involves expanding business in Asia and Europe, increasing advertising and enhancing or adding products to attract new customers.
Mr. Maxmin started in retailing with Unilever and in 1973 joined Volvo Concessionaires U.K., rising through the ranks to become chief executive of the British subsidiary and later joint chairman. A decade later he joined Thorn-EMI P.L.C. as chief executive of television rentals. He was named president of Thorn in 1988 and led its $600 million acquisition of Rent-A-Center Inc., an American consumer electronics rental company.
Mr. Maxmin has a home in London but spends half his time in Boston. His wife, Shoshana Zuboff, teaches at Harvard Business School. He has four children, ages 8 to 20, from his first marriage.

HEADLINE: A.T.& T. Expects Big Write-Off

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company announced better-than-expected second-quarter earnings yesterday, but at the same time it issued a stunning warning that it would take pretax charges of as much as $4 billion against earnings before the end of the year.
The charges will cover expenses related to its takeover of the NCR Corporation and a number of cost-cutting programs. 
 Wall Street decided it was all good news. The earnings demonstrated that the company could do well in a tough economic climate, and the write-offs, analysts said, signaled its intention to move aggressively to get rid of unprofitable operations and real estate holdings.
 
'Headed in the Right Direction'
 "You can finally say, eight years after they started to break up the old A.T.& T., that the ship has turned and is headed in the right direction," said Jack Grubman, who follows the telecommunications industry for Paine Webber.
Investors apparently agreed. A.T.&T.'s stock, which has long been the nation's most widely held, rose $1.625, to $39.625, on the New York Stock Exchange. The earnings report was one of many that helped to invigorate the market, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average 37.56 points, to 3,016.32. [Page D8.]
The write-off would be the third huge charge against A.T.&T. earnings in less than a decade. In 1983, in anticipation of its breakup as part of its antitrust settlement with the Government, the company recorded $7.3 billion in pretax special charges, the largest write-off ever by an American company. It took a $3.2 billion pretax charge against earnings in 1986 to cover the cost of reducing its work force and merging various operations.
 
MCI Revenue Up, Net Off
 A.T.&T. said that this year's charge would end up costing the company about $2.5 billion after taxes, absorbing much of its profit for the year. But the write-off will also improve A.T.&T.'s cash flow and not affect the company's ability to pay stock dividends, according to Robert E. Allen, the A.T.&T. chairman.
In related earnings news yesterday, the MCI Communications Corporation, the nation's second-largest long-distance phone company after A.T.& T., said that its revenues had grown rapidly but that much higher expenses had led to a sharp decline in income from the second quarter of 1990.
Analysts said that the figures suggested that long-distance calling had grown at an annual rate of about 6 percent during the quarter. It appeared that A.T.& T. had virtually halted the erosion of its market share at about 65 percent and that MCI, with about 15 percent, had been gaining some market share from U S Sprint, which has been concentrating on improving profitability.
The details of the companies' earnings follow.
 
A.T.& T.
 A.T.&T.'s net income rose 26 percent, to $828 million, or 75 cents a share, from $657 million, or 60 cents a share, in 1990's second quarter. Over half the gain came from the company's $140 million pretax profit on the sale last month of a stake in Sun Microsystems Inc. Operating income rose 11 percent, to $1.3 billion, from $1.17 billion a year ago for the company, which is based in Basking Ridge, N.J.
The strong gains in operating income reflected a blend of revenue growth -- up 5.4 percent, to nearly $9.53 billion from $9.04 billion in 1990 -- and effective cost controls. Expenses rose just 4.5 percent, to $8.23 billion, as declining telecommunications operating costs partly offset an 8.8 percent increase in selling and administrative expenses.
"Efforts they initiated as long as five years ago are starting to bear fruit," said Joel D. Gross, who follows the company for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "It's basic blocking and tackling."
A.T.&T.'s telecommunications services revenue rose 3.9 percent, to $5.01 billion, based on a combination of lower prices and a 7 percent increase in volume. WATS, "800" numbers and international services led the growth.
Sales to GTE and overseas offset declining phone equipment sales to the regional operating companies, lifting total phone equipment and systems sales 8.9 percent, to $1.94 billion. Sales of private exchanges and other business equipment grew just 1.7 percent, to $855 million. One reason was a decline in computer sales that A.T.&T. attributed to uncertainty during much of the quarter over the impact of the NCR acquisition.
Rental revenue fell 4.1 percent, to $1.11 billion. Revenue from financial services and leasing, which includes the company's Universal credit card, jumped 93.6 percent, to $289 million.
Mr. Allen said that A.T.&T. decided to disclose the possibility of large charges against earnings before completing its plans because of investors' uncertainty over the NCR deal. The preliminary estimate that it will cost up to $1.5 billion to meld the operations and product lines of the two companies was, in effect, a total write-down of A.T.&T.'s computer operations to allow NCR to start with a clean slate, according to Jack Grubman, who follows telecommunications for Paine Webber.
 
MCI Communications
 MCI Communications, which is based in Washington, said that its net income in the second quarter was $137 million, or 50 cents a share, down 22.6 percent from $177 million, or 67 cents a share, in the 1990 quarter. Revenues rose 12.4 percent, to almost $2.10 billion, from $2.03 billion a year ago, driven by an 18 percent increase in calling volume. An unspecified part of that increase resulted from the acquisition last August of Telecom USA Inc.
MCI's operating income fell 7.7 percent, to $276 million, from $299 million in the second quarter of 1990, in large part because of a 16.2 percent increase in expenses to $1.82 billion. Many of the expenses were associated with new product introductions and MCI's drive to increase market share.
MCI's stock fell 62.5 cents, to $28.25, in over-the-counter trading yesterday.

HEADLINE: Senators Call Raise an Issue of Equity

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Members of the Senate, many of them openly defensive about their decision to grant themselves a $23,200 raise in a vote on Wednesday night, said today that they had cast their votes in the name of pay equity, ethics reform and fairness in government.
But others appeared torn about the vote and complained that it would be hard to justify it to voters during a recession that has forced several states into budget crises. 
 "It's an issue of merit pay," said Senator John Seymour, Republican of California, who is running to retain the seat he was appointed to last year and who voted against the raise. "If you're running a business, you don't give yourself a raise when you're in the red and your firm isn't producing."
But in the 53-to-45 vote at 9:50 P.M., the wary Senators were outnumbered by those who had become convinced that their vote could be justified as a way to put their salaries up on a par with those of House members and at the same time limit income they received from outside employment and speakers' fees.
 
'It's Kind of Amusing'

"I have no problem with my salary being equal to the House," said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who voted for the raise. "It's kind of amusing from our point of view. We haven't seen the world fall in as a result of the House getting their raise."
When the Federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1, senators will earn $125,100, if the House approves the measure. That is the same amount the House voted itself in 1989 when it banned the acceptance of speaking fees and limited earned outside income.
The Senate backed away from following the House's lead in 1989 in the face of vocal opposition from their hometown constituents that precipitated a flood of angry mail and demonstrations in front of the Capitol. The Senate voted instead for a 10 percent raise, and to limit the amount of money they could accept in outside speaking fees. Senators now earn $101,900 but may accept $23,068 in speaking fees each year.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, praised the Senate's action of Wednesday as a "wise, if overdue, action." He said the House will concur with the Senate.
Senators have long complained that it is demeaning to earn less than their counterparts in the House and even some staff members.
"No one can fail to grasp the significance of the fact that there are staff members on the House side making more than U.S. Senators, that Federal judges make more, that Federal bureaucrats make more," said Senator J. Bennett Johnston, Democrat of Louisiana, who voted for the raise.
The discontent spilled over onto the floor during the debate Wednesday night and again in the halls outside the Senate chamber.
Some Senators, like Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, and Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said they would contribute their raises to charities in their home states. Mr. Wellstone voted against the raise; Mr. Wirth voted for it.
"All I'll get to take is the heat," said Mr. Wirth, who said he supported the measure because it was a way to ban the acceptance of speaking fees.
Senator Steven Symms, Republican of Idaho, said, "The fact is, my constituents already thought I was getting paid $125,000, because that's what they read Congress makes." Mr. Symms and Mr. Murkowski were two of the eight Senators seeking re-election this year who voted for the raise.
Representative Richard Stallings, the Idaho Democrat who plans to challenge Senator Symms this year, said it was "inappropriate " for the Senate to vote itself a pay raise "in the middle of a recession when families are cutting corners all over the place."
Twenty-five others who are facing re-election campaigns this year voted against the raise. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, voted for the raise in 1989 but changed his mind this time.
 
'Not the Proper Time'

"I just felt this particular time with my state in the state it's in, it is just not the proper time to vote for a pay increase," said Mr. Dodd, who sponsored an unsuccessful attempt to ban speaking fees earlier this year.
Over all, 28 Democrats and 25 Republicans voted for the raise, and 27 Democrats and 18 Republicans opposed it.
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader castigated the Senate's leaders, George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, for quietly lining up the votes they needed for the raise and orchestrating the measure's passage on the Senate floor within two hours.
The leaders, Mr. Nader said, "led a narrow majority of avaricious Senators to a huge pay increase directly in the face of massive deficits, cutbacks in critical programs, S.& L. bailouts, scandals and rising unemployment."
According to figures compiled by the National Governors' Association, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, who earns $130,000 a year, is the only state chief executive who will earn more than a member of the Senate once the raise takes effect. And among big-city mayors, Coleman Young of Detroit and Kathryn Whitmire of Houston each earn $130,000 a year, and David N. Dinkins of New York makes $123,500.

HEADLINE: Arkansas Congressman Struggles With Debt

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., July 18

 BODY:
Representative Bill Alexander of Arkansas was meeting with constituents a few days ago when several of them praised him for bringing Federal aid to the state. "I guess I'm better at doing it for myself," he replied.
The 57-year-old Mr. Alexander, a Democrat who has served 12 terms in the House of Representatives and is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, is deeply in debt. He invested in a 10-acre condominium project that went sour in Boulder, Colo. Two Arkansas banks are seeking to foreclose on his condominium at an Arkansas lake resort and on undeveloped commercial property in his hometown, Osceola. Mr. Alexander is selling his house in Washington to meet his bills. 
 His financial troubles belie the public's image of wealthy lawmakers immune to downturns in the economy.
"This is just like a farmer who didn't make a crop," Mr. Alexander said in a recent interview. "You just work hard and make another one."
 
Growing Liabilities

Since 1986, Mr. Alexander's liabilities have outpaced his assets. Congressional financial statements are imprecise, but Mr. Alexander's report shows liabilities of $865,000 to $1.9 million. He lists his assets at $171,000 to $491,000. He said he owes at least $348,000 in interest and principal to the two Arkansas banks.
After questions were raised in Arkansas recently about Mr. Alexander's investment in a planned hotel and underwater park in Key Largo, Fla., he asked the House ethics committee to review it, and it obliged him. The development is next to a nonprofit research foundation that received more than $1 million in Federal grants through the House Appropriations Committee. The foundation is operated by Mr. Alexander's business associates in the planned development.
The ethics committee found that he broke no House rules but warned that members of Congress should closely examine their official actions and personal business dealings. Mr. Alexander gave the stock back to the company.
In a recent interview, Mr. Alexander said he would not file for bankruptcy. "That's not my style," he said. "My dad lost a crop in the 1950's, and I had to drop out of college and return on the G.I. Bill to finish," Mr. Alexander said.
 
Struggling in Congress

Mr. Alexander said he had struggled financially during his 22 years in Congress because the demands of the job were too great for him to tend to his personal business adequately. "At times a job in Congress costs more than it pays," he said. In 1990, Mr. Alexander received $122,900 in salary and in fees for public appearances. He received from $11,003 to $33,700 in other income, his finance reports show. He described his way of living as modest and said it had not changed with his recent financial problems.
In November, Mr. Alexander formed a company, First Preferred Investments, with his wife, Debi, a researcher in the Washington office of the Chicago law firm, Hopkins & Sutter, to consolidate his debts for tax purposes. She owns the company and the losses are in her name, but Mr. Alexander is the guarantor of the debts, making them his liabilities. Mr. Alexander would not give details about the company's holdings, but he said he had received no loans from it.
His financial difficulties began in 1985 when he and seven other Arkansas investors paid $1.2 million for the Colorado site and started building, but accummulated $3.4 million in debt before selling it in 1990. Investors said the project fell prey to a downturn in the Colorado economy when the oil and gas industry faltered.

HEADLINE: Review/Art;
Conceptualism From California

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
FOR people who eat and sleep contemporary art, as well as for those who rarely touch the stuff, the retrospective of the work of John Baldessari that opens at the Whitney Museum of American Art today will be both a pleasure and a surprise. It is a terrific show, well paced and handsomely installed, with illuminating quotations from the artist printed directly on the wall. It provides New York with its most extensive look at the achievement of this influential Californian, now 60 years old, a Conceptual artist par excellence whose interweavings of language and appropriated photographs made him a major precursor to the art of the 1980's.
To walk through this exhibition is to see premonitions of the 80's efforts of David Salle and Eric Fischl (both of whom were students of Mr. Baldessari's when he taught at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia), as well as Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer and Cindy Sherman. The work on view dates from the late 1960's to the present and covers almost the entirety of Mr. Baldessari's art, which started out strong and has gotten consistently better, more accessible and also more profound. In this regard, the show as a whole has a traditional and eminently satisfying shape, despite Mr. Baldessari's penchant for eccentric materials and processes that some may find unconventional or even "anti-art." 
 Organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, it includes rarely seen early paintings, which he commissioned other artists and sign painters to make, and a selection of the artist's videotapes and books. And, while tracing Mr. Baldessari's growth as an artist, it also teaches much about the roles of photography and popular culture in contemporary art. Few artists have found as many different and amusing uses for photographs as Mr. Baldessari, who has transferred them to canvas, drawn on them, arranged them in cinematic "story board" sequences and, most recently, spliced them into big collage-like images.
These last works dominate the powerful second half of this display of nearly 90 works, which moves chonologically, gallery by gallery, through the artist's different styles and phases. Deploying enlarged Hollywood film stills, these works resemble visually skewed, extra-intelligent movie posters -- and should have special appeal for old movie buffs. As one wall label announces, their abrupt juxtapositions of imagery and startling additions of bright disks of color (usually over people's faces) create "multi-leveled narratives." But for all their post-modern ambiguity, they take on the themes -- life and death, good and evil -- that have concerned artists down through the ages, restating them in a contemporary vernacular. It is not by chance that intense gazes between people are a frequent motif; for all their obvious Hollywood glamour, they also bring to mind the focused eye contact in hundreds of religious paintings -- of the Annuciation and Last Supper -- from Giotto forward.
The monumental 1986 work titled "Heel," which confronts visitors as they step off the elevator, demands to be read like a puzzle, with each image adding a new twist of possible meaning. The dominant picture is a 1930's street scene in which a crowd of students or workers seems caught on the verge of action, about to riot or be herded away by nearby policemen. Smaller framing images focus on individual people or on feet, often in ways that imply pain (scarred or bandaged heels) or power (one man tying up another's feet). A tremendous tension builds as, one by one, the images iterate the helplessness of the individual.
In the double images of "Bloody Sundae," where an art heist seems to be in process, the tension is more theatrical, like a good suspense movie. On top, two men attack a third beside a stack of paintings; on the bottom, a couple lounges on a bed, a breakfast tray between them. One wonders: are they the next victims or did they plan the whole thing? That all five faces are obliterated by circles of color only increases the unease.
In art circles, Mr. Baldessari, who was born in National City, Calif., is well known without being completely understood, especially in terms of his early work. He began his career in the key of Duchamp, where the deadpan, the random and the ironic are frequently used notes. One of his best-known early works, something of a "classic" of Conceptual art dating from 1970, consists of the carefully documented act of cremating all the paintings still in his possession that he had made between 1953 and 1966.
The artist's subsequent works often took an irreverent view of modern art or the mundane aspect of life in Southern California -- or both. One series of eight photographs from 1974, each an image of four red balls caught in motion against a bright blue California sky, is titled "Throwing Four Balls in the Air to Get a Square (Best of 36 Tries)." This is not exactly the way Mondrian did things.
In many respects the significance of California in Mr. Baldessari's work should not be underestimated, likewise the fact that for many years he supported himself teaching art, first at a National City high school and later at the California Institute. His work has a freewheeling irreverence that is something of a local product and shared by California artists like Edward Ruscha, Bruce Nauman and even William Wegman, a New York-based artist who began his career in Los Angeles. In addition, like an unusually skilled teacher, Mr. Baldessari is constantly prodding the viewer to expand his or her notion of what art can be.
Especially in the early years, Mr. Baldessari seemed determined to expunge all mysteries and ineffability from his art, as well as any sense of the artist's hand or his esthetic decisions. He has said he wanted to be "less artful than Rauschenberg and Warhol: this is a photograph, here's a text. That's it."
He drove his car around National City, taking blurry photographs (while driving) that he later transferred to canvas and had a sign painter add an identifying caption, like "Econ-O-Wash, 14th and Highland." Related paintings took wry potshots at the art world, as in a canvas featuring an image of an issue of Artforum magazine over the caption "This Is Not to Be Looked At." It's unclear if this injunction refers to Mr. Baldessari's canvas, the art magazine or the abstract painting by Frank Stella pictured on its cover.
But despite Mr. Baldessari's surface of deadpan and cool, this exhibition betrays that the artist has a restless, ambitious energy that, after the mid-70's in particular, becomes more and more assertive. (The ambition is also palpable in the catalogue, written by Coosje van Bruggen, which documents an even greater array of work and analyzes everything in detail.)
The powerful second half of this exhibition reveals that Mr. Baldessari hit his stride when he stopped taking his own photographs and started enlarging and cutting up and coloring the thousands of movie stills he had collected over the years. Especially in the 80's, his sudden additions of flat bright color to these images speak more of a reverence than an irreverence for modernism, a love of the power of primary colors as strong as Mondrian's. At the same time, the purely formal drama of the colored spheres, which sometimes recall the tossed red balls of the artist's 1974 photographs, is matched by the human drama of the movie images.
Art history, movie culture and real life buzz through these works at a furious rate, fueled by each viewer's own reactions and emotional responses. In a 1987 work titled "Two Stories," for example, the life of Christ is clearly the subject of the left row of vertical images, while those on the right, of different figures running through fields, seems to mix moments of danger with ones of extreme joy. As the artist himself has said: "We bring all our baggage to it, what we've seen of life, and on television, and so on. There's just enough there to activate the mind, but not enough to provide completeness." So in the the end, the mysteries and ineffability have returned to Mr. Baldessari's art, and he is putting them to good use.
"John Baldessari" remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Oct. 20.

HEADLINE: Next Target for Bush: Accord on Cyprus

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATHENS, July 18

 BODY:
As the United States Administration works on the problems in the Middle East, President Bush took on another unyielding area today: Cyprus.
"In the new world I have discussed, none of us should accept the status quo in Cyprus," Mr. Bush said in a speech to the Greek Parliament. "And today I pledge that the United States will do whatever it can to help Greece, Turkey and the Cypriots settle the Cyprus problem, and do so this year." 
 "Today, with new leaders of vision, your nations enjoy a unique opportunity to overcome the misunderstandings of the past," Mr. Bush said. "You can begin to heal the deep wound that scars Cyprus, that divides families and friends on that island."
At a news conference after a two-hour meeting with Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece, Mr. Bush said: "I don't want to suggest that the United States can wave a wand, a magic wand, and solve a problem that has plagued this part of the world for a long time. But we are going to try."
 
Security at Its Tightest
 In Athens security precautions were even tighter than usual today, because of a series of terrorist bombings that have shaken Greece recently. Armored vehicles rolled onto the airport runway as the President and his staff landed. And officials advised members of the traveling White House press corps not to exhibit their American nationality openly, either by jogging or openly wearing their press passes on the street.
According to Reuters, the Greek Government has "imposed the most Draconian security system seen in Athens in peacetime."
More than 3,000 police officers, army troops and a special anti-terrorist squad were on full alert for the President's visit. Police officers told the Athens News that 1,000 American security agents had been sent to Greece.
About 2,000 demonstrators, mostly students, crowded into a city square downtown, protesting about Cyprus and calling for American aid in expelling the Turks from the island. The police used tear gas to control the crowd.
 
'A Historic Opportunity'
 Tonight, a bank with an American Express office was firebombed and several protesters were arrested.
On Tuesday, the Turkish charge d'affaires and two other Turkish employees were wounded as terrorists set off a bomb near their car in downtown Athens.
[In Istanbul, Turkey, where Mr. Bush is to arrive on Saturday, bombs went off Thursday night and damaged five banks despite heavy security measures, The Associated Press reported.]
Regarding Cyprus, Mr. Bush said that it was not his role to "spell out steps and procedures" but that he felt he could spur the process at a time the Prime Minister called "a turning point."
"I told him that if we could be a catalyst who could help solve the problem of Cyprus, we would willingly fulfill that role," Mr. Bush said.
He said he believed that "a historic opportunity" exists now, because both sides seem to be more optimistic about a possible settlement through the United Nations.
The Greeks have compared the Cyprus problem to the invasion of Kuwait, and Mr. Bush seemed taken aback when he was asked by a Greek reporter why he did not "liberate" Cyprus from the Turkish troops, as he "liberated" Kuwait.
Administration officials had previously been reluctant to allow Mr. Bush to be drawn into another intractable political argument, trying to settle the long-running feud in the Eastern flank of NATO.
But in an interview this week, Prime Minister Mitsotakis said that Mr. Bush had acceded to his request to get involved in the Cyprus problem.
Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974, fearing that the Greeks were trying to take over the island. It remains riven by a border enforced by the United Nations, leaving 40 percent occupied by 29,000 Turkish troops.
 
Turkish Role in Gulf War
 But Prime Minister Mitsotakis said that he pressed Mr. Bush in two conversations because he believed that the unrest in the Balkans, including the Yugoslav civil conflict, had intensified the need to bring stability to Cyprus.
Mr. Bush arrived in Athens on a steamy 90-degree morning. He had left a rainy London at dawn after the end of the Group of Seven's economic summit meeting, where he reached an arms control agreement with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and scheduled a Moscow summit meeting for the end of the month.
The President's two-day visit to Greece is part of a sensitive balancing act before a two-day visit to Turkey, where he wants to express solidarity with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey.
Mr. Bush wants to thank President Ozal for taking the risky step of acceding to his request to shut down the Iraqi oil pipeline that runs through Turkey and allowing allied planes to make bombing runs from Turkey's NATO bases. The closing of the pipeline, which cost Turkey $2.5 billion, insured the early success of the coalition against Saddam Hussein.
The Greeks contributed a frigate to the Persian Gulf effort, but now they fear that a Turkey favored by Washington could use its new postwar clout to the detriment of Greece. Mr. Bush does not want to offend either the Greek Prime Minister or the many Greek-American voters in America.
The Greek armed forces have a long shopping list to buy jet fighters, war ships, tanks and other equipment. Mr. Bush said it is "our intention to do what we can to strengthen the Greek armed forces."
The visit by Mr. and Mrs. Bush to Greece, was the first by an American President since Dwight D. Eisenhower's in 1959.

'Explorations II:
The New Furniture'
American Craft Museum
40 West 53d Street
Through Aug. 4
Sometimes a chair is just a chair and sometimes it's a work of art. In "Explorations II: The New Furniture," a survey of the work of 11 furniture makers, the chair-as-art is at the forefront, along with the table, chaise, lamp, bench and grandfather clock. The show is chockablock with objects whose overwrought silhouettes and exquistely crafted surfaces seem to have "esthetic" written all over them. The result does not feel entirely welcoming to those of us who think that form should follow function as directly as possible or that superlative craftsmanship and the savvy quotation of past styles don't necessarily add up to originality. 
 Still, this is a lively, even argumentative exhibition; it provides a valuable glimpse of a rich terrain where art, craft and design overlap. It boasts an impressive range of sensibilities. It should make all viewers sort out what they like and don't like in furniture, and why.
For those who think that Darth Vader was the last word in style, there is the rather sinister drawing room of Alex Locadia, a former car customizer, whose taste runs to black leather, aluminum and Surrealist suggestiveness. His "Vega" chair has fanglike legs and a profile reminiscent of a motorcycle; his chaise longue suggests nothing so much as an unusually svelte shark. If rustic or Adirondack furniture is more your style, there are Daniel Mack's one-of-a-kind chairs, which incorporate the roots or branches of trees (with or without bark), or old woodworking tools -- all of which, frankly, deserve a better fate. And fans of clever wordplay will undoubtedly appreciate the grandfather clock designed by Edward Zucca. It is covered with $1 bills, which interject the Father of Our Country into the proceedings, and is titled "Time Is Money."
The interest in Americana that runs through the exhibition is well expressed in Wendy Maruyama's playfully painted and carved "Two-Patterned Blanket Chest," and turns hilarious in Allan Wexler's "Screen Chair," which combines porch swing and screen porch with the modernist angularity of Gerrit Rietveld.
For the most part, the designs that speak more softly and anonymously, that look as if they might actually be lived with and used, make the most lasting impression. David Ebner's refreshingly reserved "Wine Table," a combination of tripod legs and circular top -- in a dark wood called wenge -- balances adeptly between the modern and the traditional. Dakota Jackson's straightforward "Saturn Stool" evokes an Art Deco dentist's office without looking dated; more designed than crafted, it is also one of the few objects here that seem ready for mass production.
The moments when form and function fuse into a thing of useful beauty are too rare in this exhibition; the instances of overbearing artistic ego too plentiful. But this shouldn't stop anyone from looking and learning. In addition, the contributors to the show's well-written catalogue, headed by John Perreault, senior curator at the museum and the exhibition's organizer, make impressive cases for the work of each artist.
 
'When Objects Dream and Talk in Their Sleep'
Jack Tilton Gallery
24 West 57th Street
Through August
The poetic title of this group exhibition -- "When Objects Dream and Talk in Their Sleep" -- suggests that objects, like the rest of us, have an unconscious that surfaces after the lights go out. Not surprisingly, the assembled artworks imply that what surfaces often pertains to childhood or sexuality.
This exhibition of work by eight artists reflects the appeal, among the younger generation, of casual arrangements of ephemeral signifiers of popular culture. Paula Hayes's scattering of objects, titled "Cool Bride or Bruce Lee Is Dead," suggests a teen-age fan in mourning, while Karen Kilimnik's "Castle Gloom" conjures flimsy romance with a Scottish flavor.
Maureen Connor's installation, "Ensemble for Three Female Voices," actually speaks, or at least laughs a lot. It consists of three casts of a human esophagus made of lipstick -- a luscious yet gruesome effect that evokes a lifetime of talk and makeup. Emanating from each are chuckles, laughs and guffaws whose different timbres suggest three generations -- child, mother and grandmother. Collier Schorr conflates innocence and its loss in a plaster cast of a little girl's dress that hangs high on the wall; looking up into it the viewer becomes a voyeur and also discovers primitive scrawls and graffiti -- pleas, accusations and childhood taunts -- written on its inside surface.
The other artists in the exhibition are Polly Apfelbaum, Meg Cranston, Steven Evans, Annette Messager, Donald Moffett and Kiki Smith, and their contributions all have something to say.
 
'Drawing Acquisitions, 1980-1991'
Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris
120 Park Avenue (at 42d Street)
Through Sept. 5
This delightful display of 27 drawings represents less than 10 percent of the Whitney Museum of American Art's drawing acquisitions during the past decade. If any conclusions are to be drawn from it, it is that the museum intends to treat all 20th-century art, early and late, with an even hand.
From the first half of the century are Cubist drawings by Stuart Davis and John Marin, grouped effectively with a 1937 watercolor by Lee Krasner that takes Cubism back to its Cezannesque beginnings. From mid-century comes an image of three dark levitating orbs by Myron Stout, its figural presence drawn out by the neighboring "Daisy's Dream," a glowering 1989 pastel by Elizabeth Murray.
Recent works by Mike Kelley and Christopher Wool exploit full-bodied contrasts of black and white, while Jasper Johns deals in gradations of gray. Works by Jackson Pollock, Alan Saret and Cy Twombly are all linear bravura. And in "Head of a Woman With a Hat," Elie Nadelman, a master of the economic line, fills in his forms completely, creating the semblance of a hot, summertime flush.
Unusually sensitive juxtapositions and pairings, by which the drawings speak to each other as well as to the viewer, make this exhibition especially worthwhile.

HEADLINE: Cyanamid Net Up 18.9%; Caterpillar Posts a Loss

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
American Cyanamid reported record second-quarter earnings and sales yesterday, but two other industrial companies, Dow Chemical and PPG Industries, announced sharp earnings declines, and Caterpillar Inc. reported a loss. 
 Following are the details of the companies' results:
 
American Cyanamid
 American Cyanamid, the Wayne, N.J., specialty chemicals manufacturer, earned $132 million, or $1.41 a share, for the three months ended June 30, up 18.9 percent from $111 million, or $1.16 a share, a year earlier. Quarterly sales totaled $1.42 billion, up 16 percent from $1.23 billion.
George J. Sella Jr., chairman and chief executive, said the performance reflected strong growth in the company's medical and agricultural-related businesses.
American Cyanamid's shares rose 37.5 cents, to $68.25, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
 
Caterpillar
 Caterpillar Inc. said it lost $17 million in the second quarter, in contrast to a profit of $46 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
The company attributed the loss to the recession in most of the industrialized world and in Brazil, where Caterpillar has two manufacturing plants.
The manufacturer of tractors and earth-moving equipment said sales for the second quarter were $2.69 billion, down 8.8 percent from $2.95 billion last year. Domestic sales fell 22 percent while sales outside the United States were up 2.6 percent.
Caterpillar took a nonrecurring charge of $22 million against earnings in the quarter related to the write-off of surplus assets and job reductions outside the United States.
The company's shares climbed by 62.5 cents, to $48.375, on the Big Board yesterday.
 
Dow Chemical
 The Midland, Mich., company said second-quarter results totaled $233 million, or 86 cents a share, down 36 percent from $364 million, or $1.34 a share, a year earlier. Sales were basically unchanged at $4.79 billion, against $4.80 billion.
Dow blamed lower selling prices and higher manufacturing costs for the declines.
Dow's stock fell 37.5 cents, to $54.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
 
PPG Industries
 PPG Industries, the giant chemical, paint and glass manufacturer, said its second-quarter earnings dropped 43.9 percent because of declines in United States auto production and construction starts.
After-tax profit totaled $79.1 million, or 75 cents a share, on sales of $1.48 billion, compared with earnings of $141 million, or $1.31 a share, on sales of $1.57 billion a year earlier.
The chairman, Vincent A. Sarni, said slow business for auto makers and the construction industry meant sales and earnings declines for PPG glass products.
The stock of PPG rose $1.375, to $58.625, on the Big Board yesterday.

HEADLINE: Blacks Spar Over Endorsing Thomas

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The discord among black groups over Judge Clarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court escalated today as black conservatives accused his opponents of holding him to an unfair political standard because of his race.
Buster Soaries, a New Jersey pastor who leads a coalition of black conservatives that declared its support for Judge Thomas here today, said, "Black organizations and individuals in positions of leadership do a tremendous disservice to our community when they use their offices to condemn Clarence Thomas for his philosophy and essentially, for departing from liberal orthodoxy." 
 But members of the Congressional Black Caucus today laid out their reasons for voting last week to oppose the nomination, warning that it would be a mistake for black people to support Judge Thomas solely because he is black.
It was not clear whether that Mr. Soaries's news conference and a second one by other supporters of Judge Thomas were orchestrated by the White House in response to the caucus's.
It was also not clear what prompted the formation of the black conservative coalition, but there was no suggestion it was orchestrated by the White House. In addition to Mr. Soaries, the group is being led by Robert L. Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a group that helps communities deal with their social and economic troubles.
 
A Broadening Debate

Today's exchange was the latest round in an intellectual and political debate that was sparked by the Thomas nomination, but has grown to embrace broader questions about the legacy of the civil rights movement and the political diversity of the minority population.
David A. Bositis, senior research associate for politics at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a leading black research organization, said the Thomas nomination has underscored a problem for many black people: they want to see a black replace Thurgood Marshall, the Court's first black justice, but they do not want a conservative.
"There is certainly an element of uncomfortableness," Mr. Bositis said. "There are a lot of people who long for the days of 'We Shall Overcome,' when we all stood together. But part of the consequence of the civil rights movement is that it allowed for a much greater measure of differentiation in the black community. They're not used to it right now, but they will get used to it."
Flanked by other black House members, Representative Edolphus Towns, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the black caucus, read a statement today declaring that the group's opposition to Judge Thomas was based on his philosophy and background.
"We cannot ignore or excuse Clarence Thomas's record, views, values, merely because he is an African-American," Mr. Towns said. "His view of constitutional rights as he has articulated them as jurist, administrator and before the nation's press are inconsistent with the interests of the people we serve."
 
'No Profile in Courage'

Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Democratic caucus member from Manhattan, said, "All people would feel a sense of pride if they feel that one of their own has been selected." But he emphasized that they should not be blindly supportive, saying, "Our job is to make certain that that's an educated decision that they're making."
The caucus's opposition to Judge Thomas "is no profile in courage," Mr. Rangel said, adding, "There is no support in our communities for this man."
 
Defense From a Republican

Caucus members said they were particularly concerned about Judge Thomas's record on affirmative action, and argued that he was insensitive to minorities during his tenure as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Reagan Administration. Judge Thomas now sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
But Representative Gary Franks of Connecticut, the only black Republican in the House and the only one of the 26 members of the black caucus to support Judge Thomas, defended him today at a news conference with other conservative lawmakers.
Mr. Franks accused caucus members of unfairly rejecting the notion that there were many black conservatives in the country. "Many people would say that because of my conservative positions that the black community would not be supportive of my candidacy," Mr. Franks said, "and I proved them wrong. I carried seven of the eight predominantly black precincts."
Mr. Woodson accused the caucus of "demanding that blacks be politically correct" and added, "They're looking at life through an elitist perspective."
As evidence of the ambivalence about the Thomas nomination among organizations representing black people, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Urban League and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights have yet to announce their positions on it.

HEADLINE: Europeans Continue to Favor More Generous Financial Help to Soviets

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 18

 BODY:
France, Germany and Italy continued to make clear today that they were willing to go further than their allies in providing direct Western involvement in rescuing the Soviet economy.
At this week's London summit meeting, these three European countries went along with the the joint statement agreed to by the United States, Britain, Canada and Japan, which offerred Moscow new association with international financial institutions, technical assistance and greater market access, but fell short of what President Mikhail S, Gorbachev had wanted. But the three Continental powers also have stressed they wanted to do more than their their partners in the Group of Seven industrial powers. 
 "We formed a sub-group that carried out a job of persuasion," one French official said, noting that France's President Francois Mitterrand, Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Italy's Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti lunched privately before Mr. Gorbachev met the Group of Seven.
The official added that, while as host of the summit meeting, Prime Minister John Major of Britain was intent on building a consensus among the Group of Seven, he also left no doubt that he leaned towards the more flexible approach favored by the other three European leaders, but had to go along with the less generous approach favored particularly by Washington.
The United States has repeatedly stressed that aid should be limited until the Soviet Union has actually taken the hard political moves to take it into a more market-oriented economy. It is always possible, of course, that President Bush, when he goes to Moscow at the end of the month for a summit meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, may loosen up on the question, but American officials say that beyond going ahead with seeking most-favored-nation tariff treatment for Moscow, it it unlikely that Washington will go beyond what was agreed to in London.
Political experts noted that, because of their proximity to the Soviet Union, the European members of the Group of Seven believe the collapse of Mr. Gorbachev's liberalization effort would affect them much more severely than it would the United States, Japan and Canada.
 
Early Recognition of Gorbachev

They also recalled that, after Mr. Gorbachev took office in 1985, Britain, France and Germany were far quicker than Washington in recognizing, in the words of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, that they could "do business" with him.
Further, no less than President Bush, Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Kohl both believe they have a special relationship with Mr. Gorbachev, with the German leader particularly grateful that he permitted the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and accepted the unification of Germany.
France, Germany and Italy backed early Soviet entry to the International Monetary Fund as a full member -- instead of an undefined period of associate membership -- as well as more credit from a new European Development Bank. They were blocked by the United States, Japan and Canada.
 
Follow-Up in Moscow

But they considered it a victory that the relationship with Moscow was institutionalized through annual meetings between the rotating president of the Group of Seven and the Soviet President. And they noted that finance ministers from the Seven will soon travel to Moscow for further talks.
Still more important for Mr. Gorbachev, the three governments have stressed that the London summit is merely the first step. Refering to the decision to give Moscow only associate membership of the I.M.F., Mr. Andreotti noted today: "The problem is not closed of course."
In Bonn, while German newspapers described the summit as a personal failure for Mr. Kohl, Germany's Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said the Group of Seven had "begun a process which would have as its conclusion the full integration of the Soviet Union in the world economy."
On Wednesday, Mr. Mitterrand went out of his way to praise Mr. Gorbachev and noted that, when it comes to helping Moscow, "France belongs to those who believe it is better to assume the risk now than to accept the alternative risk that could lead the experience to failure."
French officials said that the European powers had no plan to launch an independent initiative to step up aid for the Soviet Union, but would continue to work in that direction in other forums, including the 12-nation European Community and international financial organizations.
The London summit's failure to promise direct aid to Moscow, however, was seen as a setback for Germany. Since the Germans currently provide around 60 percent of all Western aid to the Soviet Union, Mr. Kohl had hoped to persuade his Group of Seven partners to assume a greater share of this burden.

HEADLINE: Protest Tangles Airport Traffic For Rush Hour

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Using more than 30 tractors and other pieces of heavy construction equipment, about 60 demonstrators -- demanding contracts and jobs for blacks -- brought traffic to a halt yesterday afternoon at the height of the rush hour on the road leading to Kennedy International Airport.
Beginning at 4:30 P.M. and blocking all three lanes on the Van Wyck Expressway, the protest tied up traffic for 2 1/2 hours, forcing some passengers to leave their cars in the 99-degree heat and lug their baggage on foot for a mile to try to make flights. Fourteen demonstrators were arrested on disorderly conduct charges by the Port Authority police, which confiscated four tractor-trailers, a front-end loader and two vans. 
 Earlier in the afternoon, the organizations sponsoring the action -- United Black Enterprise, a group of black truckers and contractors; the Jamaica branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Queens Urban League -- picketed outside the World Trade Center, the site of the Port Authority's executive offices. They were joined there by State Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., Assemblywoman Vivian Cook and the City Council majority whip, Archie Spigner, all Democrats of Queens.
"We are concerned about the lack of contracts for any businesses and vendors in the airports," said Ed Lewis, assistant to the president of the Jamaica branch of the N.A.A.C.P., last night. "There are unfair and different requirements for African-American contractors, and there has been an exclusion of the southeast Queens community in the economic developement of the J.F.K. 2000 project and the rebuilding of La Guardia Airport. We are just looking for our fair share of the economic base in the borough."
L. B. Griffin, president of United Black Enterprise and a heavy-construction contractor in Jamaica, said the protesters were seeking job equity.
"There are no black contractors for the $2 billion expansion project at Kennedy and La Guardia. There are zero bona fide -- that is, not working for a white front -- black contractors working on major construction sites for the Port Authority," he said, adding, "We intend to go back again until someone speaks to us about black participation in the Port Authority."
Calling the action "irresponsible and deplorable" in a statement released last night, Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority, denied that the agency discriminated in employment or business opportunities for minorities and disputed Mr. Griffin's contentions.
"The Port Authority has a long record of creating such opportunities," he said. "In April and May of this year, construction employment at J.F.K. rose to 375, of which 107 jobs went to minority group members, about 29 percent. Since the beginning of 1990, about $19 million, or some 19 percent of all redevelopment contracts, have been awarded to minority-owned businesses. Simlilar results have been obtained at La Guardia and Newark International Airports."

A Lawyer Whose Client Was Racial Justice

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

A Season for Justice
The Life and Times of Civil Rights Lawyer Morris Dees
By Morris Dees with Steve Fiffer
Illustrated. 355 pages. Charles Scribner's Sons. $24.95.
 Morris Dees, a white lawyer who grew up in Mount Meigs, Ala., population 400, became a millionaire in 1967 by publishing and selling cookbooks to schools, churches and women's groups. He was named one of the "Outstanding Young Men in America" by the Jaycees, on a notable list that included Ralph Nader. The next year, he was on his way to Chicago, where he intended to start a trade-book publishing house, when a snowstorm diverted his flight and he found himself spending the night on a hard bench in the Cincinnati airport. There, he picked up a paperback copy of "The Story of My Life," by Clarence Darrow, a reprint of the original 1934 autobiography of the famous American defense lawyer. In "A Season for Justice," Mr. Dees says that Darrow's book changed the course of his own life. 
 Unfortunately, the author's rather convenient epiphany in an airport waiting room has an after-the-fact feel to it. A more likely explanation appears in his book. He grew up in a progressive Southern family and came of age at a time when the colleges and the country had reached a point that legal, if not economic and social, equality became acceptable and necessary.
Mr. Dees and his co-author, Steve Fiffer, a lawyer and writer, have constructed a sympathetic account that should be useful background to understand the clashing views today by those trying to narrow or broaden civil-rights laws. It's about the extraordinary achievements of a courageous minority of black and white people, risking their necks in the streets and their careers in the courts, to break down the entrenched racist system during the last quarter of a century.
The book is subtitled, "The Life and Times of Civil Rights Lawyer Morris Dees," but the times are far more revealing than the author's life and motivations. And what historic times they were! Marches by demonstrators, bus boycotts and sitdown strikes, nonviolent resistance inspired by Gandhi, eloquent speeches by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and crusading preachers; on the other side, violent resistance by sheriffs with police dogs and fire hoses, beatings and killings that were inspired by the Ku Klux Klan as well as by the rhetoric of racist governors and senators, slavishly waving the Confederate banner in the 20th century.
Much of the story in "A Season for Justice" is built around the role of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., in attacking segregationist institutions and the Ku Klux Klan. In 1971, Mr. Dees and his law partner, Joseph Levin Jr., founded the center. Twenty years later, it remains a nonprofit legal and educational foundation that serves as an advocate for the oppressed all over the South. Often at personal risk, and without the monetary rewards of their colleagues in private practice, the center's lawyers continue to be in the forefront of civil-rights battles, mainly for blacks but also for new immigrants.
Even the most obvious injustices -- for example, membership restrictions for the Y.M.C.A. in 1969 -- required a lawsuit to achieve desegregation in Montgomery. Mr. Dees relates how pressure was brought by community leaders, including a threat to have him disbarred. He was offered a deal: the case against him would be dropped if he called off the lawsuit. He continued to press ahead; again and again, the author shows that he loved a good fight and knew how to use public-relations methods to combat segregationist diehards. Mr. Dees says that because the Y.M.C.A. case hit so close to home for many in Montgomery, some people began to call him a "Commie lawyer."
Other center lawyers began to win precedent-setting cases that established new gains for powerless citizens. Steve Ellmann litigated a case involving inhuman conditions in Alabama mental institutions. Ira Burnim broke new ground in obtaining financial benefits for cotton-mill workers suffering brown-lung infection caused by an excess of cotton dust. John Carroll and Dennis Balske assembled a trial team to train lawyers trying capital cases. More than 50 death-penalty cases were brought by the center; in some cases, inmates were saved from execution and received their freedom. In one highly publicized case that lasted 12 years, a black Marine sergeant who shot two white Georgia law officers in self-defense was eventually released from prison.
After the center established Klanwatch 10 years ago, Mr. Dees, his family and colleagues became assassination targets of the Klan and neo-Nazi groups. The center itself was fire-bombed in 1983. Four years later, the center achieved a major victory when it brought a lawsuit on behalf of the family of a 19-year-old black who was lynched by Klansmen in Mobile, Ala.; the largest Klan organization in the country, the United Klans of America, was bankrupted when it lost the $7 million case. Last year, the White Aryan Resistance, based in Fallbrook, Calif., was ordered by an Oregon court to pay $12.5 million in damages to the family of a black Ethiopian immigrant killed in Portland in 1988 by two skinhead members of a group called East Side White Pride. The center's lawyers had argued that the White Aryan Resistance had encouraged the skinheads.
"A Season for Justice" appears at a moment when the battleground has shifted, once again, to Congress and the United States Supreme Court. Although the book seems glossed-over as a personal story, it holds up as a report on the achievements of the Southern Poverty Law Center in the field of civil rights during the last 20 years.

Budget Dim Sum
 Past the throngs of tourists and sidewalk shopkeepers, tucked away along cluttered and colorful Division Street in Chinatown, is a Cantonese restaurant renowned among Chinese residents of the neighborhood for its diverse and budget-priced dim sum. Eight-year-old Lan Hong Kok Seafood House looks as if the contractors who built the place quit in midstream. The front room has soot-brown walls, Formica wainscoting and big glass-covered tables; the unfinished-looking back room is stunning in bright red, with a solitary chandelier in the middle. 
 Diners are ushered to big communal tables, where one presumes it could be fun to sit as patrons swap comments on different dishes. The only problem was that none of our dining companions spoke English. Servers who stroll around the room holding dim sum trays are no more helpful. The most detailed description of a dish I got was "pork."
 Left to our own devices, we enjoyed some gelatinous pork meatballs vibrant with fresh coriander, coriander-flecked steamed pork dumplings, fresh and delicate shrimp dumplings and crisp fried shrimp dumplings ($1.35 each). Pork spare ribs are served in an unusual way, cut into tidbits and served in a slightly sweet sauce ($1.35). Shrimp and bits of lobster in a gossamer wonton skin were delicious and impeccably fresh, but fried scallops were too heavily breaded ($2.50 each). For $35, a couple can eat until they need a kneeling bus to get home.
Lan Hong Kok Seafood House, 31 Division Street, serves dim sum from 7:30 A.M. to 4 P.M. daily; dinner from 4 to 11:30 P.M. daily. No credit cards. Telephone: (212) 431-9063 or (212) 226-9674.
 
Staying Closed
 Toscana, the Italian restaurant at 200 East 54th Street in Manhattan, which was to be converted to a casual and less expensive spot, will not reopen, said Sergio Bitici, one of the owners. The restaurant closed in March for renovation, but Mr. Bitici said the state of the economy made such a venture impossible.

Presenting the Issues For Viewers' Decisions

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Can a half-hour television program touch the heart and stir the brain cells at the same time? Before you burst out laughing at the idea, tune into Channel 2 at 8:30 tonight for "Whose Side Are You On?"
This first of three CBS News specials digs into the issues involved in a husband's killing of his terminally ill wife. Next Friday brings the question, lately raised by the rape charges against William Kennedy Smith, of whether the name of a woman who says she has been raped should be made public. The final program, on Aug. 2, deals with public opinion and the right to parole. 
 The innovative format, which may turn up again on CBS News if the response is what it should be, works. Opposing lawyers present the pros and cons with the help of people directly involved, others who have had related experiences, and experts. In effect, the lawyers, abetted by the CBS producers, offer their own mini-documentaries.
In tonight's case, which Mike Wallace, presiding, calls "killing with kindness," Robert Harper, a Michigan man who admitted to giving his wife sleeping pills and then putting a plastic bag over her head, says he did what she would have wanted. Their daughter, who was in the room, remembers the scene as "peaceful, tender, loving." A doctor who specializes in geriatric care reports that patients are typically terrified by the prospect of months in a hospital and painful treatment, and a lung-cancer sufferer pleads with doctors to help her "to die with some dignity."
The other side introduces the argument that in expressing a wish to die, Mrs. Harper might actually have been asking for support and sustaining love from her husband and daughter. A man who was told four years ago that he would soon be dead of cancer says he drew strength from his family's assurances that they wanted him to live. A specialist in the ethical implications of "right to die" cases warns, "We do not want people given the right to kill other people even with love."
A panel of four people, at least one or two of them likely to be recognizable to viewers (Arthur Ashe, the former tennis champion, and the actress Meredith Baxter Birney), then weighs in, evidently expressing opinions the participants held before watching the cases unfold. The panelists, even the celebrities, seem reasonably thoughtful, but in the manner of panels, the fastest and loudest talkers tend to dominate. The half-hour ends with the scene, captured by a camera in the courtroom, of the Harper jury delivering its verdict.
Next week, Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University of Southern California and a rape victim herself, makes the case that given the shame that attends rape victims, exposure in the press and on television is "devastating," while Alan M. Dershowitz of Harvard Law School argues that only when women come forth will the crime be treated like any other crime and the stigma be erased. It is a question that apparently divides feminists. Among Mr. Dershowitz's witnesses is Karen DeCrow, a past president of the National Organization for Women, who holds that the accuser's name should be publicized just like the name of the accused. Charles Kuralt moves matters along.
Yes, it would have been more daring if the producers had chosen to lead off with less celebrated cases, but if this bow toward popularity helps them to do other programs in as intelligent a spirit, the compromise will have been justified.
 
'20/20'
Channel 7
Tonight at 10
Tonight on "20/20," Hugh Downs offers a pilot's-eye view of the nation's most dangerous airports. Drawing on responses to a question in Professional Pilot Magazine, he finds the danger spots to be bicoastal: La Guardia Airport in New York City; National Airport in Washington; Los Angeles International Airport; San Diego Airport, and John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Calif.
The hazards include congestion, maneuvers required to cut down on engine noise and, in the case of La Guardia, short runways. A Federal Aviation Administration official responds that the airports are closely regulated and safe, and despite scenes of crashes and dire reports of disasters barely averted, you may be left with the feeling that "20/20" is indulging in a little scare mongering. Still, the pictures from the cockpit should raise travelers' appreciation of the pilots' skill.
 
'The Treasure of the South Pole'
Channel 4
Sunday at 7 P.M.
Antarctica's pristine beauty and its imported rubbish are on display Sunday in "The Treasure of the South Pole." The hourlong documentary tells of the efforts of dozens of countries to get footholds on the vast, icy and as yet unexploited continent in hopes of benefiting economically, politically and militarily.
The report, narrated by Keith Morrison, is sympathetic to Greenpeace, the environmental group that wants to leave the area to its native inhabitants -- penguins, walruses, seals and whales -- but it does not simplify a complicated matter. It leaves open the question of how long the lure of possible oil, gas, coal, platinum and who knows what other riches can be resisted.
 
Whose Side Are You On?
Catherine Lasiewicz, senior producer; Andrew Heyward, executive producer. At 8:30 tonight on CBS.

HEADLINE: The Best Way to Save the Banks

BYLINE: By Charles E. Schumer; Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is a member of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The megamerger of Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover vividly illustrates the changes rocking the American banking system. These two giants were falling further and further behind in the fiercely competitive global marketplace. Although no one knows if they will survive as one entity, they would likely have failed without this consolidation. The deal is certainly a harbinger of more mergers.
We make a grave error, however, if we believe that consolidation, in and of itself, is a solution to the underlying problems of the banking industry. We cannot make one healthy bank merely by combining two or more sick ones. And big is not necessarily better, as the problems of Citibank in New York and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in Japan illustrate. 
 If we do not assert more control, banks will continue to do what they can to survive -- pursue mergers and other self-help measures, raise interest rates to attract deposits, invest in speculative ventures, and so on in an endless spiral. We can, through several simple, straightforward steps, create a market environment for banks that will act as a self-governing check on the industry.
The problem is rooted in the 1980's, when bank interest rates were deregulated to compete with money-market funds and other magnets for investor dollars. Because much of their traditional business was being ripped away, banks had to look for new, often riskier investments.
Under normal circumstances, an industry faced with these problems would have shrunk, but because of the safety net of Federal Deposit Insurance the banking industry continued to grow.
Chock-full of insured dollars, without the market discipline to force them to be careful about where they placed these funds, banks fell behind when they entered new, strange and complex fields like investment banking and commercial real estate. For a decade, Congress and regulators looked the other way.
But in the late 1980's, the chickens came home to roost. Banks became much weaker, and taxpayers were faced with billions of dollars in losses.
The problem of shaky and failed loans is sure to continue into the 1990's unless we change the way banks do business.
Certainly, we can give regulators more authority and better tools to intervene when banks get into trouble, and the current bank reform legislation, recently passed by the House Banking Committee, does that. But even the most competent regulator is no match for market scrutiny when it comes to getting a balance sheet into shape.
We need only give the following instructions to our banks:
First, if you accept federally insured deposits, invest them in relatively safe ways. Any one loan from a federally insured bank should be limited to no more than 3 to 4 percent of the bank's capital. No single equity investment of more than 5 percent should be allowed.
Second, the interest on all deposits should not exceed a floating interest rate cap. Weak banks would be prevented from recklessly raising interest rates to lure depositors (a way of staying liquid while trying to climb out of trouble) and would not be allowed to capitalize on the bonanza of a Government guarantee.
A floating interest rate cap and a maximum loan limit would make banks kick their deposit insurance addiction by limiting the Federal Government's safety net to core banking functions needed to serve small borrowers, individuals and midsize companies. The higher-yield, riskier activities would continue, but in separate uninsured affiliates that depend on private investors to raise funds.
Core banking would force banks to become healthy and strong precisely because it would steer them to the markets to raise funds for their newer and riskier investments.
We cannot fail to enact these changes. Mergers, regardless of how numerous or large, will not cure the illness that ails our banks.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Tax Cows of New York

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
The good news for New Yorkers is that real estate prices are collapsing and that the President does not give a damn about the city.
 If the prices of one-family homes in Queens and co-op apartments on Park Avenue were holding up, a lot more taxpayers would cash them in and leave than already have. 
 The evidence about Mr. Bush's attitude toward the crisis in New York is what White House and newspaper reference computers show he has said about it -- not a thing.
 That is good news because New Yorkers can stop wasting time fantasizing that Mr. Bush will ever be of help. Gorbachev yes, Dinkins no.
So we know that if anybody is going to help the city it will have to be the people who make their living in it: us.
Everybody says New York will have to "restructure" itself. God help us, we even have another committee to study it. First, we should restructure our own heads.
I will start with mine. Until recently I thought New Yorkers should just pay more taxes for the privilege of living in the city, and shut up about it. I know now that people want to leave New York not because of taxes but because they are not getting the decent money's worth for them that self-respect demands.
 Seven percent of the households pay 50 percent of the city's personal income taxes. Fewer than 1 percent pay 20 percent. About 1,000 out of 350,000 companies pay 50 percent of the corporate income tax. These high-tax payers benefit directly from only about 12 percent of the $29 billion budget -- the money that goes into police and fire protection, street cleaning, as it is laughingly known, and "amenities" like museums, parks, cultural groups.
Now, that is also the 12 percent of the budget that makes possible the city's major industry: tourism. But how long will tourists pay good money for the joy of consulting changing schedules to find out what museums are closed on which days, as they pick their way among stinking mountains of garbage bags and try to edge around the muggers, hoodlums and confidence men who have taken over Broadway or the professional beggars and cheapjack peddlers who are turning Fifth Avenue into a flea market?
When the supply of masochistic tourists runs out, jobs in restaurants, hotels, entertainment will vanish with them. We will be singing "The Sidewalks of Pompeii."
For New York to cut back on museums, parks, Lincoln Center and performing groups is like an electronics store owner deciding to stock only pencils and expecting shoppers to keep coming in and paying computer prices for them.
Decent streets and protection against crime and fire are the bedrock services that a local government must deliver -- the contract with City Hall. In New York, add culture as economic lifeblood that must not be spilled.
The rest -- decent public schools and hospitals, child care, welfare -- are redistribution of wealth by democratic consent. It is a relatively modern concept, born out of Western enlightenment movements and revolutions. Perhaps that will be mentioned in multicultural courses when they get around to rotten old Western society for a chapter or two.
I am still willing to go on paying ever-higher taxes to live in New York, no matter what. But it has finally sunk into my New York-loving brain that other taxpayers are not as professionally or emotionally tied to New York. Expecting them to go on paying ever more to live in a smelly, dangerous city that gives them ever less is not boosterism -- it's arrogance.
Once Mr. Dinkins has demonstrated to the people who pay the taxes that a decent minimum will be guaranteed to make the city livable for them, he can reasonably say, here is the rest of the news:
One, costs will be cut and management sharpened and here's how. But two, the city will still probably have to charge you more for schools your children will not attend, hospitals you will not enter and welfare you are fortunate enough not to need.
Treated as urban milch cows in a dirty ramshackle barn, many New York upper-bracket taxpayers will try to escape. Given protection and respect for their own needs, I believe, they will stay and pay what is necessary to respect everybody's needs.
 President to city: New who?
 City: York. Come see us sometime; we'll be here. Bring the wife, see the shows.

HEADLINE: Rowe Journal;
Near Old Nuclear Plant, Town Keeps the Faith

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROWE, Mass., July 16

 BODY:
Tucked discreetly into the northern Berkshires, Yankee Rowe is the oldest and perhaps the most picturesque nuclear power plant in America. The trout waters of the Deerfield River cut a glistening path around the containment dome. Bright orange butterflies flutter in and out of the barbed wire fencing.
For three decades, the residents of Rowe have treated their atomic neighbor with the best sort of Yankee hospitality. They have built houses nearby, taken their children on tours and used the plant's taxes to buy services most small towns cannot even dream of. 
 But recently, unsettling news has come from the plant. Several scientists have questioned the safety of Yankee Rowe's reactor vessel, and earlier this month, the new chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission called the possible dangers at the plant his most pressing concern.
Now, many residents of Rowe, population 357, are disturbed. Not because they are seriously worried about an accident at the plant, in the northwest corner of Massachusetts. They are annoyed, they say, by the interference of people who obviously are not like themselves.
"I call them radicals," one Rowe resident, Robert Kenney, said of those calling for the plant to be shut down. "They look like they got their latest clothes out of a Salvation Army box. They go around with pigtails."
Another resident whose husband works at the plant and who insisted that she not be identified, said: "It's yuppie panic. They're people who want you to quit smoking and eat tofu."
And James O'Brien, chairmen of Rowe's Board of Selectmen, said, "They're intellectuals."
By today's standards, 31-year-old Yankee Rowe is a diminutive plant. It generates just under 200 megawatts of electricity, slightly less than one-quarter of what Shoreham, the unopened nuclear plant on Long Island, was supposed to produce.
But Yankee Rowe's significance to the atomic power industry far exceeds its size. The plant is licensed to operate until it turns 40; in the next year it is expected to become the first in the country to apply to extend its life through relicensing.
But the plant may not ever make it that far.
Engineers with the Union of Concerned Scientists say Yankee Rowe's reactor vessel has become so brittle after three decades of nuclear bombardment that it could rupture in an emergency, and they have called for the plant to be shut immediately. While the plant's owners, a consortium of New England utilities, deny the allegations, members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have expressed reservations and are expected to take up the issue later this summer.
Here in Rowe, most people seem to place more faith in the workers who run the plant than in the outsiders who are casting aspersions. These workers are friends and neighbors and relatives, and with the jobless rate in the Berkshires approaching 10 percent, expressing doubts about Yankee Rowe is seen as tantamount to wishing those workers onto the unemployment line.
"I am concerned about the embrittlement," said Dick Quinn, a Rowe resident. "But I trust the people that work there. I don't want to see anybody lose their jobs, especially these days."
Hard times have hit Rowe just as they have the rest of New England, but not quite as hard.
Between the nuclear plant and a major hydroelectric project in town, 85 percent of Rowe's taxes are paid by utility companies. This has made the town the object of more than a little envy in the area.
"They've got the golden egg," Dorothy Stetson, a resident of nearby Heath, said bitterly. "It's just too bad they don't share a little of that."
Rowe may not have much to offer in terms of commerce; the town's only store is a cross between a camping outfitter and a candy shop. But it does have a new firehouse, a library, an elementary school and a newly remodeled town hall. Driving into Rowe, one cannot help appreciating the work of the town's busy highway crew; right at the town line the rutted roads of the Berkshires suddenly become smooth.
Local officials are quick to point out that even if Yankee Rowe were to shut down, the town would still be collecting good money from the hydroelectric plant. This realization has gone a long way toward steadying nerves in town.
As Mr. Kenney, a member of the highway crew as well as the town forest warden and deputy fire chief, put it, "If the plant ever closed, we wouldn't be down the pooper scoop -- Pardon my language."

Big Loss Faced By General Tire

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio, July 19

 BODY:
General Tire, a unit of Continental A.G., the German tire maker, is facing a $100 million loss and is exploring cooperation with the Pirelli Armstrong Tire Company, an Ohio newspaper reported today. Like other tire companies, General Tire has had slumping sales because of the recession, and the company has said that it expects to lay off 600 salaried employees this year, as well as about 175 of the 1,000 workers in its Akron offices.
Alan Ockene, General Tire's president, told The Beacon Journal in Akron that his company and Pirelli Armstrong, a unit of the Italian tire maker, were discussing possible cooperation agreements between certain operations. "Without a merger, if we can save $20 million, why don't we do it?" Mr. Ockene was quoted as saying. He said the negotiations were limited to those concerns. General Tire's losses could reach $100 million this year, Mr. Ockene said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Down in Slow Day; Gold Prices Edge Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled yesterday against most major currencies in light dealings that traders said were driven mostly by internal influences in the foreign exchange markets.
Gold prices edged higher. In New York, gold for current delivery edged up 40 cents an ounce, to $370.60, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank quoted a bid for an ounce of gold at $370.40 as of 4 P.M., up 70 cents from late Thursday. 
 The dollar drifted lower this past week in the aftermath of concerted efforts a week ago by several central banks to curb its rise. Mindful of that unexpected wave of dollar-selling, currency traders have sold dollars themselves, testing the lower end of the dollar's recent trading range. A summertime lull in activity accentuated yesterday's moves.
Francoise Soares-Kemp, a vice president who follows the currency markets for Credit Suisse in New York, said last week's intervention showed traders what the central banks would like to see as the highest levels for the dollar, so the market has "started to look for the bottom."
"This is not based on fundamentals," she said. "It is purely technical trading in a thin market."
Christa Bleyleben, vice president in currency trading at the Bank of Boston, said many large currency traders had changed their trading strategies over the last week "from buying on dips to selling on rallies." She said rumors that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates circulated briefly, but no one appeared to pay much attention to them.
Trading was "more technically fueled" than it was influenced by speculation on the economy and interest rates, she added.
The dollar dropped to 136.40 yen in New York, from 137.65 yen late Thursday. Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar fell to 136.92 yen from 137.17 yen and was quoted later in the day in London at 136.40 yen.
Against the German mark, the dollar fell more than two and a half pfennigs, to 1.7480 marks from 1.7755.
The British pound rose to $1.6900 in London, from $1.6515 late Thursday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.69425 from $1.6645.
Selected dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.51125 Swiss francs, down from 1.5405; 5.9360 French francs, down from 6.0270; 1,303.75 Italian lire, down from 1,322.50, and 1.15975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15775.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
MNC Financial Names New Chief Executive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
MNC Financial Inc., a Baltimore-based banking company that has been hurt by commercial real estate loans, yesterday named Frank P. Bramble chief executive officer. He has been an executive vice president at the company.
He fills a post that has been vacant since the retirement last September of the chairman and chief executive, Alan P. Hoblitzell Jr., who was replaced as chairman by MNC's largest shareholder, Alfred Lerner. 
 Mr. Bramble, who is 43 years old, becomes the youngest chief executive of any banking company as big as MNC, whose $19.2 billion in assets make it te nation's 33d-largest bank holding company. MNC owns the Maryland National Bank and American Security Bank, Washington.
Those two banks were so deeply involved in that region's real estate boom of the 1980's that by 1990 about 26 percent of all MNC loans were for commercial real estate projects, a high portion for a company of MNC's size. Today, those loans account for the majority of the company's nearly $1.82 billion of nonperforming assets -- either loans that are badly delinquent or real estate the company acquired through foreclosures on bad loans.
Mr. Bramble was not directly involved in the real estate lending, but he has taken part in the efforts to correct past mistakes. The activity has been so hectic "that I feel older than 43," he said. He noted that the cost savings from MNC's merger with American Security Bank in 1987 and Equitable Bank of Baltimore in 1989 -- both of which he arranged -- "are hard to find now that they have been buried under all the real estate problems."
To remove the cloud created by the bad real estate loans, Mr. Bramble said MNC must do more than reduce costs by $100 million, as has been planned, and adopt new central controls over lending.
"We have to continue our efforts to sell the bad assets," he said, and maintain MNC's already large business with local consumers and small businesses. Although demand for business loans in the region remains weak, Mr. Bramble said that consumer confidence in the bank was improving, and deposits had been increasing gradually since February.
Nancy Bush, a banking analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, noted that with nearly 15 percent of its assets consisting of badly delinquent loans or foreclosed real estate, the only hope of MNC for sustained profits was "to get rid of the problem loans in huge chunks."
Mr. Bramble said the company was looking at ways to sell the bad loans "in bulk" but declined to describe what progress had been made. Over the last year nonperforming assets have more than doubled from $756.7 million in July 1990. But in the most recent quarter, Mr. Bramble said the pace of deterioration had slowed, so that the increase in the second quarter was only $24.8 million.
"We have identified the problems," he said. "The timetable for disposing of them depends on the market."
Mr. Bramble graduated from Towson State Univeristy with a bachelor's degree in 1976 and attended the University of Wisconsin's graduate school of banking. He lives in Baltimore with his wife and four children.

HEADLINE: 2 Baby Bells' Profits Drop; Third Is Flat

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Three regional phone companies yesterday reported second quarter earnings, with Southwestern Bell and Bell Atlantic posting drops and U S West reporting flat results.
Following are the details of the results:
 
Southwestern Bell
 The Southwestern Bell Corporation said its second-quarter profit fell 34.2 percent, largely because of a one-time charge. 
 For the three months ended June 30, the company earned $172.6 million, or 57 cents a share, down from $262.5 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier.
Even without the one-time charge of $80.7 million, profit would have declined by 3.5 percent primarily because of two regulatory decisions that reduced earnings at its phone company by $14 million.
Revenue rose 3.2 percent, to $2.24 billion from $2.17 billion.
The one-time charge accounted for fees and charges associated with refinancing $732 million in long-term debt that carried interest rates of 11.5 percent to 12.75 percent. The debt was replaced with shorter-term notes with interest rates of 8.3 percent and 7.7 percent.
"The company took advantage of the lowest interest rates in several years and will realize significant savings in interest expenses over the long term," said a spokesman, Jerrell Ross.
"We see solid progress in the last half of this year," said Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive. "The key indicators of our business are strong."
The St. Louis-based company provides phone service to Missouri, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Texas. It also supplies paging equipment, cellular telephone service and phone directories.
The stock closed down 50 cents yesterday, to $53.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
U S West
 U S West Inc. reported earnings of $276.6 million for the second quarter, virtually unchanged from $276.4 million in the second quarter of 1990.
But earnings per share decreased to 70 cents, from 72 cents, largely because the company sold 16.1 million shares of common stock in May 1990, it said.
Revenue rose to $2.5 billion, from $2.41 billion last year.
"Results of our telephone operations were essentially flat, with rate reductions offsetting volume increases," said Richard D. McCormick, president and chief executive. "Increased earnings of certain diversified businesses were offset by higher start-up losses of U S West's international joint ventures."
U S West, based in Englewood, Colo., provides phone service to many Western states. It also owns companies involved in communications, marketing and financial services.
U S West's shares fell 75 cents yesterday, to $34.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 Bell Atlantic

The Bell Atlantic Corporation, based in Philadelphia, reported a 2.1 percent dip in its second-quarter profit, saying a cutback in expenses prevented a steeper decline.
Profit totaled $355.1 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with $362.8 million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was unchanged at $3.08 billion.
"Although our second-quarter results contain some encouraging signs, we have not yet seen across-the-board indications of economic growth," said Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive.
The results include income and expenses from Bell Atlantic's investment in the Telecom Corporation of New Zealand.
Bell Atlantic is the parent of local phone companies providing service to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington. It also provides mobile phone service, financial services and computer services.
The company's stock rose 87.5 cents yesterday, to $48.25 on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: Zenith Posts Wider Loss in Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GLENVIEW, Ill., July 19

 BODY:
The Zenith Electronics Corporation reported today that it had a $26.9 million loss for the second quarter, blaming the recession and continued planned reductions in inventory for its sixth straight quarterly loss.
The latest loss compares with a loss of $11.2 million for the second quarter of 1990. Sales dropped 17.7 percent, to $275 million, from $334 million a year earlier. 
 Zenith, the last United States-based television maker, said it cut costs by $13 million in the quarter but that the cuts were more than offset by lower sales.
"Results in the second quarter were in line with our earlier statements that the first half of 1991 would be difficult," said Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith's chairman. "The second half of the year is normally stronger for consumer electronics sales. And if economic and industry conditions improve, we expect better results in the second half."
For the first half, the company reported a $50.6 million loss, compared with a $15.2 million loss in the 1990 period. Sales fell 16.1 percent, to $578.7 million, from $689.8 million last year.
 
Investment in Advanced TV

Zenith invested about $4 million in the second quarter in two high-definition television technologies on which it has staked much of its future, up from less than $3 million a year ago.
One of the technologies is the company's unique flat-screen tube that promises sharper, glare-free pictures; the other is a digital transmission system for HDTV signals.
Zenith has joined with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in a proposal to develop a national standard for HDTV. Five other companies are competing to set the standard.
In 1988, Zenith posted its first annual gain in four years, and analysts said the positive result could signal a turning point. But the company has had losses totaling $140 million in nine of the ten quarters since then, broken only by a $4 million gain in the fourth quarter of 1989.

HEADLINE: Omaha: Talk, Talk, Talk of Telemarketing

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
If Detroit is the Motor City, then Omaha must be the Motor Mouth City. This low-key community of 350,000 people on the western bank of the Missouri River would never embrace such a saucy slogan, but the fact is that Omaha sets the pace for the world when it comes to making a living on the telephone. And that's just how the city's leaders planned it.
"They put together an exceedingly effective economic development program to attract telecommunications companies at a time when everyone else was concentrating on industry," said Robert Ady, president of the PHH Fantus Corporation, a Chicago-based corporate relocation consulting concern. 
 Cheap real estate, relatively low wages and living costs and a well-educated, reliable work force are also among Omaha's major selling points. Omaha has shown that state-of-the-art telecommunications can be a 20th-century advantage comparable to sitting aside a railroad line in the 19th century. The city best known for its slaughterhouses now has well over 10,000 jobs in telecommunications -- more than double the number of meatpackers -- and an unemployment rate below 3 percent.
During the 1980's, the city's telemarketers gained a nationwide reputation for their ability to handle any special event, any crisis. After Johnson & Johnson found that some of its Tylenol capsules were laced with cyanide, the company chose Omaha as the communications center for its program to exchange capsules for tablets. The Eastman Kodak Company did the same for its instant camera exchange and refund program after a Federal judge ruled that the company had infringed the Polaroid Corporation's patents. And Omaha telemarketers have handled fund raising for the Farm-Aid and Live-Aid rock concerts.
Omaha today is home to a number of large hotel and travel reservation operations, including those for Marriott, Hyatt, Radisson and Westin hotels, as well as the traffic information center for Greyhound bus lines.
It is also the base of operations for three of the nation's five largest telemarketers, as enterprises that sell products and serve consumers over the phone are known. And First Data Resources, a local subsidiary of the American Express Company, is the largest contract processor of credit-card transactions for the nation's banks, handling tens of thousands of charge authorization calls and telephone data transfers daily.
 
Other Successful Uses
 Omaha's use of telecommunications as an economic development tool is hardly unique. Britain has used the privatization and decontrol of its telecommunications industry to help London stay ahead of Frankfurt, Zurich and Paris in the competition to be Europe's financial capital.
New York City and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are partners with private investors in Teleport, a real estate development on Staten Island linking offices there to a satellite transmission park and fiber optic telecommunications systems.
The developers of the planned community of Heathrow, Fla., teamed up with Northern Telecom and the Southern Bell Telephone Company to install fiber optic and digital phone lines to help lure the wealthy to its home sites and businesses to its industrial park. The American Automobile Association said the town's telecommunications helped persuade it to move its headquarters from Fairfax, Va., to Heathrow.
Even tiny Breda, Iowa, a town of 500 that lost its only rail connection to the outside world during the 1980's, managed to attract new business after the privately owned Breda Telephone Corporation built 13 miles of fiber optic lines as links to the A.T.& T. and U S West fiber optic networks. A transportation broker who specializes in helping companies move electronics equipment around the nation now employs 24 residents, and the phone company itself has 100 part-time workers handling calls subcontracted to it by the Omaha-based Sitel Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest telemarketer.
Omaha's drive to make a name for itself as a telecommunications center seems like an obvious strategy in retrospect. The decision of the Federal Government to locate the Strategic Air Command here after World War II made Omaha home to one of the world's most advanced and secure phone systems. That endowed the region with engineers and workers who could also apply their knowledge to local public service.
Two other key advantages were already in place. Because of Omaha's location in the central time zone, it is more convenient to call either coast during the work day than to call from one coast to the other. And the local speech is described by consultants like Mr. Ady as "pure American," easily understood everywhere.
As Steven Idelman, chief executive of Idleman Telemarketing Inc., said, "It's no accident that Johnny Carson, Tom Brokaw and Walter Cronkite all come from this region of the country."
 
 Some Added by Design
 Other elements were added by design. Over the years, state regulators granted local phone companies wide latitude to deploy new services rapidly. Metropolitan Community College developed telecommunications-related courses and training programs. The Chamber of Commerce decided to keep track of the telecommunications capacity of every office building in the city.
The city also benefited from phone companies' investments in switches that protect the area's networks from service interruptions. And Northwestern Bell, the local operating company of U S West, has long made rapid customer service one of its highest priorities.
"We can get a WATS line installed in 20 minutes," said Timothy Placzek, senior vice president of client services at First Data Resources. Mr. Placzek recalled that within four hours Northwestern Bell repairmen wired new lines directly to all 60 desks normally served by an automatic call distributor that had broken down. The major telemarketing companies say Northwestern Bell routinely gives them the home phone numbers of the repairmen who service them.
Omaha's telecommunications drive became so intense during the early 1980's that one American Telephone and Telegraph survey concluded that telemarketing call volume was eight times higher here than in Atlanta, the next most active city. After the A.T.&T. breakup, U S West, the phone company whose 14-state territory includes Nebraska, adopted the slogan "Dial 800 and get Omaha" to promote its services.
 
 Some Advantages Gone
 Some of Omaha's advantages have been lost in recent years. New tariffs since the A.T.& T. breakup have evened out long-distance billing rates, which once favored Omaha and other Midwestern cities. The city sat astride one of the first junctions of east-west and north-south fiber optic lines; now most major cities have their own fiber optic hubs.
The loss of these advantages has hurt. "Charles Schwab recently chose Indianapolis over us for its communications center when it decided to move out of Chicago," said Red Keenan, director of marketing and business development for Omaha. "Ten years ago, they would have come here."
More important, perhaps, companies looking for the most modern telecommunications are more likely to be looking just as hard for broad computer skills as well. In this area, Omaha has far less to offer than communities with big universities or major computer companies.
 
 Companies Continue to Come
 Nevertheless, companies like the Ford Motor Company's credit subsidiary continue to arrive. Ford chose Omaha last year to consolidate 132 offices that answer consumer questions about Ford loans. It will eventually have 325 employees here handling six million calls annually, according to Susan Seidenfeld, director of employee relations.
Meanwhile, established telemarketers seeking low-cost labor have been moving some of their operations out to neighboring Kansas, Iowa and Colorado. But they are adding more advanced services here to exploit Omaha's phone structure.
Today, the city boasts more than 25 telemarketing and reservations companies. Related industries, like printing brochures or making credit cards, have sprung up to serve consumers who respond to telemarketing.
Many more Omahans work at insurance companies or companies like the Union Pacific Railroad. For these companies, the city's superior telecommunications are a secondary but important attraction.
City officials concede that many of the telecommunications jobs offer lower wages than the declining, unionized sectors of the local economy, like meatpacking. Reservations clerks, most of them women or students, earn about $5 an hour and job turnover is about 50 percent annually. Those with more difficult telephone sales jobs can earn as much as $13 an hour, plus benefits and bonuses. The trend, telemarketing executives here say, is toward more extensive services, higher wages and benefits and less staff turnover.
At WATS Marketing of America Inc., a calling program to generate lists of consumers who want American Express card applications mailed to them has been supplanted by a program in which WATS employees fill out the applications while callers are still on the line. The employees must be able to answer a wide range of questions about the cards' benefits and limits.
"Our work is getting much more interactive," said Charles Brooks, president of WATS, which was acquired by American Express in 1980. "We are 75 percent full time now, compared to less than 50 percent just five years ago."
Supporting such businesses is a reservoir of telecommunications engineering talent that telemarketing executives say is unmatched by any other small city in the nation.
"It's not just the equipment but the concentration of know-how that makes a difference," said Mary Swenson, senior vice president in charge of operations for Utell International, a British-owned reservations company that specializes in booking overseas hotels for travel agents. Utell moved to Omaha from New York City in 1986. "The vendors have seen so many telecom centers that they understand the nuances and can give you helpful advice. And when we go out to recruit a telecommunications manager, we get twice as many qualified applicants as in comparable cities."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Net Fell 91.9% In Quarter

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported yesterday that earnings dived 91.9 percent and revenue declined by 10.7 percent in the second quarter. At the same time, however, the company raised hopes that it might be able to ride a sluggish United States economic recovery during the second half of the year, saying it saw some new strength in domestic markets.
But the company also sounded a bleak note about the international economy, saying it had seen further deterioration in its Asian and European markets. Over all, I.B.M. said it was still grappling with a difficult global economy and competitive pressures in many of its product lines, as well as trying to manage a difficult transition to new products in several of its major businesses. 
 The company warned Wall Street of the impending poor quarter in a June 20 conference call, and there were rumors earlier in the week that it would report a loss, analysts said. As a result, the stock market reacted positively yesterday to the earnings announcement. I.B.M.'s share price rose $2.25, to $100.50, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Several Analysts See Daylight

Moreover, several analysts said they believed that the company had hit bottom during the last three months and would begin making progress toward a financial turnaround in the third quarter.
"I think they've reached the inflection point," said Rick Martin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. He added that he had changed his rating on I.B.M.'s stock to a "buy" after the company held another conference call with analysts yesterday.
"The real key is the phrase, 'the U.S. is starting to show some positive momentum,' " he said.
The International Business Machines Corporation said that earnings for the second quarter fell to $114 million, or 20 cents a share, from $1.41 billion, or $2.45 a share, for the comparable period last year. Revenue fell to $14.73 billion from $16.5 billion.
Part of the momentum may come from the company's continuing restructuring effort, which has led more I.B.M. employees than originally expected to take an early retirement plan option. The computer maker has been saying that it expects 10,000 workers to leave during 1991, in addition to 4,000 who left as part of the leveraged buyout of I.B.M.'s typewriter and keyboard division. Yesterday, the company said that an additional 3,000 would leave by the end of the year.
"We have accelerated our restructuring efforts," said John F. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman. "And we expect to reduce our worldwide work force by at least 17,000 employees this year." The company began the year with 373,000 employees worldwide.
The impact of the employee departures is a special second-quarter charge of $200 million, or about 20 cents a share, according to the company.
 
 Revamping Expected to Help

"I.B.M. is doing a better job," at reducing its cost structure, said Daniel Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, adding, "even though they have yet to use the word that everyone wants them to use, that is, 'layoff.' " Analysts predicted that the company would benefit from revamping during the second half of the year.
Mr. Mandresh said that the company was also likely to benefit during the third quarter from the first shipments of its new top-of-the-line water-cooled System 390 mainframes. The machines are the heart of I.B.M.'s new high-end computer generation, and many large corporations have been waiting until these systems are ready before upgrading to the new computer family. The company, based in Armonk, N.Y., said yesterday that the machines were on schedule for a third-quarter introduction.
Several analysts said that I.B.M. had now shipped about a dozen of the systems as part of a field testing program and that shipments would increase throughout the second half of the year.
 
 Billions More in Revenue Possible

The company could realize between $3 billion and $4 billion in additional revenue before the end of the year if the new computer line is successful, Mr. Martin said.
I.B.M. has also introduced a number of new desktop models that it hopes will stop the erosion of market share it has seen during the first six months of 1991.
But this progress in introducing new product lines may be offset by foreign economic declines. Last week, a senior I.B.M. official in Japan said that the second quarter had been even worse than the first. Mr. Akers was quoted last month in an internal memorandum, calling that quarter in Japan a disaster. The Japanese executive said that the company's "big ticket" mainframes had simply stopped selling during the second quarter and that the rest of Asia was also seeing new declines.
 
 'I.B.M.'s Worst Nightmare'

"This has to be I.B.M.'s worst nightmare," Mr. Mandresh said. "This is a company with 60 percent of its revenues from foreign sales."
I.B.M. may be particularly vulnerable in Japan because its business is concentrated in the banking and financial services sectors -- traditional purchasers of the largest computers. These businesses have recently been hard hit financially.
The impact of foreign currency values on the company was essentially neutral in the second quarter, said James Clippard, I.B.M.'s director of investor relations, who spoke with Wall Street analysts in a conference call yesterday morning.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Close Two Plants, Cut 6,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 19

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it would close two North American assembly plants, one in Van Nuys, Calif., and one in Scarborough, Ontario, putting almost 6,000 people out of work.
G.M.'s move is in line with the pledge by Robert C. Stempel, the chairman, to balance the productive capacity of the No. 1 auto maker with demand for its vehicles by 1992. Despite several plant closings since 1986, dwindling G.M. vehicle sales in the United States and Canada have resulted in more plant space and output than the company needs. 
 Automotive analysts said, however, that G.M. must close three or four more assembly plants in order to fulfill Mr. Stempel's goal. Jerry Paul, automotive analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated G.M.'s North American capacity at about 6.2 million cars and trucks, with expected 1992 sales in the neighborhood of 5.4 million.
A spokesman said G.M. probably would not have to take an additional write-off to cover the costs of closing the two plants, since an adequate reserve was established last year.
Edmond Dilworth, a G.M. spokesman, said G.M. had tried and failed to make a business case for assembling one or more car or truck models at Van Nuys, which will build the current models of the Pontiac Firebird and the Chevrolet Camaro until the summer of 1992. Then it will be closed. The Scarborough plant will continue building a G.M. van until 1993 before closing.
About 2,700 workers will be laid off at the Van Nuys plant. Already, 900 employees have been temporarily dismissed.
Although G.M. workers had received hints that the plants were vulnerable to shutdown, the announcement about the Van Nuys plant nevertheless provoked anger from the United Automobile Workers union. Workers at the Scarborough plant are represented by the Canadian Automobile Workers union.
Stephen P. Yokich, a U.A.W. vice president, accused G.M. of "shamelessly breaking commitments" to workers in Van Nuys. G.M. managers had often asked workers to cooperate with innovative, Japanese-style work-place practices, saying they would help preserve the plant's competitiveness and the workers' jobs.
 
 Workers' Seniority Rights
 Some Scarborough workers may be able to exercise seniority rights to move to other jobs in G.M. plants in Ontario, the company said. George Peapples, president of G.M. Canada, said the announcement was being made two years early so that workers would receive "the fullest opportunity for planning for their future."
The closing of the Van Nuys plant, the last assembly plant owned by a Big Three auto maker in California, reflects in some measure the loss of status of G.M. vehicles on the West Coast. Mr. Dilworth said G.M.'s market share was about 15 percent in California, compared with about 35 percent nationwide.
The ripple effect of the plant closings may cause layoffs at G.M. parts plants elsewhere. Steel body stampings for the Camaro and Firebird are shipped to the West Coast from G.M. plants in Marion, Ind., and Grand Rapids, Mich.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From U.S. Letter Rejecting Redistricting Plan

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Assistant Attorney General John R. Dunne's letter to the New York City Districting Commission:  
 In our view, the New York City Districting Commission was faced with a job of staggering proportions, namely, to divide a city of over seven million people into 51 new Council districts while addressing the historical inability of the many minority communities in the city to elect candidates of their choice.
We also know that this enormous task necessarily involved many compromises and difficult choices; yet the Commission has made great strides in drawing Council districts which greatly enhance minority voting strength overall. In many areas of the city minority voters will now have an opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to office for the first time. Thus, we have concluded that most of the districting plan satisfies the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5.
We are concerned, however, with the choices made throughout the districting process with regard to Hispanic voters. The 1990 Census reveals that the minority population of the city has increased dramatically, particularly the Hispanic population. However, it seems that in at least two areas of the city, the inappropriate choice was made to draw particular districts at the expense of Hispanic voting strength. . . .
In one area, the proposed configuration of district boundary lines appears to have been drawn in such a way as to minimize Hispanic voting strength. Specifically, we refer to the overconcentration of Hispanic population in the Williamsburg area in Brooklyn (District 34) at the expense of Hispanic voters in the adjacent district in Bushwick and Cypress Hills (District 37). We are aware that the Commission rejected available alternatives that would likely result in an additional district, which would provide Hispanic voters in Bushwick and Cypress Hill an equal opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to office. . . .
Additionally, with regard to proposed District 8 in the East Harlem-Bronx area, serious allegations have been raised that as in District 37, a series of boundary line changes were made over the course of the districting process which ultimately resulted in a district that was purported to be an Hispanic district but which will likely result in a district in which Hispanic voters will not be able to elect a candidate of their choice.
In light of the consideration discussed above, I cannot conclude, as I must under the Voting Rights Act, that the city's burden has been sustained in this instance. Accordingly, on behalf of the Attorney General, I must object to the 1991 districting plan for the City of New York, only with regard to the manner in which it treats the Williamsburg and Bushwick areas and the District 8 (East Harlem-Bronx) area. . . .

HEADLINE: U.S. REJECTS NEW YORK PLAN FOR CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS; FINDS HISPANIC VOTERS HURT

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The Justice Department today blocked use of a new districting plan for the New York City Council, saying that it "consistently disfavored" Hispanic voters in violation of Federal law.
The redistricting plan for an expanded and more powerful City Council was a central element of New York's historic effort to make its government more reflective of the city's racial and ethnic diversity. Today's decision threw that process into at least temporary disarray, casting doubt on whether the city could hold elections for the new Council on schedule in September and November. 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins and other New York political leaders scrambled tonight to salvage the elections. But Hispanic groups vowed to seek a postponement and send the entire plan back to the drawing board. [Page 23.]
 
'Job of Staggering Proportions'
 The Bush Administration is trying to appeal to Hispanic voters across the country, but in objecting to the New York City plan, Assistant Attorney General John R. Dunne couched his concerns in legal language, citing court precedents and statutory standards.
In redistricting a multiracial city of more than seven million people, Mr. Dunne said, New Yorkers faced "a job of staggering proportions" and met their responsibilities in many parts of the city.
But he said that New York made an "inappropriate choice," to the detriment of Hispanic voters, in several parts of the city. He formally objected to three of the 51 districts proposed for the new City Council: District 34, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn; the adjoining District 37, in the Bushwick-Cypress Hills areas of Brooklyn, and District 8, which combines East Harlem with a predominantly Hispanic part of the Bronx.
 
New Enforcement Vigor
 The redistricting plan was submitted by the city in June, a tortuous decade after the filing of the lawsuit that ultimately killed New York's Board of Estimate and gave birth to the new Council. In 1989, the United States Supreme Court ruled that New York's government, with its powerful and idiosyncratic board. discriminated against minority groups by violating the constitutional principle of one person, one vote.
Under the Voting Rights Act, the city may not use its Council districting plan until it is revised and approved by either the Justice Department or the Federal District Court here.
The objections to the New York plan provide further evidence of the new vigor with which the Justice Department is enforcing the Voting Rights Act as cities, states and counties redraw election maps to take account of the 1990 census results. In the last three weeks, Mr. Dunne, who is in charge of the civil rights division of the department, has objected to redistricting plans for both houses of the state legislatures in Mississippi and Louisiana and for the Virginia House of Delegates.
Mr. Dunne said the department would work with New York City to review a revised plan as swiftly as possible, so as not to disrupt this year's election schedule.
"I don't think it should delay the election," Mr. Dunne said at a small news conference here this evening. He said the problems "could be corrected by relatively simple adjustments," and he said he was "committed to turn around in 24 hours" any revised plan submitted to the department for review.
 
Proportional Representation
 A spokeswoman for the City Districting Commission, Leah C. Johnson, said the Justice Department action "could put the election in jeopardy." But she said members of the commission "most definitely" want to see the election held on schedule.
Mr. Dinkins said he, too, was hopeful, noting that the Government had rejected only three districts. But once the commission convenes, it has the power to redraw any of the lines anywhere in the city. And the commission's decisions are likely to be marked by the same political contentiousness that characterized the entire mapmaking process.
Mr. Dunne adamantly denied that the Justice Department required proportional representation on the Council for members of minority groups. The law "insures fair election opportunities and does not require that any jurisdiction attempt to guarantee racial or ethnic proportional results," he said in a letter to Judith Reed, counsel to the Redistricting Commission, an independent agency that adopted the plan on June 3.
Mr. Dunne, a Long Island Republican who served for 24 years in the New York State Senate, said Justice Department lawyers were concerned with "choices made throughout the districting process with regard to Hispanic voters."
"The 1990 census reveals that the minority population of the city has increased dramatically, particularly the Hispanic population," he wrote. "However, it seems that in at least two areas of the city, the inappropriate choice was made to draw particular districts at the expense of Hispanic voting strength, causing the Hispanic electorate to be unfairly underrepresented on the Council."
 
'Serious Allegations'
 In northern Brooklyn, Mr. Dunne wrote, "the proposed configuration of district boundary lines appears to have been drawn in such a way as to minimze Hispanic voting strength." He said there was an "overconcentration of Hispanic population" in District 34 at the expense of Hispanic voters in District 37.
The city reported that Hispanic people accounted for 50.2 percent of the voting-age population in District 8, which includes East Harlem and a small piece of the Bronx. But Mr. Dunne said the city had failed to disprove "serious allegations" that Hispanic voters there would be unable to elect a candidate of their choice.
Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, certain states with a history of discrimination must obtain approval from the Justice Department or the Federal District Court here before they may make any change, however minor, in voting laws or election procedures. This "preclearance" requirement applies to nine states and portions of seven other states, including three boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Democratic member of Congress from the Bronx, said he was "very pleased" with the Justice Department's decision. "It is a significant victory for the principle of equitable representation in government for all of our citizens," said Mr. Serrano, who was born in Puerto Rico.
In his letter, Mr. Dunne praised the efforts of the Districting Commission.
"In many areas of the city," he said, "minority voters will now have an opportunity to participate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice to office for the first time."
Thus, he said, "most of the districting plan satisfies the preclearance requirements of Section 5." But those words of praise have no immediate practical effect, for the plan as a whole is, as Mr. Dunne said, "legally unenforceable."
Next Monday was the deadline for candidates to file nominating petitions with the City Board of Elections. The primary is scheduled for Sept. 12, with the general election to follow on Nov. 5. Council members elected this year would serve two-year terms. Elections for regular four-year terms would be held in 1993.
 
Alter's District
 In an unusual coda to his letter, Mr. Dunne discussed a controversy involving Susan D. Alter, a Councilwoman from Brooklyn who has filed a lawsuit asserting that she was discriminated against because she is white. In the past, she has won re-election in a district dominated by members of minority groups. Under the new plan, she would have to run in a white-majority district where another incumbent, Noach Dear, has stronger white support.
Referring to Ms. Alter's situation without naming her, Mr. Dunne said it was wrong for anyone to suggest that Justice Department policy required the city to draw districts to insure that Council members would have the same race and ethnic background as a majority of the people in their districts.
Census figures show that New York, the nation's largest city, had a population of 7.3 million in 1990. There were 2.1 million blacks, accounting for 28.7 percent of the city's population, and 1.8 million Hispanic people, accounting for 24.4 percent of the city's population.

HEADLINE: U.S. Backs Taiwan on Trade Agency

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
In a reversal likely to win votes in Congress for trade preferences for China, the Bush Administration said today that Taiwan should join the main international organization that oversees world trade.
The policy shift comes after weeks of sometimes strenuous interagency debate, and despite China's warning that such a move would be "totally unacceptable," leading to concerns among some that China would retaliate against United States imports. 
 But Harry Harding, asenior fellow and China specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that China's protests might be mostly oratory, because Taiwan has applied to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a "customs territory" and not as a sovereign nation.
China and Taiwan have been increasingly willing to compromise on sovereignty issues in recent years and join the same institutions, Mr. Harding said. Taiwan increasingly uses the name of its capital, Taipei, in international forums. Taiwan's athletes now compete in the Olympics as representatives of "Chinese Taipei," while its bankers serve at the Asian Development Bank as officials from "Taipei, China."
 
Wooing Anti-Communist Senators
 Mr. Harding said that he knew of no evidence of a deal between Taipei and Beijing, but that the President's letter would give each capital what its leaders wanted. China would retain its access to the United States market, while Taiwan would enter the trade organization.
The Adminstration's new position was made public today in a letter from President Bush to a group of 15 senators led by Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, who had demanded the change, along with four other, less controversial concessions in exchange for their support for an unconditional renewal. The President's letter also addressed the other four concessions in general terms.
In terms of domestic politics, the Bush letter not only represents a calculated attempt to woo anti-Communist senators who support Taiwan but it provides political cover for Democratic farm-state senators to cross party lines to support the Administration. Constitutents of those senators have been concerned that China could cut off American agricultural imports if Congress revoked China's trade status or renewed it with conditions.
Almost all the United States' trading partners, including Iraq and Libya, have most-favored-nation status, which allows imports from those countries to enter the United States at the lower of two tariff rates for each type of product. Revoking China's most-favored-nation status would increase tariffs on average about eight times for its exports to the United States.
But many members of Congress have been appalled by China's human-rights record, ballooning trade surplus with the United States and reluctance to restrict arms exports.
Reacting to the military crackdown on the democracy movement in June 1989, the House of Representatives voted last year to renew China's trade status but made future renewals conditional on human-rights improvements, but the Senate never acted on the bill.
Last week, the House voted by a narrow margin to revoke most-favored-nation status for China, and by a vote of 313 to 112 to attach conditions to any renewal.
Senator George J. Mitchell, Democrat of Maine and the Senate majority leader, has introduced a bill to attach conditions to the renewal. Mr. Mitchell announced today that he had scheduled debate on the bill to begin on the Senate floor at 3 P.M. on Monday, and that a vote would be held no earlier than 7 P.M. the same day.
 
'It Is a Strong Signal'
 Reaction in the Senate to the President's letter was mixed today. Mr. Baucus praised the letter and said he would support the Administration next week, defying his party's leadership to do so.
"This is a significant breakthrough in United States policy," he said. "It is a strong signal that the U.S. will not allow China to dictate its policy toward Taiwan."
But Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico and a co-signer of Mr. Baucus's letter, said he was inclined to support Mr. Mitchell because the President's response did not go far enough in addressing his concerns about China's poor human-rights record, arms exports and trade surplus with the United States.
An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said several senators had said a change in policy toward Taiwan would be critical to their votes on China's most-favored-nation status. Republican vote-counters have estimated that for Monday's vote, they have the support of at least the 34 senators needed to sustain a veto, and might win up to a dozen more votes on any effort to override a Presidential veto.
 
Letter Called Inadequate
 Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the sponsor of the bill to attach conditions, said today that the President's letter was inadequate and that she would continue to push for conditions.
"The letter does not say anything except on the Taiwan issue, which is in our bill anyway," she said.
Changing the United States policy toward Taiwan will do little if anything to free students imprisoned after the military crackdown or address other human-rights violations in China, she said.
Taiwan applied to the trade organization on Jan. 1, 1990, but no action has been taken on its application as member countries have been reluctant to antagonize China. But this spring, France indicated that it might be willing to support Taiwan's application.
That alarmed trade officials in the Administration, who became concerned that France would curry favor for its companies in Taiwan's recently announced six-year, $300 billion public-works program.
China applied to the trade organization in 1986, and a working group has been set up to review its application. But membership requires a country to give equal treatment to foreign and domestic companies, and China's economy remains so centrally controlled that trade experts consider it unlikely that China will be able to join the organization in the next several years.

HEADLINE: PRETORIA ADMITS MAKING PAYMENTS TO MANDELA FOES

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, July 19

 BODY:
The South African Government admitted today for the first time that it secretly gave money to the black political organization Inkatha in its often violent rivalry with the more popular African National Congress.
The admission, following disclosures in a weekly newspaper, was one of the strongest confirmations of repeated charges leveled by the congress and others that the white-dominated Government of South Africa had been using its resources to bolster the congress's principal black opponent. President F. W. de Klerk said today that such covert aid had been cut off by his Government in March 1990. 
 Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, after the appearance of the newspaper report, said that the Government had paid for two political rallies held by Inkatha, despite Pretoria's assertions of impartiality at the time. He was responding to a report in The Weekly Mail, the country's leading anti-apartheid newspaper, that the security police channeled nearly $100,000 to finance the Inkatha rallies on Nov. 5, 1989, and March 25, 1990.
 
Documentation for Charge
 The weekly newspaper said it had acquired a lengthy police memorandum, letters, deposit slips and bank receipts to back up its assertions that the police were using Inkatha and its leader, Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, to counter the rising influence of the African National Congress.
The leaked documents constitute the first detailed evidence of assistance by the security forces to the Inkatha Freedom Party. They lend fresh credibility to numerous allegations of police bias in favor of Inkatha, whose supporters have been fighting supporters of the African National Congress and its allies. By one estimate, 10,000 people, virtually all of them black, have been killed in the political violence since 1986.
Mr. Vlok conceded that money was given to Inkatha for the rallies but denied that it came through the police, despite documents to the contrary obtained by The Weekly Mail. He said the Government had budgeted the money for a campaign to combat Western economic sanctions.
"Both overt and covert assistance was, on request, provided to a wide spectrum of persons and institutions in South Africa in an attempt to combat sanctions effectively," Mr. Vlok said. "Mass gatherings by an organization such as Inkatha would have made a significant contribution to the fight against sanctions."
Inkatha has opposed sanctions, contending that they hurt blacks by depriving them of jobs. The African National Congress supports sanctions as a weapon against the white minority Government. The United States last week lifted its package of sanctions imposed by Congress, and some other countries are following suit.
The disclosure today focused new attention on the charges by Government critics like Nico Basson, a former army major who alleged that the South African military supplied automatic rifles to Inkatha supporters for use in their fights with congress supporters.
"It is evident to us that the Government is pursuing a double agenda of talking peace while it wages war on the A.N.C. and the democratic movement," Nelson Mandela, the congress's president, said.
Speaking to journalists before flying abroad on a tour that will take him to Latin America and the Caribbean, Mr. Mandela said the police should confine themselves to maintaining law and order. He said there was no point in talking to the Government if it could not restrain the police. He said he had brought instances of police complicity in the ongoing violence to the Government's attention, but without result.
Chief Buthelezi has presented Inkatha as the moderate alternative in black politics and the disclosure dealt a severe setback to the Zulu-based organization's credibility and his own political ambitions. Tonight in a statement issued at his headquarters in Ulundi, Chief Buthelezi acknowledged that Inkatha had a bank account in Durban, as The Weekly Mail alleged, but denied knowledge of police payments.
"I knew nothing about these transactions," Chief Buthelezi said. "I was never involved in them and I had no idea whatsoever that money had been deposited in a Durban Inkatha bank account."
The Weekly Mail, in reporting the story, said that "there is no conclusive evidence that Buthelezi or members of Inkatha knew that the money deposited came directly from the security police."
But President de Klerk lent credence to the account by recalling in his own statement today that on March 1, 1990, he had ordered an investigation into secret funds and projects. Subsequently, he said, "numerous covert operations were canceled in an orderly fashion."
Mr. de Klerk said it was not the Government's policy to support any political organization directly or indirectly.
The Weekly Mail's allegations center around a 10-page memorandum written in Afrikaans by Maj. Louis Botha, a senior security police officer in the Durban region, to police headquarters in Pretoria. In the memorandum, Major Botha requested about $50,000 to finance Chief Buthelezi's rally at King's Park in Durban on March 25, 1990, "to show everyone that he has a strong base." President de Klerk legalized the African National Congress on Feb. 2, 1990, and released Mr. Mandela nine days later.
 
Payments by Police
 "It should also be accepted that Inkatha does not have the financial means to arrange such a gathering on its own," said the memorandum allegedly written by Major Botha. An unsuccessful rally, it warned, could have "far-reaching implications" for South Africa as well as Chief Buthelezi, who might end up allying Inkatha with the African National Congress.
The police actually paid about $60,000, according to the receipts. But only 10,000 people came to the Inkatha rally, a far smaller turnout than more than 100,000 who showed up to hear the newly freed Mr. Mandela at the same venue a month earlier. The Inkatha rally was followed by a vicious new outbreak of fighting between Inkatha and congress supporters in central Natal.
Another letter, allegedly written by Brig. J. A. Steyn, the deputy regional commander of the security police in Natal, said Chief Buthelezi was grateful for another payment of about $40,000 for the Inkatha rally on Nov. 5, 1989, which was addressed by the Zulu King, Goodwill Zwelethini.
"Chief Buthelezi was very emotional when a copy of the receipt was given to him," the letter said. "He could not say thank you enough and said that he had not expected it."
The security police, who focused on political rather than criminal offenses, were officially disbanded and reassigned to criminal investigation earlier this year, but suspicions remain that some are still involved in covert operations.
Anton Harber, the Weekly Mail's editor, said it obtained the documents earlier this week and that a team of reporters spent two days scrutinizing them before the article appeared. Mr. Harber declined to say where they came from but affirmed that the documents and their source were authentic.

HEADLINE: Cardinals, Throngs and Carnations Put End to Rizzo Era in Philadelphia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 19

 BODY:
They were young and old, but mostly over 50. They were black and white, but mostly white working people from ethnic neighborhoods. They were Republicans and Democrats, but nearly all were Rizzocrats, the name given to tens of thousands of Philadelphians who religiously voted for the former Mayor, Frank L. Rizzo, no matter where the Democrat-turned-Republican was on the ballot.
Yesterday and today Rizzocrats and others came to pay respects to the cop-turned-mayor who became a legend in Philadelphia politics. Mr. Rizzo, who was 70 years old, died of a heart attack on Tuesday in the midst of his fifth campaign for mayor. 
 Today, in a funeral presided over by two cardinals and worthy of a head of state, about 2,000 people crowded into the Cathedral Basilica of SS. Peter and Paul, a 145-year-old cathedral on Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia's showcase boulevard lined with trees, fountains and museums.
About 300 mourners stood outside in the 90-degree heat in the hope of being able to get inside the Roman-Corinthian-style structure.
 
Praise From Cardinal
 Inside, mourners heard Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of the Philadelphia Roman Catholic Archdiocese praise the blunt, no-nonsense politician as a compassionate, caring man who, for so many people, was "God's answer to the call of the needy."
Cardinal Bevilacqua was joined by his predecessor, John Cardinal Krol, 80 years old and in frail health, who was rolled into the cathedral in a wheelchair.
Virtually all the major figures of Pennsylvania politics had assembled inside the cathedral, along with Dick Thornburgh, the United States Attorney General who is a former Pennsylvania Governor. They included Gov. Robert P. Casey, Senators Arlen Specter and Harris Wofford and Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia.
After the mass, a procession of more than 100 cars slowly moved along a nine-mile route, taking a final circle around City Hall, to the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Cheltenham Township, just outside the city limits. Thousands of people along the route stopped what they were doing to watch the procession and Mr. Rizzo's hearse, which was decorated with a floral display in which "Frank Forever" was written in red carnations. In the background of the display was the city's skyline, cut out of blue Styrofoam.
Mr. Rizzo, whose roller-coaster political career polarized the city, died a winner. His last triumph was an upset victory in the Republican mayoral primary in May. But he died without having to test his strength against the Democratic candidate, former District Attorney Edward G. Rendell, in the November general election. He had lost his last two attempts to recapture the mayor's office, which he held from 1972 to 1980, and the consensus among political analysts was that he would have run a very good race, but would have lost again. The Republicans now appear to be at a loss to replace him.
In his eulogy at the cathedral, the Rev. Richard J. Skelly, a longtime Rizzo ally, spoke of the mystery of death and the special confusion it sows when the deceased is someone as vibrant as Mr. Rizzo. "With the death of Frank Rizzo, that booming voice is silent," he said. "The hands that so many thousands clasped move no more."
Hundreds of police, from as far away as Chicago, sat holster-to-holster in the pews, paying respect to Mr. Rizzo, who became one of the nation's most well-known police commissioners in the racially turbulent 1960's and early 1970's.
Many national figures -- including former Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter, Vice President Dan Quayle, Sylvester Stallone and Frank Sinatra -- had all inquired about the services but did not come. "I know the Nixon people were worried about the heat," said Joseph Cascerceri, Mr. Rizzo's press secretary.
On Thursday, the body of Mr. Rizzo, wearing his eyeglasses and customary pinstripe suit, was laid out in a flag-draped coffin for a public viewing. About 14,000 mourners and others queued up in a line that at its peak at 7 P.M. wound about a half-mile around the cathedral. Ten people collapsed from heat exhaustion, and the enormous bronze doors on the brownstone cathedral did not close for seven hours until the last mourner in line passed through them at about midnight.
No sooner did the doors close than a crowd of about 200 disappointed people materialized in the darkness, mostly blue-collar workers who had just got out of work. "Frank definitely wouldn't be happy about this," said a disgruntled mourner.
Why all these people came to the viewing and funeral says as much about their lives and Philadelphia as it does about Frank Rizzo and his dual reputation as both a tough police official with big heart and also as a racist.
Some came to mourn the end of a political era in which politicians like Mr. Rizzo tirelessly handed out favors to constituents and formed public policies without the aid of opinion polls. "He wasn't like a normal politician who lies through his teeth," said Denise L. DeRosa, a 37-year-old restaurant manager from South Philadelphia, where Mr. Rizzo grew up.
"He helped my cousin with muscular dystrophy get a wheelchair," said Frank D. Punzo, a financial analyst who also lives in South Philadelphia. "There had been a waiting list and everything and Frank Rizzo pushed it along. He was always there to help the normal person."
Many mourners said they came to savor for one last time the special sort of civic pride that Frank Rizzo sparked among them. "When I was a teen-ager in the late 1970's, Frank Rizzo was in control and the city was in control and you were proud to be a Philadelphian," said John A. Hosovsky, a 30-year-old restaurant manager. "Now I'm ashamed to say I'm from Philadelphia, there is so much crime and poor leadership."
 
Back When Teams Won
 Joseph A. Pizzo Jr., 31, a mechanical engineer and a distant cousin of Mr. Rizzo, agreed. "Philadelphia is a national joke now," he said. But that was not all that mattered, said Mr. Pizzo, who grew up in Philadelphia but now lives in Cherry Hill, N.J. "Frank Rizzo wasn't a technician in city finance but at least he gave the feeling that he was doing the best he could. The sports teams were winning back them, too."
Among the mourners were some blacks. They either dismissed the charges of racism against Mr. Rizzo or, more often, said they forgave. "If it was back in the 1970's, I wouldn't be in this line," said Gregg M. Ford, 40, a probation officer. "But I think he mended his ways."
Ron Dixon, who said he was honored to be one of the police officers guarding the coffin, said, "All I know is hearsay about racism and brutality."
"I loved him," said Tresa M. Brown, 39, an unemployed nurse's aide, who said Mr. Rizzo showed his concern about the black neighborhoods by providing highly visible police protection. "He was not at fault for the police brutality," she said. "He was in his office and he had no idea what some of his police officers were doing."
Frank Rizzo knew how passionately people felt about him. "I would want them to think of me as a man who tried to make this city better and their lives better," he once said, referring to his supporters. "And for my detractors, I would want put on my tombstone, "He's really dead."'

HEADLINE: Banks in a Shadow

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The proposed alliance between Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover puts other full-service New York banks under increased pressure to improve their operations, either by finding partners or cutting expenses, or both.
 The new Chemical, which will be the second- largest American bank, after Citibank, will threaten nearly every business line of the other large New York banks. In consumer banking, Chemical's new size will give it the muscle to spend more to advertise and develop new products and the larger scale to deliver its services inexpensively. A bigger Chemical will also be able to cut prices to take market share from its rivals.
 
 Mergers May Help Profits

William T. Gregor, a consultant at the MAC Group, a Boston consulting firm, noted that because banks were suffering from sluggish loan demand and too much competition, "mergers, and the savings they produce, are perhaps the best way for a large bank to show good earnings growth." 
 In corporate finance, the improvement in Chemical Bank's financial strength and credit ratings should make it much more attractive to corporate treasurers, who prefer to deal with the strongest banks when arranging long-term foreign exchange trades, borrowings and cash management services.
Because of the estimated $650 million of annual cost savings from the Chemical merger, and the extra $1.25 billion of fresh capital it expects to raise next year, "the new Chemical Bank is well positioned to become the first New York bank to break out of the New York market in a big way and acquire large banking companies in the New England or mid-Atlantic states," said Robert B. Hedges Jr., a MAC Group vice president.
The challenges posed by the Chemical merger are different for each of the large New York banks, depending on their own condition and strategy. Least affected, analysts say, are Bankers Trust and J. P. Morgan, which do not cater to consumers, preferring to concentrate on corporate banking services.
At Citicorp, executives say they are sticking with their plans to cut costs internally and to shed non-essential businesses, like the municipal bond insurance unit that was sold last week. Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, expects the fastest growth in consumer banking to come overseas. Although Citicorp has recently improved its financial condition enough to meet next year's minimum capital standards, its stock price remains too low for it to make large acquisitions without issuing so many new shares that existing stockholders would suffer. (Citicorp shares closed at $15.125 yesterday, down 12.5 cents.) The bank also lacks the capital to make purchases in cash.
For Chase Manhattan and the Bank of New York, the merger of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover will be a serious challenge. Chase and Bank of New York are now a distant third and fourth, respectively, in the rankings of New York consumer banks and they are bound to suffer in competition with the new Chemical for corporate business.
"Bankers like to be large, and for Chase Manhattan and Bank of New York, whose rankings in the New York market and the national lending market are eroding, the other mergers have to be causing some hard thinking," said Richard Pike, a banking specialist at Chancellor Capital Management, an investment advisory firm in New York.
James J. McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm specializing in banks, said, "There are more reasons why Chase and Bank of New York would not merge with each other" than reasons why they would, "but it is clear that the other merger in town will cause them to think harder about the whole possibility."
 
 Equals Merge More Easily
 He said that one of the main problems of such a combination was that unlike Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, which could merge essentially as equals, Bank of New York is less than half the size of Chase.
If Chase and Bank of New York do decide to grow through acquisitions outside New York, there will be plenty of cost-savings opportunities.
Out-of-region bank mergers do not save as much in costs as local mergers, but analysts say they could still produce significant savings. Mr. Hedges of the MAC Group estimated that savings from trimming executive staffs and combining computer systems equal between 10 and 20 percent of the acquired bank's non-interest expenses.
As a rule, banking analysts say the greatest cost savings are realized from mergers within a single market. Certainly the Bank of New York's ability to reduce expenses by $150 million in 1990, after the 1988 merger with Irving Bank, was one reason Wall Street took seriously the $650 million in savings projected from the Chemical merger.
 
 Chase Studies Its Options
 Michael Esposito, chief financial officer of Chase, said on Tuesday that the company was studying its strategic options. Besides mergers, those options include joint ventures with non-bank companies in any of Chase's main lines of business. Frasier Seitell, a Chase spokesman, added that as the company's earnings improved, "one of our options is to remain as we are and continue to strengthen ourselves from within."
Allen R. DeCotiis, president of PSI, a Tampa, Fla., research and consulting firm, said, "Chase has to decide whether it wants to compete for the main mass of the consumer business or to concentrate on certain products and niches where it is very strong and very profitable, such as credit cards or private banking services to the affluent consumers." Mr. DeCotiis noted that Chase was more successful than its rivals in reaching wealthy customers, through its emphasis on large mortgages, luxury car loans and investment advice.
 
 Merger Talk Lifts Stocks
 Wall Street's conviction that mergers are good for banks caused a widespread rise in bank stocks across the country after the Chemical deal was announced. With the additional help of stronger than expected earnings in the second quarter, Chase Manhattan shares rose $1.875 each, to $19.875, on the day of the announcement, and have since advanced to close at $20.125 yesterday. The Bank of New York closed yesterday at $30.75 a share, up from $29.375 on July 12, before the Chemical announcement.
J. Carter Bacot, chairman of the Bank of New York, said before the Chemical merger that his plans might not include another deal like the Irving merger, despite the benefits. Loan troubles caused the Bank of New York to cut its dividend by 28 percent earlier this year, and generated a $2.7 million loss for the first half, compared with a profit of $172.7 million in the first half of 1990.
The lending problems were compounded after the Irving merger, Mr. Bacot said, because the Bank of New York took advantage of its larger size to make larger loans and to be more competitive with much bigger banks.
But despite the problems, Mr. Bacot said he had not lost his desire to grow. Expansion into Connecticut and New Jersey would be nice, he says, but the economic downturn in the Northeast has made him more mindful of the advantages of diversifying the bank's business.
"A large bank will be more stable if its middle-market corporate business and consumer banking are not limited to a single market," Mr. Bacot said.

HEADLINE: 6 Insurers Have Cut In Ratings

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service, a leading Wall Street rating agency, said yesterday that it was lowering its ratings of six of the country's largest life insurers: John Hancock, Massachusetts Mutual, Mutual Life of New York, New England Mutual, the Travelers and Principal Mutual.
What links the insurers downgraded yesterday is that they all have large exposures to commercial real estate, either to the actual properties or to mortgages backed by those properties. Moody's declared that real estate was a "deteriorating" asset and that it expected property values to continue to fall.
 
 Adjustments Were Small

The changes in Moody's ratings, which are the firm's assessment of the insurers' ability to pay the claims of policyholders, were very small. The insurers downgraded yesterday ranked high in Moody's 17-notch rating system, and they fell only a notch or two. But the move could have a big effect on all six companies because many policyholders, as well as brokers and agents, want to do business only with insurers rated at the top, or just a notch below. 
 Aware that its changes come amid extreme policyholder edginess about the health of all insurers, Moody's emphasized that the great majority of insurers, including those downgraded yesterday, remained strong.
But the agency said that property values, particularly of commercial buildings, had continued to fall in the first half of 1991 and that it thus had no choice but to conclude that the insurers' ability to pay policyholders had eroded. Moody's said additional downgradings could be expected if its prediction of further real estate declines proved true.
 
 'We Have to Do It'

"We don't want people to think that the end of the world is coming, because we definitely do not believe that," said Kenneth J. H. Pinkes, director of financial institutions research at Moody's. "And while it is difficult to make rating changes in situations like this, we have to do it because the risks have increased. Our sense is that real estate is deteriorating and will continue to deteriorate."
Industry experts say the number of people expressing concern about insurance companies has increased in the wake of state takeovers this year of Executive Life, First Capital Life, Monarch Life, and most recently Mutual Benefit Life Insurance.
Thus, these industry experts say, the downgrading will likely present a serious public-relations challenge for the affected companies. They were already receiving calls from policyholders, agents and brokers made nervous by the takeover this week of Mutual Benefit, based in Newark.
No sooner had Moody's made its announcement than the six companies began contacting agents and brokers, instructing them on how to keep policyholders calm. David Hurd, chairman and chief executive of the Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company, said the Moody's action "does not give enough weight to our different approach, our foreign record, our excellent current status and our carefully projected expectations for real estate."
At Massachusetts Mutual, Eustis Walcott, a spokesman, called Moody's move "a reaction to the times." He added that the downgrading was undeserved but that in any case the company had more than $6 billion in investments that it could easily convert to cash.
New England Mutual Life Insurance seemed to take the downgrading in stride, emphasizing that Moody's still left it with what it called an acceptable rating. "In a a poor economy, we are happy to be awarded a rating that says we have excellent financial strength," said Peter N. Harrington, vice president of public relations. He said New England Life still expected a profit of $25 million to $30 million this year.
Experts said the volume of calls from customers is likely to increase when the companies open for business on Monday. A small amount of capital could flow out of the affected companies to insurers whose claims-paying rating remains Aaa.
"You will get a few panic-stricken customers who will react," acknowledged Mr. Hurd of Principal Mutual, That company, formerly known as Bankers Life, is the nation's 11th-largest life insurer.
Principal Mutual's real estate portfolio is in extremely good shape; in dollar terms, less than 2 percent of its loans have gone bad. But that is not true at companies like the Travelers. Its $2.5 billion in troubled mortgages now exceeds its net worth, or its cushion against losses. The situation is only slightly better at companies like the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, for which troubled real estate now amounts to 50 percent of its net worth.
Moody's concern, in short, is that real estate values will continue to decline. While the companies will continue to earn profits from insurance, those profits have been shrinking because of competition. So one risk is that the impact of declining real estate values on the insurers' net worth will swamp positive developments, further diminishing the insurers' ability to pay claims.
 
 Details of Changes
 The following ratings changes, none of which were to less than investment grade, were made by Moody's late yesterday:
*John Hancock from Aaa (exceptional) to Aa2 (the middle of the excellent category).
*Massachusetts Mutual from Aaa (exceptional) to Aa1 (the top of the excellent category).
*Mutual Life of New York from A2 (good) to Baa1 (the top of the adequate category).
*New England Mutual from Aa1 (the top of the excellent category) to Aa3 (the bottom of excellent).
*Principal Mutual Life from Aaa (exceptional) to Aa1 (top of the excellent category).
*Travelers from A1 (the top of the good category) to A2 (the middle of the good category).
The Moody's downgrading poses an immediate question for the other leading insurance ratings, A. M. Best and Standard & Poor's, which will now have to decide whether to follow Moody's lead and lower their ratings. If they do not, it could cause confusion among consumers, since it is common to rely on at least two ratings agencies in choosing an insurance carrier.

HEADLINE: Foley Calls for Extension of Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
Speaker Thomas S. Foley pushed today for Congressional action to extend unemployment benefits, saying he wanted the House Ways and Means Committee to address the problem.
His statement came three days after a proposal by Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to declare an emergency, as provided by last year's budget law, and to lengthen the benefit period, relying on the $8 billion Federal unemployment trust fund. The benefits now exceed 26 weeks in Alaska, Maine, Rhode Island and Puerto Rico. 
 With leading Democrats in the House and the Senate now moving to extend benefits, Congressional action could come in September. Mr. Foley, Mr. Bentsen and others have argued that even if the recession was coming to an end, unemployment was still at 7 percent in June and would remain high for several more months.
They say that the Government should move against a domestic disaster like unemployment under budget emergency provisions, just as it helped distressed people overseas like the Kurds and Bangladeshis.
 
Selective on Emergencies?
 At a breakfast meeting with reporters, Mr. Foley commented that to President Bush, "everything outside the country is an emergency." But when it comes to the "problems of American workers," he said, "those are never emergencies."
The Speaker, a Democrat from Washington, said he would prefer an approach like that of Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Long Island. Mr. Downey's measure would change the unemployment compensation system, making it harder for states to deny benefits to unemployed workers, and paying for those changes with higher taxes on employers.
But if there were not enough votes to support a plan including a tax increase, he said, he would support an approach like Senator Bentsen's, under which benefits could be provided for a year without raising taxes.
Mr. Foley's remarks were apparently directed at Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The remarks were seen as a mild prod to act on the issue. The two leaders had discussed the matter earlier this week.
Mr. Downey introduced his proposal in March. Mr. Rostenkowski has been unwilling to bring it up in committee without being sure that he has the votes to pass it. Nor has it been clear that there was sufficient support for the measure in the full House even if he could get it out of committee.
Some Democrats have contended that this issue is important enough as a symbol of the party's commitment to disadvantaged workers that it should be pressed, even if it faces defeat. But Mr. Rostenkowski is known for keeping bills off the floor until he is sure they can pass.
In an interview today, Mr. Downey conceded there was not enough support in the panel or in the full House to enact his initial proposal because it included a tax increase.
He said a vote by the committee for an approach like Mr. Bentsen's was likely before the end of this month. Such a short-term approach was the only one with a chance of passage, he said, "given the fact that no one wants to pay for this, in either chamber."
 
A Problem Demanding Urgency
 Mr. Bentsen also deplored the lack of willingness to raise taxes for unemployment benefits. "I'd rather do pay-as-you-go and do permanent reform," he said in a telephone interview. "But it will take time to do that, and we need to deal with the suffering now."
Mr. Bentsen said he was not sure when he would seek action from the Finance Committee, but he conceded, "it will be damn tough to get it done."
Under current law, unemployment benefits for as many as 26 weeks are paid through state taxes on employers. Extended benefits, for an additional 13 weeks, can be paid through a program financed equally by Federal and state unemployment taxes.
A state becomes eligible for that program when at least 5 percent of its workers covered by unemployment insurance apply for benefits, and the rate of unemployed insured workers exceeds the average of the last two years by at least one-fifth. If the rate is at least 6 percent, a state can choose to pay extended benefits without regard to the last two years.
Mr. Bentsen's proposal would finance extended benefits entirely from the Federal trust fund. The fund includes $8 billion and is growing despite the recession because few states are now eligible to use it.
His program would be in effect until June 30, 1992.
The program would offer four levels of extended benefits.
If the jobless rate was 8 percent or higher, an additional 20 weeks could be provided. If a state's unemployment rate was 7 percent, it could provide 13 weeks of benefits. If the rate was 6 percent, it could provide seven weeks of extended benefits.
All other states would be allowed to provide four more weeks of benefits.

HEADLINE: U.S. Appeals Court Clears Way To Dismantle Shoreham A-Plant

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Rejecting a last-ditch effort by the Bush Administration to keep the $5.5 billion Shoreham Nuclear Power Station alive, a Federal appeals court ruled yesterday that the plant's owner could begin dismantling it without conducting an environmental impact study.
The decision, by the United States Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia circuit, grants Shoreham's owner a new license that allows it to begin taking apart the fully operational, 809-megawatt plant. The owner, the Long Island Lighting Company, said that it would quickly move forward to decommission the plant, making the chance that it will ever operate as a nuclear plant decidedly remote. 
 The decision is a major blow to the Department of Energy, which has portrayed Shoreham's operation as an important symbol of its commitment to nuclear energy. Earlier this month, the Justice Department, acting for the Energy Department, argued that the environmental consequences of other power sources, like fossil fuels, should be studied before the plant was abandoned.
 
No Environmental Study Needed
 Yesterday's ruling rejected that argument and let stand a decision by the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission saying that no environmental study was needed before the new license, known as a "possession only" license, could be granted. The new license took effect at 12:01 this morning.
The plant's supporters said they would continue fighting the nuclear commission's decision and appealed yesterday evening to the United States Supreme Court for an emergency stay.
But with the new license in effect, Shoreham is be on an almost irrevocable path to destruction, officials say. Trying to run it now would take two to three years and cost $300 million, they say, and the time and cost will multiply once the process of dismantling begins.
Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency formed to take over and take apart the plant, said decommissioning could begin as early as October and would take about two years and cost about $186 million.
Joanne Johnson, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department, said she would have no comment on yesterday's ruling. In January, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins called the decision not to operate the plant "tragic" and warned that it would have "adverse consequences on energy security and reliability, the environment, the ratepayers of Long Island and the New York State economy."
But New York State, which is waiting for approval from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to take over and dismantle Shoreham, applauded the ruling and said it was a warning to the Federal Government not to meddle in local decisions about nuclear energy.
"I would hope that the Bush Administration would now cease its efforts to try and delay the decommissioning of Shoreham," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in a prepared statement.
In 1989, after intense pressure from Mr. Cuomo and officials in Suffolk County, who argued that Long Island could not be safely evacuated in the event of a nuclear disaster, the lighting company agreed to turn the plant over to the state for $1 in return for 10 years of rate increases.
Conceived in 1966, completed in 1984, and granted a full-power operating license in 1989, the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station was originally billed as an answer to Long Island's energy problems. The plant, able to provide 809 megawatts of power, or enough electricity for about one-third of the Island's 903,000 homes, was seen by proponents of nuclear power as a clean and safe alternative to the messy, aging fossil fuel plants on the Island.
 
Never Allowed to Operate
 Though the plant, on a rural road in a remote village on the north shore of Suffolk County, performed successfully in low-power tests in 1985 and 1987, it was never allowed to operate. Originally budgeted at $269 million, it ended up costing $5.5 billion.
In June 1989, after years of bitter debates and court battles on both sides, Lilco signed its agreement with New York State, which vowed to take over and then take apart the plant.
But transferring and dismantling a power plant is hardly simple. Every modification, from the most trivial to the most-far reaching, has to be reviewed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
As a result, though the nuclear fuel has been removed from the reactor and is being stored in a spent-fuel pool inside the plant, Shoreham has been sitting in a more-or-less pristine condition for the last two years.
 
2 Groups Fight for Plant
 Meanwhile, a case for Shoreham was made in the courts and before the nuclear commission by the plant's supporters, most particularly the Shoreham-Wading River Central School District, which depends on the taxes the plant generates, and a group called Scientists and Engineers for Secure Energy, Inc.
Last month, when the nuclear commission said that it planned to grant a possession-only license to Lilco, the two groups asked the United States Court of Appeals to stay that decision. The Department of Defense, represented by the Department of Justice, joined in that request, and it was that motion that was rejected yesterday. The school district and the scientists' group made the final appeal to the Supreme Court last night.
Under its full-power license, Lilco was required to maintain Shoreham almost as if it were an operating plant. Many employees had to spend as much as one in six working shifts in training sessions and many of the operating systems had to be kept up.
Joseph W. McDonnell, a Lilco spokesman, said Shoreham's cost under the full-power license was $400,000 a day, with about half going to taxes and half to maintain the plant. Under the new license, he said, Lilco will immediately begin saving $48,000 a day.
 
Lilco Can Shift 100 Workers
 The new license relieves Lilco of many of its previous requirements. Mr. McDonnell said it would enable the lighting company to shift 100 Shoreham workers to new jobs, either in helping to decommission the plant or in other parts of the company. It will also allow Lilco to vacate many parts of the plant it had been required to maintain, though it will still follow strict safety requirements for the spent fuel and the contaminated areas. Those will be dismantled and disposed of when decommissioning begins.
Now that it has agreed to the possession-only license, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is free to consider the next two issues before it: Lilco's request to transfer Shoreham to the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency, for $1, and the power authority's request to decommission it.
It is unclear what will happen to Shoreham then. A business group on Long Island has proposed using the property as a terminal for a new ferry across Long Island Sound. The Long Island Power Authority has said it would be feasible to convert the plant to a 413-megawatt natural gas-fired plant, but that would require a developer with $215 million.

HEADLINE: French Protest New Taxes on Art

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, July 19

 BODY:
Having long cossetted the world of culture with subsidies and privileges, the Socialist Government of France has suddenly become the target of furious protests from art dealers and painters over an increase in the sales taxes on art and antiques.
With auction houses and art galleries already feeling the squeeze of economic recession, the dealers have charged that the new taxes will further discourage sales and dash any hopes that Paris may have of joining London and New York as a major international art market. 
 "It comes at a very bad moment," said Yo-Yo Maeght of the prominent Galerie Maeght. "Paris was just in the process of becoming an art capital again. And it's a great pity it is being done by a Socialist Government, because it's contrary to what it has done for culture so far."
Applying pressure on the Government to reverse itself, France's largest auction house, Drouot, has threatened to take some of its business abroad. More than 100 art galleries also held a one-day protest strike on July 2 amid warnings that some may be bankrupted by the new rules.
"It's going to be catastrophic for painters," said Martin Guesnet of the Galerie Beaubourg in Paris. "It's trying to turn painters into accountants. Can you imagine van Gogh or Picasso trying to work out the sales tax on their works?"
 
The Value Added Tax
 But the Government is showing no signs of budging. Clearly embarrassed by the row, the Culture Minister, Jack Lang, has chosen to remain silent. But a statement from the Economy Ministry said that "it is not abnormal to seek an effort of solidarity" from buyers of highly priced works of art.
The law incorporating these measures was approved by Parliament on July 4 and is expected to go into effect on July 29, although some of the new taxes will not be levied until October 1992. Ever hopeful, a spokesman for Drouot said negotiations with the Government were continuing.
The new rules relate mainly to a Value Added Tax, or V.A.T., which is the principal form of indirect taxation used in the 12-nation European Community. A minimum 15 percent V.A.T. rate will go into effect throughout the region when it becomes a single trading market on Jan. 1, 1993.
The proposed regulations exclude private sales of paintings but for the first time will require painters as well as writers to add a 5.5 percent sales tax to the price of their works. To shield young and struggling artists, though, the first $40,000 of income each year will be exempted.
"It's all immensely complicated," Ms. Maeght said. "Painters are going to have to declare their V.A.T. every month. It means that every time they buy a brush or paint, they must keep the receipt. This law was voted without having been thought through properly."
 
New Rate Is 18.6 Percent
 Until now, the V.A.T. rate for galleries has been 5.5 percent, while auction houses paid only a 2 percent registration fee. But both will now be required to charge 18.6 percent V.A.T. on sales. Art sent abroad for sale will not be taxed here, but French citizens buying imported art will also pay the 18.6 percent V.A.T.
Complaining about "inexact presentation" of its plans, the Economy Ministry's statement insisted that "the new V.A.T. rules will not penalize France on the international market, nor will it turn foreigners away from the French market, nor will it encourage the French to buy abroad."
But a spokesman for Druout responded, "That is false, absolutely false." With revenues down by 35 percent so far this year, Druout's president, Joel Millon, has already said the auction house will carry out its major sales abroad, either in New York or Geneva, if the new law goes into effect.
In an interview with Liberation, Mr. Millon even raised the possibility that Drouot's main Paris auction house on the Avenue Montaigne might eventually be forced to close. "If in 10 years all the major sales are taking place outside France, this could happen," he said.
 
Politicians Join Outcry
 One auctioneer, Jacques Tajan, said the new rules could bring a 20 percent decline in business. Another, Guy Loudmer, said they would scare away foreigners seeking to sell valuable paintings in France. "This will penalize France's chances of enriching its national heritage," he said.
Art galleries, in contrast, argue that they will suffer because the new law will stimulate untaxed direct deals. "Big-name artists will use foreign agents," one gallery operator explained, "and other painters will sell to clients who come to their studios. Only the black market will grow."
The tax dispute has even prompted the conservative opposition leader, Jacques Chirac, to join the fray by charging that the tax on "works of the spirit" will damage French creativity. "There is something very shocking about these hasty decisions that aim only to swell the state's coffers," he said.
Piqued by his criticism, the Economy Ministry recalled that when Mr. Chirac was Prime Minister from 1986 to 1988, he cut the Culture Ministry's budget, which this year will exceed $2 billion. "In matters of culture, he is not well placed to give us lessons," the ministry statement added.

Road Racing Finds Bumps Along the Way

BYLINE: By WILLIAM N. WALLACE

 BODY:
Real estate prices in Fairfield County, Conn., may have retreated, but not the costs of running road races. Entry fees have climbed here -- as they have in other communities in the metropolitan area -- from $7 and $10 a decade ago to $12 and $14. Race organizers in the county say entry costs have increased because expenses have gone up, the number of sponsors has gone down and runners are more demanding.
The number of informal, grass-roots races has diminished and, while no one counts, the perception is that the number of runners has stayed about the same compared with five years ago. These kinds of road-running events are found in every corner of the United States, three- and five-mile distances being most common, with an occasional 10-kilometer for variety. 
 About 100 such races are run in Fairfield County each year, and Jim Gerweck, who puts on 15 of them, sees a drop-off. "There was a shake-out two and three years ago," he said. "The clubs that know what they're doing stuck around, and they make a buck. Other races dried up."
Are road races supposed to be profitable? Is the traditional giveaway T-shirt necessary? Are the runners really demanding yogurt, salads and juices as free post-race goodies? These are some of the questions being asked by runners and organizers alike.
"Who needs another T-shirt?" asked Augie Diamantini, a veteran road racer from Brookfield who favors Spartan events and lower entry fees.
 
In Praise of Amenities
 Diamantini helps run Brookfield's James O'Brien Memorial race, a Lions Club benefit on New Year's Day. Even with the obligatory T-shirt this event has managed to hold to a $7 entry fee, as has the Ridgefield 5-K, held in June.
"I boycott most races with $10 and $12 entry fees," said John Dugdale, a prominent masters marathoner from Ridgefield, who helps organize that race. "But I make exceptions for big races that provide a lot of amenities."
Those amenities are meaningful, said John Bysiewicz, who runs Connecticut's largest race, the New Haven Labor Day event that draws 3,000 competitors. "The trend is toward bigger races that attract more attention," he said. "And people have come to expect the extras."
David Singer, a race organizer who is the director of Mohonk House in Westport, a housing and support program for troubled teen-agers, was skeptical that no-frills races with low entry fees would succeed. "There is a core out there, maybe 10 percent, that absolutely insists on T-shirts," he said.
 
'Happy to Break Even'
 If there were no T-shirts, race sponsors would lose their best billboards, said Mickey Yardis, who runs several events in behalf of Threads and Treads, a Greenwich sportswear store. And sponsors, providing cash or products, have become precious in tougher economic times.
"We have 600 runners, 500 preregistered for a $10 fee. The others pay $15," said Yardis of the popular five-mile Point Perspective races overlooking Long Island Sound at Greenwich Point. "We make sure everyone gets a T-shirt, ones that cost us $5 to $6. Ten years ago they were $2.25. We're happy to break even and regard the event as a promotion for the store."
He said that Threads and Treads makes money on its biathlon and triathlon races, which have entry fees of $25 to $30 and $30 to $50.
Jeff Palmer of the Pequot Runners in Southport said, "We don't want to make a profit." That group's Thanksgiving Day five-miler is one of the county's most popular races; last year it drew 1,763 runners who paid $18,000 in entry fees.
But with cash also coming from a primary sponsor, Runners Roost, and donated food, the race makes money -- Palmer would not say how much. Substantial contributions from the proceeds go to the Wakeman Boys and Girls Club, which serves as race headquarters, and to Mohonk House.
Mohonk House also runs its own races, a five-kilometer and 10-kilometer, on Father's Day. This year, with the weather hot and the field smaller than usual, the income from entries was $4,020; the costs came to $3,820.
"It's an inefficient, rotten fund-raiser," said Singer, Mohonk's director. "But our kids like to help organize and run it, we make a lot of friends and I love running."
Gerweck agrees that the smaller road races seldom make good fund-raisers.
The Minute Man Five-Miler, held by the Westport Young Woman's League in April, is an exception. This year it had 54 sponsors who contributed money, services or goods in kind. A field of 1,285 runners paid entry fees of $6 to $14 for a total of $11,653. Expenses came to $10,235. But sponsors added $10,789, so the profit was $12,206, according to Eileen Peterson, the chairwoman. The money went to the benefit of organizations such as Mohonk House, the Police Athletic League and Westport Senior Center.
But runners apparently don't care to know where their money goes. None of the organizers could recall ever being asked for a profit-and-loss statement or even an expense breakdown.
"They care about the course and the amenities," said Bysiewicz. "And that's about it."

HEADLINE: Rockefeller's Assets

BYLINE: BY ROBIN TONER; Robin Toner is national political correspondent of The New York Times. Her profile of Senator Bob Kerrey appeared in this magazine in April.

 BODY:
IN THE BLOOD SPORT OF POLITICAL TALK shows, John McLaughlin's "One on One" can be one of the bloodiest, but Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th was holding his own. McLaughlin was pummeling Rockefeller on his health-care proposals, raising the prospect of another big-spending Democratic program driving under a nation of virtuous small businesses. Rockefeller was countering with a barrage of eye-glazing detail on cost shifting, first-dollar coverage and the per capita cost of health care in Canada.
The West Virginia Democrat had that special glow of a fledgling Presidential contender, that adrenaline rush of "Hey, I can do this," skimming along from health care to civil rights legislation to indexing capital gains. He was dropping in a cocky "Well, John" here and a chummy "No, John" there. His press secretary, watching from the control booth, began to uncoil and settle back in her chair just a little. Then McLaughlin turned the questioning to money. And Rockefeller's smile, that well-bred but earnest smile forged in a lifetime of campaign picnics and town meetings, that smile that says, "Yes, I'm a Rockefeller, but I understand," suddenly got very tight. 
 McLaughlin opened the subject by repeating a joke Rockefeller tells on himself as he makes the rounds of Democratic meetings these days: "The good news is I have 100 percent name identification in Iowa. The bad news is one-third of the people think I'm the banker who foreclosed on their farm, one-third think I run the oil company that raised the price of gasoline and one-third think I'm the guy who sold Manhattan to the Japanese."
Rockefeller said evenly: "This is a good joke, but it's my joke, John. Remember that."
McLaughlin was in full cry: "And you are one of the Rockefellers, and I read recently that you live in a house that's worth $15.3 million after the remodeling you put on it, and it's got 11 bathrooms on the first floor."
The guys in the control room were perking up. "Eleven bathrooms?"
Rockefeller ducked the bathroom question, but McLaughlin kept pushing.
"Are you the wealthiest man in the Senate?"
"I don't know, John. I'm not poor, O.K.?"
The show cut for a commercial, and McLaughlin throttled back, leaned over and said, man to man: "I did you a favor. You get this stuff out, you're better off." Rockefeller looked unconvinced and faintly peeved. He wanted to talk about the Presidency, about important public-policy issues, about the failings of the Bush Administration. But in the end, of course, it always comes down to questions like this: How many bathrooms does a Rockefeller have? This is the price of dynasty in a democracy.
JOHN DAVISON ROCKEFELLER 4TH, A.K.A. JAY, THE eldest son of the eldest son of the eldest son of the founder of Standard Oil, is doing what the pundits have predicted he would do ever since he entered politics in the 1960's: testing the waters for a Presidential campaign. He has two hot issues: health-care reform and the state of the nation's children. He has a solid base in West Virginia, where he was re-elected to a second Senate term last fall. He has a respectable record in the Senate, on top of eight years (1977-1984) as Governor.
His party, panicky over the lack of Presidential contenders, is pathetically grateful for any major politician who looks interested in the nomination. In all, it is a ripe moment for a man with the name, the numeral, the legacy and the money.
Like Kennedy, it is one of the few names in America with the power to shape a life. When he came of age in the 60's, when his uncle Nelson was Governor of New York and his uncle Winthrop was Governor of Arkansas and his uncle David was head of the Chase Manhattan Bank, many of his generation in the family "were in kind of full retreat from the name Rockefeller," the Senator recalls. Not him.
If he ever had any doubts, any guilt, any shrinking from 100 years of power and privilege, monopoly and philanthropy, he does not acknowledge them. His parents named him John Rockefeller and raised him with the nonthreatening, one-of-the-guys nickname Jay; at the age of 21, while studying in Japan, he wrote to his grandfather and asked the stern old patriarch's permission to use the full name and numeral.
"I wanted that name very much," he says. "I thought it represented certain levels of public service, integrity, the sense of you've got to go at it, you know, that there's no such thing as leisure."
In politics, the name means instant, often remarkably premature, credibility: the last profile of Jay Rockefeller in The New York Times Magazine declared, "If money, looks, brains, a fashionable social conscience and a lovely wife are still the making of a President, it could be a significant story of the 70's and 80's." It was 1970, and Rockefeller was the 33-year-old Secretary of State of West Virginia. The name also means unusual opportunities, like the time in 1968 that Uncle Nelson offered him a vacant United States Senate seat from New York.
But Jay Rockefeller did not move as fast as the pundits expected. The Kennedys followed an extraordinary arc -- soaring, crashing, burning, washing ashore in the tabloids. Rockefeller plodded along, step by step, struggling with setbacks. His second term as Governor coincided with a wrenching recession. He barely won his 1984 Senate race against a political novice, even while outspending him 12 to 1. Rockefeller then spent his first term in the Senate in careful, penitential devotion to West Virginia concerns, with almost no profile in national politics. Some of his friends said they had concluded he had given up the dreams of his youth. Then, a couple of years ago, he began edging toward the limelight, speaking out on some of the nation's most pressing domestic needs. In May, he suddenly declared, "The door is open," and he was looking hard at a Presidential campaign.
He can seem, at times, a strangely unconflicted man -- relentlessly earnest, doggedly putting one foot ahead of another, blithely comfortable with his vast wealth even as he champions the poor, able to live in a sprawling mansion in Washington and yet assail "the obscene contrasts" of wealth and poverty in the nation's capital. "He is who he is, he's accepted that for a long time," says his wife, Sharon Percy Rockefeller. "He's not metaphysically tied up in knots." His poll taker, Geoffrey Garin, describes the Senator, his wife and their four children as "the Cleavers with a lot of money."
Yet there are deeper currents here: Of all his generation of Rockefellers, usually referred to as "The Cousins," he may be the only one who reaches for the kind of power and prominence attained by his uncles, his grandfather and his great-grandfather. He has not only accepted the name, he has used the money with a vengeance. He spent close to $12 million in his 1980 gubernatorial campaign alone, enough to buy every man, woman and child in West Virginia a $6 dinner.
His critics assert that he has simply bought a political career, the way other rich men buy estates or islands. They say he has scant ideology beyond a vague intention to do good and little sense of how most Americans live their lives. They say his motivation, at root, springs from an overweening sense of entitlement. They say he is not ready, may never be ready, for the big leagues. "His strengths?" says David B. McKinley, chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party. "His name is Jay Rockefeller. That really is his greatest strength."
If he runs in 1992, and leaves the small pond of West Virginia politics, he will be measured against great expectations. And he will face the question that haunts any scion, but perhaps especially a Rockefeller, the question that has run throughout his political career in West Virginia, but will be writ large in the unforgiving arena of a Presidential campaign: Would he be here without the name and the money?
IT WAS NOT HEAVY LIFTING, AS FAR AS political events go -- a gathering of senior citizens in Parkersburg, W.Va. But Rockefeller was paying careful, almost slavish, tribute to his constituents. "I do not forget ever who put me in the Senate," he said. It is the mark of a man who spent much of his political career defending himself against the charge of carpetbagging.
It always was an unlikely match, Rockefeller and West Virginia, from the moment he arrived in 1964 as a 27-year-old Vista worker. The people of the state are often described as "poor but proud," but the cliche does little justice to a state that seems a microcosm of the roughest economic history. In much of West Virginia, for much of this century, the coal mines were the best source of employment for those who loved the land and wanted to stay. But the industry could exact a harsh price: more than 20,000 have died in West Virginia mining accidents this century. And the industry's grim cycle of boom and bust forced waves of out-migration over the years.
Into this setting came young Jay Rockefeller, who grew up in Manhattan and Westchester County, who prepped at Exeter, studied in Japan, graduated from Harvard. His father, John D. 3d, was a philanthropist who was instrumental in creating Lincoln Center; after his death in 1978, one estimate placed his lifetime giving, before bequests, at $94 million.
Jay Rockefeller, his only son, was on track for a career in international affairs. But he came to West Virginia, he says, because "I didn't know a darned thing about my country." In the argot of the times, and in the full glow of Kennedy fever, he wanted to "make a difference."
He moved quickly into politics, running for the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1966 -- as a Democrat. He went to New York to break this news to his uncle Nelson, a rather prominent Republican at the time as Governor and past contender for the Republican Presidential nomination. "He was very busy, so I had about five minutes in a long black limousine," Rockefeller recalls. "I cannot say it to you definitively but I will suggest, I think, that there was not only approval from him but a sense of wistfulness."
In 1968, after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, Governor Rockefeller offered his nephew a short cut to the Senate. "I got a call from Uncle Nelson offering me Bobby Kennedy's seat," he says. "And I said no, immediately.
"He didn't put a party restriction on it," Rockefeller says. "But I said no. I said, 'I don't think that's good for you, and I'm here, and I'm going to stay here.' "
By 1972, Jay Rockefeller was running for Governor against the incumbent, Arch Moore, a wily and pugnacious Republican who delighted in tweaking the rich young aristocrat. One of Moore's television spots that year became a classic, featuring man-on-the-street interviews in which New Yorkers were asked how they would feel about a West Virginian as their Governor: "That makes as much sense to me as having the next Governor of West Virginia be a New Yorker," said one woman. Rockefeller tried to cast himself as a reformer, most dramatically by advocating the abolition of strip mining, which put him in direct opposition to the state's powerful coal interests. It was a rough campaign, and he took hits from many sides, but the message was simple: He is not one of us. At one point, signs appeared that said simply, "Remember Ludlow," referring to the 1914 massacre of striking miners, women and children by state militiamen at a Colorado coal company controlled by the Rockefellers.
He lost, badly. Today, he tries to cast it as a growth experience. "You know, people lose constantly in life, every day they lose," he says. "Rockefellers usually don't lose."
CONFOUNDING predictions that he would leave the state, Rockefeller took a job as president of a small college, West Virginia Wesleyan, and came back to win the governorship in 1976. There was a difference: this time, he was no longer a strip-mine abolitionist. Rockefeller says that, thanks in part to his efforts, reclamation laws and practices had changed enough to make strip mining acceptable. Indeed, state and Federal environmental regulations did tighten in the 70's. But Rockefeller's critics have always seen his strip-mining flip as proof of breathtaking expediency.
Rockefeller's eight years as Governor began with high hopes -- the seemingly promising coal market, the prospect of a major Federal effort to produce synthetic fuels from coal, the chance, finally, for some economic stability. Rockefeller stoked those expectations by touting his clout with the Carter Administration and in the board rooms of major corporations around the country. But he ended up struggling with a national recession that struck West Virginia with harrowing force. Unemployment, by his second term, shot up to 21 percent in his state, highest in the nation, and his administration became a grim round of budget cuts. Rockefeller will have no West Virginia miracle to trumpet if he seeks the Presidency.
Any assessment of Rockefeller's governorship must be tempered by the times. David J. Greenfield, editor of The Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, says: "In retrospect, I thought he was an acceptable governor. He got good people in his administration. His honesty was unquestioned. His intentions were beyond reproach."
Don Marsh, editor of the more editorially liberal Charleston Gazette and a longtime friend of Rockefeller's, says: "Jay did not impress a lot of people as a dynamic decision maker. He was scandal-free and a solid performer who had an average or better-than-average set of officials."
Around West Virginia political circles, the line on Rockefeller was "too rich to steal." There was a serious point to this joke in a state regularly buffeted by corruption; the former Governor Arch Moore, for example, is currently in Federal prison for extortion. But Jay Rockefeller faced another character issue -- how he spent his own money. John R. Raese, who ran against Rockefeller in 1984, asserts, "He bought the Governor's office in 1980, and in 1984 he bought the U.S. Senate seat."
WE ARE SITTING IN the sunlit living room of Rockefeller's hilltop home in Charleston, and I am having an attack of deja vu. As a reporter for The Charleston Daily Mail, I covered Jay Rockefeller as Governor, in the late 70's and early 80's, when a major issue was his use of personal money in his campaigns (he spent more than $11 million in 1980, more than $12 million in 1984, most of it his own money -- a remarkable amount in a state of just 1.8 million people). It gave rise to regular, almost ritualistic, press questions about just how much the Governor was worth. (Estimates have varied widely, but according to a Forbes assessment in 1986, he and his three sisters have assets of more than $760 million.) He would not say. He is not saying now.
"We're just going to have to wait on that one," Rockefeller says with a well-mannered but implacable smile. If he runs for President, he says, he will make a disclosure. Until then, "I'm rather private on family stuff."
When he ran a second time against Arch Moore in 1980, one of the most popular bumper stickers declared, "Make Him Spend It All, Arch." A popular comeback was, "At Least It's His." In fact, Rockefeller's poll taker, Geoffrey Garin, says, "There's just a lot of evidence that if you have to spend somebody's money, voters prefer that you spend your own rather than special-interest money." His critics, though, argued that Rockefeller spent such huge amounts that it fundamentally distorted the electoral process. Who, after all, can afford to run against a Rockefeller?
Rockefeller always defended his spending, but by the time he ran for re-election in 1990, he had announced that he would not use his own money. "I think he felt he had to do it, to prove he could do it," a friend says. Rockefeller says he actually found he enjoyed raising money. As it turned out, however, his opposition was largely token.
He could, if he ran for President, decline Federal matching funds, thereby exempting himself from spending limits, and reach into the Rockefeller fortune once again. Asked about that approach, he responded, somewhat cryptically, "Let's wait until that either happens or doesn't."
Unlike some of his cousins, Jay Rockefeller lives, unapologetically, like a Rockefeller. In addition to his house in Charleston, he and his wife have an estate in Pocahontas County in West Virginia and a mansion near Rock Creek Park in Washington. Some Republican strategists gleefully predict that Rockefeller could make the plutocratic President look downright prole.
For all of that, Rockefeller has a taste for class-oriented politics, including the attacks on the tax policies of the Reagan and Bush Administrations that propel so many Democrats these days.
When I note that he comes from a background not dissimilar to that of George Bush, he says icily, "For whatever reason, George Bush, in my judgment, has never engaged in the inner workings, in the inner feelings, of what goes on in America."
The difference, Rockefeller asserts, is that he began his career as a Vista volunteer in the hardscrabble town of Emmons, W.Va., not as a Texas oilman. "It wasn't Houston, and it wasn't, you know, whatever the name of that oil club is on the top of whatever the building is, where it is," he says, with a trace of disdain.
HIS FIRST TERM AS SENATOR seemed almost subterranean, from the perspective of national politics. Shaken by the rocky end of his governorship, and by his 52-percent-to-48-percent election to the Senate, he hunkered down and devoted himself to learning the folkways of the institution and catering to the people back home, on issues like alternative-fuels legislation. Like his sojourn at Wesleyan, it was another period of proving his fealty to West Virginia.
He compiled a fairly liberal voting record: In 1990, he was more liberal than 71 percent of his Senate colleagues on economic issues, than 60 percent on social issues, and than 69 percent on foreign issues, according to the rankings by the National Journal. Like most of his fellow Democrats, he voted against the resolution authorizing the use of force in the Persian Gulf.
In the past few years, Rockefeller moved toward more national prominence by seeking and winning the chairmanships of two blue-ribbon commissions -- one on health care, one on children, the kind of domestic issues that Democrats hope will someday bring them back to power.
The United States Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care -- often known as the Pepper Commission -- produced a plan last year to provide universal health insurance and extensive new long-term nursing-care benefits. But its proposals would cost $66 billion a year in Federal funds, and the chances for legislative enactment any time soon are considered slim.
The National Commission on Children, in its report last month, called for major new initiatives to combat poverty among the young, including a $1,000 income-tax credit for each child in America. The Bush Administration, citing fiscal constraints, has been less than enthusiastic.
In his initial forays into Presidential politics, Rockefeller seemed ill prepared to handle the fundamental question most liberals face these days: Who will pay for their good intentions? Rockefeller has a powerful belief in government as an instrument of social good; he sometimes seems unaware of how many Americans no longer share that view, how much the Reagan revolution has altered the political landscape. Like Michael S. Dukakis, he has been insulated by a political career spent in one of the most Democratic states in the union.
(Indeed, during an interview, Rockefeller declared: "This is controversial to say, because Michael Dukakis took a terrific fall. We'd be a much stronger country today if Michael Dukakis were President. You print that." It is an opinion rarely voiced in political circles, even by those who believe it.)
On the campaign trail, Rockefeller often has the air of a patrician camp counselor or social worker, peering down, empathetically, from his 6-foot-6 1/2-inch height, trying to do good. His speeches are often very long and only lightly organized, but deeply felt. ("I'm very proud -- deeply proud -- deeply moved -- fiercely moved -- about what we did on the Pepper Commission.") He can, however, turn imperious and chilly when the business turns to politics; when I first asked about his old rival Arch Moore, Rockefeller said distantly, "I don't even remember the name of the prison he's in."
Rockefeller does not have the kind of powerhouse staff that one might expect from a Rockefeller; only three of his staff workers have experience in Presidential campaigns, none at a senior level. Rockefeller's political consulting firm is Squier, Eskew & Knapp, headed by political veteran Bob Squier, but it is not clear whether they would handle a Presidential campaign; they have other clients who are potential candidates, including Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee.
Like many other potential candidates for the Democratic nomination, Rockefeller would begin a Presidential campaign with major weaknesses -- untested in national politics, unproven in foreign policy, with no real base outside West Virginia. "He is a long shot, but they're all long shots," says William Schneider, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute. "It's a field of long shots unless and until Mario Cuomo decides to run." But Democratic oddsmakers, by and large, see Rockefeller as someone who would also begin with a certain star appeal.
The name piques considerable interest as he travels among Democrats around the country. Peter Collier, the co-author of "The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty," says, "We'll see what the baggage of the name is once he gets out there with it." But, Collier argues: "Those vulgar Marxist conspiracy theories that hung over the name like static electricity are gone. This notion that they got in one small room every morning and decided what the fate of the world would be is just gone."
As he struggles with his decision, Rockefeller talks incessantly about the effect of a campaign on his wife, Sharon, and their four children: John 5th, 22; Valerie, 20, who is named after Sharon's slain sister, Valerie Percy; Charles, 18, and Justin, 12. "Sharon has spent her entire life being a good soldier to me, for me, with me," he said, somewhat guiltily, at the end of a speech not long ago.
The daughter of Charles Percy, the former Senator from Illinois, Sharon Rockefeller is a veteran of 22 statewide campaigns between her father and her husband. In West Virginia, some feel she has the better political instincts in the marriage. Rockefeller has struggled with the number-of-bathrooms-on-the-first-floor question; when a reporter posed it to his wife, she said: "Oh, come on. I can personally testify, there are two."
In recent years, she has increasingly reached for a separate career; she is now president and chief executive officer of WETA, the public television and radio station in Washington. As her husband began exploring a race for the Presidency, she recused herself from all planning meetings for political coverage, but thinks she can keep her job if he runs. She says she is ready to be a good soldier again. "The family's unified around Jay," she says. "There's no question of what we would do if this is the way he goes"
ROCKEFELLER LIKES TO project himself as the untroubled cousin, the one at peace with John D. I and II. Yet on a recent summer afternoon, he wants to tell about his speech last year to a convention of the United Mine Workers of America, now headed by Richard L. Trumka. "It was a wonderful speech," Rockefeller says, "and after it was over they were cheering, and I turned to Rich Trumka, and we were just in this great bear hug, and I said, 'It's a long way from Ludlow, isn't it, Rich?' And he said, 'It sure is.' "
Rockefeller tells this story with great pleasure and intensity, and in that moment it is hard not to feel the weight of this name. He brushes away all the psychological theories of guilt and expiation that surround the Rockefeller family, the getting of its fortune and the giving away. But he clearly wants a place in the family pantheon. His niche, if he has his way, will be as the voice of compassionate government, provider of health care, nurturer of children. It would be a long way from Ludlow.
It is a logical evolution for this fourth-generation Rockefeller, this philanthropist's son, but it may be out of sync with the times -- the straitened budgets, the acute sensitivities to taxes, the suspicions of "big government." One can easily imagine some opponent declaring that while a Rockefeller might be able to afford the programs he advances, the average taxpayer could not.
His Presidential ambitions have a certain inevitability to them; a political Rockefeller will always be urged into the big game. But once the game begins, Presidential campaigns have a way of stripping away mystique and reputation and all the protection that a great name ordinarily provides; his uncle Nelson could attest to that.
If he runs, sooner or later, his campaign will all come down to him -- his wits, his beliefs, his intellect, his drive. It will be only Jay Rockefeller stepping up to his moment.

HEADLINE: Nowhere to Go: The Palestinians After the War

BYLINE: By Judith Miller; Judith Miller is a Times senior writer and the author, with Laurie Mylroie, of "Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf."

 BODY:
ZIAD ABU ZAYYAD, A 51-YEAR OLD Palestinian journalist, sat with his wife and eight children under a framed embroidery that his wife had finished sewing only the day before. "There is no place like home," the embroidery read, in English.
 For Zayyad, it was his first day at home in the West Bank town of Bethany in six months. He had just been released from an Israeli prison where he had shared a cell, 13 feet by 11 feet, with seven other men who, like him, were being held without formal charges or a trial. 
 Israeli officials deny that they used the gulf crisis as cover to step up their repression of Palestinians, people like Zayyad, who publishes a Hebrew-language newspaper about Israeli-Palestinian relations. But no Palestinian believes those denials.
The Persian Gulf war was over, Zayyad argued, but the lopsided war between Israel and the Palestinians continued. He had met one of its victims in prison: a middle-aged man -- he called him Ahmed -- who had already served 20 years of a life term. When he was sentenced by an Israeli court two decades ago, Ahmed had released the woman he loved from their engagement. During the gulf war, a new prisoner had sought Ahmed out. "I send you greetings from my mother," the teen-age prisoner said. The teen-ager turned out to be the son of Ahmed's one-time fiancee; the son, Zayyad said, that Ahmed might have had.
Now, Zayyad added, the teen-ager's generation was also being sacrificed to the relentless, devastating war between Arabs and Jews. "How many more generations will be wasted?" he wondered sadly.
For Palestinians, the people who come from or whose ancestors came from the land that Israel now inhabits and occupies, the war has significantly complicated the answer to that question. Saddam Hussein did succeed in focusing the world's attention on the more than five million Palestinians who for more than 40 years have lived in a diaspora depressingly similar to that of the Jews who now inhabit their land. And as some have noted with bitter irony, the war has left the United States, as the pre-eminent power in the Middle East, with new responsibility for the Palestinians' welfare. But the Palestinians' open and enthusiastic support for Iraq turned the Israeli public -- even the doves -- against them, undermined their cause in the eyes of the world and added immeasurably to their misery.
It also devastated the Palestinian economy, which relief groups estimate has lost $350 million since last August. Some of the wealthiest Palestinian communities, particularly in Kuwait, are barely functioning. Critical safety valves of employment and "safe haven" in sympathetic countries have been closed off. At least a quarter of a million Palestinians have fled Kuwait and Iraq since last Aug. 2.
Politically, the war's effects on the Palestinians are harder to measure. America's overwhelming victory weakened the Palestine Liberation Organization and its chairman, Yasir Arafat. Yet the P.L.O.'s terrible miscalculation of backing Saddam Hussein appears to have given West Bank Palestinians the latitude to enter negotiations for autonomy, rather than for immediate statehood.
At the same time, the gulf war widened divisions among Palestinians, splitting them openly for the first time, not just ideologically but geographically and economically. And the growing number of stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians and murders of Palestinians by Palestinians suggest that extremist forces, particularly in the occupied territories, are also on the rise.
Mostly, the war has deepened the despair of Palestinians -- everywhere. But it is most noticeable in the occupied territories and in Kuwait, long a key source of support for the Palestinian people and their organizations. Kuwait -- once home to the third-largest Palestinian community outside of Israel and the occupied territories, and surely the wealthiest -- now rivals only Israel in its loathing of Iraqi "collaborators." Most of the Palestinians still in Kuwait remain in limbo, jobless, stateless and in fear for their lives.
The war has also triggered a new diaspora. Many of the more than 200,000 Palestinians in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region are being methodically replaced by Asians, Egyptians and other politically more "reliable" workers.
The Palestinian sympathy for Saddam Hussein has placed a heavy burden on Jordan, which, according to King Hussein, has in recent months received 200,000 Palestinian refugees. Some 50,000 Palestinian children have swelled school enrollments; unemployment, in a country where Palestinians account for roughly 50 percent of the population, has soared above 30 percent, more than double what it was before the war. Nearly all of the refugees need daily assistance, something that Jordan -- having lost about $600 million in aid from Saudi Arabia and the gulf states for having backed Iraq in the war -- is unable to provide.
And the war has compounded the daily suffering of the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. The Palestinian economy, already crippled by the four-year-old intifada -- the locally organized uprising against Israel -- was virtually obliterated by Israeli war-related restrictions. These included an unprecedented 40-day curfew -- a de facto house arrest of the entire population -- a travel ban, severe work restrictions and other ostensibly security-related measures.
"Conditions in the West Bank and Gaza are as bad or worse than I have ever seen them, probably worse even than the aftermath of the 1967 war," concluded Peter Gubser, who heads American Near East Refugee Aid, a private relief group.
What the gulf crisis seems not to have done is prompt a sustained soul-searching among Palestinian leaders and intellectuals. Few will admit that backing Saddam Hussein was a huge mistake, the latest in an almost uninterrupted series of self-defeating miscalculations by Arafat and his leadership. Many privately concede that it has undermined their support in Europe and, among a far smaller constituency, in the United States. But few will acknowledge, at least publicly, that their support of Iraq undermined the legal and moral basis of their own cause: the unacceptability of the seizure and occupation of territory by force.
Although many Palestinians now openly criticize Arafat's leadership -- in many cases for the first time -- Palestinians say he still commands enormous support. And despite the worst discord in P.L.O. ranks in years, there is no serious effort to replace him, largely because there are no plausible alternatives.
Paradoxically, many Palestinians now see the United States as a prospective savior, the only nation capable of persuading Israel to grant what they call a fairly modest request -- an area equal to 20 percent of what was historically Palestine. They are not taking to their rooftops to applaud President Bush's vow to help resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Far from it. Few in fact, believe that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d's dogged efforts can succeed. But in their utter despair, many still hope that America, Israel's patron, will deliver what countless United Nations resolutions and years of struggle have not.
A sense of powerlessness, as well as hopelessness, is now palpable among Palestinians everywhere. "We didn't commit the Holocaust," said Hanan Ashrawi, a professor and writer who reflects mainstream P.L.O. thinking. "We do not want to drive Israelis into the sea, to wipe them off the face of the earth. Since 1988, the P.L.O. has accepted the notion of a two-state solution, of Israel's right to exist as a nation state. The problem is that Israel won't acknowledge ours. It does not want to trade territory for peace with us.
"Look, the peace process we worked so hard to build collapsed in the spring of 1990. The U.S. let Yitzhak Shamir bring the Israeli Government down in March rather than force him to implement his own peace proposal. In June, following the renegade Palestinian beach raid in which no Israeli was killed, the U.S. broke off its dialogue with the P.L.O. You stopped even talking to us! In August, Iraq invaded Kuwait and promised the Palestinians, who had lost hope, the faint possibility of liberation. Many knew it would not work. But if they dreamed of an Arab liberator on a white horse, if, in their despair, in the absence of any semblance of a peace process, they clung to this reed, can you really blame them?"
 IN MAY, KUWAIT WAS STILL A SMOLDERING wreck. Some 100,000 Kuwaitis had fled, deciding that a country in which you could taste the air was no place for their children. For many Palestinians, however, there has been no escape.
According to estimates from the Kuwaiti Government and independent sources, about 10 percent of the Palestinians who remained in Kuwait during the occupation collaborated with the Iraqis, 80 percent just tried to get by and 10 percent actively resisted. Nevertheless, while every Kuwaiti seems to know individual Palestinians who helped during the occupation, Kuwaitis now appear to remember only Arafat's embrace of Saddam Hussein.
More than a third of the Palestinians remaining in Kuwait are huddled in an area called Hawali, a Palestinian neighborhood in Kuwait City that was transformed by the liberation into a slum. The Kuwaiti and Saudi checkpoints that ringed this ghetto to snare collaborators were gone by mid-May. But Hawali still resembled a prison camp, without the barbed wire.
Only children played on the filthy streets, in front of the graffiti-scrawled apartment buildings. Teen-agers and adults were afraid to go out. Tawfik Oqal, a 26-year-old Palestinian who was born in Kuwait, explained why.
On March 9, his brother, Walid, 27, left to buy food and gasoline. He was stopped and arrested at a Kuwaiti checkpoint; no reason was given. He was severely beaten at a police station and urged to "confess" to collaboration, which he refused to do. He was burned with cigarettes and his nails were beaten and pressed by weights until they turned black. Twenty-one days later, he was released, and then only after the intervention of an American colonel.
"My father has been here for 40 years," said Tawfik, a soft-spoken young man with a neatly clipped beard, clad in jeans and a grey "Daytona Beach" T-shirt. "He was a crane operator. He came here when they had nothing; he helped build Kuwait. Walid and I went to college in the States. But we both loved Kuwait and chose to come back here in 1989. I would still stay if I could find work. But they don't want us."
It is in families like this that one hears the harshest criticism of Arafat. "I don't care about him," Tawfik said of the P.L.O. leader. "What has he done for us? All I want is my own country where I can live freely. You can't imagine what it is not to have a state, to be an eternal guest, threatened and humiliated wherever you go."
Even if they could leave, there are few places to go. Only Palestinians essential to Kuwait's reconstruction are being called back to work. Most of those who agree to forgo back pay and possessions can leave for Jordan. But between 20,000 and 40,000 Palestinians -- estimates of their numbers vary wildly -- hold Egyptian travel documents. Egypt refuses to admit them, and they are unwelcome in Jordan or any other country. They are literally stranded.
Among the few mandatory excursions for Palestinians are the humiliating trips to the Kuwaiti centers established to register all foreigners. Each day since mid-April, Palestinians have formed long lines in front of the centers, squatting amid garbage, the men on one curb, the women on another.
As they sat under the smoggy rising sun one day in May, Kuwaiti soldiers in desert camouflage swaggered among them at the sand-bagged entrance to the Jabriya branch of the Ministry of Interior. A New York Times reporter stationed in Kuwait witnessed what he called a typical incident: a young Kuwaiti man plucked out of the line and beaten. They dragged him into the ministry building. By midafternoon, he had not emerged.
The new Government of Kuwait, a reshuffling of members of the ruling al-Sabah family, denies it has mistreated Palestinians. "My house was burned," said Ahmed Hamoud al-Jaber al-Sabah, the Interior Minister. "So I've been trying to get some of the rooms painted. Some of my workers are Palestinian. If I had anything against Palestinians, would they be working in my house?"
For the moment, the Kuwaiti Government has forbidden the return of the 200,000 Palestinians who fled the Iraqi invasion, people whose life savings are held in Kuwaiti banks and whose children know no other society. But no decision has been made about the fate of the Palestinians remaining in Kuwait. "They want them to leave, but they need them," a veteran European diplomat said. "It was Palestinians, not Kuwaitis, who made this society work."
Worse still, Palestinians have nowhere to turn. P.L.O. officials burned all the documents in their embassy, and then the building itself, before fleeing as Iraqi troops left the city. The embassy has not reopened. So Palestinians are at the mercy of what is widely regarded as a disorganized, inept and vindictive Kuwaiti Government.
 UNDER THE UNFORGIVING FLUORESCENT LIGHTS of his sparsely furnished office in Tunis, Yasir Arafat, the living symbol of Palestinian aspirations, looked old. His left hand was bandaged, the result of a skin disease. The usual three-day stubble had turned patchy white; his stomach drooped over the belt of his olive-green fatigues; he seemed smaller than his 5-foot-4-inch frame, dwarfed by machine-gun-toting bodyguards and stacks of faxes. "Bills, bills, bills," he complained.
The P.L.O. is running short of cash. Funds that once flowed from Persian Gulf governments and from a tax on Palestinian workers in Kuwait and some other gulf states -- estimated at more than $250 million a year -- were cut off after the crisis erupted.
The P.L.O. also appears to be running short of political steam. Its morale has been shattered by the war, and most recently by the expulsion of Palestinian guerrillas from southern Lebanon, the P.L.O.'s last stronghold. Another critical blow was the series of Israeli and Palestinian assassinations of P.L.O. leaders. In January, Salah Khalef, or Abu Iyad, the P.L.O.'s No. 2 man, who was unhappy about the alliance with Iraq, was killed by an extremist Palestinian bodyguard. His picture, smiling beatifically, still hangs in most P.L.O. offices, a grisly reminder of the group's inability to protect its own.
None of the fear and anxiety so evident in many P.L.O. officials in Tunis was apparent in Arafat's demeanor. "We are at a peak," he declared with almost surreal conviction. "At the peak of support with the Arab masses, with the Muslim nation, with the third world."
All he had tried to do, Arafat said, was to mediate an end to an Arab quarrel. The United States had wanted war with Iraq. Washington wanted to deal with Arab "puppets," and, if it could find them, with Palestinians who would relinquish their national claims. He would not do so. And he would not step down, unless his critics had "50 percent plus one" of the votes to oust him. The P.L.O., he said, was an "oasis" of democracy.
Besides, he continued, he had only followed his people in supporting Saddam Hussein. "What else could I have done?" he asked. "It's impossible to be a democratic leader without following your people." The Saudis and the gulf states knew that and would ultimately come around, he insisted. No Arab could afford to abandon the Palestinian cause. "They made excuses for King Hussein because he has so many Palestinians," he said. "O.K., I have all of them."
Palestinians had championed Saddam Hussein because they had nothing to lose, he argued. "I gave all that the Amercans wanted. What more striptease can I do? Until now, nothing has been offered us."
It is President Bush's credibility, not his, that is now at stake, he asserted. The United States, he said, appealing once more in typical Palestinian fashion to his archenemy, has to resolve this conflict now. And it has to do so with him, not with "ghosts."
If Arafat had second thoughts about the war, he didn't betray them. If in the twilight zone of Tunis he was aware of the hatred so many Palestinians in Kuwait and in Jordan felt for him, he never admitted it. If he knew they called him King Yasir, or that many no longer referred to him as Abu Ammar, his nom de guerre, but as Abu Kharab, or father of ruin, he wasn't letting on. If he recognized that the P.L.O. had become paralyzed by factionalism, he gave no indication.
"You have all written him off so many times before," said Farouk Khadoumi, the P.L.O.'s foreign minister, "that doing so now is not credible."
Barring his murder or resignation, Arafat will probably remain as the P.L.O. head, despite the likelihood of challenges from prominent Palestinians in exile. "If elections were held in all Arab countries, few Arab leaders would remain in office," said Marie Colvin, who covers the Middle East for The Sunday Times of London. "But even today, a majority of Palestinians would keep Arafat in office."
But Arafat's support of Saddam Hussein damaged the P.L.O.'s unity, independence and relevance, which he had fought so long to build. True, leaders in the West Bank and Gaza said they would neither meet with Baker nor negotiate with Israel without the P.L.O.'s authorization. But experts on the P.L.O. say that Arafat had no choice but to grant permission.
If pushed, some local leaders were prepared to meet with Baker anyway, West Bankers say. Even those who insist that local leaders would never dare disregard a P.L.O. command agree that in sanctioning the meetings -- as well as the participation of West Bankers in a Jordanian delegation to peace talks with Israel -- Arafat has, in effect, acknowledged that Tunis no longer directly controls the West Bank Palestinians.
Some say that Arafat's growing vulnerability has made him even more obstinate, megalomaniacal and reluctant to share power, much less to designate a successor. "He simply will not let go," said one P.L.O. leader. "The world is coming down around our ears, and he hears nothing. I've worked for this cause all my life. But now, I'm truly fed up."
 WITH WORLD ATTENTION DIVERTED BY THE gulf crisis, Israel seemed to step up its repression of the Palestinians, despite official denials. In October, at least 17 Palestinians were killed and 100 wounded after Israeli police opened fire on demonstrators at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. When the deaths prompted a rash of stabbings of Israelis by Palestinians -- at least 10 Israelis were stabbed to death during the gulf crisis -- the Shamir Government cracked down, declaring a 24-hour curfew, among other security measures.
"What would you call occupiers who explode American-made sound bombs that deafen children for weeks inside schools?" asked one diplomat, referring to the riot-control device meant for use outdoors. "What do you call an occupation in which, for more than a month, people cannot go to school or work or even leave their houses for half a day to buy food for more than a month?"
Of all the Palestinian communities outside of Kuwait, Gaza was hurt the most by the war. It is home to 700,000 Palestinians, 300,000 of whom are crowded into eight refugee camps, among the poorest, most densely inhabited areas of the world. Gaza was placed under 24-hour curfew for 52 days -- 12 days longer than the West Bank.
"I saw illness I had rarely seen here," said Mohammed Moussa Abu Lehia, the senior Palestinian doctor in Jabalia camp, a Palestinian Calcutta. "We saw diseases of developed societies -- hypertension and depression, triggered by anxiety over the war and the restrictions -- and the ills of the poor, such as scurvy, malnutrition."
 With the Israeli curfew and travel bans, most of the 120,000 Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank working in Israel lost their jobs. Many of those jobs were filled by the thousands of Soviet Jewish immigrants flooding into Israel. By May, only about 50,000 Palestinians had received passes enabling them to return to work in Israel, or even to pass through Jerusalem.
Since the north and south of the occupied territories are linked by roads through East Jerusalem, the West Bank was divided in half, with the capital virtually off-limits to most Palestinians. In May, three months after the war's end, checkpoints manned by Israeli soldiers still ringed Jerusalem. Israeli cars with yellow license plates were permitted to pass; Palestinian cars with blue plates were turned back, except for the lucky few with passes.
 "They have used the gulf crisis to isolate Jerusalem from the rest of the territories," said Hanna S. Siniora, a Palestinian editor. "Israelis are shy about discussing expelling Palestinians from this land, but that's the effect if you deny us the ability to feed our children."
A spokesman for Israel's Defense Ministry in the occupied territories denies that Israel used the gulf crisis to punish or drive out the Palestinians. He acknowledged that tear gas and, on one occasion in Gaza, a sound bomb, had been used. But after the sound bomb incident the authorities banned the use of such weapons in closed quarters, though Palestinians insist that the practice continues. The spokesman insisted that during the curfew Palestinians were permitted to leave their homes for a few hours a day to buy food or take sick family members to hospitals and infirmaries. "There were cash flow problems -- largely from the absence of funds from Kuwait -- but never any starvation," he said.
The curfew was needed to curb what otherwise might have been a "stabbing spree in Tel Aviv," given what Palestinians were prepared to do, he asserted. Military authorities had intercepted letters and messages ordering leaders of the intifada to attack Israeli targets, "and not just stone-throwings, but murders with guns." The curfew was extended, he said, only after the military intercepted messages from Palestinians indicating that they were unable to carry out these terrorist attacks because of the curfew.
Since the gulf crisis, Israel has placed new restraints on Palestinians. A military spokesman said that some 10,000 "green cards" have been issued to Palestinians, barring those convicted of crimes or who have what he called "terrorist files" from working in, or even visiting, Israel, including Jerusalem. Palestinian employment has also been limited by a new order requiring employers of Arabs to supply transportation from the territories to and from work, since Palestinians now need special permits to drive their cars into Israel proper.
Israeli officials say they recognize the danger to stability posed by the ravaged Palestinian economy, and they say they are loosening restrictions and adopting rules to promote development. Two more Palestinian financial institutions were recently licensed, and Israeli officials said the Government would soon permit the opening of 25 new Palestinian factories. The Draconian limits on movement have been eased a bit, but will be lifted only when the stabbings stop, Israeli officials said.
Yet the easing of the oppressive occupation has done little to allay Palestinian concerns about the steady growth of Israeli settlements in the territories. By both Israeli and Palestinian accounts, Israel now effectively owns more than 50 percent of West Bank territory. If current settlement activity continues, Palestinians will within three years become a minority in East Jerusalem, which was Arab until the 1967 war. Washington has not recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, and has protested settlements as illegal. But it has provided $750 million in emergency aid to help Israel settle Soviet Jews, aware that some are being settled in East Jerusalem and the territories.
 "The settlement activity is tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian people, acre by acre," said Ibrahim Mattar, a Palestinian economist who monitors Israeli settlements. "The giant condos are more than an obstacle to peace; they are facts we cannot change."
The gulf war has exacted a dire political toll as well. Israeli and Palestinian peace activists agree that the two communities have never been as divided. "Many Israelis are still afraid of venturing into Arab parts of East Jerusalem and the territories, and the Palestinians can't come here," said Menachem Brinker, a professor and member of Israel's Peace Now, a leading dovish group. "The massive Palestinian support for the Scud attacks on Israel damaged our cause," he conceded. "But we are slowly rebuilding our bridges to one another."
 Avishai Margalit, a professor and a Peace Now activist, goes further. "The Palestinians made a mistake," he said. "But we morally ambushed them. We waited for them to blunder, and then we said 'We knew you were rotten.'
"Their daily lives had become so rotten -- day-to-day humiliations, harassment, arrests, detentions, beatings and torture if you believe the detailed reports we've seen -- that I understand -- not accept, but understand -- why they acted as they did. In a sense, the Palestinians were entitled to their irrationality. We cannot delegitimize them simply because they or their leaders made a mistake. Our occupation is tragically emulating South African apartheid."
Moreover, given the increasing extremism among Palestinians and Israelis, many argue, moderate Palestinians willing to negotiate with Israel are a precious resource that Israelis should not lightly write off.
 The danger to these Palestinians is already evident. Faisal Husseini, who has been meeting with Baker, was recently forced to leave his home when teen-age neighbors noticed a car with yellow Israeli license plates parked in front of his house. Much embarrassed, Husseini explained to an Israeli journalist that it would be safer if they went elsewhere.
During the war, local Palestinian leaders dared not urge moderation in their compatriots' zeal for Saddam Hussein. "We would have been killed for trying," said one leader, who insisted on anonymity. "Intellectual terrorism has taken root here."
In Nablus, the largest and most intensely political West Bank town, Palestinian desperation -- and its political evolution -- is literally written on the walls. The earliest slogans one sees are those of the Unified National Leadership, the ostensibly P.L.O.-directed intifada, written in black and blue spray paint. Many of these have been painted over with the increasingly vicious threats of the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, the major Islamic-inspired radical movement in the territories. Some of these, in turn, have been covered by the slogans of Al Jihad, an even more extremist Islamic group.
 "There have been about 20 murders in Nablus -- and 164 in the territories -- since the gulf crisis," said Haitham Hamad, a Palestinian journalist who works for The Associated Press. "Most have been of Palestinians, by Palestinians. This is the ugly side of the intifada."
 Said one Palestinian analyst, "The P.L.O. still represents the Palestinians politically, but Hamas increasingly reflects their despair."
 Despair took hold after the intifada failed to end Israeli repression or to produce peace talks. And it is becoming stronger still after the gulf war, part of a self-defeating political cycle that Israeli hard-liners use to justify a policy of not dealing with the Palestinians who supported Saddam Hussein and are now knifing Israelis in the streets.
"In this sense, the gulf war stance can legitimately be seen as the latest stage of the intifada," said Radwan Abu Ayyash, a leading Palestinian journalist who was imprisoned by Israel for five months during the crisis without trial or formal charges.
 The mostly moderate Palestinians who have been meeting with James Baker agree with Husseini that the Baker peace mission is a "last chance" before Israeli settlement activity and repression create new and even uglier political dynamics. It is the last time, they say, that a relatively moderate P.L.O. will still be able and willing to make a deal that involves territorial compromise. And it may be the last chance before Palestinians become so desperate, so full of hate for Israelis and so radicalized that Hamas, Jihad and other groups advocating "no negotiation, no compromise" come to reflect the majority view in the territories.
An endless succession of Palestinian suicide strikes against Israel, in turn, could provide a pretext for evicting more and more Palestinians from the territories, as many Jewish fundamentalists advocate and Palestinians fear.
"I'm pleading while there is still time," said Husseini. The United States and Israel have to deal with Arafat because he still represents the Palestinians, because he is "flexible and moderate and because he can deliver," Husseini said. "I would deal with Yitzhak Shamir precisely because he, too, can deliver."
 "If we don't succeed," Husseini said, "if Baker abandons this effort as he did before, leaving only his telephone number behind, one thing is sure: When he returns, he won't be interested in talking to me. He'll have to talk to people who know the language of the jungle better than I do."

HEADLINE: It's Cornstock, Not Woodstock

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT; WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, a London correspondent for The Times, is a frequent visitor to Minnesota.

 BODY:
ON most summer evenings, the only sounds carrying across the shallow lakes of northwestern Minnesota are the whine and sputter of outboard motors, as anglers set out through the twilight, trolling for pike and walleye.
But for three days beginning Aug. 2 in Detroit Lakes, Minn., the hazy northern nights here will be broken broken by other, less familiar, sounds: the distant riff of amplified guitars and the muffled bass backbeat of drums, drifting clearly through the woods and over the windless surfaces of lakes. 
 Since 1983, this little tourist crossroads 60 miles east of the North Dakota border has become the site of what is called WE Fest, one of the nation's largest outdoor camping and country and western music festivals.
 The 271-acre Soo Pass Ranch, which is usually the site of riding stables, a restaurant and bar, will be turned into a kind of country and western Woodstock, a temporary community of some 25,000 raucous adults who gather around tents and motor homes in six relatively primitive campgrounds to drink beer, cook hamburgers, swap stories and savor some 36 hours of nearly nonstop music from more than 25 groups, including big-name acts like Kenny Rogers, Reba McEntire and George Strait, all of whom are scheduled to appear this year. The festival is the creation of Jeff Krueger, a former rock and roll promoter from Minneapolis and a veteran of Woodstock, the 1969 outdoor concert that drew 300,000 to a farm in upstate New York.
Along the way, the visitors will snarl traffic hopelessly on local roads and cause gridlock at supermarkets and liquor outlets. They will get sunburned when they are not being drenched by afternoon thunderstorms.
But for most of the audience, a large proportion of whom are middle-aged and well-behaved, the event will mark the high point of the summer, a kind of annual celebration of friends and family, marked in time to the rhythms rolling off the stage.
More than 80 percent of those surveyed at last summer's festival said they had been to a WE Fest before. And while some campers come from as far away as Texas, Canada and California, the overwhelming majority are residents of the Upper Middle West: Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and the Dakotas.
The WE in WE Fest represents nothing more than its ordinary usage as the first person plural pronoun, a formulation intended to suggest that the event is as much about the audience as it is about the performers.
Some people organize their summer vacations around the concert and stake out the same campsites year after year, marked by signs and flags declaring their arrival: the Peterson Family or the Corner Gang" or the Lake Park Country Club.
For the most part, the crowd is adult, and the festival's own promotional literature gently tries to discourage people from bringing their children. "There are large crowds day and night, alcoholic beverages are sold on site and there are no activities strictly for children," advises one bit of published material. The point is indirectly reinforced a few paragraphs later, in a blunt reminder that anyone caught carrying or brandishing weapons will be immediately ejected.
 In 1983, sensing there was now more profit to be made off country and western than rock, in a mostly rural region of the country where nearly every small town has its own country AM radio station, Mr. Krueger, the organizer, assembled a group of investors and hit paydirt on his first try: he landed Alabama, one of the hottest groups in the nation, to headline the original WE Fest.
 Attendance has continued to grow since, and the large and enthusiastic audiences at what Mr. Krueger and his own partners now refer to internally as their Cornstock, have guaranteed an all-star lineup every time.
Last year, for example, when the festival drew a record one-night crowd of 40,000, the headliners included Randy Travis, Barbara Mandrell and Dolly Parton, who appeared with a 100-member chorale assembled from local churches.
The choir joined Ms. Parton in the concert finale, a stirring rendition of the recent gospel song, "He's Alive," that brought down the house.
"The common denominators are rural and mid-America," said Chyrll Weimar Sparks, another former rock and roll promoter who found salvation in country and western. "We're appealing here to simple, genuine people who have their heads screwed on straight."
While country and western is more commonly associated with the regional cultures of the South and Texas, the music has a wide following across the rural Midwest.
The performers at WE Fest appear on a large stage facing a broad, dusty hillside, on which fans set up lawn chairs and settle in for some 12 hours a day of nonstop music. The best views of the stage go not only to those who get there earliest, but to the fleetest among them. Each morning at 9 the gates are opened as a loudspeaker blares the "William Tell Overture," and the hundreds who have been waiting in line begin a mad sprint across the hillside, racing to stake out their favorite spots.
Between acts, Tom Katt, a country music disk jockey from Minneapolis, struggles to keep the sometimes unruly crowd in line, telling jokes or helping them burn off energy by leading a determined competition in which one side of the audience is exhorted to shout "tastes great!" more loudly than the other half can howl "less filling!"
Meanwhile, ringing the audience are dozens of small shops, beer gardens and assorted diversions, including teams of Indian dancers in tribal dress, and a wide variety of stands selling everything from fluorescent baseball caps and hand-tooled leather belts to $20 straw cowboy hats.
THERE is also a stand that sells framed paintings done on black velvet, with a selection that aims straight for the heart of any country and western fan, including moody portraits of Willie Nelson, Elvis and John Wayne.
For Detroit Lakes, a town whose wintertime population of about 7,000 swells to some 21,000 on warm summer weekends, the WE Fest has been a major boon to business, pumping millions of dollars into the local economy.
It has also added a whole new element to a tourist trade that, until recently, relied primarily on the loyalties of fishermen and the vacation dollars of Midwestern families, drawn to one of the largest concentrations of water slides, fast food outlets and kiddie parks between Minneapolis and Billings, Mont.
Local merchants are among the festival's most enthusiastic backers, and sponsors line up for a listing in the local WE Fest program, a roster that not only includes the usual group of local restaurants and motels, but the town's optometrist and well driller.
 
 
 
TIPS FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS
 The WE Fest site is on the Soo Pass Ranch, which is about two miles south of Detroit Lakes, Minn. It is reachable by either U.S. 59 or county road 22.
Beginning Aug. 1, a three-day admission ticket can be purchased at the gate for $50. Before Aug. 1, a ticket can be purchased for $45 from merchants and participating ticket outlets in Minnesota. Single-day tickets cost $20. Parking is $3 a day.
A limited number of reserved box seats immediately in front of the stage are also available, at $300 each, for the entire three days.
 
Camping
 Permits to hook up campers or pitch tents at campgrounds on the site cost $50 to $75, depending on the campground, and are good for the duration of the festival. Campgrounds open at noon on Thursday, Aug. 1, and close at noon on Monday, Aug. 5. Sites are usually available right up to the beginning of the festival, according to its organizer, but reservations are recommended.
In addition, limited camping spaces are available in a V.I.P. area immediately behind the main stage, for $200 for the duration of the festival, including electrical hookups.
Like the music area, where there is no protection from the weather and the only toilets are portables, most of the surrounding campgrounds are pretty basic. About 500 campsites bordering nearby Lake Sallie are served by a shower house and a small general store, but the rest of the campgrounds is Minnesota rustic: open fields or wooded areas that serve the rest of the year mostly as open horse range for the Soo Pass Ranch.
There are no electrical hookups for campers in these areas and the only running water is what you draw off a pumper truck that roams the campgrounds.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Central Park South;
Change, but Not at the Coliseum

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
FROM Columbus Circle to Grand Army Plaza, Central Park South presents a motley face, grandeur mingled with mediocrity. Like the physical setting, the commercial real-estate scene is decidedly mixed.
The most obvious transformation now under way is at the Essex House, near Seventh Avenue, which Nikko Hotels International hopes to turn from dowdy to deluxe, spending more than $75 million. At Fifth Avenue, the Sherry Netherland Hotel has also embarked on a renovation. The General Motors Building is undergoing a three-year, $7.5-million facelift, including the replacement of some 400 of the 44,000 marble panels in which it is clad. And Donald J. Trump still plans to add new penthouse suites to the great mansard roof of the Plaza Hotel. 
 The most obvious transformation that is not under way is at Columbus Circle, where the New York Coliseum and 10 Columbus Circle office building still stand, five years after they were to be demolished to make way for Mortimer B. Zuckerman's 2.2 million-square-foot Columbus Center project.
That project was critically, if not mortally, wounded 11 days ago when Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that it would be halted next year unless the city had by then taken certain measures to insure compliance with national air-quality standards. The judge said that fines of at least $15 million would be imposed if the deadline was not met.
"It is a very serious blow to the viability and future of the project," said Morri Berman, a spokesman for Boston Properties, Mr. Zuckerman's real-estate concern.
Unless her decision is overturned on appeal, it would not seem possible that a builder could find lenders or tenants for a project on such tenuous footing. Nor would it seem likely that the city's Industrial Development Agency could attract investors for the tax-exempt bonds that are to help finance it.
"I don't see how one could expect to sell those bonds if you've got the threat -- if not the likelihood -- that the project would get stopped midstream," said John T. Van Der Tuin, of Stults Balber Horton & Slotnick, who represents the opponents of the project.
Victor A. Kovner, the city's Corporation Counsel, found comfort in Judge Kram's denial of several claims against the project, including the use of Industrial Development Agency bonds. "We have cleared out most of the underbrush," he said, "and are left with one ruling which, in terms of remedy, I respectfully believe is erroneous."
Opponents of Columbus Center -- neighborhood residents, local businesses, community leaders and elected officials, including Representative Ted Weiss and State Senators Manfred Ohrenstein and Franz S. Leichter, all Manhattan Democrats -- had argued, among other things, that the project violated the Federal Clean Air Act.
They said the city was already in violation of the act because of its repeated failures to meet national standards. They said the Columbus Center environmental impact statement had identified a "hot spot" on East 59th Street where the carbon monoxide concentration would be increased by the project. And they said the project must mitigate any carbon monoxide violation identified in the environmental assessment.
"Plaintiffs' strongest argument in favor of their claim to enjoin the project under the Clean Air Act," Judge Kram wrote, "is that the Environmental Protection Agency requires that new projects must mitigate existing carbon monoxide violations, even those carbon monoxide violations not of the project's own making."
The defendants, including the city and the developer, argued that New York was not violating the Clean Air Act because Congress had extended the deadline for compliance until 1995. They said the project would not have a legally significant effect on the "hot spot." And they said that the city's overall control program offered sufficient proof of its commitment to improve air quality. Part of that program is a traffic study, now under way, that is to be used in the state's air-quality plan, due in November 1992.
But Judge Kram apparently was not persuaded by governmental assurances. "The Court concludes from reviewing the record that the City is far from implementing any guidelines for the attainment of air quality standards," she wrote.
Judge Kram said she "will not permit the city to persevere undeterred in its violation of these Congressionally mandated and agency-implemented deadlines." Therefore, she declared, if the traffic study was not ready in time to be incorporated in the 1992 plan, "the Court will enter an order enjoining any further work on the project."
WHILE the legal battle was being fought, the city cleared the plaza in front of the Coliseum of a large encampment of homeless people that had more or less claimed the entryways and the apron in front of the building as their full-time residence.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the site, plans to lease the space for use as an outdoor, fast-food cafe. The operator would be Plaza Caterers of Manhattan, headed by Michael Giovanni, who runs a similar concession on St. Andrew's Plaza, behind the Municipal Building.
Aspirations to higher cuisine are part of Nikko's makeover of the Essex House, which will include two new restaurants created by Christian Delouvrier, who earned his reputation as the chef at Maurice, in the Hotel Parker Meridien, 118 West 57th Street.
Nikko, a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines, bought the 45-story hotel from the Marriott Corporation in 1984. "They want to bring the experience of the hotel up to the address of the hotel," said Louis R. Hedgecock, a partner in Brennan Beer Gorman of Manhattan, architects of the renovation. The interior design is by Pierre Yves Rochon International of Paris and the general contractor is Tishman Construction of New York.
"Although this is not a complete rehab, as at the St. Regis, we tore out and reconfigured the interior," Mr. Hedgecock said. "A lot of rooms have gotten a lot bigger and there will be more suites." As a consequence, the number of rooms will drop to 591, from 690.
"The only request the client made from the beginning was larger bathrooms and better air-conditioning," said John A. Fitler-Ellis, vice president in Rochon's New York office. Through-the-wall air-conditioners, which contributed to a motel-like ambiance, were replaced with central air-conditioners.
Asked when the hotel had last been renovated, Mr. Fitler-Ellis smiled and answered, "It looked like about 100 years ago."
One big complication in reconfiguring the interior was that Marriott had sold more than 100 rooms as condominiums. Not only did the owners have to be paid to leave during the renovation but the design and construction had to be squeezed between and snaked around these units, which are scattered somewhat randomly through the tower.
"When you wanted to move a toilet, you had to make sure you weren't over someone's living room," Mr. Hedgecock said. "That made for a task -- in spades."
The architects and designers made a point of expanding the lobby and the views it affords, exploiting the fact that Central Park is just out the front door. "Before, you came in and couldn't see the park any more," Mr. Hedgecock said. "A lot of this work has been to open it up so that wherever you are, you are tied back into the park."
The hotel, which has been closed since last year, is to reopen Sept. 24, 60 years (almost to the day) after it was inaugurated.
At the Sherry Netherland, the management was not very forthcoming, other than to say that more than half of the 160 transient guest rooms are to be renovated.
At the Plaza, Mr. Trump said he "anticipated a start" over the next 12 months on the penthouse addition, which was announced three years ago. He said a plan to sell rooms as condominiums to investors, which was announced in April, would be filed "probably sometime by the end of the year."

HEADLINE: Focus: Omaha;
Thriving Through Both Boom and Bust

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
IN the late 1980's when Conagra, the giant food-processing company whose labels include Swift, Hunt, Wesson and Chun King, was seeking a suitable site for a new corporate headquarters, this former cattle and railroad junction on the prairie hardly seemed fitting.
A study commissioned by the company to determine the best location had placed its existing base in Omaha 18th. 
 Yet it was also a moment when the excesses of the 80's were drawing to a close. And some key Conagra executives whose roots were in the Midwest considered the down-home lifestyle that this city evoked to be more in harmony with the less pretentious 90's.
"The trend towards conservatism and simplicity became part of the appeal," said Janet Richardson, vice president for corporate facilities and services.
 Further, the public schools were in good shape, the air was clean, the traffic sparse and housing relatively cheap -- the Omaha Area Board of Realtors says the average single-family house still costs about $80,000.
 With a population of 350,000, Omaha was not as strained by the severe social and environmental problems overwhelming larger, more sophisticated urban areas. Moreover, Congagra had its origins in Nebraska.
 The result was the $60 million, 30-acre Conagra corporate campus completed in the fall of 1990. Replacing a decayed warehousing area downtown, the project is only one of a growing number of new developments in a community that has been largely untouched by the commercial real estate collapse infesting the rest of the country.
 Total office space completed in downtown Omaha in 1990 reached 5 million square feet, an increase of 38.9 percent over 1989, according to the city's Planning Department. And even though the overall vacancy rate for Class A, B and C office space now hovers around 18 percent, there is "very little left for anyone needing more than 10,000 square feet," said Thomas Peschio, president of Peschio and Company, commercial brokers and one of this city's business leaders.
 The vacancies, he said, are mostly centered among the smaller B and C spaces recently vacated by rapidly growing companies like Conagra which have been custom building of late. Rents, excluding operating cost, average $12 a square foot, an increase of 20 percent over the last five years.
 City officials are quick to say that the construction figures do not represent a speculative building boom. "We tend to be too small for the major promoters, and not glamorous enough for the investors from abroad," said Mayor P. J. Morgan.
 Rather, the pace of building is being generated by the expansion needs of companies already in town, many of which -- like food processing and telemarketing -- just happen to be shaping up as growth industries of the 90's.
Indeed, so many catalogue companies, credit-card servicing centers and hotel reservation services are consolidating their 800-number operations in Omaha that the city -- whose geometric towers rise from the pancake-flat surrounding prairie like the fabled Emerald City of Oz -- might easily qualify as the toll-free capital of America.
 U. S. West, the regional telecommunications company, has just completed a 300,000-square-foot, 15-story, office tower attached to a low-rise, 469,000-square-foot data processing center. Oak View Mall, a $22 million project now under construction, will provide the city with 450,000 square feet of new retail space when it opens later this year. The Gallup Organization established a polling center in 8,000 square feet of space here last spring.
IDELMAN TELEMARKETING, a local company, recently expanded into 20,000 square feet of space vacated by the Hyatt Hotel organization, which built a $3.5 million reservation center for its own expanding needs.
And initial plans are moving ahead for Gateway III, a public and private partnership with a 20-year plan for reviving 250 acres of rusting railroad repair yards adjacent to the Missouri River.
 As demand permits, the aim of Gateway III is to produce multi-use developments of office and retail space, residential units, a manmade lake and a marina and botanical center, said Michael C. Wiese, exeuctive director of the Omaha Development Council. Gateway I and II have already transformed other aging areas of the town's former marshalling yards and warehousing core into a modern mix of commercial uses, interwoven with plazas.
 Omaha is pushing ahead unburdened by excess office inventory in large part because of its farming roots. While so much of the rest of the nation was enjoying an orgy of a speculative office building Omaha's business leaders were being shaken by the sight of neighboring farmers loosing thousands of acres to the farm foreclosures that swept the Midwest during the mid 1980's. "If something like that could happen to our solid midwestern family farms we felt it could happen to anyone," said Gary Pryor, Omaha's planning director. "Psychologically, it made everybody cautious."
 Further, he added, nobody had much faith in the value of the Federal tax advantages driving the speculative boom elsewhere. "We'd already seen our farmers getting whiplashed from changes in Federal policy," added Mr. Pryor. And by the time the farm economy had recovered, the dangers of the speculative excesses in other regions had become all too apparent.
 The value of the Midwestern labor pool, with its old-fashioned work ethic, has also been treated with renewed respect in recent years, prompting corporations to expand rather than shut down smaller units already located in Omaha. "Our people were proving dependable," said Mr. Wiese. "They showed up for work. They were trainable. They had no regional accent so they were excellent for phone operations."
 Slowly but steadily Omaha's economic base began shifting gears from cattle and crops to communications. An example is the building of the U.S. West complex, which opened in June. Beta West, a development company from Denver that handled the project, built 70 percent more office space in the tower than the U.S. West communications company needed, anticipating a general demand for expansion.
"We felt downtown still lacked the sort of new space that offered more efficient operating costs and better access to modern telecommunications," said Bob Cardell, vice president of asset management at Beta West. Leases are in negotiation on two-thirds of the available space, he said.
CONAGRA took steps to make its move to a new headquarters cost-effective. As a major employer it was able to lobby the state legislature to provide the needed tax incentives for companies like itself interested in relocating or expanding in Nebraska. It also encouraged the city to use municipal powers of eminent domain plus tax dollars to help assemble the 107-acre parcel it needed. The tract holds the company's 500,000-square-foot, four-building, low-rise complex plus a new county park with a manmade lake and fountains that adjoin and adorn the downtown site.
"Our campus has became such an attractive place people want to hold weddings in the front lobby of the main building," Ms. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: Fans Call Games a Bargain (Even With Peanuts and Cracker Jack)

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH

 BODY:
WITH a big brood in tow, Phil Skrzyniarz of Cheshire entered Beehive Field in New Britain on a recent balmy evening. His group included five of his six children and two of their friends. They were all in high spirits, eager to watch the New Britain Red Sox play the Reading (Pa.) Phillies in an Eastern League baseball game and equally eager to besiege the concession stands for hot dogs, sodas and souvenirs. Mr. Skrzyniarz had spent $14 for tickets -- $1.50 for each of the children, who ranged from 5 to 13 years old, and $3.50 for himself. That total is $2 less than the price of a single field box seat at Fenway Park, where the New Britain team's parent club, the Boston Red Sox, play. Though he is a Boston fan, Mr. Skrzyniarz said, he seldom takes his family to a game there. "Much too expensive," he said.
A trip to a game in New Britain "is a much better deal," said Mr. Skrzyniarz, a purchasing agent for the Milton Bradley toy company. Counting refreshments for his group of eight, he said, a night out at Beehive costs about $45. "At Fenway, it would be at least three times as much," he added. 
 Mr. Skrzyniarz, who visits Beehive Field several times a season, is among the growing number of Connecticut residents who say that the state's only minor league baseball club is a good bargain for fans. "It's a pro team, and it's good baseball," he said of the class AA Eastern League, which is two steps below the big-league level.
Even though the team is in last place in the eight-team league, more than 20 games out of first place, the New Britain Red Sox are averaging 2,029 fans a game. And they are at a pace to exceed last year's attendance of 117,000. The Britsox, as the team is popularly known, are in striking distance of their record season attendance of 130,433, set in 1983, when the team moved from Bristol to New Britain. And that figure included the league playoffs, which New Britain is unlikely to reach this season. So why is the team doing so well at the box office while it is in last place, and the state is in the midst of a recession? Because it offers "a nice, wholesome night out at very reasonable prices," said Lois Schumey of Vernon after she entered the clean, compact ball park with her husband, Steve, and their children, Matt, 9, and Tricia, 4.
"We spent more than $100 to go to one game at Fenway Park in June," said Mr. Schumey. "And we paid $15 to park, which is more than it cost the four of us to buy tickets here. And to the kids, the quality of the baseball here is major league."
Baseball experts know that the level of play in New Britain is somewhat below the majors. But as the team's longtime owner, Joe Buzas, said, "When you come to Beehive Field, you get to see the stars of tomorrow today."
As owner, Mr. Buzas leases the stadium from the city and takes care of marketing the team, but the players and coaches are employees of the Boston team, which pays their salaries and can move them within its farm system, call them up to the parent club or trade them.
In recent years, the New Britain roster has included current Boston players like Roger Clemens, the star pitcher, and the outfielder Ellis Burks, as well as two Norwalk residents, Maurice (Mo) Vaughn, a first baseman, and Kevin Morton, a pitcher. Another promising player from the state, Jeff Bagwell of Killingworth, had a superb season at New Britain last year, earning Most Valuable Player honors and coming within a point of winning the league's batting title, too. Mr. Bagwell, who played college ball at the University of Hartford, was traded by the Red Sox to the Houston Astros and is having an outstanding rookie season with the team.
Before moving to New Britain in 1983, the farm club played for 10 years at Muzzy Field in Bristol, where future Boston stars like Jim Rice and Fred Lynn prepared for the big time.
"This is a fun place and a great place to take the family," said Mr. Buzas, who has owned more baseball teams (63 at last count) than anyone else in the game's history. "People are discovering that minor league baseball is terrific entertainment at a good price.
"And you know, the recession has helped us, because of our prices. You spend big, big bucks when you go to a big league game, particularly an entire family."
 
State's Surviving Franchise
 For a while in the 1970's and 1980's, Connecticut had three teams in the 68-year-old Eastern League -- in Bristol, West Haven and Waterbury. But attendance declined sharply in the 70's. The West Haven and Waterbury franchises folded in the 80's, leaving only New Britain since 1987.
In the last decade, attendance in the Eastern League, as in the minor leagues in general, has risen dramatically. It reached record heights the last two seasons, when the league drew more than a million spectators for the first time since 1949, the tail end of the minor leagues' heyday. Given its current pace, the league may set an attendance mark for the third year in a row.
Soaring ticket prices at major league stadiums, plus an increase in unruly fan behavior, have helped cozy little ball parks like Beehive Field thrive in recent years. Easily accessible via several interstate highways, Beehive, in the city-owned Willow Brook Park, offers free parking.
Concession prices are much lower than at big league stadiums. A new feature this season are picnic benches alongside a fence close by the hot dog, pizza and nacho stands.
With a capacity of 4,200, Beehive puts the fans close to the playing field.
"This is more like what I remember as a kid going to Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, where you always felt safe," said Bill Admirand, an advertising executive from Redding, as he entered Beehive Field for the first time with his wife, Peggy, their six children, ranging in age from 3 to 11, and some friends.
For most minor league players, Double-A ball marks the end of the road. Those who do go on to the next echelon -- in the case of the Red Sox, Pawtucket, R.I. -- are within a step of making it to the majors.
 
Asset for the City
 "It's a great opportunity to see young players who may go all the way," said Joe Mangiafico, a member of the New Britain Parks and Recreation Commission who rarely misses a home game. "And having the team here means a lot to the city of New Britain."
Just how much the city benefits economically from the ball team is difficult to assess. But it is a tangible asset in that it draws people to the city, if only to see a game and buy refreshments, and it focuses media attention on New Britain. In addition, players, live in the area from early April through August, and the visiting teams stay in nearby motels and eat in local restaurants. Under its current three-year contract the city also leases Beehive Field for $16,000 a season.
Promotional deals with local businesses are the lifeblood of minor league baseball. And the New Britain Red Sox do their share, under the leadership of Gerry Berthiaume, who is in his eighth season as vice president and general manager of the club. Promotions have produced the season's two biggest crowds. On June 26, Southern New England Telephone Company Night at Beehive, the company bought and dispensed all of that evening's tickets, and 3,400 fans turned out. Two days earlier, on WTIC Night, a near capacity crowd of 4,189 jammed into Beehive.
Other promotions range from food stores buying and distributing most tickets on a specific night to the appearance of celebrities like Max Patkin, billed as "the Clown Prince of Baseball," who will perform on Aug. 15. On Aug. 5 the Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller will take the mound in a Cleveland Indians uniform and toss pitches (now eminently hitable) to fans.
For years, most people attending Britsox games were from the New Britain and Hartford areas. But interviews before and during a recent game against the Reading Phillies found spectators from as far west as Bethel and as far south as Redding.
"Having players like Mo Vaughn and Kevin Morton play here drew more attention to the team in the southern part of the state, and that can mean more fans," said Mr. Berthiaume, himself a former minor league player. "We've noticed that we're getting people from farther away."
 
'12 to 14 Hours a Day'
 With a full-time staff of only three people, including himself, along with two summer interns, Mr. Berthiaume has to work long weeks and long hours.
"When the club is home, I'll put in from 12 to 14 hours a day, seven days a week," said Mr. Berthiaume who lives in nearby Berlin with his wife, Jenny, and their two young children. "But so will our other people."
Even with a part-time staff of 25 concession workers, ticket takers and ushers, Mr. Berthiaume is at times shorthanded, he said. When that happens, he and Mr. Buzas may dispense hot dogs, popcorn and Cracker Jack.
"You really get to know the fans when you're the general manager of a minor league ball club," Mr. Berthiaume said.
As an investment, the New Britain Red Sox are a blue-chip property. Mr. Buzas was given the franchise in 1957 when the Red Sox Double-A farm club was in Allentown, Pa. and floundering financially. He later operated the club in York and Reading, Pa., in Pittsfield, Mass., and in Pawtucket before moving to Bristol in 1973.
How much is the club worth today?
"I was offered $5 million for it last year, but I'm not going to sell," said Mr. Buzas, who also owns the Portland Beavers of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League and was the opening-day shortstop for the New York Yankees in 1945, his only season in the big leagues. "I'm having too much fun. How many people can make a living at their hobby as I've been doing for 35 years?"

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
Gaining Ground

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
The freefall of the real estate market may have others nervously pondering the future, but Dave Liniger, co-founder and chairman of Re/Max International Inc., is fairly sanguine.
A recently released survey of residential real estate transactions involving brokers showed Re/Max picking up the most market share of the country's seven biggest franchise brokerage chains. The survey by Real Trends, an industry newsletter, reported that Re/Max, the second-biggest chain, increased its share to 7 percent in 1990, from 6.1 percent in 1989, edging up on the industry leader, Century 21, which dropped slightly to 10 percent, from 10.2 percent. 
 Unlike many of its competitors, Re/Max has continued to open offices during the recession. The 18-year-old company, based in Englewood, Colo., now has more than 1,800 offices.
Mr. Liniger says Re/Max's unusual franchise structure -- in which agents form partnerships much in the way lawyers do, rather than split commissions -- draws experienced agents with established client lists.
Now, Mr. Liniger, 45, has earmarked the relocation business as Re/Max's next growth area. Mr. Liniger acknowledges that Re/Max, with just 2,000 transactions last year geared to executive transfers, is small in comparison with giants like Coldwell Banker and Prudential, which may each do as many as 50,000. But he says a new emphasis on such transfers has already produced 3,500 transactions this year for Re/Max.
"The likelihood that they will become one of the top five players in relocations, without an acquisition, is very, very limited, but they will have the ability to grow," said Steve Murray, co-editor of Real Trends. "I expect they will be good competitors."

Chemical Takes On a Partner, and a Giant Is Born 

The consolidation that has melded regional banks over the last year has blown into New York and the money center banking community. Ending more than a year of on-again, off-again speculation about such a marriage, Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover last week agreed to combine in a $2.2 billion stock swap that will create the country's second-largest banking company, after Citicorp, with $135.5 billion in assets. From weakness, they hope, will grow strength. Their hangups: More than 17 percent of Chemical Bank's commercial real estate loans are nonperforming, while Manufacturers' mistakes are problem third-world loans. The banks say a merger could save $650 million. But the savings will not come without labor pains. Up to 70 of the pair's combined 660 branches will be closed and 6,200 of their 45,411 employees will lose their jobs. Chemical's banner will fly once the merger is complete later this year, but John F. McGillicuddy, Manny Hanny's chairman, will be the new chairman -- until his scheduled retirement in 1993. Then Walter V. Shipley, Chemical's current chairman, is slated to move into his office.

Bank Profits Tumble
 
Bank stocks rallied as investors speculated on other bank matches. Second-quarter earnings showed why there may be more. While a few big banks, including Manufacturers, Chase and BankAmerica, reported gains, many were hurt by the need to squirrel away more money to cover future loan losses. Earnings slipped at Chemical, Fleet/Norstar and Security Pacific. Among the poorest performers was Citicorp, whose profits plunged by 83 percent, in part because of a $1 billion addition to its loan-loss reserve. But some analysts believe the banks' nonperforming assets have finally reached their peak.
 
 Rain on Insurers' Parade
 
When Executive Life, the "junk bond" lover of the West, was seized by regulators, industry officials argued that it was a fluke rather than a red flag that insurers were headed for a savings-and-loan-style crisis. So the seizure by New Jersey regulators of Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company last Monday was sobering. Among the nation's most conservative and respected insurers, Mutual Benefit's bad real estate loans have wreaked havoc with its portfolio of assets, valued at $13.5 billion last December. Many of its 400,000 policyholders have cashed in their accounts. And to prevent the largest insurance failure in history, regulators moved in and froze withdrawals. The savings crisis, it's not. But stay tuned to a new debate in Washington over the need for more potent regulation of insurers.
 
Another insurer with a sinking portfolio got a helping hand. Groupe Axa S.A., a leading French insurer, invested $1 billion in hobbled Equitable Life, a sum that could eventually translate into a 49 percent stake.
 
A.T.& T. Wins a Big One
 
To those who have ridiculed as hair-brained its computer strategy -- and its $7.48 billion plan to acquire the NCR Corporation -- American Telephone and Telegraph now has a powerful response: a $1.4 billion computer contract with the Internal Revenue Service. A.T.& T. and its partner, Pyramid Technology, beat out both International Business Machines and Lockheed for the contract, one of the largest of its sort awarded by the Government. Pyramid, whose stock flew up $3.75 on the news, to $18 a share, will supply 3,200 high-performance computers under terms of the deal, which also calls for 50,000 work stations and products to link them together. If only doing business with Uncle Sam were more profitable.

Another arrow for A.T.& T.'s quiver: Despitea promised $4 billion charge against earnings sometime this year for its purchase of NCR, the company's shares jumped $1.625, to $39.625, on Thursday after it announced a 26 percent rise in second-quarter earnings, signalling Wall Street's approval of its direction.
 
The Top It's Apparently Not
 
Warner Books has given Donald Trump's latest book, "Surviving at the Top," published by Random House before the developer's run-ins with the banks, a humbling facelift. The paperback version sports a trumped-down title: "The Art of Survival."
 
Pale Profits at I.B.M.
 
The International Business Machines Corporation has big blues. Battered by heavy-duty world computer competition, its second-quarter earnings dropped 92 percent, while revenues fell 10.7 percent. The company said it would be forced to cut its head count by 17,000 this year, making a total of 64,000 displaced workers since 1986. Yet its shares rose $2.25 on Friday, to $100.50, for how could the blues get bluer?
 
Brokers Rake It In
 
The payoff of a winnowed Wall Street? Record earnings at Merrill Lynch & Company and Smith Barney, Harris, Upham & Company. Cost cutting, added to the recent vitality of the equities markets, contributed to a smart-looking season.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY


Greenspan's Good News
 
Alan Greenspan delivered something of a thank you note to President Bush for his reappointment to a four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In one of his most upbeat forecasts, he told Congress last week that the recession was over, inflation was quieting, the deficit narrowing and that consumer and corporate debt would soon level off. A dynamic recovery it may not be, but a solid one it might, he said. What better way for the President to open the 1992 re-election season than with a rebound?

Housing's Mild Upswing
 
Consistent with the predictions of a tepid recovery, housing starts rose a mild 5.2 percent in June, the third straight monthly increase. While June was the first million-plus month since November, with 1,040,000 new starts, the new activity is less impressive than that of previous recoveries, economists warned. The West was the only region with a decline for the month, while the Northeast showed the sharpest rebound, of nearly 30 percent.
 
 Trade Horizon Lightens
 
Although the trade deficit widened slightly in May, the imbalance was the third best showing in eight years. And the trade gap with Japan, long the largest contributor to the deficit, narrowed to $2.4 billion for the month, the slimmest difference since February 1984. May was also the first month in which petroleum consumption returned to pre-Persian Gulf War levels. And despite slowing growth abroad, exports dipped only moderately.
 
Factories Churn It Out
 
Auto sales put a tiger in the economy's tank in June, when production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities climbed for the third consecutive month -- by seven-tenths of 1 percent. The increase, though, was broad-based. One reason: companies have had to start restocking inventories that have been shriveling since February. June auto sales, for instance, outpaced production by 1.3 million units, according to C. J. Lawrence. The brokerage firm says the auto inventory-to-sales ratio is the lowest since 1986.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
No Grand Prize for the Soviets
 
The seven leading industrialized nations sent Mikhail S. Gorbachev begging. While the Soviet President left the economic summit meeting without the direct aid he had sought, there was a consolation prize: technical assistance in areas like oil-field management, food distribution, defense industry conversion and associate membership in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Throwing money at a system as moth-eaten as the Soviet Union's, the Group of Seven concluded, would be wasteful. But generous Western aid could follow if the Soviets make concerted strides, under the tutelage of international lending agencies, toward a market-oriented system.
 
The Group of Seven leaders also pledged to complete by the end of the year a round of negotiations, stalled in December by a clash over farm subsidies, to set new rules for more than $1 trillion in world trade.
 
A New Chain of Corruption
 
The plot of corruption in Japan thickens. The last round of scandal involved questionable compensation payments made by four of the country's biggest brokerages to their clients. Now a new wave. More than a dozen of the country's biggest manufacturers have been accused of industrial espionage. Police in Tokyo and Osaka have confiscated records that press reports say suggest that several companies paid an industrial spy for information about Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction equipment. Documents also may have been stolen from a joint venture of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Caterpillar Inc. Judging from the past, resignations in high places, as officials rush to take the rap and restore corporate honor, will follow.
 
B.C.C.I.'s Connections
 
How deep were the political tentacles of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International? The bank, which was seized by regulators in seven countries earlier this month and is now under investigation for fraud, contributed $8 million to charitable organizations created by former President Jimmy Carter and used Andrew Young, the former Mayor of Atlanta, as a consultant. The bank has built ties with American public officials to help it do business, although there is no suggestion that Mr. Carter performed any favors.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
In a Small World, Mirage Is an Oasis

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
ONE of the nice things about the mail is that it carries pats on the head. But it also carries brickbats, and I have been catching a few of those lately from people who are mad at the Japanese.
For one thing, these folk do not forgive World War II. But they appear to be even madder about the fact that the Asians build world-class cars.
That ability is certain, however, and nobody -- least of all the automakers in Detroit -- will quibble with Japan as a tough competitor. Japan is beating the Motor City's brains out, and its biggest club is not, as some believe, a misguided public perception of foreign quality. Like it or not, the quality is there. 
 The Power Report, published by J. D. Power and Associates, reaffirmed that this month with its latest and much-vaunted Customer Satisfaction Index, in which Nissan's Infiniti and Toyota's Lexus pushed Acura out of first place, a spot that the Honda Division had held firmly for the past four years.
 Mercedes was three slots down on the Power survey, and the German luxury car was followed in order by Acura, Honda and Toyota. In fact, eight of the first 14 nameplates were Japanese. Only three, Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile, were domestics.
And, if you rent various makes or have other occasion to drive a lot of different cars, it is easy to put credence in the Power figures, which are calculated from a poll of thousands of owners of new automobiles.
No question, the Japanese do know how to do it, and one model, new for 1991, is a case in point. It is the front-wheel-drive Mitsubishi Mirage GS, a four-door sport sedan that ought to please commuters, young families and anyone else who wants space and economy in a small car with a bit of flare.
The GS is the top of the subcompact Mirage line, the others being the base Mirage and Mirage LS four-doors and a couple of hatchback coupes. The lesser cars carry transversely mounted 1.5-liter engines that put out 92 horsepower, but the GS offers a 1.6-liter four with multipoint fuel injection and 16 valves working off roller rocker arms to produce 123 horses.
For '91, all Mirages have what Mitsubishi calls a new "corporate-identity grille," but the GS is distinguished by its red accents on the bumpers and side moldings, by a bit of chrome around the windshield and by twin tailpipes, the extensions of a stainless-steel exhaust system.
The tester was painted Laguna blue metallic, and most of the trim was of the blackout variety, with alloy wheels as bright points of reference. The optional 14-inch wheels also carried fat Goodyear Eagle tires, part of a suspension package that has been tuned for performance.
Stopping power comes from four-wheel disk brakes, and a five-speed stick is standard, with an electronically controlled four-speed automatic as an optional transmission. Even without options, the car is well equipped, and most of the accessories that are missing can be ordered for surprisingly little money.
The blue GS had a gray cloth and plastic interior and the wheel was wrapped in vinyl, but those were minor deviations from what otherwise might be considered a luxury cabin. There is actual legroom in back, and the rear bench is split so that either side can be folded flat to extend cargo capacity.
The back seat also has a folding armrest in its center, and there are deeply bolstered buckets up front. The driver's seat adjusts three ways, and there is -- wonder of wonders -- a steering wheel that both tilts and telescopes.
 Unfortunately, the four-spoke wheel does not possess an air bag, and that means the Mitsubishi has passive restraints, a k a. annoying and dangerous mechanized seatbelts. That is one of the few complaints about this car, however, and the Mirage shows what can be done with relatively little space.
Standard equipment includes tinted glass, intermittent wipers, on-board diagnostics, power sideview mirrors, remote releases for fuel-filler door and the lighted trunk, a rear defroster and vanity mirrors on both front visors.
Also standard are two of those nice little touches that make you laugh and then keep smiling. The joke is the 150-m.p.h. speedometer. What keeps you smiling is a "chameleon" instrument panel that uses black-on-white numerals during the day and that averts eye-strain by changing to green on blue at night.
An optional "convenience package" adds power equipment, and an air-conditioner is the biggest extra with a pricetag of $756. But, with it all, the Mirage GS adds up to a good buy. The base is $10,509, and the test vehicle had a sticker that, with cruise control and a top-of-the-line radio, was a mere $13,117.
Oh, I almost forgot. There is one other nice thing about this Japanese car. It is made by American workers at the Mitsubishi-Chrysler plant in Normal, Ill.

HEADLINE: All About/Beer;
Behind All the Bonhomie, the Brewing Industry Gets Tough

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Sometimes it's hard to tell if the beer stein is half full or half empty. Just ask a brewer.
United States beer shipments increased 2.8 percent in 1990, to 193.2 million barrels, after years of essentially flat sales, according to Market Watch, an industry magazine. Per capita consumption also rose, to 24.9 gallons last year from 24.4 gallons in 1989. But shipments fell steeply in the first quarter of 1991 and are expected to be down again in the second quarter. 
 Industry analysts say both the increase and the decline are aberrations prompted by a doubling of the Federal excise tax, from 16 cents to 32 cents a six-pack, which went into effect at the beginning of the year. Many brewers also tacked on their own price increases, which they had been planning anyway, but then offered deep discounts to wholesalers who would buy in volume before the end of the year.
The result was a big increase in fourth-quarter shipments, which left wholesalers with a surplus in the first quarter, prompting a decline in sales. At the retail level, the tax hikes and price increases produced sticker shock, particularly for imports, some of which rose to $7 a six-pack.
"Between the last quarter of 1990 and the first quarter of 1991, if you averaged what happened, you'd wind up just about even or slightly down," said Paul Gillette, publisher of the California Beverage Hotline, an industry newsletter. Brewers "are not going to increase per capita consumption; it will probably decline slightly," he said. "There will still be growth, but it will not be equal to the growth in the population."

 
 
Falling Consumption
The Big 3: Strength Begets Strength
 The three biggest brewers now command 75 percent of the American beer market. In an environment of falling consumption and essentially flat sales, strong producers grow by taking market share away from weaker ones.
According to Market Watch, Anheuser-Busch Inc. increased its market share to 43.5 percent in 1990 from 42 percent in 1989; the Miller Brewing Company to 22.2 percent from 22 percent; and the Coors Brewing Company to 9.9 percent from 9.4 percent. At the same time, the Stroh Brewery Company dropped to 8 percent from 9.3 percent; and the G. Heileman Brewing Company dropped to 6.1 percent from 6.6 percent. Imports also lost share.
One area where the big three gained was in secondary, lower-priced brands, particularly lower-priced light beers, like Anheuser-Busch's Busch Light Draft, which shipped 2.4 million barrels in its first year, and Coors' Keystone Light, which shipped 1.4 million barrels, said Benjamin Steinman, associate publisher of Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter. "This was occurring even prior to the recession, but the recession, if anything, accelerated the trend," he said.

 
 
Drier and Lighter
Extending the Line To Gain Share
 A common strategy for gaining market share is extending an existing line of beer, typically adding a lower calorie, light version, usually called a "dry" beer, which means that it has less aftertaste. Thus, Budweiser begat Bud Light and Bud Dry Draft, the latter a double extension, featuring less aftertaste and no pasteurization, a feature further marketed as a "draft" beer.
Extensions are considered an easier sell than entirely new brands because they build on established customer loyalties. Advertising for the extension also increases consumer exposure to the whole brand family. But extensions carry their own risks, including customer confusion and cannibalizing the parent brand. Coors Light now outsells Coors by two to one. Miller Genuine Draft's steady gain in share matches Miller High Life's decline.
"The brewing industry has become much more of a new product game in the last two years, and it is a lot easier to create brand recognition if you have an established name attached to it," said Mr. Steinman. With the exception of Keystone from Coors, and the non-alcoholic Sharps from Miller and O'Doul's from Anheuser-Busch, the successful new products of the last two years have all been extensions, he said.
Line extensions do not come cheaply. Market Watch reports that Anheuser-Busch spent $70 million in advertising and promotion for Bud Dry, which is the No. 1 beer in the dry segment, with 1990 shipments of 3.2 million barrels. And some of those shipments may have come at the expense of Budweiser: shipments fell by 200,000 barrels in 1990, to 48.3 million.
As extensions are piled on extensions, some analysts fret that the brewers are creating confusion among customers and weakening long-term brand allegiance. Confronted someday with a "Dark Lite Dry Draft" brew, the fear is that bewildered consumers might retreat to a Coke or a Pepsi.
"When there are so many hybrids, brand loyalties begin to suffer," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los Angeles-based consultant to the beverage industry. "The genuine new product is where the gold has always been," he said.

 
 
Non-alcoholic Beers
Brewed for the Taste Not the Kick
 Perhaps the most unlikely new product success has been the non-alcoholic brews. Long a niche product aimed at recovering alcoholics and people who for religious or health reasons abstained from alcohol, these brews joined the mainstream in late 1989 with the entry of Miller and Anheuser-Busch. The brews are made so that they contain no more than one-half of 1 percent alcohol, which fulfills the legal definition of non-alcoholic.
Miller and Anheuser-Busch use different processes. Miller brews Sharps at a low temperature to retard alcohol production while Anheuser-Busch makes O'Doul's as a regular beer and then filters out the alcohol. But both have promoted their non-alcoholic brews as products for the drinker of regular beer.
"The drinker profile for Sharps is people who are predisposed to beer and the taste of beer," said Thomas Cardella, Miller's category director for allied brands. "The product provides an additional menu selection to the beer drinker," at times when other alternatives are likely to be bottled waters or soft drinks, he said.
Non-alcoholic brew sales grew from 9.6 million cases in 1989 to over 18 million cases in 1990, according to Market Watch. Sharps was by far the market leader, at 5.5 million cases, ahead of O'Doul's at 3.3 million and Kingsbury, from Heileman's, at 3.2 million. The entire category still accounts for just 1 percent of the beer market, but early indications are that strong growth has continued in 1991.
Advertising has played a big part. "Certainly the fact that you had Miller putting $14 million into media on Sharps and Anheuser-Busch $7 million on O'Doul's had an impact," said Mr. Steinman. Timing was another factor. "Given the shifting societal attitudes towards alcohol, the timing couldn't have been better," he said.
 
 
 
THE MICROBREWERIES' MACRO IMPACT
 Just as the boutique wineries which blossomed in California in the 1960's and 1970's revitalized the wine industry, a proliferation of microbreweries is bringing new excitement to the beer industry. While each brewery is by definition tiny, they collectively account for about 500,000 barrels.
"The brewing industry needs every brewer it can get," said Fritz Maytag, who as proprietor of the Anchor Brewery in San Francisco is considered the father of the micro movement. While Anchor may lose an occasional sale to one of the new upstarts, "I think we are building the category together," he said. "I don't think we hurt each other at all."
In some markets, notably Northern California, Oregon and Washington, micros account for one or two percent of market share. The United States now has 89 microbreweries and 149 "brewpubs," which are microbreweries attached to restaurants, up from 64 micros and 107 brewpubs at the end of 1989, according to the Association of Brewers in Boulder, Colo.
"What these breweries are offering are specialty beers to people who are more aware of the qualities of the food and beverages they consume and are willing to pay," said Charles Papazian, director of the association There has been "a recognition by the American consumer that what people used to believe was import quality beer can be brewed in this country," he said.
Microbrewer products tend to be heavy ales more like Watneys Red Barrel or Bass than Budweiser, and even the lagers have more hops and, therefore, a more bitter, herbal taste than typical American beers. "You may not like the style, but you will find consistent quality and big flavor," said Tom Pirko of Bevmark, a beverage industry consultant. The growth of the category "will depend on the money invested and how long they can maintain the quality," he said.

HEADLINE: Help the Russians, Not Gorbachev

BYLINE: By Bill Bradley; Bill Bradley, a Democrat, is Senator from New Jersey.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The London economic summit meeting ended without the leaders of the Group of Seven committing massive sums of money to prop up the Soviet political system and economy. But American taxpayers should remain vigilant: the Bush and Gorbachev administrations will get together again to look for ways to finance the Soviet future. The U.S. appears more committed to Mr. Gorbachev than to a set of principles.
Before the Soviet economy can be reformed effectively, democratic values and methods must be allowed to sink deeper roots. The Gorbachev regime faces a crisis of legitimacy. It does not have popular support. Otherwise, why would President Gorbachev avoid a vote like the one that elected Boris Yeltsin as leader of the Russian republic? Only with democratically elected leaders does the Soviet Union have a chance of taking the steps necessary to avoid catastrophe, much less to raise its people's living standard. 
 The old machine of party members, K.G.B. fossils, discredited bureaucrats and elements of the military still holds power, but it lacks legitimacy. Conditions worsen but it refuses to do what needs to be done, especially cutting Government spending.
Mr. Yeltsin told U.S. Senators recently that the Russian republic will reduce its payment to the central Government from 70 billion to 25 billion rubles. The result will be a bigger Soviet deficit in addition to a distribution system that has broken down and a G.N.P. in a free fall. The bloated Soviet military not only threatens us, but also the Soviet economy. Military spending has to be cut. Without action, the mammoth deficit will lead to hyperinflation.
The leadership also faces a dilemma on internal security. To obtain cooperation on economic reform and to acquire respectability in the community of nations, it must rein in the security forces that murder unarmed citizens in the Baltics and elsewhere. Repression destroys the dreams of freedom and hopes that the Soviets have changed. Citizens who are being persecuted are also unlikely to make economic sacrifices. Yet, once the totalitarian methods go, the political machine itself will be in danger.
To prevent national disaster, the old machine must yield more of its authority to the grass-roots groups -- democrats, religious believers, environmentalists, independent trade unionists, entrepreneurs, nationalists and others -- that have legitimacy but no power. How quickly that transfer occurs and in what form will determine the nation's future.
The recent accord between the presidents of the central Government and the republics represents the beginning, not the end, of conflict. Who controls natural resources? Who holds power to tax? Whose laws take precedence? None of these questions has been answered. Revolutions have been fought over such issues at other times and in other places. It will not be easier for the Soviet Union.
Letting markets emerge and function with a pricing mechanism, a banking system and pay based on productivity will do more for the average Soviet family than massive Western aid. For example, the Soviet Union last year lost 100 million metric tons of grain to corruption and inefficiency in the distribution system. Yet, trade in grain is still illegal. In June, over my strong objections, the Administration guaranteed $1.5 billion in credit to the Soviet Union to buy four million metric tons of grain. Instead, if the Soviets would decriminalize trade in grain, they would recover far more grain than we give them, without cost to U.S. taxpayers.
Now Mr. Gorbachev tells the world that he considers his unelected regime "entitled" to even more aid from U.S. taxpayers. Some in the West have suggested guaranteed loans, subsidized interest rates and guaranteed investment in the Soviet Union. None of that will make much difference to the Soviet future but it will certainly drain the U.S. Treasury. It reminds me of the S.& L. scandal, except that when things go bad in the Soviet Union we won't have a Resolution Trust Corporation to take control of the assets.
We could help the Soviets with technical assistance, exchange programs, and an associate membership in the International Monetary Fund, but first we owe them candor. Joining the international economy means tough competition. So long as private property is not protected by law and state monopolies are preserved by force, the Soviet future will be bleak. We should dispel the illusion that economic reform will be achieved by the shortcut of political deal-making. In an open world economy, capital flows to places with higher rates of return. No President can order U.S. businesses to lose money in the Soviet Union. Only the citizens, laws and institutions of a new society can make it attractive for investment.
Finally, we must not undercut our message about democracy with actions that jeopardize legitimate democratic movements, such as those in the Baltic states. The Administration's support for the Baltics has been limited to feebly reaffirming that the U.S. never legally recognized their annexation into the Soviet Union.
If President Bush soon sends a Soviet trade agreement to Congress, we will have a chance to test the sincerity of those words. We have most-favored-nation treaties with all three Baltic nations, but they were suspended in 1951 to prevent the special treatment from rewarding Stalin. Now it is likely that the Administration will ask for that status for the whole Soviet Union. The longstanding agreements with the Baltics will be forgotten, out of fear of offending Moscow. If we believe what we say about the Baltics' separate status, then any trade pact with the Soviets should be accompanied by reinstituting the agreement for the Baltics.
The course ahead will be difficult for that continental nation rich in natural resources and human talent. It must be chosen freely by the Soviet people. They are in control of their own destiny. Our influence lies in our willingness to join them in reducing military spending and in the example of our economic and political values -- not in the size of the check we write to Mr. Gorbachev.

HEADLINE: Dong Beijing a 2d Favor?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 20

 BODY:
As the Senate prepares to vote on whether to suspend trade advantages for China, many experts say the initial beneficiaries of such a cutoff would be the very hard-liners that the sanctions are aimed at.
 The Senate is expected to vote soon, perhaps Monday, on revoking most-favored-nation trade advantages. The goal of the cutoff would be to encourage China to free dissidents from its prisons, end the use of torture, and ease the repression that prevails from Tibetan monasteries in the west to universities in eastern cities like Shanghai and Harbin. 
 The problem for the United States is that a cutoff of most-favored-nation trade status would probably strike hardest -- at least at first -- at budding capitalists, whose factories might close; pro-Americans, who would have to lie low during the denunciations of Yankee treachery; and moderates in the Government, who would probably lose ground to the hard-liners.
"There's no doubt in my mind that revoking M.F.N. would only strengthen the hard-line constituency and worsen the human rights situation," said David L. Shambaugh, a China scholar from the University of London. "It would fuel the xenophobic impulses of the ideologues who seek to close China's doors."
 
Outcome Is Hard to Predict
 To be sure, it is nearly impossible to predict what will happen in China over any length of time, and the gain to the hard-liners might not last long.
In the longer term, the economic distress might even work against them, by bringing an abrupt coup in the Central Committee or a revolution in the streets. The result could be democracy, or something less palatable.
"Cutting off M.F.N. leaves you with two possibilities," a Western diplomat said. "The first is an even more hard-line regime still thumbing its nose at the rest of the world. The second is 'Apocalypse Now': they can't keep a lid on things, there's chaos in the streets, and they come up with a new system, whether it's a military dictatorship or something else."
It is difficult to be sure of public opinion in China. But the overwhelming majority of people with whom the topic was discussed in scores of conversations in recent months said they hoped the trade status would be extended.
But they often admitted that they were torn: on the one hand, they would like the United States to punish Prime Minister Li Peng and make the hard-liners "lose face"; on the other hand, they do not want to suffer economic hardship.
 
Some Favor a Bluff
 Many intellectuals say they hope the trade benefits will be extended only after a long struggle. That would put the Beijing Government on notice that it had better improve its image or risk losing most-favored-nation status next year. They say they favor trade sanctions as a bluff, but not their actual use.
An outright cutoff of the current low tariffs is considered unlikely, in part because President Bush is determined to maintain trade links with China. One possibility is that most-favored-nation status will be prolonged conditionally, with future extensions granted only if China makes progress on human rights issues.
Most Chinese do not seem familiar with the idea of conditional renewal of the trade status. When the issue was explained, some said they favored it -- if the conditions were ones that China would be likely to meet.
Many Chinese seem more enthusiastic about Western denunciations of human rights abuses than they are about trade sanctions. Many favor measures that would make their own leaders lose face without losing trade.
 
A 'Radio Free China'
 Another proposal batting around Capitol Hill that fits in with the thinking of many Chinese intellectuals is a "Radio Free China," modeled on Radio Free Europe. The State Department opposes this idea, however, because it would certainly sour diplomatic relations with Beijing.
Both advocates and opponents of most-favored-nation status argue that their approach is the best one for improving the human rights situation in China. But history suggests that the West, whatever it does, is unlikely to have a major impact on China.
The United States' efforts against China in the 1950's only made the country more radical, and the Soviet Union found at the end of that decade that economic leverage was useless in trying to prod China in the directions it wanted.
The only country that has truly succeeded in molding China for any prolonged period is Mongolia, which in the 13th century took the extreme approach of invading China and establishing its own dynasty.

A New Old Inn On the Shore

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD

 BODY:
THIS quaint seaside community that has for years been in the shadow of its southern neighbors is beginning to come into its own, thanks in part to the $2 million restoration of a former boarding house on the city's main street.
The New Devon Inn is getting to be a major lodging attraction in this city of 2,245, particularly for couples without children who want to spend a holiday on the Atlantic Coast. 
 "The inn has been a big plus," said Betsy W. Alwood, a Washington transplant whose husband, John, a former high school principal, opened a neighborhood bookstore a year ago. "It provides quality accommodations for tourists who like the nostalgia of Lewes."
The former Valley of the Swans Hotel was restored by a local real estate agent and a Washington attorney.
D. Dale Jenkins, a Delaware realtor who had been doing condominium conversions of older properties, felt that the boarding house, which had declined steadily since the 1970's, was a key deterrent to the revitalization of the city's downtown.
Built in 1926 by the Lewes Hotel Company and named the Caesar Rodney Hotel, for the 18th-century Delaware patriot, it had been an attraction on the Delaware shore as late as the 1950's.
By the time Ms. Jenkins brought her investor partner, Bernard Nash, to look at the property, it had become a residence hotel with efficiency apartments and a pool hall in the basement.
The pair bought the property in the late 80's for $387,000, then gutted the three-story building, with Ms. Jenkins acting as the general contractor. She removed everything but the main staircase and the pine floors in the guest rooms. Efficiency kitchens for the boarders were removed, and bathrooms were added for each of the 24 new rooms and two suites.
Ms. Jenkins furnished the hotel with antiques so that each guest room has a different character. The renovation includes six shops, most already leased, exhibiting space for the local art league and still-vacant space for a restaurant.
The management does not encourage booking of children under 16, and television sets are available only on request.
The occupancy rate of the new hotel has been strong, increasing steadily since the reopening early last year. The hotel was completely booked for New Year's Eve, when Lewes holds its own version of the New York City ball dropping.
"Lewes is getting on the map," said Mayor Alfred A. Stango, who led the city for 24 years. "The hotel has helped a lot."

HEADLINE: For Israelis, Talk or Pain

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 20

 BODY:
No matter what happens when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d visits on Sunday, for the people of Israel his stop in Jerusalem will likely bring a profound change in their lives.
 Of course, if the Israeli Government says yes, makes the requested concessions and agrees to attend a regional peace conference, there is the chance that at long last many Israelis could realize their fondest wish, to make peace with all their neighbors. But the answer is widely expected to be no, meaning a worsening of tensions with the Arabs and expected economic repercussions from Israel's main benefactor, Washington. 
 Shimon Peres, head of the opposition Labor Party, was not just promoting party politics this afternoon when he said, "I estimate that nothing will happen, and I regret it very much."
Early this week the small parties that give Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir his governing majority plainly told him they would withdraw their support, meaning the Government would fall, if he agrees to Mr. Baker's terms.
 
Hard for Shamir to Say Yes
 Mr. Shamir's record suggests that he is not likely to ignore the warning. Most people here say they believe he will give Mr. Baker a maybe, saying he wants more time to think things over.
The Prime Minister probably cannot say yes, even though Mr. Baker comes with only two, seemingly small procedural requests -- accept a passive United Nations observer at the conference, and allow the conference to reconvene periodically.
It is true that the Government opposes both ideas on their face. But the underlying problem is that by agreeing to them, the right-wing Likud party would have to attend the conference. Once there, every other participant would ask Israel to do what the Likud has vowed never to consider -- to give up territory in exchange for peace.
But even as Mr. Baker makes his way here to discuss peace, the talk across the nation this week has been on the possibilities of war.
 
Israel to Ask for $10 Billion
 When President Bush warned that the United States would attack if Iraq did not disclose the location of its nuclear weapons research installations, Eli Eshet, the Tel Aviv city manager, announced that the city was making a fast check of its bomb shelters. Many Israelis fear they would be victimized by Scud missiles once again, if the United States bombs Iraq.
But the more certain threat is not military but social and economic. Even as Mr. Shamir weighs whether to rebuff the United States and evoke the entire world's ire, Israel needs America's friendship just now as much as at any time in recent years.
The problem is finding jobs and homes for the Soviet Jews who have immigrated here en masse. In just over a month, Israel will make its planned request for $10 billion in American loan guarantees to build Soviet Jewish housing. And the certain wisdom in Jerusalem is that Washington will say no if Mr. Shamir turns Mr. Baker down now.
 
Draconian Financial Plan
 If that occurs, Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai has plainly warned the nation that life in Israel would be much less comfortable for years to come, so draconian is the financial contingency plan he has prepared.
"If we have to implement the plan, a very heavy burden will fall on the shoulders of the Israeli citizen, both the present and the future," he said. "I hope we won't have to do it."
In his plan are tax increases, though Israel already has among the world's highest tax rates. The Government would have to cut its budgets for education and health care, though professionals in both fields say funding has already slid below the red lines. In addition, prices on a wide range of Government-subsidized goods and services would have to be raised.
But even with all that, Michael Bruno, head of the Bank of Israel, warns that none of it would be enough. His staff predicts that unemployment nationwide would rise to about 18 percent. And in the end, the Soviet Jews would simply stop coming. That, President Chaim Herzog said in an interview, would be a calamity in many ways as painful as any war.
 
'It Would Be a Tragedy'
 "It would be a tragedy very great indeed," he said. "It will discredit Israel in the eyes of world Jewry and cause great social unrest here."
The Bank of Israel predicted in a recent report that not only would immigration stop, but emigration would pick up too; tens of thousands of Israel's young people would move away.
A few weeks ago, Rafi Melnick, a Bank of Israel official who wrote the report, said: "I can imagine that Shamir is not preoccupied these days with economics, but he should be. The Government is busy with other things, negotiations with Baker."
Three days later, when Mr. Shamir retracted a pledge Foreign Minister David Levy had made to Mr. Baker on an important procedural point for the proposed regional conference, the Prime Minister said he was not so preoccupied with Mr. Baker after all.
 
Not Enough Jobs and Homes
 "I have more serious preoccupations now," he said. "My thoughts are dedicated mainly to the absorption of Soviet immigrants."
Whatever Mr. Shamir's thoughts, the flow of Soviet Jews to Israel has already slowed quite a lot. A new Soviet passport law and the new bureacracy that came with it are making emigration more difficult. But in addition, thousands of the immigrants already here have written back to their friends and told them not to come, at least for now, since there are not enough jobs and homes.
In fact, as city officials cleaned out bomb shelters in preparation for a possible attack, they discovered that homeless Soviet Jewish families had moved into some of them.
Defense Minister Moshe Arens told the nation last week that Iraq was unlikely to fire Scud missiles here again.
But the concern now is not just Iraqi Scuds. Even as Mr. Baker heads here with word that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria is prepared to talk about peace, a mood has swept the country -- discussed at dinner parties, argued at work -- that soon Israel will be at war with Syria.
 
Israel Fears Attack From Syria
 Israelis have watched with alarm as Syria used the aid it received for joining the allied cause against Iraq to buy more and greater arms, including more Scud missiles of its own. And people here fear Syria has only one use for all that weaponry, to attack Israel.
With that fear in the background, few Israelis are talking about using this moment to make peace with Syria. To most Israelis, Mr. Assad is irredeemably evil. And so his present overture, they believe, is probably just a clever bluff. No matter the heavy price Israelis know they will have to pay, most seem too wary to accept Mr. Baker's terms.
Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, summed up the view this afternoon.
"One has to have some historical perspective," he said. "I hope very much that those who are heaping lavish praise on Mr. Assad -- the butcher from Hamma, the one who is annexing Lebanon and so on -- will not regret it in the future, because we know that these same people leaped lavish praise on Saddam Hussein just two or three years ago when it seemed at that time he was doing a good job for the West."

HEADLINE: Castro Gets Attention, but Not Money, From Latin Leaders

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUADALAJARA, Mexico, July 20

 BODY:
Received with courtesy and little else by his fellow Latin American leaders, President Fidel Castro prepared to return to Cuba today after gaining only token gestures of friendship for his beleaguered Government.
During a two-day conference of leaders from all 21 of the world's Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking nations, Mr. Castro pressed his requests for financial aid and other support to help Cuba pull out of its deep economic slide. He also delivered familiar denunciations of the United States and its policies toward the third world. 
 But while many leaders welcomed Mr. Castro's presence as a symbol of the conference's political diversity, they made little effort to play down the Cuban leader's deep estrangement from most of the region's governments, which are democratically elected and economically conservative.
"Let us permit the parliaments and the people to write their history in a sovereign fashion," declared Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, as Mr. Castro shifted uncomfortably in his chair, "and relegate guerrilla adventures to the tales of the imaginative novelists that this continent has in such great supply."
Before the formal opening of the conference on Thursday, Mr. Castro scored some achievements, winning re-establishment of consular relations with two former political adversaries, Colombia and Chile.
The conference's host, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, went out of his way to emphasize his commitment to giving Mr. Castro a respectful hearing, using the Cuban leader's presence as a political counterbalance to the pro-American economic policies his own Government is pursuing.
But suggestions that the conference would serve as a forum for negotiating democratic changes in Cuba's Communist system were quickly set aside in the initial hours of the conference, when Mr. Castro took the offensive, attacking the United States and other economic powers for creating Latin America's problems.
"The policies of the great economic powers and the international financial institutions under their control have not produced development, but have brought poverty to more than 250 million people," Mr. Castro declared in his speech at the inaugural session. "The world is heading in a still worse direction, toward world political hegemony by a superpower that has often made excessive use of force."
Despite the characteristic power of his oratory, several regional leaders did not even bother to applaud Mr. Castro's remarks, and many used their own speeches to hammer away on the themes of self-sufficiency and democracy, two subjects of particular sensitivity for the Cuban leader.
Diplomats who sat in on Mr. Castro's private meetings with other leaders said no commitments of financial help had so far been made to him.
As reporters surrounded him after the opening session, Mr. Castro began to relax and enjoy himself. But when a correspondent asked whether he planned to permit free elections in Cuba, he angrily waved away further questions, denouncing what he described as an "interminable campaign of defamation" against him.
In a concrete step toward the conference's goal of regional economic integration, Venezuela, Colombia and Mexico announced agreement to eliminate trade barriers and create a three-way free trade zone.
On another regional matter, 30 of the most prominent literary figures from the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world made a joint plea that the leaders take action to save the rain forests.
The statement, presented by the Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez and a Mexican poet, Homero Aridjis, was signed by writers across a wide political range -- from the conservative Mexican poet and Nobel laureate Octavio Paz to the leftist Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti.

HEADLINE: BUSH, IN TURKEY, MUTES WAR TALK

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, July 20

 BODY:
President Bush expressed concern today about reports of fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan, but said he did not anticipate using the American-led rapid deployment force being set up in Turkey in the current fighting.
Arriving in Turkey for a two-day visit, Mr. Bush sought to play down the reports of hostilities, adding that he thought President Saddam Hussein of Iraq would not do anything that would bring the allied intervention that followed Iraqi reprisals against rebellious Kurds in northern Iraq. 
 "Anytime there's a conflagration of that nature, it's a matter of concern to us," Mr. Bush said at a news conference after meeting with President Turgut Ozal. "I understand that the matter is, hopefully, getting resolved."
 
Hope for Lessons Learned
 "Let me say that the rapid deployment force is to guard against a repeat of horribly brutal events in the North," Mr. Bush said. "And we are not anticipating that that force will be used. We are thinking that Saddam Hussein, having learned his lesson once, will hopefully not embark on the kind of carnage that resulted in our having to do what we did in the past with Turkish cooperation."
Mr. Bush also discussed American aid to Turkey that was given to the Ozal Government in recognition of its support for the American-led coalition that ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait. He and Mr. Ozal also presumably spoke of Cyprus. Turkey is the final stop on the President's trip, which began with a stop at the summit meeting of leaders of industrial nations in London and went to Greece.
 
Fitzwater's Assessment
 Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that the Kurdish situation did not appear to be of "imminent concern."
"We hope it won't continue," he said.
One Administration official in Turkey who is tracking the reports from Iraq said that matters there remained "tense" but that there seemed to be a "de-facto truce" at the moment.
"We're keeping an eye on it," the official said. "But it's Iraqi territory."
Mr. Bush sent troops to northern Iraq last spring after the Kurds fled their homes when their uprising against the Hussein Government was crushed during the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war. The last of those 7,000 American troops pulled out of northern Iraq on July 14.
The new force, to be made up of mostly American, British and French troops, is being set up to protect the Kurds against reprisals by Government forces.
 
Protecting Turkish Borders
 President Ozal, standing beside Mr. Bush, said the force would also "be used to protect the Turkish borders" from the kind of "big inflow of refugees" Turkey got last April.
Turkish officials felt the rest of the world unfairly focused on Kurds huddling in filthy camps on the Turkish border, rather than on the Turkish aid brought to the refugees' remote mountain havens and on the burden imposed by the influx of Iraqi refugees into the country's poorest region.
On Cyprus, Mr. Bush supported the Turkish position of a four-part negotiation about the divided island that would include the leaders of Greece and Turkey, as well as representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. He made his remarks today on the 17th anniversary of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
Greece has firmly objected to such an important role in the talks for the Turkish Cypriots. Turkey is the only country that recognizes the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey has 16,000 troops on Cyprus, occupying the northern third of the island.
 
Military Aid Pledged
 As in Greece, Mr. Bush promised military aid for Turkey's help in the Persian Gulf war.
The President pledged his support for Turkey's military modernization program, including its 160-plane F-16 development program to modernize its Air Force. Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Ozal "agreed to build a new strategic relationship based on closer political, security and, yes, economic links."
Mr. Ozal, thanking the United States and other nations for the $3 billion they had given Turkey for its war-related expenses, said that while "it doesn't meet our requirements" the sum was considerable.
Administration officials said that, although Congress has said that for every $10 in aid that Turkey gets, Greece must get $7, that they plan to try to "break" that rule. They said they would seek $700 million in aid for Turkey and $350 million for Greece.
Security for Mr. Bush was tight here as it was in Greece. Police in riot gear surrounded the Prime Minister's residence. The United States Ambassador's residence, where the Bushes are staying, is across the street from the Prime Minister's residence, and there were no demonstrators as the Bushes arrived in Ankara.
 
'A Little Bit Tired'
 At the news conference, Mr. Bush, who recently suffered heart fibrillation caused by a thyroid condition, was asked about his health and how he has maintained his usual frenetic schedule.
"I'll confess to being a little bit tired -- a lot of evening acion out there coupled with getting up pretty early," he said. "So I'm 67 still, and I have to confess that from time to time I get tired."
But the President is not one to dwell on weakness for long. "Generally speaking, I feel good," he concluded. "I feel up for all of this."

Omaha's Becoming the Emerald City of the Plains

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
In the late 1980's when Conagra, the giant food-processing company whose labels include Swift, Hunt, Wesson and Chun King, was seeking a suitable site for a new corporate headquarters, this former cattle and railroad junction on the prairie hardly seemed fitting.
A study commissioned by the company to determine the best location had placed its existing base in Omaha 18th. 
 Yet it was also a moment when the excesses of the 80's were drawing to a close. And some key Conagra executives whose roots were in the Midwest considered the down-home lifestyle that this city evoked to be more in harmony with the less pretentious 90's.
"The trend towards conservatism and simplicity became part of the appeal," said Janet Richardson, vice president for corporate facilities and services.
 Further, the public schools were in good shape, the air was clean, the traffic sparse and housing relatively cheap -- the Omaha Area Board of Realtors says the average single-family house still costs about $80,000.
 With a population of 350,000, Omaha was not as strained by the severe social and environmental problems overwhelming larger, more sophisticated urban areas. Moreover, Congagra had its origins in Nebraska.
 The result was the $60 million, 30-acre Conagra corporate campus completed in the fall of 1990. Replacing a decayed warehousing area downtown, the project is only one of a growing number of new developments in a community that has been largely untouched by the commercial real estate collapse infesting the rest of the country.
 Total office space completed in downtown Omaha in 1990 reached 5 million square feet, an increase of 38.9 percent over 1989, according to the city's Planning Department. And even though the overall vacancy rate for Class A, B and C office space now hovers around 18 percent, there is "very little left for anyone needing more than 10,000 square feet," said Thomas Peschio, president of Peschio and Company, commercial brokers and one of this city's business leaders.
 The vacancies, he said, are mostly centered among the smaller B and C spaces recently vacated by rapidly growing companies like Conagra which have been custom building of late. Rents, excluding operating cost, average $12 a square foot, an increase of 20 percent over the last five years.
 City officials are quick to say that the construction figures do not represent a speculative building boom. "We tend to be too small for the major promoters, and not glamorous enough for the investors from abroad," said Mayor P. J. Morgan.
 Rather, the pace of building is being generated by the expansion needs of companies already in town, many of which -- like food processing and telemarketing -- just happen to be shaping up as growth industries of the 90's.
Indeed, so many catalogue companies, credit-card servicing centers and hotel reservation services are consolidating their 800-number operations in Omaha that the city -- whose geometric towers rise from the pancake-flat surrounding prairie like the fabled Emerald City of Oz -- might easily qualify as the toll-free capital of America.
 U. S. West, the regional telecommunications company, has just completed a 300,000-square-foot, 15-story, office tower attached to a low-rise, 469,000-square-foot data processing center. Oak View Mall, a $22 million project now under construction, will provide the city with 450,000 square feet of new retail space when it opens later this year. The Gallup Organization established a polling center in 8,000 square feet of space here last spring.
 Idelman Telemarketing, a local company, recently expanded into 20,000 square feet of space vacated by the Hyatt Hotel organization, which built a $3.5 million reservation center for its own expanding needs. And initial plans are moving ahead for Gateway III, a public and private partnership with a 20-year plan for reviving 250 acres of rusting railroad repair yards adjacent to the Missouri River.
 As demand permits, the aim of Gateway III is to produce multi-use developments of office and retail space, residential units, a manmade lake and a marina and botanical center, said Michael C. Wiese, exeuctive director of the Omaha Development Council. Gateway I and II have already transformed other aging areas of the town's former marshalling yards and warehousing core into a modern mix of commercial uses, interwoven with plazas.
 Omaha is pushing ahead unburdened by excess office inventory in large part because of its farming roots. While so much of the rest of the nation was enjoying an orgy of a speculative office building Omaha's business leaders were being shaken by the sight of neighboring farmers loosing thousands of acres to the farm foreclosures that swept the Midwest during the mid 1980's. "If something like that could happen to our solid midwestern family farms we felt it could happen to anyone," said Gary Pryor, Omaha's planning director. "Psychologically, it made everybody cautious."
 Further, he added, nobody had much faith in the value of the Federal tax advantages driving the speculative boom elsewhere. "We'd already seen our farmers getting whiplashed from changes in Federal policy," added Mr. Pryor. And by the time the farm economy had recovered, the dangers of the speculative excesses in other regions had become all too apparent.
 The value of the Midwestern labor pool, with its old-fashioned work ethic, has also been treated with renewed respect in recent years, prompting corporations to expand rather than shut down smaller units already located in Omaha. "Our people were proving dependable," said Mr. Wiese. "They showed up for work. They were trainable. They had no regional accent so they were excellent for phone operations."
 Slowly but steadily Omaha's economic base began shifting gears from cattle and crops to communications. An example is the building of the U.S. West complex, which opened in June. Beta West, a development company from Denver that handled the project, built 70 percent more office space in the tower than the U.S. West communications company needed, anticipating a general demand for expansion. "We felt downtown still lacked the sort of new space that offered more efficient operating costs and better access to modern telecommunications," said Bob Cardell, vice president of asset management at Beta West. Leases are in negotiation on two-thirds of the available space, he said.
 Conagra took steps to make its move to a new headquarterscost-effective. As a major employer it was able to lobby the state legislature to provide the needed tax incentives for companies like itself interested in relocating or expanding in Nebraska. It also encouraged the city to use municipal powers of eminent domain plus tax dollars to help assemble the 107-acre parcel it needed. The tract holds the company's 500,000-square-foot, four-building, low-rise complex plus a new county park with a manmade lake and fountains that adjoin and adorn the downtown site.
"Our campus has became such an attractive place people want to hold weddings in the front lobby of the main building," Ms. Richardson said.

HEADLINE: Brazil Abortions: Illegal in Name Only

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 20

 BODY:
In a hillside shantytown here, Selma, a 46-year-old cleaner, has a personal reproductive history that seems out of character for Brazil -- three children and 13 abortions.
On paper, abortion is illegal in Brazil, Latin America's most populous country. In March, a Brasilia jury convicted a woman of having an abortion. In June, the Sao Paulo police raided a succession of underground clinics. 
 Yet in a startling example of a gulf between law and reality, new estimates indicate that Brazilian women have abortions at a rate equal to or greater than women in the United States, where abortion is legal.
Each year, the United States records roughly 3.9 million live births and 1.6 million abortions. Brazil records about four million births annually and somewhere between 1.4 million and 2.4 million abortions, researchers for the Alan Guttmacher Institute say.
"Although abortion is illegal in every Latin American country except Cuba, induced abortion is being widely practiced throughout the region," Susheela Singh and Deirdre Wulf wrote recently in International Family Planning Perspectives, a publication of the New York-based institute. "For every 10 women giving birth, three to four in Colombia and Brazil and two in Peru terminate their pregnancies."
On a recent afternoon at a state hospital serving Rio's shantytowns, a third of the women in the maternity ward were admitted for complications resulting from abortions.
"The poor woman is alone, and she sees herself as without a way to avoid pregnancy," said the director, who asked not to be identified by name. "When she gets pregnant, she resorts to what she sees as the easiest way to solve her problem: abortion."
Even with underreporting of complication casess by hospitals, an estimated 400,000 women are admitted each year to recuperate from abortion attempts. Of these, hundreds die. In contrast, in the United States, about 10,000 women are admitted each year because of abortion complications.
"Complications from abortion are identified as the second largest cause for admission in state hospitals -- and yet society pretends it doesn't happen," said Jose Genoino, a member of the Brazilian Congress from the left-wing Workers Party. Seeking to break the silence, Mr. Genoino has proposed a bill that would allow abortion on request in Brazil during the first 90 days of pregnancy -- the first trimester.
But in a nation that claims to have the world's largest population of Roman Catholics, few politicians are willing to risk the wrath of the church hierarchy by advocating expanded access to abortion.
Technically, abortion is permitted in Brazil in cases of rape or danger to the mother's health.
But judges usually delay issuing orders until it is too late. At the Rainha Silvia Maternity in nearby Itaborai, a 12-year-old who asked to be identified only as Renata recently became a mother. First, she was raped by her stepfather. Then, she was a victim of the slow-moving court system.
In interviews, health professionals here could only recall two legal abortions performed in this city of six million in the last three years.
"Doctors are terrified of performing an abortion without written judicial permission -- no one will do it," said a prosecutor, Branca Moreira Alves.
Jaqueline Pitanguy, a feminist leader, said, "In the case of rape, the great majority of women have clandestine abortions."
Until a recession hit last year, surveys showed that abortions in Brazil were divided roughly evenly between back-alley abortions and clinic procedures.
"Less women are using clinic services now; more are using the dangerous self-induced methods," said Sarah Hawker Costa, who researches women's health issues at the National School of Public Health.
Although there are sporadic crackdowns, like the one in Sao Paulo last month, Rio's affluent beachfront neighborhoods have an estimated 100 full-time abortion clinics.
"There is a silent acceptance of these clinics, and everyone knows where they are located," said Katherine D. LaGuardia, who studied complications from illegal abortions in Rio de Janeiro in 1988.
"It appears that part of the population uses abortion as a means of fertility regulation," said Ms. LaGuardia, who noted that the women she surveyed in the middle-class clinics had had an average of four to five abortions.
Presenting a barrier to poor Brazilian women, the cost of clinical abortions is around $150 -- roughly double the nation's minimum monthly salary.
Traditionally, poor women turned to neighborhood midwives who attempted to induce abortions with knitting needles, coat hangers or sticks. Rosangela Novaes dos Santos, the Brasilia woman convicted of having an abortion in March, was admitted to a hospital suffering from a hemmorrhage caused by a piece of wire left in her uterus.
Without any action expected to allow safe, legal abortions, health experts predict that the abortion rate will remain high until birth-control information and supplies are universally accessible.
Surveys show that 90 percent of Brazilian women who use birth-control pills buy them over the counter at pharmacies, with little or no instruction. Ms. Costa's surveys of women recovering from abortion complications found that 40 percent became pregnant while trying to use some form of contraception, largely the pill.
 
Some Can't Afford Condoms
 In addition, condoms sell for 50 cents apiece -- a luxury item for poor people in this country. A new study by the Population Crisis Committee, a private Washington group, says that condoms in Brazil are six times as expensive as in the United States, as a percentage of per-capita income.
A Government family-planning effort, the Program of Integral Assistance to Women's Health, suffers from national budget constraints. Still, Education Minister Carlos Chiarelli recently announced that sex education would start next year in primary schools.
But at the state-run slum clinic where Selma works as a cleaner, neither birth-control devices nor counseling are available.
"Women don't abort because they don't love their children; they do it because of necessity," said Selma, who underwent a sterilization operation after her 13th abortion.

HEADLINE: Where Minorities Rub, It's 'Us' Against 'Them'

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
The political mapmakers call this block of the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn a "majority minority" area. But to the Puerto Ricans gathered outside La Borinquena Grocery, the Dominicans in the Cibao bodega or the blacks gathered under a revivalist's tent across the street, political reality is a little more complicated.
"I know if we are given our own representatives who understand our needs, then we will feel more involved; we would feel more like citizens," Thomas Figueroa, a 59-year-old factory worker, said as he stood outside La Borinquena. 
 "They don't give us any power here."
The issue is who residents mean by "we."
When Mr. Figueroa and his friends outside the grocery, all natives of Puerto Rico, speak of "we," they say they are speaking exclusively of Puerto Ricans.
The same political parochialism was reflected in interviews with various residents in the last two days, whether they were blacks, who have sought political power in the neighborhood for generations, or Central American immigrants who have only just arrived.
Their political prospects are now uncertain. After spending a month studying the city's new districting map that would triple the number of districts where minorities are in the majority, the Justice Department on Friday blocked the use of the city's plan.
The Government said the map "consistently disfavored" Hispanic voters in District 34 in Williamsburg, in the adjoining District 37 in the Bushwick-Cypress Hills area and in District 8, which combines East Harlem with a heavily Hispanic part of the Bronx.
In announcing the rejection, Justice officials said drawing district lines to reflect the makeup of the city was "a job of staggering proportions."
Halfway up the block from La Borinquena, the Ecuadorean, Colombian and Panamanian customers streaming through Alex Fermin's Cibao Grocery are testament to the complexity of ethnic change in the city.
"I don't know much about politics in this country," said Mr. Fermin, a 32-year-old Dominican. "But it seems everybody looks out for your race."
Given the choice, Mr. Fermin said, he would take political power over wealth.
"Through the vote we can get our representation, and they can move the rest of us up," he said. From his storefront, Mr. Fermin could see hundreds of blacks across the street beneath an expansive green tent set up for a four-week revival meeting by the Brooklyn Tabernacle Deliverance Center.
The new Hispanic influx has already made blacks a distant second in political influence, and the new lines of District 34 have widened the gap. It makes blacks 18.11 percent of the total population, 18.38 percent of the voting age population and 25.74 percent of the registered voters.
This hodgepodge of a neighborhood is replicated block after block across a swath of Brooklyn encompassing Districts 34 and 37. Their gerrymandered lines were meant to assure a minority victory in a City Council race.
But in many ways and among many people, the district lines have heightened tension between the racial and ethnic groups and frustrated the community's two established minorities -- blacks and Puerto Ricans.
"I can foresee the future economically and politically, where Hispanics will push the blacks out of the picture completely," said Earl Mann, who is black and who lives just off Broadway in Bushwick.
Mr. Mann's home falls in District 37, where the Government said the districting lines could have been drawn to widen the Hispanic majority that numbered 53 percent of the total population, 51 percent of the voting age population and 44 percent of the registered voters.
 
Blacks Could Lose Clout
 Any increase in Hispanic strength would inevitably reduce the political clout of the area's blacks, who make up 34.45 of the total population and 34.55 of the voting age population but 44 percent of the registered voters, matching the Hispanic numbers.
"Hispanics already have a heavy pull on the district," said Mr. Mann, a 59-year-old semi-retiree who moved to Brooklyn 39 years ago from his native North Carolina. He recalled the days when the area was a largely segregated one of blacks and whites.
"Politically and economically, they have advanced pretty rapidly," he said of the Hispanic residents. "The blacks are going under the rug because of this explosion."
Puerto Ricans in the area expressed similar frustrations.
"We're represented, but not adequately," said Ramon Torres, 55, a messenger wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the flag of Puerto Rico.
From the sidewalk business to automobile part stores to department stores, Hispanic businesses have made their mark in the neighborhood.
"I believe that blacks would have more control if they controlled more," said Arthur Roper, who is black.
Mr. Roper and his 28-year-old son, Wayne, who operate a cosmetics company, Deparee's Beauty Products, were making their rounds delivering supplies to shops along Broadway.
Mr. Mann, who is in his late 50's, said he grew up in South Carolina and Brooklyn believing that political empowerment was the way to advancement. But he has seen the area's population shift, and he now counsels his son to first seek economic power.
"If I had to do it over again, maybe I would choose politics again," he said. "But the political balance has changed. There are a lot of Hispanics, and it's very hard to try to overcome that."

"There is competition in some communities where there is such a mix of different nationalities," he said; "I can foresee the future economically and politically, where Hispanics will push the black out of the picture completely," said Earl Mann, who lives in District 37 in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.

Artists Try to Recreate a Great Street

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 18

 BODY:
Under a giant tent in what used to be a vacant three-acre lot in the middle of downtown Chicago, 15-year-old Melvin Roberson is making plaster of Paris masks. They are inspired by the nightmares that roused him as a child growing up in a tough neighborhood on the city's South Side. One mask has bloated eyeballs and dead bodies falling from its mouth.
Melvin is one of 259 inner-city teen-agers who are turning their experiences into art in a pioneering effort to shoot some economic life into Chicago's old downtown, the city's original retail center before it was eclipsed by the glamor of North Michigan Avenue. 
 Instead of letting the land lie unused while securing tenants for a two million-square-foot office and retail complex that is planned for the lot on the State Street mall, the city and the block's owner, FJV Venture, decided to build an open-air arts-education center to give teen-agers a chance to create and sell their art.
Each day for six weeks, high school students go to a gravel-floored esthetic oasis named Gallery 37 for the number given the block on city maps. Seven tents serve as classrooms for painting, two-dimensional design, ceramics, sculpture, printmaking and metal tooling.
"We thought about ice-skating rinks and ferris wheels or a mini-golf course," said Lois Weisberg, the city's cultural affairs commissioner. "But the developer and our office wanted to do something meaningful."
The students, who were all recommended by art teachers in the schools, are paid $4.25 an hour for a six-hour day in the summer. And their work is sold to the public upon completion.
"'This makes you feel like you're really doing something," said Dujuan Austin, 15.
Flanked by Daley Plaza and City Hall to the west and Michigan Avenue to the east, the block lies in the city's North Loop, once a flourishing urban hub. Government, retailing and other business were rooted there and in time, grew outward like spokes. But a decade ago, many of the neighborhood's buildings had become decrepit and abandoned.
"State Street was a street of rundown movie theaters on the west and aging department stores on the east," says Michael A. Tobin, project director for FJV Venture, a partnership of two Chicago-based development companies, JMB Realty and Metropolitan Structures, and the Levy Organization, a restaurant management company. "There was no new investment since before the war."
But in the last few years the North Loop has seen an aggressive fight against deterioration. Two of the city's big retailers, Marshall Field and Carson Pirie Scott, have pumped considerable amounts of money into their State Street stores in the hopes of stealing back some of the business lost to North Michigan Avenue. And a new player, Boston-based Filene's, will open a store just down State Street from Gallery 37 this fall.
Two blocks north of Gallery 37, Stouffer's Hotels, Chicago Title and Trust and the Leo Burnett Company, among several other corporations, have invested in real estate along the Chicago River in the last few years. "The downtown area is definitely on an upswing," Ms. Weisberg said. "Everybody's betting on it."
Before 1989, when demolition began on the block that Gallery 37 now occupies, about one-third of the buildings on the site were vacant, Mr. Tobin said. Some were abandoned, some were burned down and some still had ground-floor retail shops.
The lot remained unused for about six months before Maggie Daley, the Mayor's wife, proposed the art-program plan. Private and public sponsors contributed money, materials, services and instructors. All told, the project cost about $800,000, though the Department of Cultural Affairs could not say how much of that was city money.
It is hard to predict whether the pilot program will attain its long-term goals: to expose passersby to what some talented low-income teen-agers can do and to nudge the economy of the neighborhood. The sponsors of the program are hoping it will improve the image of the mall area, and thereby foster more interest in it among potential developers.
Even if this does not happen, the program may at least develop a few careers in art.
Dujuan's oil pastel of the Chicago skyline, for example, is selling for $125. And he said he would keep on drawing.
"I never seen this many people doing art before," he said. "People notice you out here, a lot. It makes you feel big."

HEADLINE: SAUDIS WOULD LIFT BOYCOTT IF ISRAEL HALTS SETTLEMENT

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, July 20

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia announced today that it would support Egypt's offer to suspend the 43-year-old Arab boycott of Israel if Israel would suspend settlement-building in the occupied territories.
The Saudi announcement marks the first time any Arab nation besides Egypt has offered to end the boycott, albeit conditionally, before a full peace settlement between Israel and its Arab neighbors. 
 The Saudi move, made during a visit here by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, came after Lebanon had announced that it would join Syria in supporting President Bush's proposal for an Arab-Israeli peace conference.
 
Pressure on Israel
 The Saudi and Lebanese actions were orchestrated by the United States and were designed to increase pressure on Israel to drop its opposition to the American-designed peace conference on the eve of Mr. Baker's arrival in Jerusalem on Sunday.
On Friday, during Mr. Baker's stop in Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt called on Arab nations to suspend the boycott in return for a suspension of settlements.
Mr. Baker is hoping that if he can line up enough Arab overtures of this nature, he will be able to convince Israelis that the Arab world's mood has changed on reconciliation with Israel and make it politically very difficult for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to continue to opposing the peace conference.
 
Rejected by Shamir in Past
 Up to now, Mr. Shamir has categorically rejected any trade-off between the Arab boycott and Israeli settlement-building.
There was no official reaction in Jerusalem to the Saudi move.
The Arab economic boycott of Israel has been in effect since the nation was born in 1948. All 21 members of the Arab League take part in the ban, except for Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Saudi Arabia, as the first Arab nation besides Egypt to endorse a conditional end to the boycott, is clearly taking a certain political risk both at home and abroad.
After talks tonight between Mr. Baker and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Government issued a statement saying: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has closely followed both the positive position adopted by the Syrian Arab Republic under the leadership of President Hafez al-Assad to promote the peace process by agreeing to participate in the forthcoming peace conference, as well as the statements made by His Excellency Hosni Mubarak, President of Egypt, indicating that Israel should suspend the building of settlements, and in such a case it would be possible for the Arab countries to take an appropriate step by suspending the Arab boycott of Israel."
The Saudi declaration continued: "Saudi Arabia supports the statement made by His Excellency President Hosni Mubarak."
Mr. Mubarak first proposed the trade-off involving a suspension of settlements in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem on Friday. But Cairo, unlike Saudi Arabia, already has peaceful relations with Israel and no longer honors the boycott.
American policy has been to oppose further settlements, and the American-Israeli differences over the issue have been a source of tension in recent years and especially in light of the influx of Soviet Jews. Since the 1967 war, tens of thousands of Israelis have settled on land taken from Arabs.
 
Baker Is Pleased
 Reacting to the Saudi announcement, Mr. Baker said: "We are pleased to see this step by the Saudi Government because it indicates a willingness to take concrete steps toward Israel, if Israel is willing to reciprocate. A suspension of the boycott, of course, would signal for one thing a willingness to reconcile with Israel, and clearly reciprocal confidence-building moves of this nature have got to improve the climate for peace. Hopefully, they will make the possibility of progress towards peace much greater."
The Arab boycott has two basic elements: a ban on all trade with Israel, and a secondary boycott that prohibits Arab nations from doing business with any company that does business with Israel.
A senior Saudi official briefing reporters after the announcement today said it was "too early" to say whether the boycott suspension being proposed would apply to both the primary and the second boycotts. Indeed, it was clear from his briefing that the whole idea has not been very fully thought out by either Arab or American officials and that for now it is designed more for its political effect than its immediate applicability.
Saudi officials conceded that it was still not clear how many other Arab nations would be ready to join in this offer and particularly whether Syria would. The Arab League boycott office is in Damascus.
Before today, the Saudis had resisted American appeals to make such an offer, and the Israeli Government had also spurned the idea when it was broached by Mr. Baker several months ago. Politically, it is virtually impossible for Mr. Shamir to accept since settlement building is central to the ideology of his Likud Party, and the idea of suspending new housing in East Jerusalem would be anathema to Israelis across the political spectrum.
Lebanon's announcement came earlier in the day during talks in Cairo between Lebanon's Foreign Minister, Fares Bouez, and Mr. Baker. Mr. Bouez gave Mr. Baker his country's endorsement for the peace conference, which came as little surprise since Syria, which in effect dominates the Lebanese Government these days, gave its go-ahead on Thursday.
"Lebanon is supporting the American proposition based on 242 and 338, resolutions of the United Nations, and is ready to be present at the peace conference raised on these subjects," Mr. Bouez said. Resolution 242 calls for Israel to trade lands occupied in the 1967 war in return for secure and recognized boundaries with its Arab neighbors. Resolution 338 calls for talks to put Resolution 242 into effect.
Mr. Bouez said Lebanon would be ready to enter two-way negotiations with Israel in the context of such a conference.
The Foreign Minister added, though, that Lebanon would also want to raise its insistence on the immediate and unconditional implementation of United Nations Resolution 425, which calls on Israel to withdraw from southern Lebanon.
The United States has commitments from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Lebanon to take part in the proposed peace conference, which would be sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union.
The way American officials envision the conference is as follows: There would be an opening session in which Israel and all of its immediate Arab neighbors -- Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and a delegation of Palestinians -- would take part and make speeches laying down their opening positions. Also attending would be observers representing the United Nations Secretary General, the European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
After this one-day opening, the parties would break up into separate, direct bilateral negotiations. Shortly afterward, Israel would also open direct talks on regional issues like arms control and water problems. At the moment, only Saudi Arabia and the other five members of the Gulf Cooperation Council have committed themselves to such regional talks.
 
Parley Could Reconvene
 The full conference, as the Americans have proposed it, would reconvene after the opening only if all the parties agree to do so, and even then only to hear reports about the progress of negotiations.
Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians have still not agreed to attend. Israel objects to certain procedural elements of the conference -- the fact that a United Nations observer would be able to attend and that the conference could be reconvened occasionally. The Israeli Government argues that the United Nations, which has declared that Zionism equals racism, is unalterably biased against Israel and that any potential for the conference to reconvene would also be dangerous because it might impose solutions on Israel.
Up to now, the Jordanians have wavered because they wanted to see whether Syria, would agree to attend. Mr. Baker will discuss Jordan's position with King Hussein on Sunday.
The Palestinians are inclined to take part, but they are split over how they should represent themselves.

HEADLINE: After 16 Years of War, Beirut Tentatively Reclaims Peace

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, July 20

 BODY:
Thousands of people gathered at a concert in the war-scarred center of this city not long ago to sing for peace.
Mona Hrawi, the wife of President Elias Hrawi, opened the event with a speech in which she compared Lebanon to a flower growing out of a rock, her description of the nation as it emerges from 16 years of civil war. Then musicians, standing at the foot of a statue in the square near the Green Line that once divided the city into its Muslim and Christian sectors, sang, "Give peace a chance." 
 Suddenly a shot rang out, and the crowd stampeded. Mrs. Hrawi was whisked away by her bodyguards, and the prominent guests hurried off in their limousines.
 
Syrian Soldiers Help
 "I felt the knot in the pit of my stomach that brought back the memory and agony of those terrible years of the civil war," said Hussein Jahshan, an 18-year-old student who had come to Martyrs Square for the concert.
For the first time in years, the people of Beirut are living in something close to real peace. The Hrawi Government, with the aid of tens of thousands of Syrian soldiers, has moved to re-exert control over the country's territory for the first time since the spring of 1975, when tensions between Christians and Muslims broke into the open with intenseclashes that heralded what turned into the Middle East's longest-running civil war.
 
15 Year in Athens
 But the shot at the peace concert -- the result of an argument between Lebanese security guards and a Syrian soldier -- is also something of a symbol of Lebanon's new peace. People are returning after years of exile, but many of those who come back do so with grave trepidation. Business is picking up, and foreign delegations are considering opening offices here again. Yet such moves, by and large, are tentative, as one might expect in a nation where truce after truce has fallen apart and 150,000 people have been killed.
One of the recent returnees was Joseph Melki, who looked dazed after landing at Beirut Airport one afternoon this month. Perspiring profusely, he clutched a briefcase in one hand and his newly issued Lebanese passport in the other as he answered routine questions from the Lebanese officer on duty at the emigration counter.
When asked where he was coming from, Mr. Melki answered, "Athens."
"How long have you been away?"
"Fifteen years," Mr. Melki replied.
"This is a long time to be away from home," the officer commented.
Mr. Melki did not reply.
Then the officer stamped his passport and said, "You are most welcome."
Thus Mr. Melki returned to his native country for the first time since he left his home at Karm el Zaitoun, a Christian suburb of Beirut, and relocated his insurance business to the Greek capital in 1976, a year after the war broke out.
Like many of the returnees, Mr. Melki is not sure he will stay.
"I will decide when to bring back my wife and two children when I can determine whether I want to relocate my business in Beirut," he said.
It is the Syrian soldiers standing behind the Hrawi Government who will have a very real effect on Mr. Melki's future. Damascus has supported the Lebanese Government in its effort to recover control of the nation's territory as part of the Arab-brokered pact negotiated by Lebanese legislators at the Saudi resort of Taif in 1989. The pact brought unity to the two sectors of the capital late last year, the first step in a process that also brought an end to the Palestine Liberation Organization's guerrilla presence near the southern port of Sidon recently.
Syria has 40,000 soldiers spread over about 70 percent of Lebanese territory, enforcing the terms of the political pact, which reordered the Lebanese power equation by removing the Christians' advantage in Parliament.
 
Airlines Return to Beirut
 The Government has focused particularly on improving security in the area of the airport in the southern suburbs, once a hotbed of Shiite Muslim militants and an area in which a number of foreigners and Lebanese Christians were kidnapped during the worst of Beirut's lawlessness.
As Lebanese continue to come back to test the new peace, foreign airlines have been resuming flights to this capital that were halted long ago because of the fighting.
So far, 13 airlines have taken the risk of using Beirut Airport again, including Air France, Austrian Airways, Cyprus Airways, the Soviet airline Aeroflot, Egyptair and several East European airlines.
The Lebanese national carrier, Middle East Airlines, is still the busiest. Its chairman, Salim Salam, says more than 300,000 Lebanese are booked to return home this summer. While no accurate figures are available about the number of people who fled during the war, official estimates put the total at three quarters of a million out of a population of three and a half million.
Mr. Salam said the airline's 15 flights fly 3,000 passengers a day.
 
Lifetime Friends Missed
 One of the returning Lebanese, Abdel Rahman Alayli, a 35-year-old Muslim, said he had sold his restaurant in Canada and returned with his family for good.
"What I missed the most in Canada were my lifetime friends," he said. "Besides, I want my children to catch up on their Arabic."
Musa Ayoib, a Christian who has just returned with his family from 10 years in Cyprus, said, "If the present peace survives to the end of this year, Lebanon would be over the hump, and the expatriates would no longer be afraid to stay."
Although Lebanese are returning in larger numbers than ever, Mr. Salam, the Middle East Airlines chairman, complained that Washington still refuses to end its ban on Beirut Airport and flights by the airline to New York.
The American quarantine of Beirut Airport and suspension of Middle East Airlines flights were imposed after the hijacking of a Trans World Airways plane to Beirut by Shiite gunmen in 1985. At the same time the State Department imposed a ban on travel by Americans to Lebanon, which remains in effect.
In any case, most Westerners are very apprehensive about travel to Beirut because of the potential for hostage-taking. Six Americans and six other Westerners who are missing in Lebanon are believed held by clandestine Shiite factions affiliated with Iran.
 
Hostages Hurt Prospects
 Western officials who visited here recently to look over conditions and examine the chances of freeing the captives, told the Lebanese Government that their plight would continue to hurt efforts to convince foreign businesses, diplomats and journalists to return to Beirut.
Nonetheless, business teams from Japan and Europe -- including bankers from France, Belgium and Luxembourg -- have come to explore the possibility of reopening offices in Beirut, the Middle East's banking and commercial center before the civil war.
Business people say the Japanese are primarly interested in investing in rebuilding Beirut's seaside hotels, which were destroyed in the early stages of the civil war. But the Japanese, too, are cautious. A major Japanese company, Sumitomo, reportedly sent a team of senior executives to Cyprus to study the possibiity of a return to Lebanon.
American Express sent its representative in Cyprus to Beirut to report on whether to sell travelers' checks again in Beirut. The sale of the checks was suspended a decade ago.
 
Feelers by Other Countries
 The French, the Germans and the British have also sent out feelers about what opportunities the Beirut market can now offer, people in business circles say.
Lebanese economists are skeptical about quick recovery. One, Kamal Hamdan, said it might take as long as 20 years for equilibrium to return. Estimates by the Government and private business put the total repatriated capital so far at only $200 million, a fraction of the $15 billion Lebanese are believed to have accumulated abroad in the last decade and a half.
Most of the money brought back went in to real estate, widely regarded as a fairly secure investment under the uncertain political conditions.
High-rise apartment buildings are being built, but they are doing very little to ease housing shortages, because condominums are offered for sale at high cost and are not for rent. A three bedroom apartment sells at about $200,000, a cost that is out of reach for most Lebanese.
 
Squatters Face Eviction
 Landlords of older buildings face the problem of evicting squatters who occupied apartments after they had been driven out of their homes in other parts of the country by the violence.
As the squatters face eviction to accommodate returnees, many other Lebanese who stayed have been enjoying life as they have been unable to do with any consistency since the war started 16 years ago.
The beaches and mountain resorts are packed. The St. George's Yacht Club in the predominantly Muslim western part of the city, as well as the Kaslik Yacht Club near the Christian port of Junieh, have reopened.
The golf club near the airport has published newspaper announcements asking members to pay their dues. Golfers are seen daily on the course.
 
An Evening Out
 When night falls, couples and sometimes whole families take off for the nightclubs or theaters to listen to an Arabic crooner or watch a belly dancer, who appears to a drum roll as the hall resounds to whistling and shouting. Women, young and old, get caught up in the excitement, wrapping scarves around their hips and joining the dancer in the gyrations.
At many of Beirut's nightspots, an evening out ends with everybody joining in what is now the most popular Lebanese song, a paean of hope including the words, "Lebanon is being rebuilt and will be better and more beautiful than ever before."
That sentiment was echoed at the concert at Martyrs Square, held in the devastated heart of the city that was for years a wasteland peopled only by killers who lived in the shadow of ruined buildings and piles of rubble.
And the reaction of those attending the event was perhaps symbolic of Beirut's past and its future: Although almost half of the crowd fled, the others stayed, and the concert continued for two hours after the shot was fired.
As Maha Samara, a Beirut journalist, said: "What we have is not an ideal peace. But it gives us something to build on."

Comparison to '75 Makes Too Much of a Bad Thing

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB

 BODY:
THROUGH the twisting negotiations that led to a New York City budget a few weeks ago, estimates of deficits, revenues and tax projections came and went like the odds on a racetrack tote board. But one number remained fixed, looming grimly above the others: 1975.
That was the year, with the city's near bankruptcy and sweeping layoffs and service cutbacks, that has become accepted shorthand for municipal disaster. And no matter what their agendas, virtually all the players in this year's budget process had an interest in evoking 1975. 
 Yet despite the pain, discomfort and cost in any budget with thousands of layoffs and higher taxes, this budget year was far different -- and far milder -- than 1975. In fact, 1965 or 1970 or any of a half dozen other pre-1975 years offers closer parallels to the current year than the darkest one in the city's recent fiscal history.
The point is more than incidental. Planning in a crisis is hard enough. Planning in a panicky crisis is even harder, with meat axes too often taking the place of scalpels.
"The mid-70's crisis as it's gone into history has been very fundamentally misunderstood," said Samuel Ehrenhalt, regional director of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It's been seen in an economic vacuum without a recognition that it was fundamentally an outgrowth of an economic crisis. Expenditures and municipal employment kept going up even while revenues were being cut by a major economic crisis."
 
A Pattern of Borrowing
 For more than 25 years, the city has been dealing on and off with budget deficits roughly comparable to the $3 billion-plus gap in this year's $28.5 billion budget, which was closed with $735 million in new taxes, $2 billion in service cutbacks and $500 million in supposed productivity increases.
In 1965 the city faced a $255.8 million gap in a budget of $3.87 billion. And in that year it established a pattern for closing deficits that eventually contributed to the near bankruptcy of 1975. It borrowed. At the behest of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and the Legislature approved a plan enabling the city to close its gap by borrowing against estimates of anticipated revenues.
 By 1970, when the city's short-term debt had doubled to $1.3 billion, and its long-term debt stood at $5.2 billion, its biggest economic downturn since the Depression took place.
After years of steady job growth that left the city with its highest employment total ever -- 3.8 million -- a string of unprecedented job losses unfolded. In 1970, 52,000 jobs were lost. By 1977, the city had lost more than 600,000 jobs -- close to 20 percent of its total -- largely in factories.
Yet the city, with the approval of the state, its underwriters and the bond rating agencies, kept enlarging its budget -- increasing it by nearly 20 percent in 1970 alone -- along with its work force, and it kept borrowing to pay for everything. When disaster struck in 1975, the city was carrying more than $12 billion in long- and short-term debt.
The results were sudden and brutal: 20,000 layoffs including police and firefighters, a gradual reduction of 85,000 jobs, elimination of the entire capital budget and the introduction of formerly verboten changes, including tuition for the City University.
 
'Not Doomsday'
 This year's crisis appears to have more in common with the 1970 or 1971 crunch than it does with 1975. After the strongest economic boom here since World War II, the city lost roughly 120,000 jobs between October 1989 and last May. Between 1969 and 1971, by comparison, the city lost a total of 186,000 jobs.
Yet there are differences in the way the city has reacted this time. First, because of sweeping budget safeguards enacted after 1975, the city couldn't spend extravagantly if it wanted to. In comparison to the close to 20 percent increase in the budget in 1970, there was barely a 2 percent increase this year. Furthermore, the city's budget is not saddled with the overbearing accumulation of short-term debt of the 1970's. And rather than experiencing a budget crunch on a different order from that of all but a handful of other governments, it is living out its version of a malady afflicting state and local governments from Maine to California.
Perhaps most significantly, despite the thousands of lost jobs anticipated in the expected demise of Pan American Airlines and the merger of Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover banks, many economists doubt the local downturn will approach that in the 1970's.
"Is New York City's pain greater than a lot of local areas?" asked Maury Cooper, senior vice president of Standard & Poor's, the bond rating agency. "I would argue no, it isn't. In terms of the overall functioning of the city, it will result in an erosion, but it's certainly not doomsday."
Mr. Ehrenhalt says while job losses continue, the rate of decline has been slowing. Some economists predict that the losses will bottom at 200,000, a third the size of the 1970's contraction.
The city still faces billions of dollars in potential budgetary shortfalls in the next few years. And even if it didn't, its array of social needs, from housing to AIDS treatment to education, would create compelling arguments for more assistance than the city could ever provide.
But in the absence of hyperbole, New York can at least address its budgetary issues in a more nuanced way: since the municipal work force expanded by 50,000 in the 1980's, is there room for further trimming? Is it possible to talk about "downsizing" government without gutting service?
As John H. Mollenkopf, who teaches political science at the City University Graduate Center, said, "In retrenchment you can force agencies to work together in different ways and have more results-oriented criterion."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Under the Voting Law, Citizens' Rights Get More Than Lip Service

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FROM the barrios of Harlem to the bayous of Louisiana to the cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta, the poorest part of the nation's poorest state, the long arm of the Federal Voting Rights Act is being felt once again.
Flexing its muscle, the Justice Department has objected to redistricting plans for both houses of the State Legislatures in Mississippi and Louisiana. On Friday, John R. Dunne, the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, blocked use of a new districting plan for the New York City Council, saying it tended to "minimize Hispanic voting strength" in parts of the city. 
 The law, which represents an extraordinary Federal interference in state and local affairs, will be fodder for debate in the next year as Justice Department lawyers review more than 1,000 redistricting plans for any trace of discrimination against voters who are black, Hispanic or of other minority groups.
The Bush Administration, seemingly ambivalent in its general approach to civil rights and vehement in its opposition to the appearance of racial quotas, is a vigorous enforcer of the Voting Rights Act.
To be sure, the Administration wants to appeal to Hispanic voters across the country, and some Republicans want to maximize black voting strength in urban districts, on the theory that Republican candidates would then fare better in nearby suburban districts.
But there are other, perhaps more compelling, reasons to bolster the Voting Rights Act, including a long series of pertinent judicial decisions. In addition, the Justice Department has a small group of career Government lawyers with vast experience in scrutinizing the handiwork of wily local politicians. And in the last nine years, Congress and the Supreme Court have made it easier for minority groups to prove violations of the voting rights law. The Administration could be embarrassed if the Justice Department approved a redistricting plan and a Federal court later found that the plan violated the law.
In an interview last week, Mr. Dunne called the Voting Rights Act "probably the most important civil rights law on the books." He added, "The whole spirit of the Voting Rights Act is that a particular group cannot gang up to deprive individual members of a protected minority of their rights."
Abigail M. Thernstrom, a political scientist who has written a book on the law, sees it differently. "We are racially gerrymandering the whole country, on the assumption that the law requires the maximum number of safe black and Hispanic districts," she said. The assumption "rests on the pernicious premise that black and Hispanic voters are never adequately represented except by a black or a Hispanic, that whites cannot properly represent blacks," she said.
In ruling on the New York plan, the Justice Department said there was no requirement for "racial or ethnic proportional results."
 The law requires states with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department or the Federal District Court here before they can make any change in voting laws or election procedures. This "preclearance" requirement applies to nine states and to portions of seven others, including three New York boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. Preclearance may have been necessary in the 1960's, but is it needed today, when there are more than 7,000 black elected officials nationwide?
 
'Still a Lot of Mischief Going On'
 "I am encouraged that the trend appears to be that we are headed toward a day when we will not need preclearance," said Mr. Dunne, a former New York State Senator. "But I think that we are a long way from that day," he added, because "there is still a lot of mischief going on out there."
The voting rights law, originally passed in 1965, eliminated literacy tests and poll taxes. But Federal judges found that such flagrant discrimination was replaced with electoral devices that tended to nullify and dilute the black vote. These devices included at-large voting schemes, multimember districts and racial gerrymandering of district lines to favor whites. When the Justice Department reviews a redistricting plan today, it typically focuses on such questions as whether the proposal packs members of a minority group into one district or disperses them among several districts so as to dilute their voting strength.
 Frank R. Parker, director of the voting rights project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who has represented Mississippi blacks in court cases for 20 years, argues that the law now requires state and local authorities to create majority black and Hispanic districts "wherever possible."
The Mississippi plans rejected by the Justice Department last month would have increased the number of State House and Senate districts in which blacks account for a majority of the population. But Mr. Dunne, in objecting to the plans, noted that the State Legislature had rejected alternatives that would have created even more black-majority districts.
Mr. Parker said the voting rights law was "widely viewed as the most successful piece of civil rights legislation ever enacted by Congress," and he said that it was "an instrument of its own perpetuation." For "as blacks registered to vote and gained political participation at state, county and local levels," he said, "members of Congress from those states opposed the Voting Rights Act at their peril."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
For Lagging American Banks, Survival Means Consolidation

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
ANY doubts about the future of American banking were pretty much settled last week. The Chemical Banking Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, two of the industry's giants, announced they were merging to pare costs and get in shape financially for the coming era of national banking. It was a bellwether.
The 1990's, by all accounts, will be a decade of wrenching consolidation for the nation's 12,300 banks. And the Chemical-Manufacturers Hanover merger will undoubtedly prompt other banks, large and small, to start browsing for partners. 
 The pace of the move toward fewer, bigger banks is a matter of debate, but the trend is inevitable. Compared to other major industrial countries, the United States is brimming with banks. Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Canada have strong national banks. Their branch networks are spread nationwide and in each nation a handful of banks are dominant. But since the early 19th century, American policy supported the Jeffersonian ideal of small community banks, protecting the little guy from the perceived twin dangers of Eastern financiers and concentrated economic power. The result has been a hodgepodge of regulation that, among other things, gives states the power to prevent out-of-state institutions from coming in.
Today, the American approach looks parochial and outdated. The big money center banks have been kept from establishing national branch networks. With their horizons in consumer banking limited, Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and others tried riskier fields, like lending to third world countries, to commercial real estate and to finance corporate takeovers -- the sources of most the big banks' bad loans these days.
"If we had had nationwide banking in the '70s, the banking world would be very different today," said Robert E. Litan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 
Moving Toward Change
 Foreign banks, with their national deposit-gathering networks, surpassed the American majors in size during the 1980's. In 1982, for example, Citicorp was the world's largest bank. Last year, Citicorp (assets: $217 billion) ranked 18th, trailing banks from Japan, France, Germany, Britain and the Netherlands.
The United States, with more banks, also has more bank failures. Again, the geographic restrictions are partly to blame. Banks legislatively confined to one state or region are hostage to local markets, as banks in Texas and New England found to their regret. The benefits of scale and diversity in banking have been proved repeatedly over the years. In the Depression, the United States lost thousands of banks. By contrast, the Canadian banking system, dominated by 10 national institutions, did not have a single Depression-era bank failure.
After the savings and loan fiasco and the rising number of bank failures, the Administration and Congress are moving to reform bank regulation. The House and Senate are both working on legislation. And while much remains uncertain, it seems clear that Congress will permit banks to set up national branch networks and offer new services, such as selling stocks and bonds to customers. In return for the new powers, regulation will likely stiffen so that banking supervisors move in quickly if a bank's capital cushion against losses or credit rating falls below certain benchmarks.
 
The Winnowing Process
 Both economics and policy, then, are fueling the consolidation in banking. McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, estimates that the top 125 largest banking companies, which hold two-thirds of the industry's $3.2 trillion in assets, may be winnowed down to no more than 15 companies by the mid-1990's.
While they control most of the assets, the 125 biggest companies account for only 10 percent of the nation's banks. The vast majority of American banks are tiny by comparison; about 9,000 banks have assets of $100 million or less. In their home markets, they are often quite strong. That is a major reason why even analysts who say that the number of banks will eventually shrink to 2,000 or less figure the process may take several decades.
Jeffrey Gerhart, the president of First National Bank of Newman Grove, Neb., is the archetypal community banker, who fears that communities will eventually suffer from the banking consolidation, because lending decisions will be made elsewhere. "I see a lot of problems, even if it is inevitable." he said.
Most rural banks, like First National of Newman Grove, should have little to fear from national banking. But the big banks are likely to make inroads in larger metropolitan markets as they set up large regional and, later, national networks. Already, big regional banks like Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and NCNB Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., have taken advantange of gradually easing state laws to move into nearby states. Some of these so-called superregionals are quite profitable and innovative in terms of services.
For consumers, the transition to greater competition nationally promises a different banking experience. To gain market share, for example, Banc One branches in many locations often stay open into the evening during the week and keep weekend hours to accommodate people's shopping habits. "In the future, banks are increasingly going have to win customers with better service just like in any other business," said John B. McCoy, chairman of Banc One.
Bigger will not necessarily be better in the new world of banking. And in industry after industry, big mergers like the Chemical-Manufacturers combination have proved to be difficult to manage successfully. But analysts say those that emerge from the Darwinian process of elimination will be stronger and offer better service to customers than the banking industry of today.
"We should have world-class institutions that can really make a difference in how our economy functions," said Lowell Bryan, a director of McKinsey.

The Senate Grits Its Teeth and Says Yes

 BODY:
IT reached the floor of the Senate at 8:47 P.M., and by 9:50 the vote was over, and it had passed. Remarkable speed for a body known for a deliberateness bordering on the ponderous. But then, the bill at hand was a pay raise.
By a 53-to-45 vote, senators decided that they could forgo the $23,068 they are allowed to earn from speaking fees each year as long as they simultaneously raised their pay by $23,200. With that, they will earn $125,100 a year. That is the same amount members of the House voted themselves in 1989, and that apparently stuck in the craws of many senators. Not only did the 435 members of the House earn more than the nation's 100 senators did, but so did some Federal judges, officials, and even some House staff members. 
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, one of those who marshaled votes for the bill, said it was demeaning for senators to earn less than representatives and warned his colleagues: "Now's not the time to run from a tough decision."
But another aspect of wanting to keep up appearances was also responsible for the raise. Members of Congress have been under pressure for years to give up the substantial honoraria they earn for making speeches. Those speeches are usually to gatherings of people who want something from the Senate, and, as Mr. Byrd noted: "There's nothing honorable about honoraria. It's simply a way for special interest groups to gain access to senators."
The consumer advocate Ralph Nader was not swayed, and called the quick debate and vote a "pre-midnight raid on taxpayers" that "stiffed the American people."
And senators who voted against the pay increase said they were reluctant to accept one in the middle of a recession. "It's an issue of merit pay," said Senator John Seymour, Republican of California. "If you're running a business, you don't give yourself a raise when you're in the red and your firm isn't producing."
For the raise to take effect when the Federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1, the House must also approve the legislative appropriations bill to which the measure was attached, and President Bush must sign it. The first step, at least, would seem to be assured -- under the circumstances, would the House dare say no?

Syria's Tactical Leap Into the Peace Process

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria

 BODY:
IMMEDIATELY after the gulf war ended, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d set off on his first Middle East peacemaking mission, buoyed by a simple supposition: that the American defeat of Saddam Hussein had opened a new "window of opportunity" for a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. What Mr. Baker seems to have discovered five trips later, though, when Syria finally accepted the American peace conference proposal, is that he was right about the window of opportunity but wrong about what had opened it. It was not the end of the gulf war. It was the end of the cold war.
More than any other Arab regime, the Syrian Government led by President Hafez al-Assad has been a creature of the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. Syria lived off the cold war for three decades, milking billions in economic and military aid from Moscow in return for being its most loyal Middle East ally and for allowing the Soviet Navy to use Syria's Mediterranean ports, from which it could better compete with the United States Sixth Fleet. The Syrians could always count on the Soviets to protect them from the Americans in the diplomatic sphere, and to rearm them after every war with Israel. 
 And then, in 1985, came Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the thaw in the cold war. Two years later, while on a state visit to Moscow in April 1987, Mr. Assad got his first Soviet cold shower. In a toast to the Syrian President at a state dinner, Mr. Gorbachev raised his glass and told a stunned Mr. Assad that it was time to end the war with Israel. The world was changing, said Mr. Gorbachev, and Syria would have to change with it. Privately, Mr. Assad was told that Syria's hopes for achieving "strategic parity" with Israel were a chimera, best forgotten.
Two years later, the Soviet Union was effectively driven back to its borders in Europe by popular revolutions from Berlin to Bucharest. This not only confirmed and hastened the diminution of Soviet power, but also deprived Syria of the bloc of Eastern European Communist regimes it had been able to count on for economic and military backing beyond what Moscow could deliver.
By 1990, Mr. Assad had awakened, looked around and discovered he was an orphan. He had two choices: Try, like Fidel Castro in Cuba, to be more radical than the Soviets, or begin to swim with the tide. Ever the Machiavellian prince, Mr. Assad started to swim, and last week he floated right into the waiting arms of Mr. Baker. The Syrian leader, who had always rejected direct talks with Israel, said he was prepared to take part in a peace conference with Israel on American terms -- which meant direct negotiations.
Mr. Assad does not appear to have been driven to this change by an epiphany that the Jewish people really are entitled to a state in Palestine. In his own unique style, he explained his policy shift during a press conference last week. The reason, he indicated, was simply that he had no choice but to bow to the American imperium, or, as he put it: "In Arabic we say, 'Do you want grapes or do you want to fight the vineyard keeper?' We want the grapes."
 
A No-Lose Proposition?
 For the Syrian leader, accepting the American terms could turn out to be a no-lose proposition. If the Israelis actually drop their objections to the American-proposed conference, he might get back some or all of the Golan Heights -- a strategic highland occupied by Israel in 1967 in a war initiated by Syria. If not, he has a chance to be welcomed anyway into the Western fraternity, with all of the strategic and economic benefits that implies. The warmth of that welcome will depend on how much Washington cares to press him on other issues, notably Syria's support for terrorists.
Mr. Assad's strategic move in foreign policy has also been reflected in domestic policy. A new commerce law was just passed, opening the door wide to foreign investment, and there is now much vague talk in the ruling Baath Party about instituting political pluralism. Mr. Assad is advertising the next Baath Party conference -- it is not clear when it will be held -- as the "Second Corrective Movement." (The first "Corrective Movement" was his seizure of power in 1970.) It surely is not Jeffersonian democracy that Mr. Assad has in mind to install, but diplomats in Damascus say he clearly recognizes that some greater degree of power sharing is probably necessary.
 
A Peace of Sorts
 From Israel's point of view, the outcome of the gulf war, if anything, has diminished all the more any desire to do a deal with Mr. Assad. To put it simply: By destroying Iraq's army and almost all its weapons of mass destruction, the United States has removed the greatest strategic threat to Israel's existence. Never has the regional balance of power been more in Israel's favor. By resisting America's invitation to trade land for peace with the Arabs, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is asking in effect: Why take chances now?
Mr. Shamir understands that the Syrian leader has not suddenly gone through therapy. And Mr. Shamir already has the only peace he feels he needs from Syria -- a peace based on a favorable balance of power, with Israel sitting atop the Golan Heights. Mr. Assad could sing the Israeli national anthem every day for the rest of his life and Mr. Shamir -- like most Israelis -- would still never trust him in a swap of land for peace. Too much has gone between them.
The only thing that might mitigate this Israeli attitude is not an outgrowth of the gulf war, but more fallout from the end of the cold war: Israel is being flooded with Soviet Jews and cannot resettle them without massive American economic help. If Mr. Shamir snubs Washington now, that aid could be imperiled.
Mr. Shamir also needs his grapes. Can he afford to fight the vineyard keeper?

HEADLINE: The Nation;
A Longtime Precedent for Disregarding Precedent

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN the Supreme Court overturned five of its own precedents during its last term, all in the area of criminal defendants' rights, liberals on and off the Court complained that the new majority had embarked on a course not only regrettable but illegitimate. Nothing about the cases had changed, Justice Thurgood Marshall declared in an angry dissent from one of the rulings, issued hours before he announced his decision to retire, adding: "Only the personnel of this Court did."
Conservatives, not surprisingly, saw the matter very differently -- it was "payback time," as L. Gordon Crovitz, a Wall Street Journal editorial page editor, wrote in a recent column. "The hypocrisy here is impressive," he wrote, noting that liberal Justices were not shy about overturning precedents when they had the votes. 
 Events of the recent term, as well as the prospect that the Court may soon overrule its 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion, have placed the question of judicial respect for precedent in an unaccustomed spotlight. What that spotlight reveals is no abstract legal axiom, but rather an earthy mix of law, politics and history in which one of the few consistent elements has been inconsistency.
The command of precedent has deep roots in Anglo-American legal tradition. Lawyers and judges often use the Latin phrase "stare decisis," meaning "to stand by things decided." The doctrine is binding on lower courts, meaning that Federal trial and appeals court judges must apply Supreme Court precedent whether or not they agree with it. Last year, when the Senate Judiciary Committee was examining Clarence Thomas for a seat on the Federal appeals court here, members asked for his views on a variety of Supreme Court precedents. He replied that because he would be obliged to apply those precedents in any event, his own views were irrelevant.
The question is bound to recur now that Judge Thomas is a Supreme Court nominee. The Supreme Court, too, has regarded itself as bound by precedent -- except for the more than 260 times that the Justices have overruled themselves since 1810, when the Court rejected a two-year-old precedent. During the 16 years that Earl Warren was Chief Justice, the Court overruled 63 cases. During Warren E. Burger's 17-year tenure as Chief Justice, the Court overruled precedent 61 times.
The virtues and vices of stare decisis have been debated almost endlessly in judicial opinions, law review articles and other commentaries. The virtues of the doctrine are apparent. It fosters stability in the law and, particularly in a political system that gives enormous power to unelected judges, a sense of legitimacy in judicial institutions. As Justice John Paul Stevens said in a 1981 opinion, citizens should be able to have confidence that the rules they rely on "are rules of law and not merely the opinions of a small group of men who temporarily occupy high office."
But a Court that cannot change its mind is one that cannot acknowledge old mistakes or adjust to new insights -- for example, that separate is not equal after all, as the Court concluded in 1954 when, in Brown v. Board of Education, it unanimously overruled an 1896 decision, Plessy v. Ferguson.
On the current Court, Justice Antonin Scalia is the most aggressive attacker of stare decisis. Dissenting in South Carolina v. Gathers, a 1989 decision that barred prosecutors in death penalty proceedings from introducing evidence about the quality of the murder victim's life and the grief of the survivors, he said that his oath of office bound him to interpret and apply the Constitution as he understood it, not as it might have been erroneously interpreted by Justices in the past.
Few members of the Court have put the argument so bluntly. But even fewer have been unwilling to abandon precedents they disagreed with.
In a 1983 case, City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, a majority opinion by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. strongly reaffirmed Roe v. Wade, the 1973 abortion precedent, with the admonition that stare decisis "is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law."
Yet three years later, Justice Powell, who retired in 1987, wrote a majority opinion in Batson v. Kentucky, permitting criminal defendants to challenge the prosecution's exclusion of jurors on the basis of race. That decision overruled a 1965 Supreme Court case, Swain v. Alabama, which had set an evidentiary standard for bringing such challenges that defendants as a practical matter could never meet. In their dissents, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Justice William H. Rehnquist, now the Chief Justice, said it was "truly extraordinary" for the Court to overrule a precedent on the basis of an argument that the parties in the case had not made.
Yet last month, in Payne v. Tennessee, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote a majority opinion overturning South Carolina v. Gathers and a similar decision restricting victim impact evidence. Neither the death-row inmate in the case, Pervis Payne, nor the state of Tennessee had asked the Court to overrule the precedents.
It is tempting to conclude that stare decisis is just so much sauce for alternating geese and ganders. But another element gives the Court's current approach to precedent added significance, as something more than just a 1991 version of "My Turn" by William Rehnquist. It is the sense that the new majority is not waiting for errors to be brought to its attention but is on a search-and-destroy mission against a generation of jurisprudence that it sees as fundamentally misguided.
Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion in the Payne case provided a blueprint for the Court's new approach. In cases involving economic doctrine, he said, stare decisis should be at its "acme" because people need stability to plan their business affairs. But in cases involving "procedural and evidentiary rules" -- a description fitting much of criminal law -- "the opposite is true," he said. He appeared to mean that criminals should not be allowed to rely on favorable precedents.
Cases decided by "the narrowest of margins" and over "spirited dissents" are particularly appropriate for overruling, the Chief Justice said. With the Court so closely divided for so long, that description fits many important rulings of the last two decades. The question is not whether but which and how many precedents will be swept away, and what the Court will put in their place.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
A Costly 10 Percent

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

DATELINE: CLEVELAND

 BODY:
Among the people of 10 industrialized nations, those of the United States were found in 1990 to be the least satisfied with their health care system. Yet, the U.S. allocates to medical care the highest proportion of income -- 12.2 percent of gross national product -- of any nation.
 You don't have to be a brain surgeon to know that there's something wrong here -- spiraling expense not least. The cost of corporate medical benefits rose, in an often cited example, to $3,161 per employee in 1990, 44 percent more than in 1988.
 
 But that figure is misleading, not because it's wrong, but because of that seemingly precise phrase "per employee." The experience of Blue Cross-Blue Shield in the Cleveland area suggests that a major cause of rising health care costs is the expense of caring for a small number of people with very severe medical problems.
 In this area, Blue Cross-Blue Shield insures about 64,000 employees in "small groups" ranging from 2 to 150 employees, with more than half numbering less than 50 members. In 1989, health benefits paid out to group members totaled $123 million, an average -- as such things usually are reckoned -- of $1,923 each.
 In fact, a study for John Burry Jr., chief executive of Ohio's Blue Cross-Blue Shield, found that for 90 percent of all those insured, benefit payments averaged only $794. For the remaining 10 percent, with major health problems, average benefits soared to $10,529. Thus, 10 percent of small-group employees accounted for $79.7 million of the $123 million in total benefits -- about twice the benefits of the other 90 percent.
 The same principle applies to that expensive top 10 percent. Among these very sick individuals, just 1 percent received $29.1 million in benefits, nearly half the total. That 1 percent received about a quarter of all benefits.
 Put another way, 50 people -- victims of major, sometimes chronic problems like muscular dystrophy, cancer and mental disorders -- alone required more in health care benefits than 40,000 of the people in the 90 percent requiring the least care. Three organ transplants, for a graphic example, generated nearly $1 million in benefit payouts. Similarly, a 12 percent increase in "inpatient days per thousand" -- which could drive up a small group's costs -- could be the result of increased hospitalization for only one person.
 No wonder Mr. Burry argues that "the health problems of the top few percentiles of health care utilizers drive the overall health care costs of the entire group." But traditional "per employee" cost-containment efforts rarely are based on or effectively deal with this fact -- which probably would be replicated on a larger scale than the reasonably representative Cleveland study.
 Mr. Burry advocates "key strategies" for employers that would recognize the importance of these relatively few high-cost cases. One would rely on "individual case management" -- for instance, shortening the hospital stay of a hip-replacement patient by paying for a ramp to his or her home.
 Another asks whether every hospital should be capable of every form of exotic treatment -- transplants, open heart surgery and the like. Mr. Burry, instead, would establish "centers of excellence" and negotiate with each a fixed fee for such expensive procedures, to be charged by the hospital; it would then pay surgeons, specialists, staff, etc. He believes this would drive down the current high costs of the kind of treatment usually needed by only a small number of patients.
 More controversially, Mr. Burry points out that the development of new technologies, while helping to keep some people alive, has resulted in spectacularly rising costs. "Is it fair," he asked in a recent speech, "to allocate the astronomical costs of these quasi-experimental (in some cases) procedures and technology to the employer and/or the individual?"
That raises interesting possibilities, as a national election campaign renews interest in an expensive but deficient system in which more than 30 million Americans have no health care insurance at all:
 Can something be done politically both to lower the cost of caring for the expensive 10 percent, and to take that cost off the shoulders of the relatively healthy 90 percent? Might that help pay for extending some form of health care protection to the millions who now have none?

HEADLINE: We Need Informed Discussion of Health Plans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The long-awaited Democratic leadership bill for a national program of health insurance was introduced on June 5 by Senators George J. Mitchell, Edward M. Kennedy, Donald W. Riegle Jr. and Jay Rockefeller. This answer to the plight of 60 million regularly or intermittently uninsured Americans and the skyrocketing cost of health care for all was briefly reported by the news media and then generally ignored. 
 When the bill, S. 1227, with 345 pages of complex text, became available, the reason was clear. The proposal is simply too complicated for the average person to understand. Private insurance for employees would be mandated for larger employers. An ambiguous supplementary plan called AmeriCare, largely covered by contributions, could be authorized for those not otherwise covered. Special provisions are attempted for small businesses. It would largely subsume Medicaid and be administered by the states.
No direct plan for controlling costs of medical providers is included in the bill, but arrangements for negotiations are authorized. This whole program sounds like a crazy quilt pieced together from existing programs while trying to avoid the sensitive toes of hospitals, physicians and insurance companies.
I have not seen any subsequent commentary or analysis of this bill, nor mention of another bill, H.R. 1200 introduced by Representative Frank Russo and 31 other members of the House. This bill provides a single national program covering all major health needs to be paid for by the United States Government. At a recent hearing of a subcommittee of the House Committee on Government Operations it was indicated that the Canadian experience demonstrated such a plan could save us $67 billion a year in paperwork alone. It seems to me $67 billion is a high price to pay for our love affair with a competitive free-market economy, inappropriate to the health-care situation.
Both bills deserve study and public debate as a preliminary to solving a critical national problem. We spend more on health care and get less for it than any other industrial country in the world.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
American Women on Parade: Pat Answers, Few Revelations

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg; Vicki Goldberg's new book, "The Power of Photography: How Photographs Changed Our Lives," will be published in October.

 BODY:
If someone asked you to take a picture that would answer the question "What does the American woman look like?" who would be your choice? Julia Roberts? Sandra Day O'Connor? A 36-year-old computer programmer in Kansas City with 1.2 children? Someone -- Esquire magazine, to be exact -- did ask a number of fashion, editorial, reportage and art photographers to take just such a picture, and the answers can be seen in an exhibition called "How She Looks" at the Staley-Wise Gallery (560 Broadway, through July 31) and in the August issue of Esquire.
Fifty photographers, later edited down to 26, and ranging from Matthew Rolston at the glamour end of the spectrum to Larry Fink at the gallery end, were asked by the magazine's editors to "surprise us." Unfortunately, most did not, so revelations are in short supply, but in the predictability of their answers lies a social lesson, and the maverick pictures in the show make up for the dull ones en route. 
 Two photographs, both 20-by-24-inch Polaroids, stand out for idiosyncrasy. In William Wegman's "Performance Artist Fay Ray, Weimaraner," the face of his well-known dog emerging from an enormous, frothy, black wig tops the body of a young woman who gestures with delicate arms and wears a jumpsuit that might accommodate both herself and Fay. One look at this American female's earnest, soulful face and highly intelligent eyes should convince you of the utter seriousness of her performance, although it is less clear whether the photographer was entirely ironic in portraying the American woman as a bitch.
In "Jessica Tandy, Actress," Joyce Tenneson casts Miss Tandy as a kind of classic muse, dressed in strapless muslin with a transparent shawl and holding a twisted wand apparently made of metal and streaks of light. The actress's flesh is pale, pale pink, her scant hair barely gray, the muslin cream-colored, the background a soft shade of unpolished brass. Mysteriously deliquescent, the photograph celebrates Miss Tandy's beauty and by extension old age itself, and the woman at its center seems to be disappearing before our eyes.
The overwhelming majority of the women in this show (including the Weimaraner) are fairly young -- Keith Carter even contributes a nice portrait of pre-adolescent girls -- or are made to look younger than they are. As half of the women in this country are older than 33.8 and more than 18 million are 65 or over, it is a relief to see several photographers addressing age.
Larry Fink's black-and-white portrait of "Maggie Kuhn and Sylvia Kleinman, Gray Panthers" -- the former is head of the Panthers, the latter the photographer's mother -- is crammed with factual information, from the affectionate pose to the patterns on sweaters and wallpaper to Ms. Kuhn's twisted, arthritic hand. Nicholas Nixon's three images of "The Brown Sisters" come from his simple but penetrating exploration of time, a series of pictures he has taken of his wife and her three sisters every year since 1975, tracing changes wrought by age, fashion, and fortune, and hinting at subtle shifts in personality and family relationships. The magazine had the good grace to print them all.
Take a copy of Esquire with you to the gallery; the comparison amounts to a succinct lesson in originals, reproductions and picture presentation. Certain pictures, especially the large Polaroids, are far more successful on the wall, whereas some of the more journalistic images strike a livelier note on the page. The quality of Esquire's reproduction is fine, but color is always tricky; it can vary from print to print even in the darkroom. And color almost always translates differently on a printing press; what the photographer witnessed is not quite what we see.
The youth and glamour predominant in this show are gently spoofed in Richard Gordon's " '32 Marilyns': Miss Artichoke Festival, San Francisco": 32 models in white halter-neck dresses and blond, curly wigs a la Marilyn in "The Seven Year Itch." These and 15 more like them, not one of whom resembled the original in the least, were hired to pass out pieces of artichoke at the festival to commemorate that great moment in 1947 when Marilyn, still largely unknown, became the first Miss Artichoke in history.
There are good pictures, if not in every case up to their best work, by such photographers as William Coupon, Sally Gall, Greg Gorman, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, Mary Ellen Mark, Dan Peebles, Neal Slavin. The general impression of this exhibition is that the American woman is young, attractive, lean, healthy, sexy and, more likely than not, white and an actress. Different photographers might have come up with different responses, but the dice were loaded for this particular set. No one asked for a demographic or economic cross section of America, and none was supplied. No poor folks here, though there is a little ethnic variety; a bit more was submitted but edited out on grounds of quality.
The project, brainchild of Alison Morley, Esquire's picture editor, was actually an ambitious and rather daring magazine assignment; most of the participants simply did not live up to it. Not that offering an endless variety of women for men to stare at is exactly a bold notion, but giving photographers free rein in style and subject, then allotting 30 pages to the result is hardly standard magazine practice.
Although the editors' letter to the photographers stressed that they should not do what they thought the magazine would ordinarily want, many did just that. According to Ms. Morley, tough reporters took soft pictures, mostly of the usual young, attractive, etc., and some ordered up cheesecake, fairly tame by today's standards. (Everyone knows that the pneumatic Varga and Petty girls long ago traded in their tiny garments, and an Esquire woman is now supposed to have a profession as well as a bosom.) Photographers with more far-ranging ideas still came up with pat answers: more than one suggested Elizabeth Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, Cher and, on the literary side, Eudora Welty. The editors tried to discourage the general drift toward major monuments and ended up with a certain amount of garden-variety decoration.
Is this indeed how the American woman looks, youthful and pretty and sure of her appeal? Well, yes, that woman is all over the tube and the silver screen, and she owns the ads; she's on the covers of the men's magazines and the women's magazines; she's just about the only woman anyone designs clothes for; and you can even find her in the street -- but she's not the majority, she's not the norm. What she is, evidently, is what almost everyone wants either to be, to look like, or to go home with.
But it may be that what these photographers were confirming was not so much a desire for this creature as the knowledge that she sells and the expectation that magazines and their readers want to see her. The ubiquitous media images that shape our cultural assumptions leave no one untouched; they shape the assumptions of the image makers as well.
The general level of high competence and low daring probably reflects the fact that commercial photographers aren't used to so much liberty. Portrait photographers rarely get to pick their own subjects; advertising photographers often have to imitate an art director's drawing; fashion photographers generally have to listen to the magazine's stylist; editorial photographers are advised by editors about what is important to shoot. This assignment suddenly gave everyone absolute freedom, and as Jean-Jacques Rousseau recognized, "Liberty is a food easy to eat but hard to digest."
The idea deserves a cheer, even if the product is only intermittently imaginative. Photographers should only be lucky enough to have such freedom and so many pages without text more often; it might make them braver. The "How She Looks" portfolio is no more than a straw in the wind, but the wind is blowing in this general direction. Although almost no publication has gone this far, magazines and newspapers (including this newspaper) have begun to print more and bigger photographs than they were printing only a few years ago.
It was television that originally cut into magazine readership and contributed to the death of the big picture magazines, and it is television that accounts for the cautious increase in photographic coverage in the press; the public's expectations of visual information and rewards just keep growing, and the only way to satisfy video addicts may be to offer them the quick fix of a photograph on the page. Where this will leave the printed word, already squeezed between TV and dwindling magazine space, is anybody's guess.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 1991, Sunday

 CORRECTION:

HEADLINE: Questions Linger as California Spill Sits

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKEHEAD, Calif., July 19

 BODY:
As a stinking, bubbling glob of spilled pesticide sinks slowly into California's largest reservoir, people who live along the wooded shoreline want to know why so little seems to be understood about it, nearly a week after it spilled from a derailed train.
The unanswered questions are urgent not just in this stunningly scenic woodland, in the shadow of Mount Shasta near the California border, but all over California. 
 Will the chemicals in Shasta Lake disperse or remain condensed? How quickly will they reach Shasta Dam, at the southern end of the lake 11 miles away? In a state already parched by drought, will the chemicals endanger the drinking water that flows from the dam into the state's water supply? And how will they affect the health of an area that depends on its pristine environment for pure water and for the fish, deer and hiking trails that draw tens of thousands of tourists a year?
For now, it is clear that the pesticide has been deadly to everything it has touched. Jim Pedri, supervising engineer for the California Regional Water Quality Control Board's Central Valley office, called it "the worst chemical-environmental disaster inland in California history."
 
Finding Dead Fish

Now that the spill has entered the reservoir, officials said today they were taking more aggressive action, pumping out some areas of heavy concentrations of the pesticide and pumping in air elsewhere to disperse the spill and speed its decomposition.
On Friday, testers in motorboats, wearing gas masks and rubber gloves, scooped some of the tens of thousands of dead fish from the water's surface. But officials said they were still conducting analyses to determine how the chemical would affect wildlife and whether drinking water would be contaminated. They do not know how long the chemicals take to decompose or what their long-term health risks are.
"I think it's kind of tight that they couldn't figure out right at the beginning what was going on," said Sean Harrington, a waiter in one of the resorts around the Shasta Lake reservoir, 175 miles northeast of San Francisco. "It's weird. This is the 20th century, isn't it?"
The spill occurred Sunday, when seven cars of a 97-car freight train of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company slipped off the track in a steep canyon. A tanker car tumbled into the Sacramento River 45 miles north of the lake and ruptured, spilling up to 19,500 gallons of the pesticide metam sodium.
The chemical is marketed under the name Vapam. It is used to rid soil of weeds, nematodes and insects before planting several crops, including fruits, vegetables and cotton.
 
Chemicals in Suspension
 The chemical blob, now about half a mile long and 200 yards wide, entered the northern branch of the reservoir on Wednesday, and is now suspended in 40 feet of water.
In the lake, which supplies drinking water throughout California, the effects of the drought are all too plain. The water level has sunk to 547 billion gallons, about 55 percent of its capacity, leaving a vast, stark strip of naked red earth and rock around its rim. Officials said the lower water level only made the spill's effect worse.
Attorney General Dan Lungren said Friday that he would file a lawsuit over the spill, and his spokesman said the railroad company was likely to be one defendant. A spokesman for the railroad said the cause of the accident had not been determined but said that it might have been less likely if the train had had an extra locomotive at the rear.
A second locomotive can help prevent the slack that can lead to a derailment. This week the company added these extra locomotives to similar trains on the route.
 
Criticism of Federal Officials

Other criticisms have focused on the fact that the pesticide was not listed as a regulated substance by the Federal Department of Transportation and that, therefore, precautions were not taken. Regulated substances are carried in double-hulled tanker cars and information on the handling of the substances is furnished to train crews.
At a news conference in San Francisco on Friday, William K. Reilly, Administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, said the spill should occasion a review of the nation's pesticide regulations, which he called "totally anachronistic."
Some of the residents of the tiny town of Dunsmuir, where the spill occurred, were evacuated, and about 200 people were treated in local hospitals for symptoms that included nausea, headaches, eye irritations, rashes and respiratory complaints.
Then, to the growing agitation of residents, officials watched, tested and issued warnings, but took no action to combat the spill as it swirled downstream, giving off the stink of rotten eggs and killing all aquatic life in its path: dragonflies, mayflies, mosquitoes and fish, including at least 100,000 rare, aggressive rainbow trout.
 
Sight of Dying Fish

As the spill flowed downriver, hundreds of fish could be seen churning the smooth surface ahead of it, leaping into the air, flapping and dying.
Charlie Jakobs, a fire captain with the California Department of Forestry, said it was understandable that residents were frightened and angry when officials were unable to give them quick answers or to take quick action. "The scientists just don't know what this much volume of this chemical in this much water will do," he said.
Peter Bontadelli, director of the State Department of Fish and Game, said: "How could we possibly know how it would react? We thought it would sink, but it's suspended now. It's a land-based chemical, not water-based. That's the problem. With all this knowledge we have, there are still gaps in what we know."
 
Years Until Recovery
 As the week drew to an end, the moss along the banks of the Sacramento River began to turn brown and the Indian rhubarb plants to curl up and wilt. Biologists said the possibility that willows, oaks and alders along the riverbank might also die could greatly extend the current 10-year estimate for the river's return to full vigor.
So far, scientists have found no confirmation that the otters, deer, beaver, raccoons or bears, or the birds including bald eagles, that feed along the river have been affected.
Now that the spill has passed, the river is running clear, clean and empty of life. Residents have returned to their homes and officials have stopped advising travelers to roll up their windows as they pass by on Interstate 5.
But signs are still posted warning: "No swimming. No drinking. Don't touch the water!" And the summer tourists on whom much of the economy depends are staying away.
At Dunsmuir, Jan Garrigus, owner of the Splash of Color clothing store, said, "As far as business goes, there really is none."
But the summer activities of boating, fishing, water skiing and houseboat rentals continued around most of the 365-mile perimeter of Shasta Lake.

HEADLINE: States Seeking Aid on Budgets From Pensions

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Growing numbers of state and local governments are drawing money from or slashing contributions to their pension funds, raising concerns about the funds' ability to pay retirees decades from now.
To many government officials, reducing pension contributions or finding a way to recapture any pensions surpluses are simply prudent financial steps. The money is needed, they note, to avert the types of steep reductions in services or layoffs that many local governments are ordering. And in some cases the employee unions support the changes rather than accept layoffs.
 
Fast-Growing Technique
 In the past, governments facing financial difficulties have occasionally sought help from their pension funds, as New York City did in the 1970's. In the last several years, cuts in Federal assistance, the faltering economy and the political difficulty of raising taxes have led more states and cities to look at pension money as a means of addressing budget problems. At least 18 states, including New York and California, have delayed or reduced payments to their pension plans in the last two years, or are considering doing so. 
 "It's becoming an all-too-frequent practice, maybe even a common practice, for cities and states to find one means or another, creative or crude, to tap into the pension funds," said James M. Hacking, the executive director of the Minneapolis Employees Retirement Fund.
So far, there has not been any effect on the benefits received by current retirees. But the trend is being watched warily by many of the nation's 14.7 million state and local government employees who are worried about the effect on the long-term safety of their pensions.
They are concerned about steps like these: Legislators in California approved a plan this month to withdraw $1.6 billion from two funds controlled by the state's public-employee pension system, as part of their package to close a $14.3 billion budget shortfall. California's move was a relatively rare instance of a state actually taking money from a fund.
"Instead of tax increases, states have had to look at every other possible source of revenue," said Brian Roherty, the executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers. "In some states there's a lot of money in public employee pension funds, and some states see that money as a way to get through hard times."
More commonly, state and local governments have tried to reduce their annual contributions to pension funds by stretching out payments or changing the accounting methods and assumptions they use to calculate the funds' long-term financial obligations. In Connecticut, for example, government employees recently agreed to allow the state to stretch out required pension contributions into future years, saving the state $190 million this year. In Texas, legislators are considering proposals to slash contributions to pension funds over the next two years.
New York State reduced its pension-fund contributions by $289 million in the last year, changing some of the accounting rules used to determine the funds' financial condition.
Some big cities are employing the same techniques. New York City, whose employee pension funds helped bail the city out of its last fiscal crisis, recently completed a budget-balancing package that calls for delaying pension contributions.
 
Trillion-Dollar Lure
 Public-employee pension funds, which nationwide have nearly $1 trillion in assets, hold an obvious lure for financially strapped governments. Many of the funds' investments did very well in the bull markets of the 1980's. By some accounting standards, many funds have enough money to meet all their payments to retirees for decades to come with plenty to spare, even if the state and local governments reduce their contributions.
But many retirees, government employees and fund officials say the steps amount to a raid on the funds. They claim that in some cases the accounting techniques that permit governments to reduce their contributions could endanger the ability of the pension systems to meet their obligations.
"If you're a baby boomer, this process currently going on suggests there will not be the money to cover the benefits you're being promised for when you retire," said Sarah Teslik, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a research and lobbying group financed by public pension plans. "It's virtually certain based just on what's happened so far that there will be a shortfall."
Concerned about the future, the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest government-employee union in New York, is suing to reverse the state's decision to change to an accounting method that allows to slash its required level of contributions.
"The Governor and the Legislature raided the pension fund as if it were their own private reserve to handle the problems of the state, which it is not," said Joseph E. McDermott, the union's president.
The accounting changes enacted in New York save money for the state in the short run by decreasing the level of contributions for employees early in their careers, but it may require a higher contribution rate down the road as more employees move closer to retirement. Claudia Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state budget office, said the Cuomo administration believes the changes are financially sound and do not endanger pension benefits.
Yet even experts in the field of pension accounting said it was difficult to assess whether the soundness of pension systems is being endangered. Indeed, the issue of financial prudence comes down to a debate over how best to apply complex and arcane accounting techniques to determine how much money a pension fund needs to meet its obligations in the decades ahead.
Skimping on pension-fund contributions to help balance a budget today, critics say, will simply postpone the day of reckoning. In this scenario, mounting shortfalls in pension-fund assets will eventually have to be made up by the taxpayers, as the population ages and the number of retirees increases. If taxpayers balk at making up the shortfall retirees could face big reductions in their pension payments and other benefits.
In Vermont, the legislature has provided the teachers' retirement fund $18 million less than it requested over the last two years, said Ron Boucher, the state's deputy treasurer. "It means that in the immediate future, starting next year, the contribution has to be higher than it would be," Mr. Boucher said. "And you're creating a funding mismatch that will widen 30 or 40 years down the road."
Altering the accounting assumptions used to determine the annual contributions can yield huge reductions. In Texas the legislature is considering reducing contributions to the teachers' retirement fund to 6 percent of total salaries paid from a previously agreed level of 7.6 percent. Over the next two years, the change would reduce contributions to the fund by $422 million. The teachers' fund is fighting the proposal, saying it needs a contribution rate of 7.31 percent to insure that it remains financially secure.
 
Tinkering With Assumptions
 The most common technique of tinkering with the assumptions is to increase the estimated returns from the fund's investment portfolio. Increased appreciation and income growth in the stocks, bonds and real estate investments held by the funds means the governments can reduce by millions of dollars a year the amount they must pay to keep the pension systems financed.
Government officials say the investment return projections used by many pension systems are far too conservative and do not match the double-digit returns most of them have earned in recent years. But pension officials said that in many cases pension systems are being pressured to meet return rates that may not be realistic in the long run.
New Hampshire, for example, has increased its investment return assumption to 9.75 percent a year from 8 percent. In California, the California Public Employees Retirement System fought off an attempt this month by Gov. Pete Wilson to raise the rate to 9.5 percent from 8.5 percent. But in a compromise, the 8.5 percent figure will be examined by outside accountants.
Raising investment-return assumptions "seems to be the trend of the future," said Will Keating, the executive director of the Nevada Public Employees Retirement System. He said fund managers around the country were worried that governments would impose increases in the assumed rate not for valid financial reasons but simply to save money.
"It's the way to make the biggest impact on the required contribution," said Mr. Keating, who is also chairman of the Public Pension Coordinating Council, a national association of pension funds.
Financially pressed governments are prevailing on their funds for other types of help, as well. In Minnesota, Gov. Arne Carlson proposed recently that the state pension funds invest $200 million in Northwest Airlines as part of a package to persuade the airline to build maintenance bases in the state and create 2,000 jobs there. Some state-employee groups objected on the grounds that Northwest might not be a good investment, and it is unclear whether the deal will be made.
In Philadelphia, the city government was so strapped for cash earlier this year that it borrowed $150 million from its pension funds for several months.

The Robots That Go Where Humans Fear to Tread

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: HILLSBOROUGH, N.J.

 BODY:
These workers do not mind toiling for hours in 130-degree heat and high humidity, or even working under water. They stroll through deserted machine rooms looking for leaks and breakdowns. They do not notice most radioactivity unless they are told to, in which case they do it better than a human.
 They do get tired climbing stairs. 
The workers are robots in nuclear reactors, with names that are supposed to sound human, like Seymour, Cecil, Rosa or Rover, although their human creators have sometimes tortured a few acronyms to make them sound friendly.
 Robots have not found the market once predicted for them in factories and other business settings, but they are gaining ground in nuclear reactors, where they increasingly show an ability to work in places where humans cannot go for long, or cannot go at all when the reactor is running. In some cases, they go places that humans cannot go under any circumstances.
 Public Service Electric and Gas, for example, is crowing over Cecil, which is being used at the New Jersey utility's Salem 1 reactor unit here. The robot is adept at crawling into one of the most vulnerable parts of a nuclear plant, the steam generator, and doing work that cannot be accomplished any other way.
 Cecil is not the most impressive looking robot; it is of a size and shape to suggest it wandered off a model railroad set. But Cecil illustrates how robots in nuclear plants have the potential for reducing human exposure to radiation, shortening the time that reactors must be shut for maintenance and reducing the potential for accidents.
Utilities are already using robots for 192 different applications, according to Harry Roman, the principal engineer for research at Public Service Electric and Gas, who heads the lab here and is also the president of the Utility/Manufacturers Robot Users Group. The number of tasks will grow, said another expert, James F. Lang, acting director of the nuclear engineering and operation department at the Electric Power Research Institute, a consortium in Palo Alto, Calif. "They are very useful to free up humans going places that are hard for humans to get to, or diving into pools where radiation levels are high," said Mr. Lang, who added that the next generation of nuclear plants will be designed in part around robots.
 Cecil, built by Foster-Miller Inc., of Waltham, Mass., with support from the Electric Power Research Institute and the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, has also been purchased by reactor operators in France and Japan, two countries generally regarded as leaders in nuclear reactor technology. It has also been purchased by the United States Navy for use in submarine propulsion plants. The robots cost more than $1 million each. Foster-Miller said that so far it has sold "more than five" and has interest from other utlities. Last year the company had revenues of $30 million.
 Others, like the Westinghouse Corporation's Rosa, and Jethro and Seymour, being developed by other groups, are beginning to make inroads, too. But growth in the use of robots in nuclear plants is limited by a problem that hamstrings much of the industry: the 111 operating plants embody almost 111 different designs, so standardizing robots to do the same task from reactor to reactor is difficult. In addition, many plants were designed with insufficient thought given to maintenance, so reaching or inspecting critical components can be difficult.
 Robot designers hope for a new generation of plants that will be standardized, with tight corners eliminated and ramps installed instead of stairs. Ramps are critical because robots can weigh several hundred pounds and have trouble hauling themselves up stairs or up even a single step. Generally, robots prefer elevators.
 "One of the things you like in power plants is to minimize your manned access," said Richard Slember, a power plant expert and executive vice president of Asea Brown Boveri in Stamford, Conn. "Making a plant robot-friendly will minimize manned access."
 Cecil began life several years ago at the Consolidated Edison Company's Indian Point 2 reactor in Buchanan, N.Y. The reactor works like most of the reactors in this country: Nuclear fission heats water in the reactor vessel, and the water is kept under pressure to prevent boiling. With repeated passes through the reactor, the water becomes radioactive and must be kept inside the plant.
 The hot, pressurized and radioactive water is passed through a steam generator, which has thousands of thin-walled pipes inside. Cold, clean water on the outside of the pipes is boiled into steam by the reactor heat.
 But at Indian Point 2, as elsewhere, the cold water leaves a corrosive sludge. Humans can clean out the sludge in the first seven or eight rows of tubes in the generator, but no further. Cecil, equipped with a video camera, lights and high-pressure water jet, crawled in another 20 rows and discovered that most of the sludge was deep inside the generator -- but could be cleaned out.
 Public Service, which has emerged as a leader in nuclear plant robotics, improved Cecil so that it could carry miniature tools. At Salem 1, near the southern tip of New Jersey, a Cecil robot crawled more than three feet into the steam generator and retrieved a washer, a welding rod nub and a welding rod, all apparently construction debris.
 The task was not a trivial one. At other plants, foreign objects have rattled around in steam generators until they smashed into tubes and broke them, resulting in the loss of thousands of gallons of radioactive water. Tube ruptures always involve some release of radiation to the environment, and engineers worry that the ruptures could set off a bigger accident.
 Such robotics feats may contribute to stricter safety regulations, said Mr. Roman. If inspection by robot is now possible, he said, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission may decide to require it. Federal regulations like that would be a sales boon to robot makers like Foster-Miller.
 Cecil is only one of several robots. In Mr. Roman's laboratory, another robot, thus far lacking an acronym, crawls on magnetic wheels through pipes, sending back color video pictures as it prowls about looking for signs of wall thinning.
 In any plants, pipes that look normal from the outside may actually be growing thin on the inside and about to burst, an accident which has occasionally killed workers. It is hoped the magnetic-wheeled robot might be able to detect the problem.
 The robot, less than five inches high and wide, comes with 100 feet of control tether, and, like Cecil, a computer on the end that controls the robot's movements. Engineers here are working on modifications to let the robot climb steeper grades.
 Another robot, Westinghouse's Rosa, short for Remotely Operated Service Arm, can also work in steam generators, but on the side where the radioactive water flows. It can test tubes through which the water flows and plug defective ones. Rosa and Cecil never meet, however; they are separated by a thick steel plate that holds up the tubes.
 So far, robots are limited in their ability to make decisions, but their designers are studying how to give them rudimentary intelligence. Mr. Roman is developing a robot named Jethro, whose crawler tractor treads can negotiate stairs. Jethro measures radiation and humidity, collects air samples, swipes at surfaces to measure contamination and sends back audio and video signals.
 The next step, said Mr. Roman, is to program its on-board computer to sort through the sounds it hears, identify those that are abnormal and alert the operator.
 Sea-Mor -- Seymour -- can work alone but is more useful as an underwater helper. With video camera, light, claw-like hand and propellers to push it forward, back, up and down, Sea-Mor helped a human diver at the Hope Creek reactor adjacent to Salem 1 here.
 One underwater robot helped end a service shutdown at Salem 1 a day early, according to Mr. Roman, saving $500,000 in electric power. So far, Public Service calculates it has saved $3 million with robots, on expenses of $1.5 million.

HEADLINE: Dell Aims for the Big Leagues

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Humbled leaders of big personal computer companies like I.B.M., Apple and and Compaq Computer have slashed prices, trimmed payrolls and even linked arms this year in various deals to share technology and revive an industry beset by a lag in new technology, financially ailing dealerships and a recession. But not Michael Dell.
 The 26-year-old Mr. Dell is winning corporate customers, expanding his staff and grabbing market share by playing marketing hardball, stressing service and churning out reliable, innovative and lower-cost desktop models -- all I.B.M. compatible -- that fill market voids. 
Formed here in 1984 as a pesky mail-order company known as PC Limited, the Dell Computer Corporation's winning formula, analysts perdict, could help nearly double its sales, to $1 billion next year from $546 million in 1990, even if demand for personal computers remains sluggish. Its revenues rose by 45 percent, to $175 million, in the first quarter, even though industry sales in the United States were flat.
 But success has spawned competition. Now, with a host of me-too marketers often undercutting its prices and bigger rivals pricing their products more aggressively, Dell is having to rethink its position. To distance itself from these new clone-makers and compete more directly in the big leagues, Dell has been cutting prices more cautiously and plowing more money into research.
 A rash of new products has resulted. Dell introduced a staggering total of 18 new models in the last 12 months, configured specifically to take business away from the Compaq Computer Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation. "That is the essence of our strategy," said Mr. Dell, whose 35 percent stake in Dell is now worth almost $230 million.
 The models include a notebook-size computer with a battery lasting three-and-a-half hours -- 30 minutes longer than the Compaq model. Another is the fastest version of the most powerful I.B.M.-compatible model, using the 50 megaherz chip in Intel's 486 series of microprocessors, which entered the market last month. Dell also mounted a broad attack this year against one of Compaq's best sellers, the Deskpro 386/25e. Four new machines, all built around the i386SX microprocessor but varying in speed and size, range in price from $2,900 to $3,900, compared with the Deskpro's $4,500 list price.
 "The battle in the PC business this year and in '92 will be to replace your product as quickly as you can at every price point," said Daniel C. Benton, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "Dell has filled virtually every single niche in the $2,000 to $4,000 price range. That is the sweet spot in the market."
 Indeed, when the Southern California Edison Company gave department managers the option of buying either Dell or I.B.M. models this year, Dell prevailed by a margin of three to one, receiving orders for about 300 machines. "Especially in times like now, when dollars are scarce," Dell has the edge, said Nick Condap, the utility's manager of personal computer products.
 In most cases, Dell's prices remain 10 percent or more lower than I.B.M's and Compaq's. Its distribution methods have also proved more efficient than the independent dealerships that sell large volumes of I.B.M. and Compaq machines. Corporate managers say dealers like Businessland have lost customers because, as machines have become like commodities, buyers rely less on others to assess different brands.
 Perhaps most critical, service quality can range from good to abysmal even within the same dealer network. That is why Ebasco Services, a consulting and engineering firm in New York, switched mainly to Dell products. "We're a mobile company, operating from project to project and trailer to trailer on short-term jobs," said Hal Manoogian, Ebasco's head of corporate purchasing. "We began to find out that some dealers were not surviving. We can't ship equipment all over the country just to get it fixed."
 Dell long ago broadened its sales effort beyond mail-order advertisements, adding representatives to call directly on big companies, which, along with government and education buyers contributed nearly half of Dell's sales last year. And last fall, for the first time, the company, in an effort to reach out to small business and individual buyers, shipped machines to one of several fast-growing discount computer retailers, the Soft Warehouse, now called CompUSA.
 Dell benefits from its direct links with customers that companies that sell mostly through dealerships do not enjoy. Owners of Dell products can call a toll-free telephone service for problem-solving. Records of thousands of customer calls are analyzed each month, in an effort to spot consumer trends. Mr. Dell maintained that the exercise gives his product designers better and faster information than I.B.M. or Compaq get from their dealers about what features will help new machines sell faster.
 Dell executives acknowledge that frequent callers drive up costs. But they say improvements in handling common questions and complaints have reduced the average call to six minutes, from 12, in the last three years and have kept the cost of the program flat.
"It's a very inexpensive way of providing service," said Eugene G. Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter, in New York.
 The combination of toll-free customer service and, when necessary, the promise of repairs within 24 hours are big reasons why Dell has often outranked its rivals in customer surveys, including one earlier this year by J.D. Power and Associates. Rivals, stung, point to other surveys. Compaq announced this month that a customer survey by Datamation magazine placed it atop a list of companies selling fast and powerful machines with the i486 chip. And Hewlett-Packard said last week that it outranked Compaq, Dell and I.B.M. in a Datamation survey of corporate buyers of i386 machines.
 In 1990, Dell held 1.2 percent of the country's mammoth I.B.M.-compatiable personal computer market, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm in Framingham, Mass. Although its share is still growing, competitors are crowding Dell. Newcomers to the mail-order business include Northgate, of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Gateway 2000, of North Sioux City, S.D., each of which had sales of more than $200 million in 1990. Zeos International, of St. Paul, Minn., had revenues of $100 million last year.
 Another Austin-based clone-maker, the Compuadd Computer Corporation, has been selling similar models at prices 5 percent to 15 percent below Dell's. Compuadd, a privately held company owned by Bill Hayden, a former engineer at Texas Instruments, has a growing network of nearly 100 discount stores and generated $515 million in sales last year, not far behind Dell.
 Noting that Dell finished 1990 with 2,100 employees, compared with 1,500 at Compuadd, Edward D. Thomas, Compuadd's president, suggested that Dell could become vulnerable if its expenses and profit margins get too fat. "Our expenses are lower," he said.
 Some analysts say smaller rivals have already put chinks in Dell's armor. "They are turning out quality products and selling them at much lower prices because they don't have the R.&D. staff that Dell has," said Seymour Merrin, head of Merrin Information Services, a marketing research firm in Menlo Park, Calif.
 Yet the mail-order rivals may fade into oblivion if they continue to spend little money for research on products to follow the mainstream i386SX machines. Mr. Benton of Goldman, Sachs said Dell wisely increased its gross profit margins to 33.3 percent last year, from 29.2 in 1989, by not cutting prices too far below Compaq and I.B.M.
 That gives Dell more money for new products and for a marketing campaign to offset fierce efforts at I.B.M. and Compaq. Compaq turned to the courts last March to try to halt brash advertisements by Dell that it claimed inaccurately compared list prices for some popular models. Dell was forced to make changes in advertisements running in Britain, but so far has not had to alter its American campaign. Compaq took another swipe in April, cutting list prices on some of its models by as much as 34 percent.
 And in June, I.B.M. introduced three lower-priced models based on the Intel Corporation's standard i386 chip. The new models, priced between $2,000 and $2,925, are aimed straight at Dell's territory.
 "These are absolute screamers in terms of price and performance," said Leslie Fiering, a personal computer analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. She said the new models would tempt some former I.B.M. customers who defected to Dell and other lower-priced models "to come back to the I.B.M. fold."
 For his part, Mr. Dell said Compaq's attacks backfired by focusing more attention on Dell's lower prices. "They had the biggest marketing mystique you could imagine," he said. "Now they've thrown that away and convinced customers who bought from them that they paid too much." And I.B.M.'s counterpunch with the i386 machines has not slowed Dell's advance, he said.
 Then there are the new alliances. Compaq, Digital Equipment and more than 20 other computer companies are trying to create standards for powerful work stations that some executives and analysts anticipate will replace I.B.M.-compatible personal computers. Separately, Apple and I.B.M. have agreed to share technology to bolster their positions in the splintering PC market. Apple will share software technology that I.B.M. needs to ease its reliance on the Microsoft Corporation and in turn obtain rights to the RS/6000 microprocessor that I.B.M. has developed for powerful computers.
 Mr. Dell is ignoring the alliances, betting that customers will prefer, and that Dell can design, machines built around advanced versions of the Intel computer chips that have been at the heart of each new generation of I.B.M.-compatible models. Software companies have written thousands of programs that customers use on machines run by Intel 386 and 486 micrprocessors, he said, and that they will want to put more effort into new programs for machines built around the 586 chip Intel is now developing.
 "People have been talking about this clashing of the PC's and work stations for a number of years, but not very much has happened," Mr. Dell said. "If there are standards for the work station business, then we believe we have the capability to develop products around those standards as well as anybody."
 
DELL'S SOURCE: MR. RESEARCH
 The tenure of G. Glenn Henry as head of research at the Dell Computer Corporation got off to a rocky start when he and Michael Dell concluded early last year that they had to scrap a series of innovations.
 Once a star scientist and manager in I.B.M.'s personal computer unit, with the rare status of I.B.M. Fellow, the highest ranking for scientists, Mr. Henry moved to Dell in 1988. He said he had become frustrated with I.B.M.'s strategy, especially its reliance on dealers. "I looked around and found that Dell actually had the formula for success," said Mr. Henry.
 He quickly expanded its research staff and then designed a new product line using a faster method for handling computing tasks, called multiprocessing, and a faster chip using fewer codes. New alliances among industry leaders have developed their own versions of this reduced instruction set computing technology, called RISC, and put it at the heart of their efforts.
 But corporate customers who saw early versions of Mr. Henry's creation were unimpressed, mainly because the technology could not run many existing software programs. The decision not to ship models with the multiprocessing gear after having spent millions of dollars on the development left Dell with few new products and a sagging stock price.
 Mr. Henry's group recovered quickly -- with a flurry of 18 new machines that have been introduced since September. "They've succeeded in spotting important technologies that others like I.B.M. and Compaq have used or are about to use," said Jim Seymour, an industry consultant in Austin. "I don't think of them as great innovators, but as great synthesizers."
 Dell has already exploited some discoveries from Mr. Henry's aborted first venture. New models, for instance, can be converted into faster, more powerful machines as faster chips become available. That's because the new machines are equipped with plug-in cards, now holding either i386SX or i486 chips. The engineering problems were mastered in Mr. Henry's multiprocessor project.

HEADLINE: Village Captured in Photos, 60 Years Apart

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: HASTNGS-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
IN the 1920's, a retired chemist who had recently moved to this Hudson River community from Brooklyn explored his new surroundings with camera in tow and a scientist's perspective, diligently photographing village scenes and meticulously documenting the images for future generations.
But Dr. Arthur C. Langmuir, photographing nearly 1,100 local scenes over two decades, also had another mission. The photographer, historians say, was a man ahead of his time, an environmentalist before it was fashionable to be one. 
 Working just before and during the Depression, Dr. Langmuir was dismayed by the condition of some of the sites he was viewing through his camera lens. A newspaper clipping from the period reads: "Clean-Up Championed by Langmuir, Cites Need for Spic-and-Span Village."
 
Open Spaces Are Gone
 Today, more than 60 years after the majority of Dr. Langmuir's photographs were made, the local historical society, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary, has started to rephotograph 500 of the images to see just how much the village has changed.
"Some things are so different you wouldn't recognize the site, while others really haven't changed that much at all," said Mary L. Allison, trustee and photo archivist for the Hastings-on-Hudson Historical Society.
"Where there were big open spaces, it is now developed," Ms. Allison said, citing the most noticeable change in the landscape during the years since Dr. Langmuir photographed. "And in some places, the foliage has grown so that the view has been obscured." In contrast, one community field, she said, looks much the same today, except for the addition of tennis courts and a children's playground.
As for championing a "spic-and-span quality" for Hastings-on-Hudson, Dr. Langmuir's goal had been achieved, Ms. Allison said. The photographer recorded scenes of rusty cars, bedsprings and other castoffs on public roads, not just in the poorer sections of town, but also on the streets of well-to-do neighborhoods.
 
Debris Taken for Granted
 Through his photojournalism, Ms. Allison said, Dr. Langmuir helped residents become aware of the condition of their surroundings and urged them to improve it. He also hired unemployed people to haul away the garbage littering the streets.
"People are more conscious of the environment today," Ms. Allison said. "They wouldn't stand for all that clutter and debris that everyone took for granted then."
Under the Margaret Kennedy Photography Project, named for a historical society trustee who died in 1990, 10 local photographers, amateurs and professionals, have been given copies of some of Dr. Langmuir's images and assigned to rephotograph the sites under similar weather and lighting conditions.
"You almost go through a time warp doing this, since you know he was standing right there," said Mary Fennell, a magazine photojournalist and teacher who has been shooting scenes in the village's small business district and in some residential areas.
Ms. Fennell said it was "like solving a mystery," working with the old photos and trying to find the same scenes, despite the changes. She said, for example, that she looked for angles of an old building that might have undergone renovation or had trees grow up around it, to be sure that it was the same location. Trying to replicate the photos, she said she always worked at the same time of day and under similar light conditions, occasionally going out in a snowstorm to achieve the desired effect.
Robert Nelson, an amateur photographer who owns an advertising and marketing company, said rephotographing residential sites emphasized the transitory quality of life.
"In some cases, the houses had not changed that much," Mr. Nelson said. "Only the occupants had. You know that if someone was in that house 60 years ago raising a family, a new family is there today. It gave me a different kind of perspective on the changes that had taken place."
Many of Dr. Langmuir's negatives were given to the historical society by his daughter, Ruth Van de Water. More negatives were found in the attic of the photographer's home on South Broadway when it was sold to its current occupants.
All the photographs and negatives were accompanied by detailed notes, citing the date and place that the picture was taken, the film used and the f-stop set on Dr. Langmuir's camera.
In 1979, with a $725 Corporate Community Jobs Project grant from the county, the society hired a high school student to begin cataloguing the photographs, which Ms. Allison refers to as "the jewel of our collection." The photographs were divided into categories like "scenic and historical," "neighborhoods," "schools," "clean-up project" and "business district."
The catalogued photos remained in the archives of the historical society, which is in a 19th-century tenant farmer's cottage on Washington Avenue, until last year, when trustees of the 1,200-member organization decided to embark upon the current project.
"We had been thinking of this project for some time," Ms. Allison said. "We decided the time had come to do for future generations what Dr. Langmuir did for us. In that sense, this is more than a then-and-now project. We want to leave a record for those that come after us, the way he did."
The society is paying the photographers a small fee for each negative it uses. In return, all future rights to the pictures are given to the society.
The Margaret Kennedy Photography Project, which is being financed through private donations, will culminate with a public exhibition next year.

DIVORCE
An American Tradition.
By Glenda Riley.
Illustrated. 262 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $24.95.  
 Moving along from such issues as school prayer and abortion, this country's "pro-family" forces are gearing up to restrict the right to divorce. And why not? Divorce is the veritable plutonium of domestic fission, leaving a trail of heartbreak, confusion and the poverty of single-mother households. But the one thing opponents of divorce will not be able to claim is that it contradicts this country's traditional values. As the subtitle of Glenda Riley's thoroughgoing and thoroughly intelligent study announces, divorce is an American tradition, going back more than 300 years.
The Puritans, for example, who are sometimes imagined to be the direct progenitors of Phyllis Schlafly and Pat Robertson, granted divorces on such grounds as female adultery, male cruelty, bigamy, desertion, failure to provide and even impotence. The first colonial divorce, Ms. Riley writes, was awarded in 1639 to a Mrs. James Luxford, on the ground of bigamy, and resulted in her husband's being fined and "set in the stocks an hour upon the market day."
The Declaration of Independence, which may be the most momentous divorce document in history, gave added legitimacy to what was already a venerable institution. In fact, Ms. Riley tells us that Thomas Jefferson appears to have honed his famous linkage of independence and personal happiness while working as a lawyer on a divorce case in the early 1770's. In the wake of the Revolution, divorce seekers began to frame their arguments in terms of "tyranny," "misrule," "injustice" and the newly claimed right to the "pursuit of happiness."
And divorce they did, in numbers that astonished European visitors, says Ms. Riley, who teaches American history at Ball State University. Women, who over the years have been twice as likely to initiate divorce proceedings, discarded husbands on grounds of drunkenness, desertion, gambling, infidelity and, increasingly, the vague charge of "cruelty."
But men were not always the parties at fault. In the 19th century, errant wives risked the loss of their children, yet they too abandoned marriages in search of freedom or true love. Ms. Ri ley cites several cases of white Southern women who were divorced for producing half-black babies and who "publicly acknowledged" that their lovers were "negro slave[s]." In another case of remarkable female daring cited in "Divorce: An American Tradition," Mrs. May Walker disappeared in the company of 17-year-old Mabel Wade, a "very good looking girl."
If divorce always seems to be a modern evil, it is because the divorce rate has been rising inexorably, decade after decade, century after century. There have been especially steep increases after each war and occasional plateaus, associated chiefly with economic hard times. As Ms. Riley ably shows, restrictive laws have never successfully curbed the American impulse to break free from the bonds of marriage. Historically, disgruntled spouses have simply deserted, run off to less restrictive states or set up more congenial menages outside the law. Nineteenth-century South Carolina, for example, had to compensate for its lack of legal divorce by effectively recognizing adulterous liaisons.
Not surprisingly, the debate over divorce is almost as much of an American tradition as divorce itself. Even women, who have the most at stake in a strictly economic sense, have long been divided. Some 19th-century feminists opposed divorce as an escape hatch for feckless males; others saw it as a kind of Emancipation Proclamation for female "slaves" of all colors. The greatest reform effort, a drive at the beginning of this century to create a uniform national divorce law and thus abolish the notorious "divorce mills" of Western states like Nevada, foundered on American ambivalence. Family stability is a fine old value, but so is individual liberty.
All those tempted to join the new crusade against divorce should be required to read "Divorce: An American Tradition," cover to cover and pencil in hand. They may be forced to conclude, along with many of our ancestors, that divorce is indeed a great evil and source of much suffering. But then so is the institution that generates it -- marriage, especially marriage under conditions of gross inequality between the sexes. Perhaps the surest way to reduce the rate of divorce, as some reformers suggested almost two centuries ago, would be to restrict the grounds for marriage.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE;
Prince Charles Pursues a Green and Pleasant Land

BYLINE: By WENDY STEINER; Wendy Steiner, a professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, has been working in England on current issues in architecture and fiction.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
In a dim attic office in St. James's Palace, plans are afoot for the Prince of Wales's second annual Summer School in Civil Architecture, which will begin on Aug. 3. This program, Prince Charles's most recent attempt to erase what he sees as the blot of modernism on the British cityscape, has provoked a good deal of media attention and something akin to hysteria among architects.
 Supporters hope the school will reintroduce the beauty and civility lost since the introduction of modernist architecture. Opponents, mostly modernist architects, fear that the Prince's intervention has put a hex on their efforts to grab important building contracts in the United Kingdom. In an age of computers, professors of architecture disdain a return to the old-fashioned life drawing and crafts training that form the basis of the summer school curriculum. 
 The opening session of the school on the campus of Oxford University last summer was veiled in the kind of secrecy that other countries reserve for the development of strategic weapons. Lecturers were pledged not to speak to the press as a condition of employment; all but a few reporters were refused access to the site, and the only press release was an application-form blurb by Prince Charles extolling "civil architecture." This year, with a new director, Brian Hanson, who is also the Prince's "secretary in architecture," the tone is calmer. The aim is to consolidate last year's experiments into a program exploring the spiritual dimension of architecture, an idea the Prince's men formulate as "man the builder."
 At stake, as the Prince of Wales sees it, are the livability and traditional look of British cities, the degeneration of which during this second Elizabethan Age has become a cause of national alarm. Over the past six years, the Prince's speeches have delighted the public, and in the process have turned the British design profession on its head. Architecture is now discussed with the passion reserved in the United States for baseball. The problem, in the Prince's view, is that the public has lost faith in the profession. One of his chief architectural advisers, Leon Krier, puts it this way: "People want beauty around them, and everywhere they are denied it."
 The 25 young men and women in last year's session, who came from Britain, America and Europe, set out to instruct themselves in this popular idea of beauty. Two-thirds of them were architects; the rest were civil engineers, artists, craftsmen and builders. They spent five weeks at Magdalen College in Oxford and the British School in Rome, visiting sites and receiving lectures and studio instruction. They practiced the time-honored but by now unfashionable techniques of life drawing, and constructed an architectural order of columns from 19th-century pattern books. They watched as their capitals were cut into stone, and then drew the stone, switching back and forth between two- and three-dimensional conception, the essence of the architectural task.
 Working only from documents, they designed a row house to replace a modernist misfit in an Oxford street, then learned the necessity of modifying their designs after visiting the site and talking to the residents. They invented ornaments and thought hard about small-scale elements like walls and pavements and signs. The assignments were often challenges to bring about a major change by the cheapest and simplest means.
 This training is unlike any other available at the moment in Britain. As things stand, students enter architecture school from high school and take a three-year academic course leading to a degree. Then they spend one year in an office gaining practical experience, two years back in school, and one more year in an office. Their training does not include drawing, carving, bricklaying or other craft or workmanly skills. The Prince is convinced that a return to these techniques will bring about a renaissance in building.
 It may seem puzzling that a small summer program in Oxford and Rome should provoke such heat, but the school is seen as part of the larger British debate between modernism and classicism. Jules Lubbock, last year's principal, says that the school, whose planning the Prince supervised down to the design of the letterhead, is broadly traditional in orientation. It is not solely classicist, as opponents have charged, but exposes students to a variety of styles -- Islamic, Gothic, classical, even modernist. The point, he says, is to teach the best that the history of architecture has to offer.
 Paul Finch, editor of the London trade publication Building Design and an avid Prince watcher, claims that Charles is coming to the conclusion that his quarrel is not with modernism but with bad modernism. The Prince's enthusiasms have gone from community architecture to neo-classicism to, most recently, the kind of reconciliation of technology and nature practiced by Frank Lloyd Wright. He seems no longer to be championing one style over all the rest, but accepting the idea that the quality of thought behind architecture is what counts.
 Ron Heron, an official of the Architectural Association school, which has trained some of London's most diverse and influential architects, is sure the summer school will only institutionalize the worst aspects of the Prince's program.
 "It's not about architecture, but movie-set values, how it looks from the street," he says. "What is needed is invention and wit responding to the context of life as it is now."
 Despite the fears the school provokes in Britain, Brian Hanson reports growing interest among members of the Economic Community and Eastern Europeans in collaborating with it. Many Britishers within the profession have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Paul Finch wrote in a Building Design editorial last summer: "Whether teaching people the virtues of drawing the orders guarantees something different is far from clear. But there is a strong case for the Prince's school continuing, if only to add to the variety of educational approaches now being adopted. And it will keep us in stories for our next thousand issues." Perhaps. How often does one get to announce a stylistic revolution by royal decree?

LONE STAR RISING
Lyndon Johnson and His Times, 1908-1960.
By Robert Dallek.
Illustrated. 721 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $30.  
 During the last decade of Lyndon B. Johnson's long political career, the country changed in ways that took him completely by surprise. To cite just one aspect of the change, from the province of intellectual life: before the 1960's a prominent academic historian who undertook to write the biography of a major political leader would surely have felt himself to be within a secure, central, admired tradition in American culture. Johnson did not keep up with American culture, but if he had, he would have wholeheartedly approved of this state of affairs: the big men of the academy naturally gravitating, as they sought to understand how the country worked, toward the study of the big men of politics.
Today, as the aftereffects of the period when Johnson was President continue to play out across our society, Robert Dallek's rock-solid biography, "Lone Star Rising," has, like its subject, an unmistakable air of embattlement about it. To one side of Mr. Dallek, a professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles, is mainstream academia, which now considers a project like his to be intellectually uninteresting and beside the point: ideas and economic and social structures, not powerful leaders, determine the course of history. To the other side is Robert A. Caro, representing another aspect of the broad national shift that caught Lyndon Johnson unawares, the rise of the press to a position of power and self-confidence -- so much so that a journalist-author like Mr. Caro can now attempt a magisterial multivolume political biography of Johnson that concedes no ground to professional historians.
In his preface, Mr. Dallek complains that "there exists a hatred of Johnson that passes the bounds of common sense and contributes nothing to historical understanding"; he says we "now need a balanced biography." Obviously this is a slap at Mr. Caro, and it makes Mr. Dallek look as if he might be in danger of crossing the line from balanced into defensive. In a few places in the early going, he seems to be gritting his teeth as he gets through material Mr. Caro used to demonize Johnson -- such as Johnson's dirty campaign to take over student politics at his college, or the nervous breakdown to which he drove his early aide Gene Latimer. Mr. Dallek makes a point of counterbalancing this sort of material with blandly sunny on-the-other-hand statements. For example, in the college section, he writes that Johnson "was an exceptionally warm person who made friends easily and took a genuine interest in them."
On the whole, though, and especially after he gets past the part of Johnson's life that was covered in Mr. Caro's first volume, Mr. Dallek is absolutely not an apologist. It does him an injustice even to discuss his work in terms of whether it is positive, negative or balanced about Johnson (though Mr. Dallek is the one who put those terms into play), because his interest in his subject is so obviously that of a seeker after truth rather than someone out to attack or defend. He doesn't pull any obvious punches: Johnson, in these pages, is crude, egomaniacal and capable of being cruel to the people around him. Mr. Dallek shows him using his position in the Government to enrich himself through the acquisition of broadcasting licenses, and stealing the 1948 election that put him in the United States Senate. He was wiretapping opponents and receiving enormous illegal campaign contributions a quarter-century before Watergate. His racial attitudes were mixed up beyond any possibility of our untangling them cleanly now: Mr. Dallek quotes him defending the Supreme Court appointment of the very well-known Thurgood Marshall, rather than a black judge less identified with the civil rights cause, by saying to a staff member, "Son, when I appoint a nigger to the court, I want everyone to know he's a nigger."
There is a substantial difference in feel between Mr. Dallek's Johnson and Mr. Caro's, but it springs from the way in which the two authors handle their material, not from a great disparity in the basic information they have at their disposal. (One of Johnson's many paradoxes is that although he loved to keep secrets from people, a good deal of the dirt on him is publicly available in the Presidential library that he built as a monument to himself and staffed with loyal former aides; Mr. Dallek even quotes from documents that people sent L.B.J. with the request that he destroy them after reading, which now reside in the marble palace in Austin.) Without pushing the armchair psychologizing too hard, Mr. Dallek presents Johnson as what is known as a borderline personality -- a man who, as a result of childhood traumas (mainly, Mr. Dallek speculates, the conditional nature of his mother's overpowering love for him), had to spend his whole life struggling, without complete success, to keep himself within the bounds of functional society.
Johnson in pursuit of political office, Mr. Dallek points out, was a desperate man, helplessly in the grip of "some sense of unrelenting deprivation" and willing to do nearly anything to win the prize. But once he got it he usually performed magnificently, driving himself and the people around him to get the Government to do more than it ever had for people who needed help. Johnson made an epic achievement even out of that most routine of a politician's tasks, answering constituent mail: Mr. Dallek has him once dictating and signing 258 letters in a day. In Mr. Caro's books, Johnson's rise seemed foreordained, and the empathy of readers was directed toward the people unfortunate enough to get in his way. In "Lone Star Rising," the odds against Johnson feel extremely long, and you find yourself rooting for him.
In part because of the lack of scholarly interest in Johnson, his current historical balance sheet is oversimplified: there is one big item in the assets column, civil rights, and one overwhelming liability, the war in Vietnam. "Lone Star Rising" ends with Johnson's election to the Vice Presidency -- Mr. Dallek plans a second volume on the rest of L.B.J.'s life -- so it does not directly try to correct or explain the main impressions we have of his Presidency. But it does provide interesting hints as to why he could have got one issue so right and the other so wrong.
Johnson spent nearly his whole career feeling vulnerable on his right flank. He won his seat in Congress because, in 1937, central Texas was still deep in the Depression and he was able to demonstrate a connection to Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was a god there. In 1941 he lost (or, more accurately, had stolen from him) his first Senate race, to the reactionary, buffoonish Pappy O'Daniel. In 1948 his opponent was the reactionary, upstanding Coke Stevenson, whose supporters felt comfortable also backing Strom Thurmond's Dixiecrat Presidential campaign that year. When he became a statewide politician, Johnson acquired a much more conservative constituency than he had had as a Congressman, and one that made up for being less intensely segregationist than the rest of the South by being more intensely anti-Communist and antilabor. Only a month after the 1948 election, Johnson told Bobby Baker, the head Senate page, that "the New Deal spirit's gone from Texas."
Throughout his career he flourished as a doer -- in every job, he accomplished more than anyone ever had before -- and as a compromiser. His triumphant period as Senate majority leader, when he engineered the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy and the passage of the first civil rights law in decades (using persuasive techniques up to and including lobbying the air traffic controllers at Washington's National Airport to land planes in the order he preferred), came at a time when the Democrats had only a one-seat majority. Johnson openly allied himself with the Eisenhower Administration, and made himself the person liberals had to come to if they wanted to get anything done. When he found himself dealing with liberals who were more powerful and farther to the left, as he did after the 1958 and 1964 elections, it threw him off his feed; what was natural for him was placing himself a few notches to the left of the position of the right. On Vietnam, this meant pursuing strong but not annihilatory policies, and his instinctive expectation was that the liberals would thank him for having tamed the conservative beast again.
Perhaps the larger problem was that Johnson's experience did not prepare him well for an executive role. He was used to mediating among competing interests, not deciding what course the nation should follow. As dominating as Johnson was personally, he could be dominated by others intellectually. And he was especially vulnerable to this in the area of foreign policy. As early as 1940, one of Johnson's mentors, the Texas attorney Alvin Wirtz, was writing him, "I will admit you are a whiz on domestic problems but I still think that on international problems you should listen to the elder statesmen."
Johnson's domestic agenda as President was not something he had dreamed up: he was applying his awesome political skills to ideas that he had been hearing all of his adult life. On racial issues, he had been preoccupied for decades with the idea that segregation, besides being immoral, was keeping the South from economic prosperity and Southern politicians from holding national office. But in the case of Vietnam, Johnson himself had to make the decision, based on the advice of experts, of what American policy should be, and all he personally had to go on was a lifetime of promilitary, internationalist, anti-Communist opinions. Mr. Dallek quotes him criticizing Eisenhower's decision not to intervene in the battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954, which makes the disastrous escalation in 1965 look very much like a foregone conclusion.
It would have been very hard, anyway, for Johnson to have conceived of dovish liberalism as an important political tendency before it emerged as one. In 1958 the columnist Drew Pearson, who habitually nagged at Johnson from the left, published a book called "USA -- Second Class Power." In bringing up this and other details about the climate of the late 1950's, Mr. Dallek reminds us that an interventionist strain in foreign policy dominated the Democratic Party for all of Johnson's years on Capitol Hill. He categorizes Johnson ideologically as "a liberal nationalist who saw a broad consensus for a strong defense against external threats and for domestic programs that eased the problems of an advanced industrial society and particularly served the economic needs of the South."
Like everything Mr. Dallek says, this is completely sound as an overall explanation for the domestic and foreign policy choices Johnson made as President, but it doesn't soar. There will be plenty of room left after Mr. Dallek completes his biography for more theoretically daring historians to explain the meaning of Johnsonism. "Lone Star Rising" whets the appetite not only for Mr. Dallek's second volume, but for their work, and also for Mr. Caro's next volume; Mr. Dallek brings Johnson himself to life, but Mr. Caro will surely make figures like Bobby Baker, the sleazy idiot savant of the Senate, and the aptly named Allan Shivers, the cold-blooded Governor of Texas in the early 1950's, memorable in a way that is beyond Mr. Dallek's literary capabilities. The rustle of index cards is always detectable behind Mr. Dallek's prose -- but he would never let the urge to dramatize the material get such a hold on him that he could present the 1948 Senate race as a struggle between good and evil, as Mr. Caro did. For better and for worse, Mr. Dallek is the rare present-day practitioner of the "three yards and a cloud of dust" school of biography. He lays out the facts and allows the grand themes to emanate from them, relatively untouched by authorial hands.
The main emanation that is given off by the facts of Lyndon Johnson's life and times is that the country he inhabited is different from the one we live in now chiefly because of the role of government. Johnson believed unshakably that government was both the best vehicle for solving people's problems and the place where the most ambitious people would naturally come to seek the gaudy success they wanted. The businessmen Johnson knew well -- lawyer-lobbyists, construction magnates, broadcasting executives -- gravitated to government to obtain money no less than the politicians he knew did to obtain power. Mr. Dallek calls Johnson's friends "self-serving altruists," which is apt. Johnson's world was one in which educated, accomplished people put years of scheming into getting jobs as postmasters.
In part this is a phenomenon common in third world countries, of which Texas was one when Johnson was coming of age; on the other hand nothing happened during Johnson's career as a national politician in the 1950's to change his view that the more the Federal Government could do in every area, the better. In Mr. Dallek's account it is plain that politically, the Government was to some extent a victim of its own success. The New Deal coalition began to erode -- very dramatically in Texas -- as soon as ordinary working people ceased feeling poor. Later, when Johnson was President, his Great Society programs did bring the South into the national mainstream and make the Sun Belt phenomenon possible, but they also Southernized the rest of the country by introducing into national politics the preoccupation with race that had long bedeviled Southern liberalism.
It appears that one of Johnson's clearest intimations of the mortality of American politics as he had always practiced it came when John F. Kennedy won the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1960. Nothing in politics had ever taken Johnson so much by surprise. As Mr. Dallek demonstrates, Johnson truly, almost poignantly, believed that the attention of the electorate was focused on the progress of legislation on Capitol Hill. It was inconceivable to him that a man whose main assets were charm, grace, eloquence, vision and looks, rather than a track record, and who was more wired in to the news media than to the organized political constituencies, would be found preferable to him. Johnson had always assumed that the political fate of liberalism would be a function of how many Government benefits it could deliver; Kennedy demonstrated that in the postwar United States liberals could win on the basis of abstract leadership qualities, and thus instantly reduced the centrality of the Government in society.
Little more than a decade after Johnson left the White House following five years of frenetic Federal activity, another Southwesterner, Ronald Reagan, took the oath of office on the steps of the Capitol, and immediately proclaimed that "government is the problem." Explaining how we got from one extreme to the other over such a short period of time is one of the crucial tasks for those who seek to provide us with a full understanding of late 20th-century America. Surely Johnson's Presidential performance played an important part in the story, and surely some kind of social transformation of the United States did too. It will probably take a small shelf's worth of important books-of-the-future to get us to the point where we know what happened -- and there is every reason to expect that one of them will be Robert Dallek's next volume.
 
 
 
'NO ONE'S GOING TO HAVE THE LAST WORD'


 When Robert Dallek, the author of "Lone Star Rising," was asked for his opinion on the work of Robert A. Caro, his rival Johnson biographer, Mr. Dallek responded with a single word: "Who?"
There followed silence and a laugh.
Although Mr. Caro has written two highly popular and highly critical volumes and plans two more, Mr. Dallek insisted, "I'm not writing against Caro, I'm writing on Lyndon Johnson. It's all to the good that we have competing views of L.B.J. This is what fuels historical understanding and interest." And Mr. Dallek added: "I'm not a believer in definitive history or biography. No one's going to have the last word."
The two actually met once -- at the Johnson Library, appropriately enough, where both men were working on what turned out to be dissimilar interpretations of Johnson's life. According to Mr. Dallek, their meeting was "perfectly cordial and amiable," except, perhaps, for the first words out of Mr. Caro's mouth. When Mr. Dallek introduced himself, Mr. Caro asked, "Who are you?"
"He knew exactly who I was," Mr. Dallek said.
Speaking by telephone from his home in Los Angeles -- where, he says, a stern-visaged campaign poster of L.B.J. dominates his study -- the 57-year-old Mr. Dallek described himself as "an old-fashioned liberal" who started the project "with a pretty critical perspective" on Johnson. "I was surprised by the extent to which I found very positive things to say about the man."
The Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation contributed two $1,200 grants toward Mr. Dallek's project, an irony not lost on the author: in a moment of whimsy, Mr. Dallek noted that Johnson "reaches out even from the grave" to spread a little money around. Of course, with the L.B.J. Library charging 30 to 35 cents per page for copying, he said, the money went fast.
"Lone Star Rising," Mr. Dallek's fifth book, took him seven years; the second volume, covering 1960-73, may take as long. The working title is Thomas Jefferson's description of the Presidency: "Splendid Misery." -- JOSEPH A. CINCOTTI

HEADLINE: HOWELL TOWNSHIP JOURNAL;
Residents Are Angry Over Reservoir's Cost and Water's Taste

BYLINE: By LEO H. CARNEY

DATELINE: HOWELL TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
IT is hard to find anyone who does not admire the beauty of the Manasquan Reservoir. The meandering verdant preserve has a 740-acre lake that sprang up in the middle of what used to be little more than the scrubby northern fringes of the Pine Barrens.
Since the reservoir opened and began operating a year ago, under the New Jersey Water Supply Authority, the lake and several hundred adjoining acres have attracted a plethora of wildlife -- deer, waterfowl and songbirds -- and residents say that the sailing and fishing for bass and trout are excellent. 
 Recreation and esthetics aside, Howell Township and other Monmouth County communities that must now augment their ground-water supplies with the reservoir's more expensive surface water are not pleased with the results. Water bills have doubled or quadrupled in the last year or so and are expected by local and state officials to go even higher.
 
Problem Stems From Court Decision
 Howell Township's problem stands out among the 16 or so municipalities and private water companies in Monmouth County that draw from the new reservoir, residents and officials say, because of a decision this year by the Appellate Division of Superior Court and the controversy that preceded it.
Now awaiting a possible review by the State Supreme Court, the Appellate decision upheld the township's abolishment of the Howell Township Municipal Utilities Authority, which, in the interim, has continued to provide the water service.
Local and state officials say there is no end in sight to the rate increases, which essentially are paying for continuing debt service on the local and state bonds that financed the $85 million reservoir, as well as municipal treatment plants and distribution lines that are being built.
"People are paying a lot of attention to the cost of water here, and there have been sizable rate increases," said Thomas R. Waskozich, the Howell Township administrator.
One of those paying attention to the water rates is Mayor Susanne M. Vietergruber, who said her rates had quadrupled, mostly as the result of the reservoir connection. "I'm paying about $200 a quarter now for just me, my husband and two teen-age daughters -- no swimming pool and no lawn sprinklers," the Mayor said.
Jerry Friedhoff and his wife, Patty, who have two children and a modern three-bedroom home, are paying about the same as the Mayor. "I guess I noticed the increases a little over a year ago and, after the initial shock, have sort of gotten used to them by now," Mr. Friedhoff said.
The reservoir water, he said, is "murky and has more air in it" than the well water. But neither he nor his wife has noticed much of a change in the taste, which many people say is worse now because surface water from the reservoir might be more heavily filtered and chlorinated.
 
'It Tastes Horrible'
 "It tastes horrible, nothing like it was when we got our water from the wells," Virginia Wombough of Wall Township said.
While Howell Township officials and members of the Howell Township Municipal Utilities Authority refused to comment on individual complaints about the new water system or the subject of rates, commercial and residential users have been outspoken.
Ron Barrow, the co-owner of the Howell Self-Service Car Wash, said he had paid the same quarterly bills this year, about $1,800, as before the reservoir came into use, despite new water conservation measures at his carwash, which resulted in the use of 25 percent less water this year.
"What makes it really bad in addition to the fact that we have well water in our own backyard that we could be using," he said, "is that we had to pay $21,000 to hook up to the township water when we opened in 1988."
 
Lawn Sprinker System Required
 Mr. Barrow said he had also been required by the township to install sod and a lawn sprinkler system on his commercial property, which, he said, "is the biggest waste of water there is." Since the reservoir came on line, he said, water pressure has decreased considerably, requiring him to install new lawn sprinkler heads because the original ones needed more pressure to function than the township was able to supply.
Although higher water rates have resulted in higher costs to carwash customers in the past, Mr. Barrow and his partner, Chuck Ranges, said that the present economy and competition from other carwashes made it impossible to pass on the latest water rates to customers.
The Manasquan Reservoir is a modified version of one originally proposed for the area in the 1950's and was eventually listed as a $40 million project on the state's Water Supply Bond Referendum Act of 1981.
But a new design and greater treatment of the Manasquan River's customarily coffee-colored waters resulted in the final $85 million expenditure, said Thomas G. Baxter, the chief engineer for the New Jersey Water Supply Authority.
The need for the reservoir, he said, was justified by a 1978 study by the United States Geological Survey. It showed that the area's aquifers were being depleted. Further studies by the State Department of Environmental Protection in the 80's, Mr. Baxter said, resulted in the environmental agency's issuing orders to municipalities to find new water supplies and to limit the pumping of their existing wells. The reservoir presented the only viable alternative, although a costly one, he said.
But Mayor Vietergruber asserted that Howell's wells were never in any danger of being depleted and that the Municipal Utilities Authority, as was stated in the court papers, had contracted with the State Water Supply Authority for far more water than the township could use.
"The reservoir is a truly lovely addition to our township and provides recreational opportunities that our residents never had," the Mayor said. But she added that "we just do not need half the water that we are now required to purchase from the reservoir."
Santa Triolo, the executive director of the Howell Township Municipal Utilities Authority, said the current contracts with the Water Supply Authority, as well as the $11.4 million municipal treatment plant that had to be built to treat the reservoir water, were based on the township's project growth figures and water supply needs in the late 80's.
Howell's rapid growth in the 80's, he said, "came to a grinding halt" in the final years of the decade, and there have been fewer new water customers since.
Mr. Barrow, for one, objected to a recent proposal by the Utilities Authority to require every residence and business in the township to tie into the new municipal water system, which uses the reservoir, even if their own well-water supplies are deemed to be adequate. "It would be totally unfair," Mr. Barrow said.
Ray Sloccum, a resident of Wall Township, said a municipal bond proposal there, which would raise an additional $470,000 to improve local distribution of the reservoir water to residents, was yet another example of how, in the early 80's, taxpayers were never told how much the new water supply would ultimately cost them.
"Township officials just told us back then that we desperately needed a new source of water and that there was no other choice but to accept the reservoir," Mr. Sloccum said, adding that his water bill will increase about $400 this year. "The officials told us it would cost more but never seemed able to say to what extent," he said.
Mrs. Wombough said she and her husband, Robert, were paying $100 a year for up to 100,000 gallons of water before the reservoir came on line last July. This year, she said, their water bill will be "closer to $500" for less water.
The latest water rate increase in Wall came on top of a tax increase, Mrs. Wombough said, and "these increases are causing people like us, who are close to retirement, to consider moving out of the state."
Mrs. Wombough said, "We're just not sure we'll be able to afford to live here after Bob retires."
 
Fixed Incomes Taken Into Account
 Paul Shives, the Wall Township administrator, said the Township Committee had taken people on fixed incomes into account when setting the new water rates. But, he said, the average residential user will be paying $462 this year for 92,250 gallons of water, and rate increases can be expected for the next two years.
Mr. Shives said Monmouth County had simply run out of alternatives for providing the adequate and inexpensive well water that people had become used to over the years. The reservoir, he said, was a costly but proper solution.
If Wall Township had to rely on its own supplies last August during a mild drought, Mr. Shives said, "we wouldn't have been able to fight a fire for very long and we could not have provided a complete supply to residents."
The reservoir, he said, "came on line just in time for us."

Earnings Drop At Affiliated

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, July 21

 BODY:
Affiliated Publications Inc., the parent of The Boston Globe, says its net profits dropped 58 percent in the second quarter. The company cited continuing decreases in advertising revenues.
Net income was $3.1 million, or 4 cents a share, for the three- month period that ended on June 30. That compared with earnings of $7.4 million, or 11 cents a share, in the comparable period of last year. Revenues totaled $130.9 million, compared with $132.1 million. 
 The company said on Friday that the recession in New England had caused The Globe's ad volume to shrink. Other newspapers have also been suffering financial strains.
Affiliated said the poor advertising climate had also hurt another subsidiary, BPI Communications Inc., which produces arts and design publications as well as Adweek, a trade magazine that experienced an operating loss.
Advertising revenue during the quarter totaled $91.3 million, a 6 percent drop from the period a year earlier.
The company's shares closed unchanged on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, at $8.875 a share.

HEADLINE: The Luster Fades at First American

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Although banking regulators are still puzzled by exactly who owns First American Bankshares Inc. of Washington and what connections it had with the recently closed Bank of Credit and Commerce International of Luxembourg, there is not much mystery about the bank's business.
With banks in Washington and six states and $11 billion in assets, enough to make it about the 50th-largest banking company in the country, First American is much like dozens of other regional banking companies, collecting consumer deposits and making loans to local businesses. 
 The group of Middle Eastern investors who bought the company in 1982 are represented by Clark M. Clifford, the 84-year-old chairman of First American and one of Washington's most illustrious lawyers. He is not involved in the company's day-to-day operations, though he is a link between First American and some Middle Eastern investors whose ownerhip of B.C.C.I. is the target of a series of investigations in the United States and abroad for a host of accusations, including one of fraud. Mr. Clifford's junior law partner, Robert A. Altman, is also a director of the bank.
Mr. Clifford, whose ties to First American began when he represented the investors during their four-year battle to acquire First American's predecessor parent, Financial General Bankshares, keeps his primary office at the law firm of Clifford & Warnke. But there is no doubt, said Jack W. Beddow, First American's chief, that Mr. Clifford "sets the overall policy and direction for the company."
Until last year, when the downturn in the Washington real estate market caused First American a loss of $139.3 million, followed by an additional $20 million loss in the first quarter of this year, First American had a record of steady though unspectacular profits. The backbone of the bank is a network of 185 branches in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, making it the third-largest bank in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia.
As it grew in the 1980's, the company spread into New York, including a Park Avenue office; Georgia, and Florida. And until recently, it had a good record of making profitable loans. But its luster has faded with real estate loan losses in the Washington area, while its banks in the Southeast and New York proved to be only marginally profitable and weak competitors against stronger rivals.
 
Feeling a Malaise
 Worse, First American's biggest banks' knack for making good loans deteriorated. Where they once were in the top third of American banks their size, they sank to the bottom 10 percent of the industry when the Washington economy finally slowed and commercial real estate values faded. Regulators have asked the company to expand its capital base to cushion further losses.
"First American is a generally well-run company, but right now they are feeling the malaise of the local economy," said Arnold G. Danielson, a banking consultant in Rockville, Md.
First American's traditional emphasis on business lending, particularly to real estate developers, served it well during the 80's, when the Washington area grew rapidly, but left it vulnerable to losses when real estate prices plummeted in 1990 and developers began defaulting on loans.
 
'A Real Estate Economy'
 According to documents filed with the Federal Reserve, the bank pursued real estate lending with such relish in the booming real estate market of the 80's, that on March 31 of this year, commercial real estate loans accounted for 27.6 percent of the assets at First American's Virginia bank and 30.1 percent at its Maryland bank. The concentration on commercial real estate was unusually high, even for the Washington area. At the American Security Bank of Washington, for example, such loans accounted for 24 percent, while the more conservative Riggs National Bank held such loans to 11 percent.
"This is a real estate economy," said Paul G. Adams, First American's chief operating officer. "Those were basically the kind of loans the market offered."
Mr. Adams said that "until 1989, we had literally no charge-offs of any significance on real estate loans."But he noted that the riskiness of the company's real estate lending rose in the late 80's as developers who had concentrated on lower-risk residential housing moved into riskier commercial projects.
 
Regulatory Intervention
 The 1990 loss led to an agreement with banking regulators three months ago that calls for First American to try to reduce its reliance on real estate lending. Mr. Adams said the plan calls for consumer loans to grow by roughly 13 percent a year, a sharp reversal from the 1987-90 period, when consumer loans fell to $1.2 billion, from $1.39 billion. He expects modest growth in business loans not related to real estate, and a 50 percent decline in real estate construction loans, to about $500 million by 1994.
In the late 80's, fewer than 1 percent of loans at First American's Washington, Maryland and Virginia banks were troubled, and they ranked in the top third of banks their size. But by the end of March 1991, the total of badly delinquent loans and real estate acquired through foreclosure had increased to nearly 12 percent of all assets at the Washington bank and 8 percent in Virginia.
Last month, First American's shareholders complied with regulators' demands for more capital by supplying $39 million of additional funds. The company also agreed early this year to sell its highly profitable Tennessee bank to First Tennessee National Corporation of Memphis for about $75 million, which would produce an additional $22 million of capital for the remaining banks. First American's Florida bank, which has $48.5 million in assets, will also be sold to local investors, but is too small to produce any significant gain.
Except for the real estate lending losses, the major missteps by First American have been those made at the sugggestion of its Middle Eastern owners, as they pushed the company to expand into New York and Georgia. The move into New York started with a new bank in 1983 and was soon supplemented by the purchase of 33 branches and their deposits in the Albany area from the Bankers Trust Company. Since 1986 the $1.6 billion-asset New York bank has never earned more than $2.6 million in a year. It is a mediocre record that First American's owners could easily have bettered by investing the bank's more than $100 million of capital in Treasury bills.
At the time of the move into Georgia, Mr. Beddow, First American's chief executive, said, "We understood our stockholders were interested in having us buy the bank, and they provided us with the money to do it." The Georgia bank, whose $1.53 billion of assets make it the sixth largest in the state, has never been strongly profitable, and its losses of $26.1 million last year and $8.5 million in the first quarter this year are greater than its profits in 1987 through 1989.
 
Well-Positioned in Washington
 The seller of the Georgia bank was Gaith R. Pharaon, a Saudi Arabian businessman and B.C.C.I. shareholder who bought the bank in 1980 from Bert Lance, former budget director under President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Lance was also an adviser to the Middle Eastern investors who created First American in 1982 after buying Financial General.
While Mr. Adams said there is no active plan to sell the New York or Georgia banks, he acknowledged that "it is now recognized that good value to shareholders from a regional bank comes when the bank has a leading position in its local market."
Because of its strong position in the Washington area, where First American has about 7.5 percent share of deposits, after Sovran Bank with 9.2 percent and MNC Financial with 8.4 percent, Mr. Paul said, the company "has a lot more value than might be recognized right now because of the problems." He does not expect a quick sale of the B.C.C.I. holdings, but said that when the shares are available, "my personal view is that some entrepreneurial group will take a position that will later lead to consolidation with some other company."
Mr. Danielson, the analyst, noted that First American is further along than its competition in organizing itself as one company, at least in the Washington area, despite Federal laws requiring it to operate seperate banks in Maryland, Virginia and Washington.
But the centralization process has also been caught up in the unraveling of the company's grandiose plans. A new computer center in Reston, Va., handles processing and account records for all of First American's banks but has the capacity to do much more. To save $3 million annually, First American earlier this year turned the center over to Pro-Systems, a Ross Perot company that needed more space to expand its own processing businesses.
"The computer center was built when we had a vision of being a much bigger bank," Mr. Adams said.

Papers begin to See Hints That Ad Slump Is Ending

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
SIX months into 1991, the prospects that newspaper advertising will show an improvement over 1990 are dim at best. A decline in newspaper advertising spending this year would be the first back-to-back annual drop since World War II.
But like the first balmy whiff of spring in early March, the fleeting and elusive scent of better times has been detected by some newspaper exectives. 
 "Before, there was an ill wind blowing, but now there's a still in the air and a sense that the next wind is going to be a good one," said Jerome S. Tilis, vice president of marketing for Knight-Ridder Inc. and chairman of the executive committee of Newspapers First, which sells advertising collectively for 39 newspapers.
Mr. Tilis, like every other newspaper executive contacted for a spot-check of the advertising climate, added that he did not know just when that fair wind might begin to blow.
The Persian Gulf war paralyzed consumer spending and sent newspaper advertising plummeting well below the depressed levels already caused by the recession.
At midyear, the advertising trough remains widespread, but with quirks.
For instance, newspapers in the Northeast continue to suffer and some of New England's papers are in an economic rout. The pain is also sharp, if not so cumulatively deep, at newspapers in California, which had been spared until late last year.
In some markets, real estate advertising is starting to make a comeback and retail advertising has stopped going down after a long slide.
The brief euphoria after the gulf war slowed the advertising decline in May; alas, the trend slowed or sputtered out in June at many papers.
"We don't see any drastic changes in advertising trends," said David Laventhol, president of Times Mirror Inc., who added, "We hope for a slight upturn in the next couple of months, but that's a hope, not a prediction."
Kenneth T. Berents, a media analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, a Baltimore securities firm, has surveyed 1,500 newspapers three times this year, asking them to predict 1991 advertising levels.
Mr. Berents said his January survey indicated that most papers expected a decline in 1991; in his April survey, the decline predicted was greater. And in his latest survey, the first 200 responses indicate that results are expected to be even worse. Mr. Berents said such results meant that many papers had given up hope of a turnaround this year to compensate for the disastrous first quarter.
Yet despite such pessimism about this year's prospects, several newspaper executives said they sensed that the mood of the industry has subtly shifted from the gloom that pervaded at April convention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association in April.
They characterize the new mood as an embattled realism, bolstered by renewed confidence that when the economy improves, the newspaper business will get significantly better.
Still, unlike other cyclical downturns in newspaper advertising, this one was accompanied by widespread uncertainty about how much advertising would return to newspapers when the economy improved.
Changes in the marketplace -- including department-store consolidations, shifts to advertising by mail and warehouse stores that do not advertise at all -- have caused huge anxiety in the newspaper industry.
As a result, there has been a grim round of soul-searching throughout the industry, which had become lethargic and spoiled by the boom years of the mid-1980's. The last few months have prompted feverish bursts of creativity aimed at finding ways to overcome these changes.
For instance, Mr. Tilis said The St. Paul Pioneer Press, which is owned by Knight-Ridder, formed an alliance with a television station to co-produce and promote a health magazine. The paper also sent an ad salesman to Las Vegas, Nev., and now passengers on flights from St. Paul to Las Vegas get a copy of the paper wrapped in four pages of Las Vegas advertising.
The Pioneer Press has also begun producing local trade shows, which provide income from display space and tickets, as well as assuring newspaper promotion with advertising.
At The New York Times Company's Regional Newspaper Group, which includes 32 small to medium-sized papers, John R. Harrison, the group's president, said many of the papers were concentrating on small advertisers, which had been overlooked in the boom years.
Business directories, with ads from plumbers, pest-control companies and other small businesses, have become a staple at many small papers.
And smaller papers are also aggressively selling ads to car dealerships and other businesses in neighboring towns. This has become a burgeoning source of new advertising that had previously been avoided for fear of angering local merchants.
But part of the new realism is a recognition that the golden years of the mid-80's are probably gone forever. Mr. Berents said the average operating profit margins for newspapers peaked at 24.1 percent in 1986 and 1987. According to his 1991 surveys, newspapers expect profit margins of about 16.6 percent in 1991.
Those responding to surveys this year said they now considered a "normal" profit margin to be 20 percent, well below the previous peak levels.
"I don't expect business to be as vibrant in the 90's as in the 80's," said W. Dean Singleton, chief executive of Media News Group. "But I don't expect it to be elementally bad either."

HEADLINE: Baker, Now in Israel, Finds Hope That Peace Is Possible

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 21

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d arrived tonight in Israel, a land of skeptics, many of whom would like to be convinced that this round of American shuttle diplomacy holds greater promise than earlier efforts.
The apparent concessions Mr. Baker is bringing from Syria and Saudi Arabia have raised people's hopes, despite the reception given them by the Government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. But these hopes find only wary expression because Syria and Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq, are regarded by most Israelis, regardless of political affiliation, as implacable enemies. 
 People of varied political views, questioned in random conversations, tempered their hopes with caution.
"It still needs to be seen," said Hanoch Bartov, a well-known novelist and biographer, appraising Syria's apparent readiness to enter into direct talks with Israel. "But what they said is a change."
 
Details Wanted From Baker
 Mr. Bartov, whose views represent the opposition Labor Party's mainstream, spoke emphatically, as did such officials as Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press Office, on the need for Mr. Baker to fully disclose the substance of his agreement with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.
"We don't know what the deal is, and we have the right to find out," said Mr. Bartov, who is president of the Israeli Center of PEN, the international writers' group.
Peter Milic, a Tel Aviv businessman, was readier than most Israelis questioned over the last three days to accept the results so far of the Baker mission as an opportunity for Israel. "There is a big difference," he said. "It's the first time that Syria has said something positive, and the first time that Saudi Arabia has spoken like that."
Saudi Arabia told Mr. Baker that it was ready to suspend its economic boycott of Israel if the Israelis suspended the building of settlements in the occupied Arab territories.
Mr. Milic cited as particularly positive the fact that Saudi Arabia had not demanded the dismantling of existing settlements. "That sounds reasonable," he said.
 
Shamir's Strength Doubted
 But he also expressed fear that political pressure on Mr. Shamir from the settlers would prevent him from responding positively to the American initiative.
Mr. Milic cited a statement today by Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, proclaiming the right of Israelis to settle on the West Bank for "hundreds of years" to come. Mr. Sharon rejected any link between "the Jewish people's right to its homeland" and the Arab boycott.
"And Labor hasn't come up with its own program," Mr. Milic continued. "They should be helping Shamir on this."
Much as Israelis in general welcomed the reported Saudi concession, they objected to the linkage between ending the boycott and the Jewish settlements.
"I must say that for the first time I'm in line with Shamir," Mr. Bartov said. "This quid pro quo should never have happened. There is no symmetry possible there. This is unbearable."
 
Linkage Resented
 The writer emphasized that he opposed the continuation of the settlement policy, but compared the linkage to what he called the "immorality" of the 1975 United Nations General Assembly resolution denouncing Zionism as a form of racism.
"For the mediator to bring this here as an achievement turns the United States position upside down," Mr. Bartov said. "After all, the United States has always opposed the Arab boycott, which began even before the creation of this state."
"There is simply no comparison," said Aharon Amir, a poet and translator who is an advocate of the concept of a "Greater Israel." "We should pay no price for the end of the boycott."
But Mr. Amir expressed optimism on the American mediation. "There is hardly any doubt that things will get moving in this area," he said. "But we should not be overwhelmed; we should be prudent."
He voiced a suspicion that Israelis across the board seem to share in varying degrees. "It should be suspected that there has been a sort of deal behind Israel's back," he said.
Many Israelis doubt that the Syrian President would have offered to attend a regional conference with Israel without receiving some American assurance that has not been disclosed.
Most of those interviewed thought Mr. Assad had been told that the United States would press Israel to return the Golan Heights, captured in 1967 and, unlike the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, incorporated into Israel by the earlier Likud Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
"No Israeli in his right mind would hand it all back to Assad just because he begins to smile," Mr. Bartov said. But he said that a compromise on the territory was possible. He suggested a formula under which, for "a long interim period," Israel would remain in control on the ground while recognizing eventual restoration of Syrian sovereignty over the area.
Even Mr. Olmert, interviewed in his office, said "the Golan is negotiable."
"Syria is wrong if they calculated on an Israeli 'no,' " the press office chief said. "We do not rule out the possibility that a positive change has occurred."
Many Israelis coupled their caution toward dealing with Syria with an appreciation of Mr. Assad's political skill, as evidenced in the timing of his accord with the United States and the consistency of his Government's policies toward Israel.
"They have fulfilled whatever they said," Mr. Milic said.
"He is the wiliest, cleverest and most dastardly guy in this area," Mr. Amir added.

HEADLINE: Arab Trade Ban Hurts Others Besides Israelis

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
An offer by several Arab countries to end more than four decades of economic warfare against Israel would end a struggle that has wounded but not crippled the Israeli economy, many American companies and the Arab world itself.
Saudi Arabia and Jordan have offered to suspend their boycotts on trade with Israel and companies doing business there in exchange for a suspension of Israel's construction of settlements in the occupied territories. The offer was made after Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 and does not observe the ban, suggested such an arrangement. 
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has rejected any link between the building of settlements and the boycott.
The costs of the boycott over the years have been hard to measure. The losses to the world economy lie mostly in trade deals that were never struck, investments never made and technology never transferred. The political cloud over business in the region has discouraged the efficient and enriching specialization of economies that trade and foreign investment provide.
 
Arab League Acted in 1954

Arab countries cut most economic links with Israel when it gained independence in 1948. In 1954, the Arab League, which now has 21 members, passed a resolution that called on members not to trade with Israel.
The Arab League later set up a special office in Damascus to administer the boycott, and in 1972 this office drew up a set of regulations for all league members to apply in international trade and finance. The rules banned economic contacts not only with Israel but also with companies and banks doing business there.
The boycott has been a political issue in the United States, with Congress passing laws barring American companies from helping the boycott, even when this might involve losing contracts, exports and jobs.
"Our companies have, most of them, with certain exceptions, tried to walk this tightrope between violating these boycott laws and yet playing in the big Arab market," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who introduced legislation three months ago to tighten Federal scrutiny of companies that may reject doing business with Israel.
If the boycott is lifted, the most likely immediate effect would be more foreign investment in Israel, economists and trade lawyers said today. There might also be some increase in trade for Israel and the Arab world, they said, both with each other and with small and medium-sized American companies now leery of doing business in the region for legal reasons.
"The heaviest effect of the boycott on Israel has been on investment, and not on goods," said Howard F. Rosen, a research associate at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington center for scholars. While many companies now sell goods in both Israel and Arab countries, they have been wary of investments in factories and other assets that are hard to hide.
And some exports that might have made economic sense were forestalled. "There is a chilling effect," said Cherif Sedky, a partner at Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in Washington and the general counsel of the National U.S. Arab Chamber of Commerce. "Smaller companies may feel, 'Uh oh, this is a trouble area; let's stay out of it.' "
Publication of the Arab League rules in 1977 drew particularly loud protests in the United States, where they were perceived as a extraterritorial threat to the civil rights of American Jews. Despite protests from corporations with large operations in the Arab world, particularly international construction companies, Congress passed legislation in 1979 that barred compliance with the boycott and set strict penalties for violations.
 
U.S. Opposition Strict
 The United States has been much more strict than other countries in carrying out the anti-boycott laws since then, and some business groups have objected that this represents a sanction that hurts American businesses more than Arab countries.
The enforcement of the Arab boycott has varied across countries and across industries. Saudi Arabia, for instance, conducts strict inspections of imports at its borders, and has been known to turn back products because they contain even a few small Israeli-made components, Mr. Sedky said.
But Arab countries have shown considerable willingness to ignore the boycott to obtain American goods, particularly weapons.

If Those Are Whirling Dervishes, Then This Stop Must Be Istanbul

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 21

 BODY:
It was fitting, of course, that George Bush, described by some as America's most famous whirling dervish, should get a chance to see the real thing.
Playing anything-but-accidental tourists today, President Bush and his wife, Barbara, went to Topkapi Sarayi, the great palace of the Ottoman Sultans, their harems and their judicial councils, and watched five dervishes whirl. 
 "A whirling dervish?" Mr. Bush delightedly asked his host, President Turgut Ozal of Turkey. "Wonderful."
Dervishes are Sufis, members of a Muslim fraternity of mystics who dance in their flowing white costumes in a trance-like state, spinning on the right foot to the accompaniment of musical instruments.
The local band was fine on the Turkish music, but their repertoire of American tunes to play as the Bushes arrived was sparse. There was no "Hail to the Chief" or "Star Spangled Banner" here: At the welcoming ceremony, the band struck up "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "The Mexican Hat Dance."
 
 Wish List Fulfilled

The Bushes and President Ozal and his wife, Semra, whirled about Istanbul today, visiting the magnificent Blue Mosque, which featured police snipers in the minarets; taking a boat ride on the Bosphorus, and checking out the weeping column and wishing hole at Hagia Sophia, which was the cathedral of Constantinople for a thousand years of the Byzantine Empire.
"Turgut, want to make a wish?" Mr. Bush asked Mr. Ozal, as he poked his finger into a well-worn hole where tourists make wishes at Hagia Sophia.
Mr. Ozal did not. Indeed, Mr. Bush may already have granted all his wishes, by being effusively praising "my friend, Turgut," by promising lots of F-16's and $625 million in military aid next year, and by omitting any reference to Turkey's human-rights record, although Amnesty International and other groups had asked him to raise the issue.
 
 Footwear of Many Colors

Mrs. Bush won the day's award for oddest fashion statement. When she bounded up the plank of the Sarayburnu, a converted steamship that was to carry the party up the Bosphorus toward the Black Sea, the First Lady was wearing one red and one blue sneaker with her white-and-black polka dot dress.
Asked for an explanation of the First Footwear, Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary, said that the President had given the First Lady 20 pairs of Keds for her birthday June 8 "and this way she gets to wear them all."
 
 The Diplomatic Marathon

At the news conference in Ankara on Saturday, the President was asked how he and his staff were holding up under his dizzying tour of four countries.
Mr. Bush made a rare concession, saying he felt a bit tired, and added that he was still taking medication and getting his thyroid checked every day by the doctors traveling with him.
But the 67-year-old President insisted that he would not slow down because "I'm very blessed with, you know, the ability to keep charging."
Mr. Bush also said proudly that he had converted his old friend and former campaign manager, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, to the Bush style of traveling.
Mr. Baker is on a tour of the Middle East for peace talks, after the economic summit meeting in London last weekend and before a scheduled meeting with Southeast Asian leaders in Malaysia on Monday. Both Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush will also go to Moscow in a week.
Sounding like a successful fitness trainer, a prosyletizing Jack LaLanne, the President said: "Jim Baker used to get tired when he drove across town in Washington, D.C. -- literally. He'd call me up and tell me how tired he was, campaigning and all of that. Now he's going all around the world all the time, dedicated to trying to help solve this problem."
 
 Who Looks at the Polls?
 Mr. Bush made two firsts on this trip. He admitted that he sometimes gets tired. And he admitted that he pays attention to polls -- something he had always denied.
Reporters asked President Ozal about a recent poll in Turkey that showed that most Turks feel that the United States, through the coalition against Iraq, has been interfering in Turkey's internal affairs.
Mr. Ozal said he didn't see it. But when Mr. Bush was asked if he reads polls, he finally 'fessed up.
"My wings would drop off if I told an untruth," he said. "So put it this way: from time to time, I look at them."
 
 Burnishing the Image

It's nice to know that even the highest officials of the land engage in a little resume enhancement now and again.
Consider the biography for the White House Chief of Staff, John H. Sununu, printed in the official United States Information Service media guide for the President's visit to Greece.
"Part of the job of the Chief of Staff is to mediate the many competing requests of Cabinet members and others seeking the President's time and attention. At the same time, he must insure that the President's policy is presented effectively to Congress and the public. Mr. Sununu's experience in an elective office ensures his effectiveness in both venues.
"He is considered an able, meticulous and experienced administrator whose political toughness helps shape the Bush Administration's approach to bureaucracy."
Mr. Baker's biography is equally flattering.
It says of Mr. Baker, who says he is more interested in returning to his ranch than running for President: "Many in the political arena see James Baker as having a very bright future in politics and feel, as a political insider has put it, 'that he will be a major force on the political scene for the next 10 or 15 years.' "
By the time the Presidential party got to Turkey, the biographies had been yanked from the official media guide.

HEADLINE: West Virginia Roads: A Bumpy Legacy Lives On

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTS, W.Va.

 BODY:
As the four-wheel-drive lurches across the mountain, splashes through the creek and bounces down a graveled lane, miles from the cushioned comforts of blacktop, a thought occurs: John Denver may have immortalized West Virginia's country roads, but he didn't have to drive on them.
In West Virginia, the struggle to build and maintain roads is a Sisyphean quest that is woven into the state's politics, with significant social and economic consequences. 
 Bad roads can keep children from school, workers from work and the sick from people who can heal them. They bring endless promises from West Virginia's politicians and occasional rulings by the state Supreme Court.
 
A Harder Road to Build
 No other state combines the mountainous terrain, dispersed population and poverty that makes roads so hard to build in West Virginia. Roads are more expensive here than they are in just about any other state, and few states have less money to build them. West Virginia may be the only state where a roadless town has petitioned the Soviet Union for foreign aid.
"West Virginians are constantly preoccupied with their roads," said Ken Sullivan, a historian who edits the state magazine, Goldenseal.
But if bad roads have been part of the state's sorrow, they are also part of its glory. By preserving some of the region's isolation, they help maintain the distinct culture that keeps so many residents from ever wanting to leave.
For the families in Sand Creek Hollow, a few mountainous miles from Harts, the road to school has brought the kind of epic misadventure rarely found outside Road Runner cartoons. Every morning, until a recent court decision, the hollow's 11 children -- Patience, Frank, Amy, Marie, Larry, Jason, April, T. C., Jasper, Eddie and Shawn -- would crowd into Louise Collins's dilapidated red pickup truck.
Down the hollow they would bounce on a dirt road that sometimes crossed the creek and other times was the creek. Assuming no ice or floods, they would emerge at the hollow's mouth, turn left and hug the railroad track for three miles, spitting gravel.
From there, all they had to do was climb out of the truck, crawl under the occasional parked coal train and scoot across a swinging bridge without sides that dangles 60 feet above the Guyandotte River. In good weather, that is.
In bad weather, the truck would bog down and the children would push.
"We'd be late just about every morning," said Patience Collins, now 15 years old, who is Louise Collins's daughter. "Everybody'd be in class looking at you. That's embarrassing, water squishing out your shoes."
Since a 1986 ruling by the State Supreme Court, things are better, though how much so remains in dispute. Holding that the right to attend school includes a right to get there, the court told the state's Division of Highways to fix the road.
These days, the middle section of its four-mile stretch is studded with progress's own jewel: gravel. But, with a good rain, the end that crosses the mountain and opens onto blacktop still turns to gravy, making it too dangerous to travel. And the other end is still blocked by creek and railroad.
 
2 Miles in 2 Hours
 The local school board now sends in a four-wheel-drive vehicle. In good weather, the trip, about two miles as the crow flies, takes about 45 minutes. In bad, it has been known to last two hours.
Conditions there are not unique.
"We're reluctant to print letters to the editor about poor roads, because they just set off an avalanche of letters saying, 'My road's worse than yours,' " said Don Marsh, editor of The Charleston Gazette.
Political brawls over West Virginia roads are older than West Virginia itself, dating back to the time when Virginia was united. Westerners accused easterners of hogging all the development money. That, along with slavery, led to the westernmost counties' separation from Virginia in 1861.
A century later, in 1965, Congress created the Appalachian Regional Commission as a conduit for development money in a 13-state area. Since then, about two-thirds of the money has gone to road building.
 
Emphasis Is Changing
 Those roads, along with the federally financed Interstates, have reduced the region's isolation, providing four-lanes between most major West Virginia cities. And efforts by the commission and others have helped bring health clinics and social services to underserved areas.
But getting out of the hollow can still be a feat.
"We're just now getting around to taking the emphasis off the Interstate and switching it onto those local roads," said Randy Epperly, of the Division of Highways.
In most mountain states west of the Rockies, the population congregates in towns and cities. In West Virginia, by contrast, the population is spread out in the hollows carved by the state's countless streams. This means it takes more roads to reach the people.
 
Higher Road Costs
 And West Virginia is the only state that lies completely within Appalachia. States like North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia have lowland areas with prosperous cities that can help subsidize road building in the mountains.
In steep, creek-crossed West Virginia road building almost always entails earth-moving and bridge construction, and the high cost s bleeds away money from other services.
"It lowers the overall quality of social services that West Virginians can draw on," said John Alexander Williams, a leading historian of the state.
How much does it cost to build a West Virginia road?
Consider "common excavation," otherwise known as moving dirt. The Federal Department of Transportation's 1990 statistics show the national average at $2.38 a cubic yard. It West Virginia, it cost $7.87.
Of the 33,000 miles of state roads here, only 61 percent are paved. And 13 percent are categorized as "unimproved" or "primitive." In other words, "It'd have grass growing in the middle," said Paul Wilkinson, the head of planning for the highway division.
How much yearning can a West Virginia road produce?
In 1977, the self-proclaimed mayor of a hamlet called Vulcan was so frustrated by a fallen bridge that he wrote the Soviet Embassy in Washington, seeking help.
A Soviet journalist came to investigate, and a local radio station reported bomb threats toward any bridge built with communist help. Embarrassed state officials coughed up $1.3 million to build Vulcan's bridge.
West Virginia is one of the few states where virtually all the roads are maintained by the state, rather than counties and cities. This helps insure that roads remain a focus of state politics.
It is true that Mr. Denver's "Take Me Home, Country Roads" has been adopted as an unofficial state anthem. But few people here take its misty-eyed view of roads very seriously. After all, Mr. Denver's real name is Henry John Deutschendorf Jr., and he grew up in Arizona, Alabama, Ohio, Texas and Japan, not West Virginia.
 
A Song to Remember
 When West Virginians get real about roads, they turn to songs like this one, written by Billy Edd Wheeler for John D. Rockefeller 4th's 1976 campaign for governor:
 
 Well you rattle and you shake
 Speed up and then hit your brakes
 I'm jumping like a toad
 On this West Virginia road
 Bumpity-bump, bumpity-bump.
And if he made more road promises than he kept, Mr. Rockefeller, now a United States Senator, was following in a proud tradition.
Evident amusement comes into the voice of Mr. Marsh, the newspaper editor, when he tells of what happened when Mr. Rockefeller, as Governor, bought a block of television time and invited voters to call in.
"He had all these high ideas about a colloquy between the governing and the governed," Mr. Marsh said. "And all he got was curses: 'My road ain't no good; my holler ain't got no road.' "
In a state that cannot afford many basic services, Mr. Marsh said, it is unrealistic to expect a road to every hollow. Either accept rural life as it is, he said, or move.
But many students of Appalachia have long marveled over its residents' intense love of home. The hills are filled with stories of workers who once moved to booming industrial cities, like Cleveland and Detroit, but made 10-hour drives back, just for the weekend. When the Industrial Belt rusted, they came home for good.
 
It Is Their Home
 Among them was Thomas Church, Patience Collins's grandfather and the patriarch of Sand Creek Hollow. Nine of his 10 children still live there, scattered across the 369 acres his stepfather bought in 1941. Stymied in part by the difficulties of getting there, none finished high school.
Mr. Church's daughter, Louise Collins, began her pickup truck service with the determination to see her children go further. She and her family say the responsibility helped bring on a subsequent nervous breakdown.
Whatever the hardships, Mr. Church and his children have a hard time imagining a place they would rather be than in their current backyard, filled with mountains, streams and bumblebees.
As for the argument that the state cannot afford to fix the road, Mr. Church is skeptical, pointing to an imprisoned former Governor, Arch A. Moore Jr., and what Mr. Church calls another of the state's great political traditions, corruption.
"They sit over there in Charleston and let them steal all that money; they can afford to put in a road," he said.

HEADLINE: TV Dials Set to Rhode Island Bank Crisis

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., July 21

 BODY:
Six months after the collapse of a private bank insurance fund left 300,000 Rhode Island depositors locked out of their accounts, televised hearings have transfixed the state and focused attention on one question: Why were public officials and financial leaders able to withdraw their own money on the eve of the crisis?
The hearings, the first of several phases of public testimony in coming months, will resume Monday and continue through Thursday. The nine-member investigating panel was created by the Legislature to look into the collapse of the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, a private company that insured the deposits of 45 credit unions and banks. 
 After the company failed on New Year's Eve, the banks and credit unions it insured were ordered closed by the new Governor, Bruce G. Sundlun. The closings directly affected one out of three Rhode Islanders, creating the state's worst banking crisis since the Depression and shaking the political establishment.
 
$1 Billion in Assets Frozen
 More than $1 billion in assets, representing the accounts of 160,00 depositors, are still frozen in the 13 credit unions and banks that remain closed. The other financial institutions were allowed to reopen after obtaining Federal deposit insurance. Accounts in Federally insured banks and credit unions throughout the state were not affected by the crisis.
Last week, Rhode Island residents watched the televised hearings with fascination as public officials and former officials of financial institutions answered questions about whether they used inside information to make last-minute withdrawals, aggravating the crisis at the expense of ordinary depositors.
While not a root cause of the crisis, the issue has given Rhode Islanders a focus for their frustration. The crisis is widely perceived to be an outgrowth of an inbred political culture that produced a tangle of conflicting interests among public officials and financial institutions.
One witness last week was State Representative Robert V. Bianchini, who until this year was the vice chairman of the House Finance Committee and also headed the trade association of state's credit unions.
Mr. Bianchini, a Democrat, has been criticized for his role in the failure of a 1986 bill that would have required all credit unions to obtain Federal insurance, putting Rhode Island Share and Desposit out of business.
Mr. Bianchini was called to explain a complex series of personal transactions in which he borrowed $85,000 from a credit union just before it closed, then later used his frozen passbook accounts to pay off the loan. Mr. Bianchini vigorously defended the moves, saying they did not represent a withdrawal and were unrelated to the condition of insurance fund.
 
Last-Minute Withdrawals
 Other witnesses have included the Mayor of North Providence, a state senator, several credit union executives, along with the fund's former president, his wife and his mother-in-law. All were asked about last-minute withdrawals. Several have invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination.
The commission is made up of legislators and community leaders, but most of the questioning has been done so far by its two special counsels: Alan I. Baron, whose investigation as special counsel to the United States House Judiciary Committee led to the impeachment of two Federal judges in 1989; and John W. Nields Jr., chief counsel for the Iran-contra inquiry in 1987 by the United States House of Representatives.
In the coming months, the commission plans public hearings into areas that cut closer to the roots of the crisis, including roles played by legislators, state banking regulators and the credit unions themselves.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Cable Networks See Dimmer Future

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 21

 BODY:
The central story in the television industry for the last decade has been the erosion of the broadcast networks' audiences. Now, a new story is emerging: the erosion of cable.
Executives from several of the biggest cable networks -- including MTV, Showtime and Turner Network Television -- said last week that they did not expect their channels to continue to build audiences; rather, they are calculating ways to try to hold on to their current audiences. 
 Indeed, several established cable networks -- like ESPN, MTV, TBS and the Family Channel -- have begun to lose viewers.
Up to now, cable networks have generally grown steadily as more and more homes added cable service. Cable currently reaches about 60 percent of American households. But future growth based on future expansion of cable service appears to be limited. Most areas of the country are now wired for cable service, so most homes that want cable are already able to add it.
Moreover, the continuing increases in the cost of cable service has created consumer resistance. The slowdown in the growth of subscribers for the pay channels, like HBO and Showtime, is widely regarded as an indication that the boom in consumer spending on cable is over.
Cable network executives said the competition for viewers and programs was likely to become increasingly intense and even cutthroat as cable systems added more channels, and that the climate would be especially hostile toward the newcomers.
"Cable is going to begin eating itself," said Scott Sassa, president of Turner Entertainment Networks. "Will it eat itself to death? No. But we're looking at our backs right now."
The metaphor of creeping threats from within what used to be known as the "cable family" runs throughout the industry. Nickelodeon's president, Geraldine Leybourne, said, "We're aware of having to watch over our shoulders."
Doug Herzog, senior vice president of MTV, said, "Clearly, we're thinking hard about our cable neighbors."
And Tony Cox, chairman of Showtime Networks, said, "The industry is quickly moving toward a classic battle between the haves and the have-nots."
One executive said established channels were moving aggressively to try to prevent newer channels from gaining a foothold. The chief method: buying up many programs that new channels want.
"We heard that someone was going to try to start up the Cowboy Channel," said the senior executive from a long-established channel, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"Do you think we're going to sit there with our pants down?" the executive continued. "No. We buy up every cowboy movie we can. And so does everybody else. Same with the Science-Fiction Channel. There's only a finite amount of that stuff available. To an extent, we can prevent them from getting started."
 
'Opening a Pandora's Box'
 As cable systems expand to include more and more channels, audience shares are likely to decline even more steeply. Systems of up to 150 channels are now expected to be widely in place within a decade.
"It's kind of like opening a Pandora's box," Mr. Sassa said. "The networks started to get eaten up first by independent stations. Then the first wave of cable channels came along. Now there's a second wave. The viewing has to come from somewhere. Viewing is a zero-sum game. It's arrogant to believe we have this size of audience and we're always going to have it. You're going to have to fight for it."
Many cable networks are responding to the huge expansion of channel capacity by planning to offer their programming in what they call a "multiplex format." In this format, a cable subscriber gets HBO or MTV on as many as three channels, with different lineups on each.
While this may help protect a cable franchise, it has the prospect of spreading viewing levels out even more. "As hard as it was for the broadcasters to understand what cable was going to mean to their lives, I think it is hard for us to understand what a multiplex environment is going to mean for our lives," Ms. Leybourne of Nickelodeon said.
But that flood of new channels will not signal the official beginning of cable erosion.
"Cable erosion is for real already," said Lee Masters, president of "E," an all-entertainment channel of the second wave. "MTV is still making $85 million a year. But it has only been on the air 10 years and its share is already falling. How long can they keep making profits like that with declining shares? Cable has been a great business. But it's going to be a very different business in the 90's."
Among the differences cited by the executives: higher prices for programming, lower profit margins and possibly even well-established channels going out of business.
"The cable channels have really stepped up and paid out large rights fees in recent years for sports and movies," said Matthew C. Blank, president of Showtime. "Those involve ongoing payments of a lot of dollars. If you crank their business down just a hair, some of those guys could go under."
The addition of more sports events could increase viewing on some cable channels. But better attractions, like championship boxing matches, are likely to be siphoned off to pay-per-view channels. And Congressional opposition is likely to prevent cable from gaining the biggest sports events, like the World Series and the Super Bowl, because legislators object to people without cable being frozen out of such events.
What some channels fear the most is that more cable operators will react to consumer resistance to higher cable bills by separating channels into numerous "tiers," with sharply different prices.
At the moment, all the main advertiser-supported channels share space on most systems in what is known as "basic cable" -- that is, customers receive all these channels for the same monthly price. They pay extra if they want a "premium channel," like HBO or Showtime.
As Mr. Cox sees it, any move toward tiering channels jeopardizes those that are not intrinsically linked to a program theme (like ESPN and sports) or a specialized audience (like MTV and teen-agers).
"The Lifetimes and the Arts & Entertainments of the cable world have been extraordinarily lucky because they have basically hidden in the weeds," Mr. Cox said.
If these channels were ever placed in a price tier above the more popular basic channels, Mr. Cox said, they could be vulnerable.
But all the channels are vulnerable to an explosion in the cost of programming. Part of the reason for that explosion: what Mr. Masters called a "feeding frenzy" among the cable channels for programs. "You have everybody vying for old network sitcoms," he said. "That drives up the price for everybody."
In order to try to protect their franchises from looking too much like others, channels increasingly want to produce original programs. But these are even more expensive and further drive down profit margins.
 
'That Hits the Bottom Line'
 Then, Mr. Masters said, there is the need for channels on a heavily crowded dial to spend much more in marketing to try to make an impression on viewers, or to maintain the ones they have. "Again, that hits the bottom line," he said.
Clearly, that is another problem that will be far worse for newcomers. "I feel very fortunate that our company was in the first wave," Mr. Sassa of Turner Entertainment said. "In a 50- to 60- to 150-channel environment, how do you tell people you exist? How does 'E' tell people it exists?"
Most cable executives, who have depended on change to provide an opportunity to take viewers from the broadcast networks, realize with some chagrin that change now has the potential to undermine them.
But, Mr. Sassa said: "We have to accept that television is an evolving medium. We've seen it change in our lifetimes from sociology, from technology. It's up to us as programmers to continue to find our own edge."

HEADLINE: A Sea of Doubt Swells Around Bush's Education Plan

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DENVER, July 19

 BODY:
Three months after President Bush staked his claim to be the "education President" by unveiling an ambitious plan to transform American schools, his strategy is coming under increasing fire.
Within the last two weeks, the presidents of the country's two major teachers' unions have sharply attacked his plan after earlier praising it. A committee of business leaders assembled to raise money to build innovative model schools is reportedly facing tough going in the recession. 
 And both here at a major education conference and elsewhere around the country, many educators are beginning to question whether the President's strategy will actually produce widespread, fundamental changes. Past reforms, they note, have not had trouble creating model programs to serve as points of light. The open question is whether most of the country's 110,000 schools will be ablaze, or whether only a few candles will flicker in the dark.
Many temper their criticism with praise for the President's commitment to keep education in the spotlight. Congress is moving quickly toward action on some of his proposals. And President Bush's highly regarded new education team is fanning out across the country to sell his plan to the important constituency outside Washington and education circles.
 
Arousing the Populace
 The "America 2000" strategy that the President announced April 18 relies primarily on such populist outsider forces to turn around America's ailing schools. He asked each community to realize that the problem lies with its own schools and its own children. To set high standards and measure progress, he proposed a system of national tests to show for the first time how students and schools ranked across the country.
He charged business leaders to raise about $150 million to help create "new American schools" to serve as models of excellence. To prod reluctant schools to change, he proposed vouchers, allowing Federal money to follow children to whatever school they choose, whether public, parochial or private.
Although most educators and union leaders heaped praise on the initial announcement, the tone has turned decidedly combative in recent weeks. Several educators here in Denver made acid comments about the plan at the annual meeting of the Education Commission of the States, a policy body primarily serving governors and state legislators. Both Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association, blasted the plan in recent speeches.
The President's endorsement of open school selection and private school vouchers is political dynamite, stirring both ardent supporters and detractors. It was their belief that the choice option was the heart of the President's agenda, the union leaders said, that changed their minds about his plan.
 
Picking a Fight
 "If they want to pick a fight, they've picked one," Mr. Shanker said of the choice issue. "This is a terrible tactical error. If they don't find a way to get off this, it will destroy the program."
While the choice proposal has drawn the most strident comments, education and business leaders are also expressing reservations about other parts of the plan. The most fundamental problem, they say, is that the President has not shown how his plan will lead to broad-based, systemic change.
Here in Denver and in a collection of articles by 30 prominent education experts just published by the William T. Grant Foundation and the Washington-based Institute for Educational Leadership, educators outlined what they saw as glaring omissions. The plan offers no new money or strategy to combat poverty, they said, despite its widely recognized link to school failure. It does not directly reach out to the very people who will implement change, teachers and principals, and few details have emerged on several crucial points, like national testing.
Lamar Alexander, the new Secretary of Education, is unperturbed by the storm. "It doesn't bother me one bit -- the debate is engaged," he said.
It is far too early to tell whether the growing furor will scuttle the plan or just widen the debate. The President's supporters remain confident, but they are wary about union opposition.
"There was a kind of honeymoon period that's clearly over, but I don't think the marriage is on the rocks," said Chester E. Finn Jr., a leading architect of the plan. "The education community, on the whole, is behaving about the way I expected it to: 'Things are O.K. the way they are; send money.' But if this educator resistance extends in a big way to blocking state and local change, then it's much more damaging if it cannot be overcome."
Unions do wield considerable power, particularly at the state and local levels, which pay more than 90 percent of educational costs and where reforms are won or lost, Mr. Finn said.
But Mr. Alexander is still able to draw on a considerable reservoir of good will, and many educators continue to praise Mr. Bush, who they say is the first President to make education a truly national issue. Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, says his colleagues are eager to work with Mr. Alexander and to address issues of concern. Congress, too, is moving quickly on the President's proposal. A bill based on the plan is likely to move to the Senate floor soon after the summer recess, with many of the President's ideas intact except for the provisions on private school vouchers, a Senate Democratic aide said.
 
Alexander as Crusader
 The real test of the strategy, Mr. Alexander and Mr. Finn said, will be how it sells outside Washington. "On the surface, it may look reasonably quiet this summer, but I've only been here four months," Mr. Alexander said. "What we will be spending our time doing is trying to create this framework for a crusade, for a populist movement."
So far, Mr. Alexander and his deputy, David T. Kearns, the former chairman of Xerox, have traveled to a few states that have pledged to become "America 2000" communities by encouraging all citizens to work for better education. It is unclear whether this is a stirring public-relations exercise or the preface to real change, but Mr. Alexander, a canny politician and coalition builder, reports good ratings from the hustings.
Back in Washington, however, he faces a more skeptical audience. Letting Federal money follow each child to the school of choice remains the sticking point, not only among union leaders but also among some business groups. Both the Business Roundtable and the National Alliance of Business expressed tepid support at best of the idea in recent position statements.
"There are those who believe that choice is the only thing we need to do, an ideological panacea," said William A. Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business. "We do not believe that. Our attitude at this stage is that choice needs to have a lot more experimentation done."
 
Avoiding Testing's Pitfalls
 While the proposal for national testing is the sketchiest at this point, it is already stirring as many passions as the proposal on choice. A National Council on Standards and Testing has begun to debate concerns raised by many critics -- how to draw up what will be in effect a national curriculum for the first time in America's history, how to make sure tests are used to enforce high standards without dooming the futures of those who fail them, and how to avoid charges that tests are biased against minority students.
Mr. Bush's proposal for "new American schools," and his decision to ask business leaders to raise money for their design, is also drawing criticism. Several educators here mentioned similar projects in the 1960's that created isolated model schools but did not change most schools.
Many educators wondered why it was necessary to pay for design teams when many other models for creating schools that excel are already up and running -- for example, James Comer's work in New Haven or Theodore R. Sizer's Coalition of Essential Schools. Many members of Congress, a Senate Democratic aide said, worry that the design teams will overlook the needs of inner-city schools.
Several educators in Denver who attended the National Alliance of Business's recent meeting reported concern among business leaders about raising $150 million in a recession. Moreover, some fear that businesses will simply switch financing from ongoing projects.
 
The Big Enemy: Poverty
 "It's not going to be a new pool of money," said Michael D. Usdan, president of the Institute for Educational Leadership. "Is it going to dry up other local and state initiatives?"
Mr. Alexander dismisses such concerns, saying the fund-raising group has already raised $30 million. The schools will work, he says, because they will engage whole communities for the first time in thinking about how children should be educated.
In the end, many educators believe, the strategy's ambitious agenda will fail unless it includes steps to fight poverty. At the very least, several educators said, President Bush could have moved more quickly to make preschool programs like Headstart available to every eligible child.

HEADLINE: JORDANIANS AGREE TO JOIN IN TALKS ON MIDEAST PEACE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 21

 BODY:
Jordan joined Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia today in agreeing to attend a regional peace conference proposed by the United States. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel, however, told the visiting American Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, that he wanted more time to consider the matter.
King Hussein said, "We are ready to attend a peace conference, and we are very happy indeed it is going to be a comprehensive one." The Jordanian ruler spoke at a news conference with Mr. Baker after their talks in Amman, Jordan's capital.
Until now, Jordan has wavered on accepting the American proposal, waiting to see if Syria would.
 
5 Acceptances in His Pocket
 Mr. Baker, armed with commitments from the five Arab countries to take part in a conference that would open the way for direct negotiations with Israel, flew here from Amman to try to persuade Mr. Shamir to drop his opposition to the proposed peace talks.
The Israeli Government, though, seemed shocked -- confronted by Mr. Baker after he obtained, over three days, commitments from the Arabs to take part in the conference and in subsequent direct talks.
Jordan also joined Saudi Arabia and Egypt in offering to suspend the Arab economic boycott of Israel if it will suspend the building of settlements in the occupied lands. And President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, again suggested that Israel halt settlement building on the West Bank.
The Israeli public appears skeptical about the latest round of American diplomacy, tempering hope with caution. [Page A6.]
 
Deadline or No Deadline
 Mr. Baker denied that he had set a deadline for an Israeli response on peace talks, but American officials say it is possible that when President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Moscow on July 30 and 31, they will issue invitations to the conference -- as its joint sponsors -- whether the Israelis have responded positively or not. Such a move would put Israel under even greater pressure to attend.
"We have always indicated that that would be something we might pursue," said Mr. Baker, when asked whether invitations would soon be sent. "Of course, it would be much better, if there is going to be a conference, if everybody could sign on before invitations are issued."
Senior Israeli officials said they had no idea what Mr. Shamir was going to do, and the Israeli Prime Minister was saying nothing.
Mr. Shamir's dilemma, though, is clear. If he says yes to Mr. Baker, his fragile coalition Government is likely to collapse and he will be challenged by members of his own rightist Likud bloc. If he says no, he risks alienating Israel from the United States, and from much of the rest of the world.
Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir alone for 90 minutes. The meeting was taken up almost entirely with a review of the essence of the letter that President Hafez al-Assad of Syria sent to Mr. Bush a week ago. In that letter, the Syrian leader is said to have committed his Government to take part in the peace conference and subsequent direct talks.
The Israelis have been deeply suspicious that Washington and Damascus struck some sort of deal. American officials said that Mr. Baker, without actually showing Mr. Shamir the Assad letter, had briefed him both on its contents and on the side assurances that the United States had provided the Syrians.
 
What U.S. Would Do for Syria
 Those side assurances mostly involve restatements of American policy: that the United States does not recognize the Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights; that it believes that United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, calling on Israel to exchange land for peace, applies to the Golan Heights as well as to the West Bank, and that the United States is committed to pushing any peace negotiations actively, so as not to allow delays.
Mr. Shamir asked Mr. Baker for more time to consider the matter, and the two men will be meeting again on Monday. "We are not under any pressure to give an answer soon," the Prime Minister's spokesman, Avi Pazner, said. "The problem is content, not deadlines."
Before Mr. Baker met with Mr. Shamir, he held talks with three West Bank Palestinian leaders, led by Faisal al-Husseini, and made it clear to them that they, too, had to make some hard decisions. American officials said it was a tough, and at times emotional, encounter in which the Palestinians were essentially told that as the weakest party in the equation, they would have to accept previously unpalatable political realities.
One of those is that the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasir Arafat, can have no direct involvement with their delegation to the peace conference, since that would prompt the Israelis to walk out immediately.
The other is that no Palestinians from East Jerusalem can take part in the first stage of the negotiations. The Israelis have ruled this out, arguing that such a role would imply that East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed, was negotiable.
But it is possible that the second restriction might be finessed if there is a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and Palestinians born in Jerusalem take part with Jordanian passports.
Despite those restrictions, the Palestinian leaders were told that they would soon have to come up with a list of acceptable representatives, American officials said.
An intriguing thing about the endorsements that Mr. Baker has won from the Arab countries is that the Arab leaders all say in public that they are ready to accept Mr. Bush's proposal to attend "a peace conference" to reach a "comprehensive solution" based on Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. But none of them ever mentions that this conference is intended as a ceremonial opening event for direct Arab-Israeli talks.
American officials insist that the Arab leaders have privately assured them that they understand this, but do not now want to say it publicly for fear of alienating their own hard-liners. Each one, instead, allows Mr. Baker to say it for him.
Thus, when reporters asked King Hussein today if he would say in public that he was committed to direct talks with Israel, he was not pleased.
Looking a bit flummoxed, the King replied, "This is about the most ridiculous question I have ever heard."
If it is so simple, the reporters persisted, why not give just a simple answer?
"What do you attend a conference to do?" the King retorted. "To mime? To make faces at each other, or to discuss and try to resolve the problem? I have been calling for this for years and years. I assure you that this is really the intention, and it is very, very clear."
As the journalists continued to press the King to say the words "direct bilateral talks with Israel," he declared the news conference over and walked out with Mr. Baker.

BUSH REITERATES VIEW
 ISTANBUL, Turkey, July 21 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Bush, on a visit to Turkey, suggested once again today that Israel should be flexible for the sake of peace in the Middle East and halt settlement building on the West Bank.
"The question of settlements has been important," Mr. Bush said, in response to a reporter's question at a meeting here today with Turkish opposition leaders. "I haven't encountered anybody in this part of the world that thinks increasing settlements is a helpful thing. And the United States policy has been opposed to it for years."
The President also said he did not want to use a "volatile" word like pressure in talking about his stance with the Israelis. He preferred to call it "reasoning and taking this -- what I keep calling a new credibility for the United States in the Middle East -- and using that to encourage what is a very reasonable and important step to peace."

HEADLINE: American and T.W.A. Plan a Competing Bid for Pan Am

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines and American Airlines plan to make an offer today for much of Pan American World Airways, challenging Pan Am's agreement to sell most of its assets to Delta.
People involved in planning the offer said yesterday that T.W.A. and American wanted to divide up much of the bankrupt carrier. 
 Under the expected offer, the two airlines would pay Pan Am $310 million, with American would putting up $250 million and receiving the East Coast shuttle and Pan Am's routes between the United States and Italy, Spain and Portugal. T.W.A would pay $60 million for Pan Am's large Frankfurt operation and routes between London and Miami and Detroit.
Earlier this month, Pan Am accepted an offer from Delta Air Lines, agreeing to sell its African, Asian and European routes, the Boston-New York-Washington shuttle and 45 planes for $260 million.
Because Pan Am is in bankruptcy, that deal is subject to the approval of the Federal bankruptcy court. If competing offers or a bidding war emerge, the court has the power to choose among the various proposals.
"We are really beginning to see some competitive bidding, which will help establish the realistic levels at which these properties should be sold," said Paul Turk of Avmark Inc., an airline consulting company in Arlington, Va., that is advising Pan Am's unsecured creditors about the value of the company's assets. "I don't know what those levels are, but we haven't seen them yet."
 
A Blow to Delta's Ambitions

Delta sought its deal to gain a leg up in its competition with American and United Airlines, the nation's two largest carriers. In making this offer with T.W.A., American is clearly trying to deal a knockout blow to Delta's ambitions.
T.W.A. also plans to invest an additional $140 million in Pan Am's remaining operations, which are largely in Latin America.
But T.W.A. has had substantial financial problems of its own, and its chairman, Carl C. Icahn, has said the airline might be forced to file for bankruptcy protection. T.W.A.'s debt is estimated to be $1.37 billion, and it has defaulted on about $200 million in principal and interest and withheld payment on equipment leases.
Asked about the expected offer, John Hotard, a spokesman for American Airlines, said last night, "Our corporate policy is not to comment on any possible mergers or acquisitions."
At Delta, Neil A. Monroe, the director of public relations, said he could not say whether Delta would increase its offer for Pan Am's routes. But he said the T.W.A.-American offer did not come as a surprise.
"We have an excellent package in place that we feel is very fair," he said.
Pan Am has repeatedly said that a primary objective in coming out of bankruptcy is protecting its employees. The people involved in planning the T.W.A.-American offer, who insisted on anonymity, said their proposal would save the jobs of about 10,000 Pan Am employees, 4,000 more than the Delta bid. Mr. Monroe of Delta questioned whether that expectation was reasonable.
On Friday Northwest Airline bid for one route included in the Delta package, and Pan Am responded that it considered the route sold to Delta.
 
A Return to London
 John V. Pincavage, a partner in the the Transportation Group Ltd., a New York-based investment company, observed, "The offer gives American the things they want, it gives T.W.A. the things they want, and it lets Pan Am exist and get reorganized and save a lot of jobs."
T.W.A. and American have forged a number of links in recent months. American recently bought T.W.A.'s lucrative routes between London and the United States, and the two airlines agreed to mesh their frequent-flier programs.
The proposed deal with Pan Am would put T.W.A. back into business in London, and Pan Am would feed passengers into the London routes that would be acquired by T.W.A.
T.W.A. would also take over Pan Am's hub in Frankfurt, which would allow it to regain a strong European and international presence. In addition, T.W.A. would take over Pan Am's Eastern European routes, which are likely to gain value with the region's switch to free markets, as well as additional landing slots at La Guardia Airport and Kennedy International Airport in New York, and at Washington National Airport. It would also get some Pan Am aircraft, engines and ground equipment.
Mr. Pincavage said heavy government regulation has prevented American from opening routes to Italy, which it has wanted to do for some time. "The only way to get into the market is to buy your way in on somebody else's routes," he said.
 
A Focus on Miami

If American and T.W.A. could acquire the Pan Am assets they seek, Pan Am would be left with its routes to Central and South America out of its Miami hub, its only profitable operations.
T.W.A., and possibly some outside investors who were not identified, are expected to invest $140 million in equity to reorganize Pan Am and would also provide a line of credit to finance Pan Am's operations. Equity in the reorganized company would be owned by Pan Am's creditors, T.W.A. and any outside investors.
Pan Am and T.W.A. would coordinate their business operations, a strategy that has been sought by both carriers in the past.
Delta has made a similar offer to invest in Pan Am that would enable Pan Am to continue its Latin American operations, and a Delta spokesman said that offer was contingent on the completion of the purchase agreement.
In an offer that analysts estimated at $200 million to $300 million, United sought to buy the Latin American routes, which had operating revenues of $736 million in 1990, a 14 percent increase from 1989. But it was rebuffed by Pan Am's creditors, who said the offer was too low.
Delta Air Lines, based in Atlanta, is the nation's third-largest carrier, behind American and United. Through its deal with Pan Am, it hopes to join the handful of carriers with vast international route networks that are expected to dominate the industry in the next decade.
 
Behind the Shuttle Deal

Its acquisition of the shuttle, which Pan Am acquired from New York Air in 1986 for $76 million, would make Delta a much greater threat to the smaller carriers that now operate in the Northeast market. These include Northwest Airlines, which is in the process of buying the competing Trump Shuttle, and Continental Airlines.
Delta said it would offer jobs to about 6,000 of Pan Am's 22,000 workers, most of whom are expected to be workers overseas, at the other end of the international routes.
Analysts had called the $260 million price a great bargain for Delta and had speculated that other bidders might emerge. Northwest's bid on Friday was $20 million for Pan Am's Detroit-London route, or $35 million for that route and another between Los Angeles and Mexico City.
Mr. Turk, representing the Pan Am creditors, and other industry watchers said T.W.A. and American might be making a nuisance bid to drive up the cost of acquiring Pan Am. While American has wanted routes in Italy for some time, it also has an interest in preventing Delta from gaining strength.
"While they aren't worried about T.W.A. and Pan Am, they don't want United or Delta to get these assets without paying a high price for them," Mr. Turk said.
Analysts said that in agreeing to the deal with Delta, Thomas G. Plaskett, the chairman of the Pan Am Corporation, was trying to carry out an orderly liquidation of the airline to avoid a hasty fire sale after the carrier ran out of cash later this year.
 
Hurt by Deregulation

Unable to compete after the industry was deregulated in 1978, Pan Am was forced to sell assets including its headquarters building above Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, its Pacific routes and its London routes to raise case to keep flying.
Pan Am's bankruptcy is being overseen in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York by Judge Cornelius Blackshear.
Any deal also requires the approval of Pan Am's creditors and the boards of the purchasing airlines. And it would be subject to approval by the Transportation Department and various European governments.
The Europeans are expected to be tough in the negotiations since they will demand new rights for their carriers serving the United States in return for allowing powerful carriers like Delta or American into their countries.
Founded in 1927, Pan Am grew and thrived when the industry was highly regulated; it dominated the market for international travel and seemed to some people to be the quasi-official United States carrier. It inaugurated service across the Pacific, ordered the first Boeing 747 and was widely known for its Clipper service. But it faltered under the pressures of deregulation. And in the last year it has been devastated by the decline in international traffic caused by the Persian Gulf war and the recession. Its operating costs soared as fuel prices doubled.

HEADLINE: C'mon Connecticut, Try It

 BODY:
Three weeks into the new fiscal year, Connecticut still has no budget. The General Assembly can't muster the courage to enact one with an income tax, or the votes to override Gov. Lowell Weicker's veto of the alternative, which would maintain the state's high sales tax.
Enough already. It's time to experiment. 
 An experiment is just what the Governor proposed last week. On television in prime time -- pre-empting "Jeopardy" and other taxpayer favorites -- he said he would accept an income tax that expired automatically at the end of 1993. It would be a test to see if the new tax flies. To make the tax permanent, the Assembly would have to vote again, and approval would require a 60 percent majority.
The offer was brave, smart and fair. It would give people a chance to feel the effect of a modest tax on their wages, salaries and other income, offset by sharp cuts in the 8 percent sales tax as well as in the current taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains. If they didn't like it, little would have been lost. The unwanted tax on wages and salaries would self-destruct on Jan. 1, 1994, and people could go back to paying the extra 8 percent on nearly everything they buy -- the highest of any state sales tax -- and the even higher taxes on unearned income.
So why not give it a try?
Granted, while the Weicker plan reduces the burden on lower-income taxpayers, it would tax upper-income families more heavily. Granted also, the very thought of becoming an income-tax state, after years as a no-income-tax haven, is unnerving.
The politicians blocking the change are saying, in effect, it's better to run the state badly. Reliance on a sales tax is careless and cruel; it yields erratic revenue, depending on economic conditions, and at all times it penalizes the poor, socking them for the same 8 percent as the rich.
The obstructing politicians are most of the Republicans in both houses, and the Senate Democratic leadership, all of whom would like to see Mr. Weicker in retirement. But they may well find themselves in retirement if Connecticut's voters tire of their dawdling.

HEADLINE: Bush Lifted South Africa Sanctions Too Soon

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush's decision to lift South African sanctions (front page, July 11) ignores compelling evidence that the South African Government is pursuing a double agenda -- freeing Nelson Mandela, unbanning the anti-apartheid opposition and dismantling much of apartheid's legal structure, but at the same time orchestrating violence against its chief rival, the African National Congress. While Americans want to believe that the South African Government is unequivocally ending apartheid, the following evidence of government-sponsored violence should not have been ignored. 
 Africa Watch, the American human-rights organization, finds that during last year's township conflicts in Natal between the A.N.C. and Inkatha, South African security forces repeatedly joined with Inkatha against the A.N.C., and transported Inkatha vigilantes in police vehicles, standing by while Inkatha attacked, and intervening only to stop A.N.C. supporters from defending themselves. Almost without exception, independent journalists report similar security force support for anti-A.N.C. violence this year in the Transvaal.
Lawyers for Human Rights, a respected South African human-rights group, has documented that former South African military officers are using black surrogates to attack the A.N.C. from the Ciskei homeland in the Eastern Cape. The anti-apartheid newspaper New Nation reports similar activities in the Gazankulu homeland in the far northern Transvaal.
A former South African intelligence officer, Maj. Nico Basson, has described a secret government operation to supply AK-47 submachine guns to Inkatha and to organize attacks on the A.N.C. According to Mr. Basson, South African security forces use black surrogates, such as Inkatha and other vigilante groups, to create the false impression that attacks on the A.N.C. are so-called "black on black violence," rather than planned and coordinated by security forces.
Undercover police have assassinated dozens of anti-apartheid activists, according to a former South African police captain, Dirk Coetzee. The Afrikaans language newspaper Vrye Weekblad printed Mr. Coetzee's allegations that a senior police official, Gen. Lothar Neethling, prepared poisons for government opponents. After General Neethling sued the newspaper for libel, a South African judge pronounced him a liar for denying the allegations and pronounced Mr. Coetzee a truthful witness.
A few months later, a sophisticated letter bomb addressed to Mr. Coetzee exploded and killed a South African human-rights lawyer. Africa Watch has concluded that the evidence fully warrants "findings that death squads have been supported by both the South African police and the South African Defense Force."
President F. W. de Klerk resists an independent investigation of the security forces, preferring that inquiries be supervised by National Party loyalists. Defense Minister Magnus Malan and International Security Minister Adrian Vlok deny that security forces have acted improperly. While rogue units in the South African security establishment could be responsible for anti-A.N.C. violence, it is difficult to believe this occurs without the knowledge of Mr. de Klerk, Mr. Malan or Mr. Vlok.
Among conditions imposed for lifting sanctions by the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act are that the South African Government permit free exercise of political activity and negotiate in good faith for a new constitution. The inaction and defensiveness of South Africa's three most powerful government officials on security force violence raises a serious question about compliance. Can a government that condones security force violence, including death squads, against its chief political opposition be said to permit free exercise of political activity or to negotiate in good faith.

HEADLINE: Bush Lifted South Africa Sanctions Too Soon;
Time to Move On

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"South African Sanctions: Go Slow" (editorial, July 5) asserts that sanctions were a factor, among many others, in stimulating change in South Africa, though not in my view the most important. I believe the efforts of the black people of South Africa and the recent initiatives of President F. W. de Klerk are the foremost reasons for change in South Africa. 
 As a Liberal opposition member of the South African Parliament, who has always opposed apartheid, I have been privileged to be involved in the dramatic changes that have taken place in my country. There can be no doubt that the Government is committed to implementing a democratic system, leaving behind the immoral, outdated, even evil apartheid empire.
Likewise, there can be no doubt that all but one of the five conditions in the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986 for lifting sanctions, have been met. The single outstanding condition (release of all political prisoners) may well be met by the time this letter is published.
This cannot and should not mean that people who have been incarcerated as a result of common law crimes such as murder, rape or robbery should be released.
While I can appreciate your desire to be even-handed and to resolve reasonable doubts about the conditions, I am disappointed that you have suggested a go-slow.
The South African economy is in a perilous state brought on in part by the Congressional sanctions. Unemployment among South Africa's economically active stands at more than 40 percent. Economic growth is at zero, while the population is growing at 2.8 percent. Inflation is more than 15 percent. There is a massive housing shortage and education crisis.
Sanctions have outlived their useful purpose as the change is irreversible, and America should focus attention on assisting South Africa to achieve a growing economy to help particularly those people who were disadvantaged as the result of apartheid.
It may be added that independent opinion polls have indicated that the majority of black people in South Africa are opposed to the continuation of sanctions.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Balk on I.M.F. Funds

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 21

 BODY:
A request by the Administration to give $12 billion to the International Monetary Fund has run into trouble in Congress.
What initially appeared to be a routine request for an increase in the money that the I.M.F. has available to lend to countries facing trade problems has become an increasingly partisan issue. Democrats are objecting to the Administration's handling of the request, and they are also unhappy at the I.M.F.'s resistance to making its loans conditional on environmental preservation programs and efforts to alleviate poverty. 
 The House has sent the Senate an appropriations bill that includes no money for the I.M.F. The chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Foreign Operations, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said he was reluctant to add the money in the Senate version of the bill because the fund had not done enough to acknowledge a 1989 law requiring the Treasury Secretary to press the I.M.F. to pay more attention to the environment.
"The I.M.F. kind of treats it with an Olympian disregard, that mere mortals at the United States Senate couldn't possibly understand all the decisions they have to make," Mr. Leahy said in an interview. "We mere mortals, however, can't understand why they need all that money."
 
Avoiding the Politics
 The fund itself has stayed out of the political dispute in the United States. An official of the fund who insisted on anonymity pointed out that some previous capital requests by the agency had been addressed through separate legislation rather than in appropriations bills. But other fund officials express concern that the capital increase may not be approved at all.
The Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, and David C. Mulford, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, have lobbied Congress on behalf of the bill. "We think it's absolutely critical," particularly because of the I.M.F.'s current program to help Eastern Europe, said a Treasury official who insisted on anonymity.
Political games of chicken also occured the last two times Congress considered increases in the I.M.F.'s capital base, in 1981 and 1983. Democrats ended up supporting the Administration both times, first to help third world countries struggling with high oil prices and then as a response to the third world debt crisis.
 
Concerns Hard to Address
 The Democrats' stated concerns this year are hard for the agency to address.
The I.M.F.'s sister institution, the World Bank, has traditionally lent money for specific projects, particularly for the alleviation of poverty, while the I.M.F. has largely confined itself to dealing with broad national economic policies.
The conditions the fund attaches to aid are designed to promote financial stability and long-term economic growth and typically call for currency devaluations, increased exports, the elimination of subsidies and other cutbacks in government spending. But the conditions can temporarily put many people out of work, wipe out government-run environmental programs and increase the pressure for harvests of timber and other natural resources to export.
The currently proposed increase would raise the agency's base to $180 billion, from $120 billion, with the United States providing a fifth of the increase, a share based largely on the size of the American economy as a fraction of the world's economy.
 
Not Part of Deficit
 The $12 billion United States contribution is not counted directly as part of the Federal budget deficit because it goes into a special Government account from which the I.M.F. may only withdraw money as needed. The I.M.F. also pays interest on any money withdrawn.
But the I.M.F.'s use of this account has resulted in an annual loss in recent years for the United States because of exchange-rate fluctuations. This loss, forecast at $800 million in the coming year, is included in the budget deficit.
Some Democratic lawmakers have been leery of supporting the I.M.F. since 1982, when a Republican group encouraged candidates to accuse Democratic supporters of the I.M.F. of supporting an institution that lends money to Communist countries. The Democratic lawmakers had voted for the money at the request of President Reagan, and insisted on a public letter from the President before backing the next increase in 1983.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, asked for a similar letter this year from President Bush but has not received it.
Mr. Obey said that the possibility of the I.M.F.'s request not being granted this year, "doesn't give me an ounce of sweat."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 29, 1991, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Monday about a proposed United States contribution to the International Monetary Fund referred incorrectly to the effect of exchange-rate fluctuations on past contributions and also to a forecast of the effect this year. Since 1986, the fluctuations have on average produced a surplus, not a loss. The Government has not determined the effect of the fluctuations in 1991.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A Weak Quarter Seen at Oil Giants

BYLINE: By Thomas C. Hayes

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
AS big oil companies release earnings reports in the next two weeks, most will post lower profits for the second quarter. Analysts say that despite higher oil prices, compared with the spring quarter of 1990, too many other parts in the long chain of the energy business fared poorly.
 "Most of the major oils will have down quarters," said Bryan Jacoboski, oil analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in New York. "The comparisons are going to be ugly." 
But many analysts see various factors giving oil stocks a lift, relative to the broad market, in the months ahead. The oil industry has underperformed the broader market this year, but many analysts believe that as the recession eases, oil stocks will recover and actually outpace the market as a whole.
 The recession produced a weak quarter for the refining and chemical business. Natural gas prices in the United States, still reeling from an unusually warm winter and huge supplies, plunged by the end of June to the lowest level in more than 15 years: to $1.07 per 1,000 cubic feet in the Gulf of Mexico, the bellwether area.
 And a price war among gasoline marketers in the West, normally the region with the fattest profit margins for gasoline sales, erased most profits in that part of the industry for the main competitors: ARCO, Chevron and Unocal. Analysts said overall operating profits for those companies fell an estimated 50 percent or more in the quarter, excluding special charges from write-offs or gains from asset sales.
 Most analysts agree that only the Exxon Corporation, the largest of the major oil companies, had a higher operating profit for the quarter, compared with a year earlier. Exxon, which reported the highest quarterly profit in its history in the first quarter, has more of its refining and oil business outside the United States, where profit margins were wider in the second quarter.
Oil production generally was the only bright spot for the diversified oil giants in the spring quarter. Prices were a few dollars a barrel higher than in the spring of 1990, averaging more than $20 a barrel. Analysts had expected a global oil glut to develop after the war in the Persian Gulf, and some had predicted that prices would slide to less than $15 a barrel.
 They were wrong, for several reasons. Production in the Soviet Union continued to fall. Iraq's output was limited to 350,000 barrels a day. And Kuwaiti production is not expected to reach its daily quota of 1.5 million barrels before early 1993.
 In the United States, a glut developed in refined petroleum products. Kenneth Miller, senior principal at Purvin & Gertz, refinery consultants in Houston, said demand for gasoline, fuel oil, jet fuel and other refined products fell 2.7 percent in the second quarter, compared with the quarter in 1990, following a 3.5 percent drop in the first quarter.
 Michael L. Mayer, of Wertheim Schroder in San Francisco, estimated that Mobil's earnings slipped to 95 cents a share, from $1.01 in the period a year earlier; that Amoco fell to 70 cents, from 76 cents; that Texaco declined to 95 cents, from $1.26; that ARCO plummeted to $1.35, from $2.33, and that Chevron dropped to 85 cents, from $1.67.
 Analysts expect profits for both the third and fourth quarters to be lower than in 1990 for most of the large oil companies. In 1990, oil prices soared to a peak of $40 a barrel in the futures market in October, and for many companies the price averaged nearly $30. Prices in the last half of 1991 will range between $22 and $24 a barrel, analysts said.
 The outlook for lower oil revenues helped put the brakes on oil stocks through the spring and early summer. Industry stock values lagged gains in the broad market this year, and companies with operations mainly in the United States suffered most.
 The Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrial companies was up 18 percent through Friday, while stocks of the 15 largest energy companies based in the United States rose 5 percent.
 Shares of Exxon and the Mobil Corporation, two big international companies, rose 15 and 17 percent for the year, respectively. The stock of a rejuvenated Texaco Inc. climbed 8 percent. A broader sampling of companies with assets mainly in the United States showed 2 percent gains for the Chevron Corporation and the Phillips Petroleum Company, and gains of 1 percent for Amoco and ARCO.
 As a group, oil stocks showed some life last week, as investors reacted to renewed threats of military action against Iraq by the Bush Administration and some allies. Oil prices rose to the highest level since the gulf war, more than $22 a barrel.
 Some analysts see further gains ahead, saying the fundamentals of excessive supplies, weak prices and lower demand that worked against refining, marketing and chemical units in the first half will improve as the economy improves.
 Frank Knuettel of Prudential Securities in New York noted gasoline demand had picked up, prices in the slumping chemical sector had steadied and natural gas prices were certain to climb as seasonal demand rises after Labor Day.
 Shares of ARCO and Phillips Petroleum will be oil favorites as the recovery takes shape, said George F. Friesen, oil analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital in New York. He expects Phillips to benefit from improved natural gas prices and ARCO from higher gasoline profit margins. His buy recommendations also included Chevron, Mobil, Texaco and Royal Dutch Petroleum.
