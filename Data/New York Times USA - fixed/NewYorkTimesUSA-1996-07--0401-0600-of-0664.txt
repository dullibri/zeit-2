Interest Rates Cut by Canada

DATELINE: OTTAWA, July 19Reuters

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada cut key short-term interest rates today, citing a sluggish economy and an inflation rate near the bottom of the central bank's target range.
The cut, which surprised many investors, followed the release today of weaker-than-expected retail sales and inflation data. 
 The bank lowered its key bank rate -- the rough equivalent of the United States discount rate, the rate the Federal Reserve charges banks to borrow -- by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.75 percent.
The move lowered the target range for the overnight lending rate to 4.25 to 4.75 percent from 4.5 to 5 percent. Short-term rates have fallen 3.5 percentage points since the Bank of Canada began its easing cycle on May 8, 1995. The bank's last previous rate cut was on April 18.
The bank said it cut rates because sluggish demand in the economy meant downward pressure on the already low rate of inflation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off vs. Mark and Yen, Following Stocks Down Again

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against most leading currencies yesterday, hurt by a drop in the United States stock market and by speculation over higher Japanese interest rates.
While the drop in stocks yesterday was moderate, sharp declines earlier this week have caused currency traders to worry that foreign investors may be selling off United States assets and converting the proceeds into other currencies, which would reduce demand for dollars. 
 As a result, the United States stock market and the dollar have been "pretty tightly correlated this week," said Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group. "There's less correlation when the market's up than down."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 107.95 Japanese yen, down from 108.46 yen on Thursday. It was also trading at 1.4865 German marks, down from 1.4920 marks. The British pound settled at $1.5455, unchanged for the second consecutive day.
Throughout the trading day in New York, the dollar tracked the stock market closely. Against the yen, the dollar was hurt by speculation that the Bank of Japan would soon raise interest rates. Higher rates tend to make a nation's currency more valuable.
Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of international finance at the Japanese Ministry of Finance, did not rule out a rate increase as officials have recently. "I don't think we should take it as given," he said in comments published yesterday about the possibility of higher rates. Currency traders read his comments as leaving open a slight possibility of an increase in rates.
Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company, said Japanese officials in the last few days have been backing away from strict denials that rates would rise.
At the same time, currency traders are concerned that comments on Thursday by the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, suggested that a rise in United States interest rates would happen later than expected. While the prospect of higher rates has weakened the stock and bond markets, it has recently bolstered the dollar.
In other currency trading, the dollar fell to 1.2147 Swiss francs from 1.2198 Swiss francs and to 1,511 Italian lire, from 1,518 lire. The dollar rose to 5.0345 French francs from 5.0335 francs.

This Wine Has a Presidential Seal

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: ANILLACO, Argentina

 BODY:
With his four sons, Saul Menem, a poor Syrian immigrant who spoke little Spanish, started a small winery in this arid farming village in northwest Argentina 65 years ago.
It was an ambitious venture, undertaken mainly for personal consumption, because most Argentine wines were produced farther south, where the soil is richer and the climate more suitable for vineyards. 
 But Mr. Menem's vines took root, and his wine soon gained a following. As for his sons, Mr. Menem once said: "Amado is the worker, Munir is the administrator, Eduardo is the one who defends us, and Carlos is the one who enjoys the wine."
Today, Menem e Hijos S.A. (Menem & Sons) may not produce the best wines in Argentina, but its label is certainly among the best known. And sales of Menem wines have risen sharply in recent years mainly because of the son who showed the least interest in the business, Carlos Saul Menem, the President of Argentina.
Mr. Menem, who was elected to a second term last year, remains immensely popular in Argentina, and as his political fortunes have risen so have those of his family's winery.
Since Mr. Menem first took office in 1989, the Menem winery has seen its sales climb more than 60 percent, company officials said. Although the privately owned winery does not discuss its sales and profits, the officials said that the winery produced about a million bottles of wine last year making it a modest-sized winery here among the country's growing wine business and somewhere between a tiny boutique and a smallish winery in the United States.
"Its sales are rising because of the popularity of the family name," said Dereck Foster, a leading Argentine wine critic. "People who don't know a lot about wine are buying Menem wine because the name speaks to them."
"You can say a lot of bad things about the President, but you can't deny that he's bringing Argentina into the first world," Leopoldo Muzon, 43, owner of a video store, said, referring to Mr. Menem's success in stabilizing the Argentine economy. "I don't mind buying the wine of a man I respect."
It has also become chic to bring a bottle of Menem wine to dinner parties or to give a bottle to foreign visitors as a memento of Argentina. And some presidential aides said the wine was sometimes served at official Government functions and receptions, an assertion the Government would not confirm or deny.
For Maria Jose Chacon, 36, a lawyer, Menem wine turned out to be the perfect Christmas gift. "My best friend and I exchanged gag gifts at Christmas. She gave me an electronic head massager that she ordered from television. That was funny. I gave her a case of Menem red wine. That was hilarious."
And how does Menem wine taste? Mr. Foster, the wine critic, said that for a basic table wine, the Menem label was far superior to comparable inexpensive wines produced in Europe. A bottle of Menem wine ranges between $2 and $6.
"These cheap Argentine wines will beat the pants off anything in the same price category from France," Mr. Foster said. "Let me just say that if I were deprived of the higher-end wines, I would prefer to open a bottle of Menem wine before drinking much of the other stuff that's on the market."
Menem winery officials said they had worked hard recently to improve the quality of their wines by investing in new production and bottling technology. The winery has also built a new bottling plant in Anillaco and licensed its label to a producer in the southern wine-making province of Mendoza. Menem is also seeking to increase its exports, as is the rest of the Argentine industry.
Few people know that Argentina is the third-biggest producer of wine in the world, after Italy and France. It has more than 490,000 acres of vineyards and produces a wide variety of wines from different grapes, including chardonnay, sauvignon, bonarda and criolla.
Until recently, however, Argentina had done very little in the way of exporting and advertising its wines compared with Chile, which has become the No. 3 exporter of wine to the United States, after Italy and France.
But after investing heavily in new technology and international promotion campaigns in recent years, Argentina is starting to see results. Last year, foreign exports of wine increased almost 900 percent, to 59 million gallons, compared with 6 million in 1994, according to Argentina's National Wine Institute.

HEADLINE: Stirrings in Indonesia

 BODY:
Thirty years of military rule has stifled the political life of Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous country. Now, with President Suharto nearing the end of his sixth and possibly last term, open debate about the country's future and institutions is beginning to revive.
That is a trend Washington should encourage, and not just for idealistic reasons. Prolonged dictatorship has allowed corruption to flourish, leaving Indonesia without an independent legal system for resolving commercial disputes that sometimes involve American and other foreign companies. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current visit to Indonesia provides a timely opportunity to make clear where America stands. 
 The most notable challenge to Mr. Suharto has come from Megawati Sukarnoputri, whose father, Sukarno, ruled Indonesia from independence in 1945 until 1966. Ms. Megawati, elected in 1994 as head of one of Indonesia's two tame legal opposition parties, has tried to transform that party into a serious opposition force. Last month a Government-backed faction deposed her from the party leadership, depriving her of the platform from which she hoped to run for president in 1998. But she has vowed to fight on and is seeking reinstatement through the courts.
Whatever happens in Ms. Megawati's case, a return to enforced political passivity is unlikely. The Indonesia that General Suharto took over 30 years ago was desperately poor, exhausted by Sukarno's confrontational foreign policy and riven by tensions between soldiers, Muslims and a powerful pro-Beijing Communist Party.
The Suharto regime crushed the Communists in a bloody purge, imposed political order and gradually rebuilt the economy. Now, at the price of political liberty, Indonesia is one of Asia's emerging economic powers, with large new middle and working classes straining for a larger voice in their own affairs.
During the cold war, Washington too often overlooked the Suharto Government's repressive ways along with its forcible annexation and occupation of East Timor. Today a more forthright approach is needed.
America should stand behind the efforts of Indonesia's impressive network of independent civic organizations to smooth the transition toward a more democratic future. As Indonesia's second-largest trading partner and one of its largest sources of foreign investment, the United States could exert a significant positive influence.
The Clinton Administration has been understandably eager to increase American business involvement in booming Southeast Asia. But Washington should not pursue business promotion at the expense of efforts to encourage respect for labor standards, human rights and the environment. In Jakarta, Ambassador Stapleton Roy has set a good example by standing up to pressure from Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc., which wants Washington to withdraw financial support from a local environmental organization that has challenged the company's mining practices.
The Administration is right to pursue economic opportunities in Indonesia. But it best serves American values and longer-term business interests by supporting those Indonesians now pressing for increased democracy and human rights.

HEADLINE: Dow Jones and the Nikkei: Partners or Strangers in the Night?

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 19

 BODY:
For much of this week, the Tokyo stock market followed Wall Street on its roller-coaster ride. When stocks in New York plunged on Monday, they fell sharply in Tokyo on Tuesday. When Wall Street began to recover in the next two days, so did Tokyo.
Today, however, Tokyo went its own way. While the Dow Jones industrial average staged a strong rally on Thursday, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell 90.13 points today to close at 21,476.29. 
 Are the world's two largest stock markets fatally attracted or not?
Many analysts say that in the long run, movements of the two markets are not well correlated. Indeed, if the New York market hits new air pockets, it could make Japanese stocks an attractive alternative, especially as the Japanese economy has just begun recovering from a four-year slump while the American economy might be about to enter a downturn.
"People may now take another look at Japan and see it as a very attractive market," said Kevin Hebner, a strategist here at SBC Warburg Securities. "Our view is that the driver of the Japanese market is earnings momentum," not what happens in New York. The fall of stock prices here in response to Monday's plunge on Wall Street was "largely psychological and it's incorrect," he said.
One need only look at history. The day after the Dow fell 22.6 percent in the "Black Monday" crash of Oct. 19, 1987, the Tokyo market fell 14.9 percent. But the Nikkei average recovered to pass its pre-crash level by March 1988, while the Dow did not do that until mid-1989, said Ken Okamura, a strategist here at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
Conversely, in the last few years, as Wall Street has experienced the longest bull market in history, the Tokyo market has languished.
To be sure, there are some good reasons that market movements might be correlated, at least in the short run.
If high-technology companies in the United States are seeing poorer-than-expected earnings, their suppliers and competitors in Japan would also. If the American economy turns down, it would hurt Japan's economy as well. A sharp drop on Wall Street could also weaken the dollar against the yen, which would hurt Japanese exporters and thereby weaken stocks in Tokyo as well.
Another factor is that foreign investors have been aggressive buyers of stocks in Japan in the last year or so, buoying the market, while Japanese investors have sat on the sidelines. Indeed, foreigners owned 9.4 percent of all the shares on the Tokyo exchange in 1995, compared with only 3.6 percent in 1987.
Hence, if American and other foreign investors become wary of stocks, and if the American public stops pouring money into equity mutual funds, foreigners might pull out of Japanese stocks. Indeed, selling by foreigners appears to be behind some of the weakness in the Tokyo stock market this week.
Still, said Kathy Matsui, a vice president and strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd., "Relatively speaking, compared to Southeast Asia or Latin America, the Japanese market has tended to be more resilient to declines in the United States."
If Japan's market keeps going its own way, the case could be made for emphasizing Japanese stocks at the expense of American ones. While the Dow has fallen a bit from its all-time high, the Tokyo market is still well below its peak of about 39,000 in 1989. And the economic cycles are in different stages as well.
"The U.S. economy has continued its expansion for three to four years while the Japanese market has just started to show a rebound," said Kazuyuki Suzuki, assistant general manager of the equity division at Daiwa Securities.
Mr. Okamura of Kleinwort Benson expects the Nikkei average to reach 24,000 by the end of the year. Mr. Hebner of SBC Warburg expects to see 23,750 by then.
But there is reason for caution. The Tokyo market has been losing steam in recent weeks, a trend that started even before the first sharp drop occurred in New York on July 5.
The Tokyo market had been rebounding this year because of prospects for recovery and the weakening of the yen against the dollar.
But after peaking at 22,666.80 on June 26, the market has fallen 5 percent, partly on expectations that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates and on fears that the economic recovery will be mild. Upward revisions in earnings projections in the next few months could give new life to the market.
But without them, the Tokyo market might languish on its own, even if it is not dragged down by New York.

Spanish Companies in Crossfire of U.S.-Cuba Battle

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MADRID, July 19

 BODY:
Before Fidel Castro took over Cuba, Irenee du Pont Sr. owned a three-story beach house, a golf course and a private dock on the island's northern coast as a retreat from his family's Delaware chemical company.
Today, the Spanish-style home trimmed with mahogany stands in the midst of Cuba's most popular beach resort area, Varadero, and at least two of the 30 modern hotels there were built on land Mr. du Pont once owned, according to a Government official, a Spanish hotel executive and a report in Spain's largest daily, El Pais. 
 The Helms-Burton Act, which President Clinton signed in March, opens the way for the punishment of companies "deriving benefit" from American property that the Communist Castro regime has confiscated since the 1959 revolution. But two major Spanish hotel operators are staying put to protect their stakes in Cuba's growing tourist business.
"You can't just leave the day after making an investment," said Antonio Fernandez Casado, sales director for the Tryp hotel chain of Madrid, which has put $50 million into Cuba in the last few years and manages the former Havana Hilton and four other hotels. "We'll start to worry when you can't buy Coca-Cola and Winstons there."
Across Cuba, dozens of Canadian, European and Mexican companies, with investments ranging from mining to telephone service are taking a similar tack, while questioning whether they will ever be sued in United States court by American citizens claiming title to confiscated property in Cuba, as the Helms-Burton Act permits.
And further complicating such decisions, President Clinton announced an election-year compromise this week that delays any lawsuits until at least February 1997. He was torn between the potent Cuban-American voting blocs in Florida and New Jersey and the threats from outraged nations vowing to penalize American businesses in like measure if their own companies were hurt.
Yet Washington can still wield another part of Helms-Burton. This section prohibits foreign executives, controlling shareholders and their family members from entering the United States if their companies are in violation of Helms-Burton.
The American threats have been effective in some quarters. Two Madrid hotel companies, Occidental Hoteles and Paradores Nacionales, were just getting into Cuba but backed out. An Occidental spokeswoman said the decision had been made out of "respect for the American law."
But most of the 50 Spanish companies already in Cuba, from hotels to banks to tobacco companies, have not wavered, although it is not clear how many of them might be using confiscated property. The companies are attracted to Cuba mainly by low wages, but also by close ties between the two nations, even in the post-colonial era. Mr. Castro's father was born in Spain and immigrated to Cuba early in this century, seeking opportunity.
The first Spanish company expected to get a warning from Washington over Helms-Burton is the nation's largest hotel operator, Sol Melia S.A., of Palma de Mallorca, which had $1 billion in sales last year. It has 189 hotels in 25 countries, including 6 in Cuba totaling 2,100 rooms.
The company's luxury 340-room Hotel Melia Las Americas in the Varadero resort is next door to the old du Pont home, now a restaurant, and almost surely was built at least partly on former du Pont land, according to Mr. Fernandez of the rival Tryp chain, the report in El Pais and the Spanish Government official said.
The du Pont family had no comment on how its former property was being used at the beach resort, a family spokeswoman in Wilmington, Del., said.
The Du Pont Company, which had chemical interests in Cuba, issued a statement this week in response to President Clinton's announcement. The company said that "the global economy is dependent on reliable rules of trade and those rules would be jeopardized by the friction that would result," if the Helms-Burton Act took effect.
The Sol Melia chain said it was "not aware" if it was benefiting from confiscated property in Cuba but acknowledged that its hotels "could be located on land which is, or otherwise makes use of, confiscated property," according to the prospectus for the family-owned company's first offering of stock on July 2.
Despite the potential problems with Helms-Burton, Sol Melia's offering was oversubscribed 23 times, making it the most successful initial offering ever on the Madrid stock market. It raised $275 million for the company's expansion plans, which include two more hotels in Cuba and dozens more around the world.
Sol Melia has strongly hinted that it may drop its 271-room Sol Miami Beach hotel in Florida and remain in Cuba, where it is the biggest hotel operator, if the American law is fully applied. Cuba represented 7 percent of company revenue in 1995, compared with less than 1 percent for Florida, company spokesmen said.
Mr. Fernandez said the Helms-Burton Act was helping the more-established companies in Cuba by scaring off newcomers. Cuban-Americans are worried, he added, that some of the best deals on the island already have been locked up by non-American companies.
The new law, he said, was not just a political move against Castro but was also meant to slow European investment in Cuba.
Cuba has just 23,000 hotel rooms -- about the same number as in Madrid. Some 15,000 of the Cuban rooms are obsolete and below international standards, Mr. Fernandez added. With 1,200 miles of coastline, good weather almost all year and many still-pristine beaches, there is plenty of room for expansion.
Both the report in El Pais and the Government official said that another shareholder in the Hotel Melia Las Americas was the Sherritt International Corporation, a Toronto mining company whose executives have already been notified that they will not be allowed into the United States because of Sherritt's mining activities in Cuba.
Sherritt did not respond to telephone calls about its interest in the Varadero hotel.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Rubber Hits the Road;
Tire Makers Struggle to Stand Out From the Crowd

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
For the first nine years of its televised life, the Michelin baby did little but look cute as it frolicked around a tire. That was plenty: even competitors concede the cuddly tyke made Michelin's name synonymous with tire safety.
Last year, though, the baby began sharing center stage with products and technology. Dressed in safari garb, it watched a sport utility vehicle negotiate a rocky desert terrain -- the first Michelin baby ad that actually demonstrated how tough tires had become. In another commercial, the baby was dressed up as a scientist, and an adult voice-over explained Michelin's latest technology. 
 "We used to be secretive about technology," said Michael W. Cain, Michelin North America's technical-marketing manager. "But now we want to tell all about it."
Tire marketing, which used to seem as bland and predictable as, well, tires, is getting a lot more interesting. Companies that once simply touted the excellence of their tire lines now stress the strengths of specific tire technologies. And they are selecting distinct demographic groups as targets for each of their products, trying to differentiate not only, say, Bridgestone from Goodyear, but Bridgestone's Bridgestone brand from the company's Firestone brand.
It is no easy task. "People identify with their cars, but most of them can't even tell you what kind of tires they have," said Peter J. Tate, chief operating officer of DDB Needham New York, Michelin's advertising agency.
Apparently, the decades and dollars the tire companies have spent fine-tuning their products so that even the cheapest tires perform adequately have worked as much against them as for them. Consumers are now pretty certain that whatever they buy will be safe and durable. And, since they never found buying tires much fun to begin with, many of them simply lump tires together as those indistinguishable black things that their cars ride on.
"Judging by the questions we get, most people think a tire is a tire is a tire," said Kristen Karczewski, director of the Tire Industry Safety Council in Washington.
The inevitable result is that brand loyalty has given way to bargain hunting. According to Modern Tire Dealer, some 28 percent of replacement tires sold in this country are private label, and sell for far less than their branded equivalents.
"People who will spend $50 for a restaurant meal are still looking to get four tires for $100," said Saul H. Ludwig, an analyst with McDonald & Company Investments in Cleveland.
The bargain hunters are not necessarily misguided. Consumer Reports, in a lengthy guide to buying tires published in January, conceded that all of the tires scored were "impressive," and that "there wasn't all that much difference, over all, from the best to the worst tires."
Tire companies, of course, dispute that. But most concede that the perception of tires as a commodity product is their fault.
"Our industry has not made consumers understand how unique tires are," said David B. Murtaugh, manager of marketing communications for Michelin North America's Michelin brand in the United States. His competitors agree. "Tires are highly engineered products, but consumers just don't realize that," said Samir F. Gibara, who just succeeded the legendary marketer Stanley Gault as head of Goodyear Tire and Rubber.
Neither do investors. Tire company stocks trade as though tires were cyclical commodities like rubber or chemicals. Their performance generally trails the market. Goodyear's stock, for one, has dropped by more than 5 percent so far this year, while the Dow Jones industrials have advanced slightly more than 6 percent.
Now, the tire companies are trying to heighten the awareness level. Goodyear has blanketed the airwaves with ads for the Aquatred, its wet-weather tire. Michelin is pushing its X One's XSE Technology, which the company says provides wet traction without sacrificing long wear. Bridgestone/Firestone makes similar claims for its Potenza S-02, developed with the company's Uni-T group of technologies.
More than a soupcon of gimmickry has crept in. Goodyear and Bridgestone recently introduced tires with lifetime warranties, knowing full well that most cars are traded in well before their replacement tires wear out. "Consumers see a lifetime warranty as an indication of the manufacturer's confidence in its product," said Arthur J. Michalik, manager of Bridgestone Consumer Tires Marketing.
Michelin, in contrast, has opted for a six-year warranty, because "consumers find a finite warranty a lot more credible," Mr. Cain said.
But why is all this marketing savvy appearing now?
First off, tire research has yielded some gems. Just three decades ago most tires were held together with cotton cords and lasted less than 10,000 miles. But with the switch to steel-belted radial tires made of more durable rubber compounds, tires typically last five times as long.
Most tire companies have developed low-friction tread designs that make the engine work less to turn the wheels and thus promote fuel economy. Several have attacked the wet-weather skidding problem. The tread design of Goodyear's Aquatred, for example, shoots water out the grooves, rather than letting it accumulate. Similarly, Michelin's X One has wide, deep grooves that wrap straight around the tire to maximize water removal, as well as lateral grooves that scoop up water.
Bridgestone's Uni-T technologies include a new bead -- the part that holds the tire to the wheel -- that lets tires fit tighter and vibrate less, as well as a process to produce a reinforcing material known as carbon black particles in chains instead of clusters, which Bridgestone says enhances wear resistance.
And most companies say they can blend their best tires' attributes, so that consumers do not have to choose between a tire that takes corners well and one that gives the smoothest ride, for example, but can get both in the same package.
The companies have also speeded up the transfer of new technology to the marketplace. Their researchers, marketers and production people now collaborate on products from their inception, and use computers to fine-tune ideas. The result? The time it takes to get a new tire to market has been halved at Michelin, to a little over two years. Goodyear says it can now do the start-to-finish process in 15 months.
"It takes less than two years to get a car to market, so we can certainly do it with a tire," Mr. Gibara said.
Tire distribution has changed as well. Goodyear, which used to sell only through its own dealers, now competes with other brands at Sears. Firestone owns 1,500 stores, but also sells through independent dealers and mass merchandisers.
The companies have had no choice but to add outlets. "People used to buy tires from the man they sat next to at church," said Anne S. Evans, president of the International Tire Association in Farmington, Conn. "Now there's no dealer loyalty."
And, industry consolidation has meant intensified competition among fewer companies. Japan's Bridgestone bought Firestone Tire and Rubber in 1988; Modern Tire Dealer says the two brands together control 12 percent of the replacement tire market. France's Michelin, which owns B. F. Goodrich and Uniroyal, has a 15 percent share. Goodyear, the leader in North America, has 16 percent. Together, the Big Three control 43 percent of the market.
The combined companies have deep advertising pockets. Last year Firestone participated in the Indianapolis 500 for the first time in two decades, as part of Bridgestone's attempt to give a lift to the flagging brand. Apparently it worked: Firestone's higher-priced performance tires now make up 25 percent of Firestone's unit sales, up from 15 percent in 1993. On Aug. 1, Firestone will start broadcasting commercials that talk about the transfer of tire technology from the Indianapolis 500 to passenger vehicles.
But the mergers have brought an interesting problem: companies that once competed are now part of the same corporate family, and must not eat into each other's sales.
"We had to get our brands to complement each other," said Mr. Michalik, who says that ads for the Firestone brand are aiming at Goodyear's value-conscious customers, while the higher-end Bridgestone brand is going after Michelin.
Similarly, Michelin is aiming its Michelin brand at owners of expensive cars; it pitches its B. F. Goodrich brand to young men who like speed, and it just started heavily advertising its Uniroyal brand's durability to older bargain hunters.
"We are very cognizant that our brands could cannibalize each other, so we're letting each stake out its own turf," said John T. Hargrave, director of marketing communications for all of Michelin's brands.
All of these factors, combined with software that makes it easy to animate technological ideas, would probably have spurred a marketing renaissance on their own. But the seminal change in the tire industry came from a person. Stanley Gault, the Rubbermaid Corporation's former chief executive-cum-marketing guru, became Goodyear's chief executive in June of 1991. Tire marketing has not been the same since.
"Stan Gault brought a marketing and product perspective that wasn't there before," said Stephen E. Brown, general manager of J. Walter Thompson Detroit, which handles the Goodyear account.
Indeed, soon after Mr. Gault arrived at Goodyear, he hustled the Aquatred into the market amid a promotional blitz. The brand became synonymous with wet-road safety -- even though Michelin had a wet-road tire first. "What good is having a great tire if you don't tell people about it?" asked Stephen Girsky, a tire industry analyst with Morgan Stanley & Company.
Mr. Gault quickly found ways to let Goodyear's different brands play off each other's strengths. The company now has Aquatred versions of the Eagle (its highest-end tire), the Wrangler (for light trucks) and, most recently, the Aquatred II, an "improved" Aquatred.
Of course, Goodyear's consumer-products-type marketing has left the company vulnerable to consumer-products-type mistakes. A few years ago, Goodyear retired its Arriva tire, a steady seller, because "there was nothing new and exciting about it," a Goodyear spokesman recalled. Customers protested, and Goodyear reintroduced the tire in the line it sells through Sears.
Classic Coke, anyone?

Though dowdy to the eye, tires long have been high-technology products. France's Michelin has been selling steel-belted radials since 1946. The company's new X-One exemplifies the refinements tire makers are bringing to their products.
 
INTERIOR CASING
Distributes weight better so that the tire wears more evenly and lasts longer.
 
CIRCUMFERENCE GROOVES
Remove water and snow under the tire.
 
SHALLOW LATERAL GROOVES
Pinched shape helps drain water from the circumference grooves, further improving traction.
 
DEEP LATERAL GROOVES
They have interlocking edges that open and close to increase the tire's stability and traction under high stress conditions, like turning and braking.
 
TREAD BLOCKS
Stay open in wet conditions to provide better drainage and handling but close up during acceleration and braking to increase the tire's
 
RUBBER
specially manufactured to be more resistant to heat and cold while providing good durability and traction.
 
"Tread Trends"
Major tire companies are making technology central to their attempts to attract customers.
 
MICHELIN
For nearly a decade, Michelin's baby has helped the company build a reputation for tire safety. Now, ads tout tire technology and performance also.
 
GOODYEAR
Through vigourous promotion of its Aquatred line, Goodyear has built broad recognition for its wet-weather tires.
 
BRIDGESTONE
Begining next month, Bridgestone's ads for Firestone and its other tires will tell consumers that technology used in auto racing is now available on tires for higway use.

HEADLINE: Frederick J. Stock, 88, Pharmaceutical Executive

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Frederick J. Stock, a pharmaceutical-industry executive who supervised the nation's large-scale production of penicillin and other "miracle drugs" during World War II, died Tuesday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 88 years old.
Mr. Stock, who earned a degree in pharmacy from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind., in 1928, was manager of the prescription departments of the Walgreen Corporation drug-store chain when American industry mobilized for war in 1941. He was assigned to the Office of Production Management, a unit of the War Production Board, and later was named chief of the office's drug branch. 
 In that role, Mr. Stock supervised the large-scale production of penicillin and sulfa drugs, the first of the stream of wonder drugs that would revolutionize the postwar treatment of infectious diseases. He was also responsible for the allocation of drugs between the military and civilian markets, as consumer demand for the precious new medicines quickly outstripped supply in the constrained wartime economy.
In early 1944, with penicillin supplies still inadequate, Mr. Stock led the War Production Board's effort to encourage drug companies, normally competitors, to share patents and research technology with each other so that production of the new drug could be increased. In 1949, Purdue awarded him an honorary degree in recognition of his wartime contributions to pharmacy.
After the war, Mr. Stock joined Charles Pfizer & Company as it made its entry into the prescription drug field. While there, he oversaw the company's global introduction of the early antibiotic Terramycin. In 1952, he joined the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation, and stayed on after its merger with E. R. Squibb & Company, from which he retired as senior vice president and general manager in 1972. In 1989, Squibb merged with Bristol-Myers to form the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company.
Mr. Stock also served as a trustee of the Hudson River Museum, an officer of the Yonkers Historical Society and a governor of Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville.
He is survived by his wife, Margaret Wilson Stock of Bronxville; two daughters, Suzanne Macdonald of Villanova, Pa., and Carol Mahony of Edina, Minn. and Vero Beach, Fla.,; 10 grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren. A son, Frederick J. Stock Jr., a former executive of the New York Stock Exchange, and three grandchildren died in 1973.

Bonds Retreat As Fed Stance Is Reassessed

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Treasury market retreated yesterday as investors reassessed the views of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on the economy and concluded interest rates were likely to inch up soon.
Treasury prices rallied on Thursday after Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that he expected economic growth to slow this year, which would forestall the need for higher interest rates. Yet the Fed chairman also warned that the central bank might have to raise interest rates anyway to insure a slowdown, and it was that view that was the focus of attention in the market yesterday. 
 "People thought about the testimony and felt Greenspan indicated he is ready to tighten credit," said James Padinha, an economist with the analytical firm of MMS International. He said several of Mr. Greenspan's comments gave a clear hint that short-term interest rates would soon rise.
"Greenspan said, 'The timing and extent of that downshift are uncertain,' " said Mr. Padinha, who stressed that recent economic data did not show the kind of slowdown the Fed had earlier forecast.
 In addition to renewed speculation over an increase in interest rates, many market participants decided to take profits on Thursday's rally ahead of next week's sales of new two-year and five-year notes.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 21/32 , to 8727/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.98 percent, from 6.92 percent on Thursday. Prices of shorter-term maturities also fell, with the yield on the two-year note rising to 6.20 percent, from 6.13 percent on Thursday.
Traders said bonds were also under pressure from talk that a consulting firm based in Washington was telling its subscribers that the markets had misread Mr. Greenspan's testimony.
"They are saying it is surprising how markets rallied on Greenspan's testimony on Thursday because nothing he said ruled out a tightening," one dealer said.
In any case, the market yesterday was clearly re-evaluating the inflation threat and the chance of the Fed responding with higher interest rates.
"The Fed always believes in the importance of keeping inflation down, as it should," said Alan S. Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed.
Mr. Blinder, now an economics professor at Princeton University, said Mr. Greenspan's testimony reflected a shift at the Fed regarding the risks to the economy: from fears of a recession earlier this year to the need for heightened vigilance on inflation.
"I don't believe there has been any fundamental change of views, but an evolution, yes, rather than a big change," Mr. Blinder said.
Among economic data yesterday, the University of Michigan said that its preliminary July index of consumer sentiment stood at 93, compared with 92.4 for June, traders said. The university's survey is issued only to subscribers.
Signs of consumers' ability and willingness to spend are important in determining the direction of the economy since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of growth.

HEADLINE: Colorado Booms, and Some Worry

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, July 19

 BODY:
With 600 head of Santa Gertrudis cattle grazing on 4,000 acres of grass dotted with ponderosa pine, Cherokee Ranch is a Charles Russell tableau, squeezed into a 1990's frame.
"Some of the new houses come right up to the barbed wire," said Tweet Kimball, the ranch's owner, who in recent years has watched neighboring ranches fall one by one below the bulldozers of Highlands Ranch, the fastest-growing suburb in the United States. 
 Of the nation's 30 fastest-growing counties in the first half of the 1990's, 11 were in Colorado, according to figures released recently by the Census Bureau. Six are within 75 miles of Denver, including the two fastest growing, the affluent southern suburbs of Douglas and Elbert.
Indeed, with the state's population jumping by 15 percent since 1990, growth usually outstrips crime as the No. 1 concern of Colorado poll respondents. They say scenic countryside is disappearing and traffic building.
In Douglas, only four miles north of Mrs. Kimball's pastures, construction workers are furiously hammering copper-clad roofs, preparing for the opening next month of Colorado's largest shopping center, Park Meadows. Situated at the junction of two Interstate highways, the shopping center has 100 stores, 7,200 parking spaces and a Rocky Mountain lodge motif, including timber ceilings.
With the mall already 93 percent leased, Park Meadows is part of a wider boom enveloping metropolitan Denver, home to slightly more than half of Colorado's 3.8 million people. Around the area, builders are breaking ground or obtaining financing for 9 indoor skating rinks, 17 hotels, 23 golf courses and the first speculative office buildings since the oil boom collapse of the early 1980's.
"Denver is a terrific city," said Hanna R. Smith, a 22-year-old corporate publicist who moved here last year from Rochester. "I can walk anywhere downtown; the bar scene is very friendly."
Saying that two friends from college stopped here for a weekend on their way to Seattle, Ms. Smith added, "They drove to Seattle, turned around and came back here to live."
Housing costs have responded to the growth. So far in the 1990's, housing prices in the Denver area have jumped 50 percent, a rise that is second only to that of Salt Lake City for the nation's 50 largest metropolitan areas. Colorado Springs, the state's second-largest city, ranked second among smaller cities nationwide for price increases in single-family houses. Tucson, Ariz., was first.
Colorado has boomed in the past -- with gold in the 1860's, silver in the 1880's, military spending in World War II, and oil and gas in the late 1970's. Each boom has also been followed by a bust.
This time, many analysts say, the state has diversified enough to avoid being dragged down by the crash of one sector or commodity.
Philip M. Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a study group here, said: "The energy boom camouflaged the six new pillars of the Colorado economy: telecommunications, high technology, recreation, real estate, a transportation hub, and a regional trade center. The economic base of the state has become very broad."
Greater Denver, for example, now has the nation's largest concentration of cable television company headquarters. And since 1990 the city has become a regional center of the mutual fund industry, with the assets of portfolios managed by mutual funds based in Denver jumping to $50 billion from $5 billion.
What is happening here is part of a larger Western trend away from resource-based economies like ranching, mining and logging. Once addicted to oil and gas, Denver now has less than 1 percent of its work force employed by energy companies. Statewide, employment in the military industry has fallen by half from a recent peak of 9 percent of the labor force.
In contrast to the painful closings of military bases in some parts of the nation, the closing last year of Lowry Air Force Base east of Denver brought immediate plans from developers to build two golf courses and 350 houses on the site.
Flexing its international muscles, Colorado last year exported $4.7 billion in manufactured products, slightly more than the state's total output from ranches and farms. Since 1992, the state's international exports have grown by 80 percent, the fastest for any state.
"Colorado has a well-disguised technology base," said Morgan Smith, director of the state's International Trade Office. "We're exporting medical, computer and tele comunications equipment, as well as environmental cleanup technologies."
Always strong in recreational tourism, Colorado is undergoing about $1 billion in long-term investment in ski resorts, largely at Keystone and Vail.
Colorado's varied economic base has also brought lower unemployment in the 1990's than the national average. In recent years, unemployment here has averaged one or two percentage points below the national average. Last year, Colorado's job growth was 4.7 percent, double the national average.
After losing population in the late 1980's, Colorado has gained population at triple the national average since 1990. The 450,000 increase in the state's population since 1990 is largely the result of people moving here. Many people take pay cuts to do so.
"I know one woman in property management who took $26,000 as a starting salary here, when she had been making $45,000 in Los Angeles," said Lisa Hein, who works with Preferred Leads, a Denver employment agency. "Most of the reasoning we hear is for the quality of life here."
Even with housing prices, the cost of living here remains lower than in cities like Boston and Los Angeles.
Low crime rates are also attracting new residents.
Ringing Denver, the suburban counties of Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas Jefferson Counties are home to 1.3 million people. In the first half of the year, six homicides were registered in the four-county area. On an annual basis, that would be slightly less the 1994 rate for Japan of 10 homicides per 1 million inhabitants.
Even in the city of Denver, where 33 homicides were recorded in the same period, concern about crime is low. "Sylvie, just leave your purse in the car," Ty Jurras, a former Los Angeles resident, shouted to his wife one recent evening as they prepared to leave a city parking lot to attend a two-hour play.
It is the crowded highways that have become the bane of many residents. Every weekday morning long lines of traffic snake out of the mountain suburbs, causing commuting times to lengthen each year. Forsaking the Westerner's traditional attachment to the steering wheel, a quarter of all people who work in downtown Denver now commute by bus or rail.
"I don't want the Front Range to become one solid city," Gov. Roy Romer, a Democrat, said in a recent interview, referring to a 160-mile corridor from Fort Collins to Pueblo. Running along the eastern edge of the Rockies, this stretch of plains and hills is home to about 80 percent of the state's population.
"Don't let the cities grow together," the Governor said. "Keep some space; keep some cornfields."
This November, several towns are expected to vote on proposals to restrict the number of building permits granted annually. In Golden, a western neighbor of Denver, officials operating under tight new curbs voted by residents will issue only 71 permits for new homes this year, down from 275 last year.
Hoping to preserve open spaces and to curb strip-mall development, Coloradans voted in 1994 to funnel all profits from the state lottery -- about $40 million a year -- to Great Outdoors Colorado, a public entity that buys land threatened by commercial development.
At Cherokee Ranch, Mrs. Kimball has set up a foundation to keep the land as wild as when she bought it in 1954. On the far side of her fences, the Highlands Ranch development has grown to 33,000 residents from 4,000 in 1984. In 25 years, developers project it will have 96,000 inhabitants.

Stocks ended lower yesterday, capping the busiest week of trading in Wall Street history and one of the most volatile, as investors fretted anew about corporate earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 37.36 points, closing at 5,426.82. For the week, it was down 83.74 points. 
 Volume was active once again on the New York Stock Exchange at 408.1 million shares. For the week, Big Board volume totaled 2.49 billion shares, passing the previous weekly volume record of 2.30 billion set Oct. 19-23, 1987, when the market crashed.
"I'm glad this week is over," Hildegard Zagorski, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said yesterday. "It was a wild week, with lots of gyrations -- quite dramatic, quite scary -- and lots of programs. Today was a cautious regrouping day."
Analysts said yesterday's trading was also affected by the double-witching expirations of the July Standard & Poor's 100 index options and the July S.& P. 500 index options.
Stocks were depressed early this week by heightened concern that earnings for the latest quarter would be weaker than expected. But by midweek, the market snapped back on bargain-hunting that was induced by some solid earnings reports.
The rally was also aided by testimony in Congress this week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. Traders took his remarks as an indication that the central bank did not plan to raise interest rates right away. But the earnings fears flared again yesterday, mostly in the technology stocks.
The Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavy with technology stocks, fell 12.14 points, to 1,097.68.
Netscape fell 3 1/2, to 53, after rising 31/16 on Thursday. It reported second-quarter operating profits just 1 cent above analysts' expectations.
Iomega lost 5 1/2, to 22 1/2, topping the Nasdaq actives list. It also reported quarterly results that beat the analysts' consensus by 1 cent, but some traders were hoping for stronger results.
"By and large, earnings have been coming in fine," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.
Of the 222 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index that have reported results so far, 57 percent had positive surprises, 27 percent negative surprises and 17 percent were on target, according to IBES, which tracks corporate results.
Key companies reporting next week include I.B.M., Microsoft, Compaq and big oil companies.
Airline stocks were weaker in the aftermath of the T.W.A. 747 crash off Long Island. Mr. Orlando said that shares were pressured by concerns that international travel may fall and security costs for carriers may rise. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 2 3/8, to 78 3/4; UAL, parent of United Airlines, 1 1/2, to 46 1/4; Delta Air Lines 2 1/8, to 72 3/4, and Trans World Airlines 3/4, to 9 1/2.
Sunbeam soared 6 1/8, to 18 5/8. Late on Thursday, the company said it had named Albert Dunlap, who has a reputation for being an aggressive cost-cutter and was formerly chairman of Scott Paper, as chairman and chief executive.
Gillette rose 2 1/2, to 63, on stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and news that its Russian joint venture had acquired a Russian maker of double-edge blades under the Sputnik brand name.
The Big Board composite index fell 2.19 points, to 342.91; the S.& P. 500 index fell 4.83, to 638.73, and the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.87, to 548.76.

HEADLINE: Judge Clears Accord on Class-Action Suit Against Archer Daniels

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 19

 BODY:
A Federal judge gave final approval today to a $45 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit accusing the Archer Daniels Midland Company and its competitors of fixing prices for the animal feed supplement lysine.
The action came despite the refusal of an Archer Daniels executive to testify. 
 United States District Judge Milton Shadur shared the concerns of the settlement's critics, who complained that Archer Daniels, which is based in Decatur, Ill., and its competitors had provided little documentation to show if and how much customers were bilked. But Judge Shadur added, "Is anyone obligated to put their neck in a noose?"
Kenneth Adams, a lawyer who represents some of the 33 parties that opted out of the settlement, said an appeal was possible.
Terrence Wilson, head of the Archer Daniels corn processing division, was called to testify about the company's lysine pricing but asserted his right against self-incrimination and did not appear.
The Justice Department currently plans to disclose the scope of its criminal investigation into the Archer Daniels lysine deals in September, according to law enforcement sources and people familiar with the case. Federal prosecutors have told Michael Andreas, an Archer Daniels vice president, and Mr. Wilson that they will be indicted as early as September.
Judge Shadur said, taking all the factors together, that the proposed settlements were "fair, reasonable and adequate, which is the ultimate determination."
Archer Daniels will pay $25 million to settle complaints that it manipulated the market for lysine, an amino acid that speeds muscle growth in animals. In addition, the American units of Japan's Ajinomoto Company and Kyowa Hakko Ltd., both major distributors of lysine, are to pay $10.2 million each, bringing the total to more than $45 million. A fourth company, Sewon America, did not settle; the class-action case against it continues.
The parties not in the settlement, including the multibillion-dollar agricultural cooperative Farmland Industries, are likely to file new lawsuits against the companies, Mr. Adams, the lawyer, said. Purina Mills Inc., which purchased about a third of the lysine during the reported price-fixing period, had already filed a separate lawsuit.
In court, Mr. Adams presented a study by a Purdue University agricultural economist who estimated lysine buyers were cheated out of as much as $180 million because of price-fixing that took place from 1992 through 1995.
But Judge Shadur argued the numbers were flawed. He said they overestimated the length of the period of price-fixing, basing his conclusion on published interviews of Mark Whitacre, an Archer Daniels executive who secretly taped meetings for the F.B.I. where the reported price-fixing took place. The judge also said that the market price of lysine would normally be higher than the Purdue study because the lysine market was not a highly competitive market as the study had assumed.
Settlement of the lysine civil case came with unusual speed; such antitrust lawsuits often take years to wind their way through the courts.

HEADLINE: Income Gap in Mexico Grows, and So Do Protests

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: TEPOZTLAN, Mexico

 BODY:
One simmering Sunday in May, a hundred peasant farmers stormed a luxurious hillside mansion here and, in a scene out of an old newsreel of the 1910 Revolution, pounded on the gates with machetes and their clenched fists until the wealthy owners abandoned their brunch and fled.
Peasants now stand guard at the exclusive grounds about 35 miles south of Mexico City. They have painted "House of the People" on the imposing wooden doors, but they still find themselves ogling such luxuries as the artificial lake just inside the gates and the mounted bison head on the warehouse wall. 
 "The only thing that one can feel is embittered," said Guillermo Noriega Garcia, 56, a farmer who took part in the assault on the 20-acre estate that stands in the middle of parched subsistence farms. "How can it be that one man has everything and others don't even have water?"
The episode is just one sign of how the current economic crisis has deepened already serious divisions in Mexico. It has exaggerated the gap not only between rich and poor, but also between the industrialized north and the rural south, between Spanish-speaking Mexicans and the 10 million who are Indians and between those whose lives are increasingly tied to the United States economy and those who are entirely dependent on the fortunes of Mexico.
The degree of income disparity in Mexico is among the worst in the world and is steadily growing more extreme. Excluding African countries, Mexico has the largest gap between rich and poor of all but six nations in the world, United Nations and World Bank figures show.
Today the richest 10 percent of Mexicans earn 41 percent of the country's income, while the bottom half of the population receives only 16 percent of all national income. The Government admits that the number of Mexicans living in extreme poverty has grown to 22 million, an increase over the last 15 months of 5 million people.
The growing gap has given rise to many clashes and to startling contrasts throughout Mexico. On the outskirts of the wealthy northern city of Monterrey, residents of a shantytown recently stopped a freight train in the dead of night. Officials say the train was disabled when it slowed down to go through the area. When word got out that the train carried tons of corn, whole families rushed out to fill pots and sacks full of grain.
On the other hand, as the Mexican market for bargain-priced Volkswagen Beetles dried up in 1995, Mercedes-Benz sales actually rose. This year, as the worst economic crisis in 60 years continues, the car maker is on target to sell 50 percent more cars in Mexico than last year.
A few large Mexican companies benefited handsomely when Mexico entered the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 and when the devaluation of the peso in December of that year made Mexican exports cheaper. But business leaders say 17,000 companies have folded since the crisis began. While a second Gucci boutique recently opened in the swank Polanco section of Mexico City, a United Nations report said the number of children who live and work on the streets of the capital has doubled in three years.
The polarization between classes in Mexico is a "historic problem that is always present but never resolved," the historian Lorenzo Meyer wrote. Mexico now faces severe political and economic problems, but the most serious crisis, he wrote, "is the enormous distance and antagonism between the classes and groups that form the Mexican social fabric."
One factor aggravating the tensions is the insistence by the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo, like the Governments of his two predecessors, on pursuing an economic policy of privatizations, free markets and integration into the global economy. Such a policy is endorsed by the United States and the International Monetary Fund, but it has failed to raise the standard of living for most Mexicans.
Big gains in real wages and economic growth from 1963 to 1984 were wiped out as the previous two presidents religiously followed their open-market policies. Real wages today are below what they were in 1981. The debacle of Mr. Zedillo's first 18 months in office only worsens that record.
Criticism of the economic model is widespread. "An absolute and total disaster," said Vicente Fox, an opposition-party Governor from the central state of Guanajuato. Even Mr. Zedillo has called for a public debate about Mexico's economic direction.
But alternatives are scarce. Beyond some technical tinkering, the only consensus so far has been that the economic modernization of Mexico should be more humane -- which in most cases means more direct Government intervention to help small- and medium-sized manufacturers stand up to the competition.
Although the class gap in Mexico has deepened, the political scientist Jorge G. Castaneda believes that there is little danger of social conflict. The reason is the substantial and growing number of Mexicans whose lives are tied to the United States economy.
Those Mexicans, Mr. Castaneda says, include both rich exporters and the poor farmhands who cross the border and send home their earnings. What they have in common is dependence on the American economy, which buffers the shocks of Mexico's economic problems.
"A nationwide social explosion, such as the Revolution of 1910, is virtually impossible while such a large, regionally well-distributed, broadly based segment of the population is thriving," Mr. Castaneda wrote recently in Foreign Affairs magazine.
Others believe that the danger of a spark to set off social revolt is actually much greater. Manuel Camacho Solis, the former Mayor of Mexico City who broke ranks with the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party and is now part of a developing alternative political force, said in an interview that recent polls showed 22 percent of the capital's residents believe that violence is justified to correct social imbalances -- a figure far higher than at any time in the last decade. Recently, public schoolteachers demanding a living wage paralyzed the city with demonstrations that at times turned violent.
"It doesn't take 50 percent of the population to make the country ungovernable," Mr. Camacho said. "If just 5 percent take to the streets, that could be enough."
It was a comparatively small band of guerrillas in Chiapas who in January 1994 shocked Mexico with an insurrection that is still not resolved. And in June, as few as 50 masked men, and perhaps a few women, declared themselves another revolutionary army. That was enough to send shivers down the spines of many Government officials.
Recent incidents have worried many in Mexico because they seem to reflect a loss of respect for the rule of law and a frightening lack of Government control. The train robbery near Monterrey was reminiscent of the 1910 Revolution, when peasants routinely assaulted trains.
But in the modern version, the attackers included children and housewives like Argelia Espinosa, who was almost arrested for trying to bring home a bushel of corn. "We would have milled the corn and used it to make tamales and tortillas," said the 37-year-old woman, whose husband, Alberto, was arrested with a sack full of corn on his shoulder. "It wouldn't have gone to waste."
For the Rev. Rodolfo Reyes, a local priest, the assault was a manifestation of Mexico's smoldering economic and social crisis. "I see it as a sign that says 'Hey, be careful,' " he said.
In June, in a similar episode, a train full of wheat was sacked in the state of Durango.
The assault on the Tepoztlan mansion roused fears that have haunted wealthy Mexicans since the Revolution, when peasants banged on the doors of big haciendas demanding the return of the land to the people.
The mansion, called La Quinta Piedra, is owned by Guillermo de Jesus Occelli, the brother-in-law of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Mr. Occelli says he bought the 20 acres legitimately. But for the last five years, local people have insisted that the transactions were fraudulent and that the land, like much of the land in Mexico since the Revolution, belongs to the community.
This is an old battle here, where Emiliano Zapata began his struggle for liberty and land at the beginning of this century.
The peasants here finally decided this year that they had had enough. After meeting in a general assembly on May 12, they made their way to the huge front gate of the Occelli estate, peasant leaders said. Inside, the family was enjoying a Sunday brunch. Some peasants banged on the door with machetes. One may even have tried to start a fire, a newspaper account said.
The gates eventually lumbered open, and the family and guests rushed off, peasant leaders said. For the first time, local peasants passed through the great doors and gawked at the splendor they had until then only imagined. People who lived four or six to a room wandered wide-eyed through the house and past a dining room table large enough to accommodate a dozen people. Peasants who rely on water from a tanker truck during the dry season stared at the hotel-sized pool and the fountains that seemed capriciously to splash water everywhere.
The peasants say they now have a list of other property holders in the area who, they contend, also bought land illegally. What happened at La Quinta Piedra ought to be taken as a warning, they say. What started as a land dispute has turned into an open struggle between rich and poor.
"We tried to talk to the rich people, but they never paid attention to us," said Nicanor Demesa Ortiz, who took part in the takeover. "But what we did here was to show that no one, no matter how powerful or influential, is immune to the power of the people or to what is right."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;
Dole Holds His Tongue, But Strain Is Showing

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: CLEVELAND, July 19

 BODY:
Bob Dole is striving these days to curb the unscripted remarks that have distracted his Presidential campaign, but it became clear this week that the switch might not be so easy. The former Senate majority leader spent his career fielding questions, and he is now responding to the silence imposed on him by his campaign with a collection of shrugs, grins, grimaces and grunts.
"No comment, no comment," Mr. Dole said the other day, arching his eyebrows and casting his eyes upward to the boom mikes and the heavens above, struggling to ignore questions about his view of reports of past drug use by some White House employees. "I've taken my vow of silence." 
 This is not the first time that Mr. Dole's campaign aides have tried to encourage him not to answer passing questions, concerned that his off-the-cuff remarks -- as when he compared the dangers of tobacco to those of drinking milk -- might be hazardous to the campaign's health. And it seemed -- at first, at least -- that it might work this time.
Mr. Dole ignored questions yelled at him at a photo session in Washington early this week. Moments later, as he left the lunch, members of his staff swiftly roped off reporters on one side of the sidewalk. Using a network of walkie-talkies, they maneuvered Mr. Dole out the farthest door and into his waiting car.
On this trip through the Midwest, Mr. Dole heeded the pleas of his staff and never ventured to the back of the plane, where the press sits. That was a change of habit for the passenger in the first-class cabin, who often sits alone and is known to wander back to chat whenever he grows bored or restless.
But the wall shows signs of cracking. When Mr. Dole was asked the other day whether his silence reflected a new campaign gambit, his eyes lit up. He raised a hand to his mouth and pinched his lips together. That was taken as a yes. And as the week went on, the candidate, in ignoring questions, took on the look of a schoolboy forced to eat his peas.
By today, Mr. Dole could barely restrain himself, communicating with his gestures a sort of detached bemusement at the whole exercise. When a television correspondent yelled a question to Mr. Dole about why he was not answering questions, the candidate raised an eyebrow, tilted his head to the right, put a hand to his mouth, grinned -- and then, resisting temptation one more time, headed for his plane. Even Mr. Dole's staff took that as a sign that his "vow of silence" would not hold for long.
Friendly Criticism
Mr. Dole learned again this week that yesterday's political rivals do not necessarily make for today's political friends. He spent much of this week pushing his school voucher program at parochial schools, including a speech here today at St. Rocco Church. To bolster his case, he brought along two former Secretaries of Education, Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett. Mr. Bennett was chairman of Mr. Alexander's failed campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination that Mr. Dole is presumed to have won, and he was one of the earliest Republicans to criticize Mr. Dole's campaign publicly.
Mr. Bennett is also one of the leading advocates of Mr. Dole's adopted school voucher program. While Mr. Bennett gamely stayed at Mr. Dole's side this week and talked up the merits of the policy, it was clear that he remains less than enthusiastic about the course that Mr. Dole's campaign has taken. The differences could not have been more apparent than in how they reacted to reports of past drug use by some White House employees.
Mr. Bennett rushed out to seek reporters to condemn the news. "You don't inhale, you get a job in the White House," Mr. Bennett said. "You do inhale, you get a job in the White House."
Mr. Dole dealt with the same subject with a fleeting allusion, hidden in an introduction of Mr. Bennett, that was no doubt lost to most in his audience at the Cardinal Stritch College in Milwaukee.
"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, drug czar," Mr. Dole said. "Lots of news about drugs in the paper today." And that was that.
Mr. Bennett showed concern that Mr. Dole was emphasizing economic issues in his campaign, rather than the social ones that have interested Mr. Bennett.
"I don't think people's concerns about what's wrong with this country are economic," Mr. Bennett said. "They're cultural. Moral. Spiritual."
Mr. Bennett, continuing his gentle critique of Mr. Dole's campaign for reporters in the back of the plane as Mr. Dole remained up front, said: "I don't think we've made our case clearly."
Age as a State of Mind
As Mr. Dole approaches his 73d birthday on Monday, which he will celebrate in Russell, Kan., age seems to be on his mind. Here at St. Rocco Church, Mr. Dole took the opportunity to aim a good-natured joke at his old friend Strom Thurmond, the 93-year-old South Carolina Senator.
"I know you're celebrating your bicentennial," Mr. Dole said, "and I'm sorry Senator Thurmond couldn't be with me because he was here for the first one."
Mr. Thurmond is often a foil for Mr. Dole's jokes about aging, but Mr. Dole, who is bracing for a wave of news coverage this weekend about his age and questions about his fitness, did not leave it at that.
"He's a very unique individual," he said. "If you ever have any doubt about, you think you're getting old, just come up to Washington and follow Senator Thurmond around for a day. Or two. And drink your orange and your grapefruit juice and take your vitamins as he does. And you just keep going on and on and on. Like that little Energizer Bunny."

HEADLINE: TOP BOSNIAN SERB AGREES TO RESIGN

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, July 19

 BODY:
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political chief who led his people in a brutal war of ethnic separation, has agreed to give up political power immediately, the special United States envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, said here today.
The agreement removes an obstacle to September's national elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina and could aid the flagging peace effort by removing from visible public life a man indicted for genocide and other war crimes. 
 But Mr. Holbrooke acknowledged that it fell short of the goal of removing Dr. Karadzic from Bosnia and putting him on trial at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, something Western nations have long demanded.
"This is a minimal acceptable package," Mr. Holbrooke said. Only a few days ago Mr. Holbrooke told Western and Bosnian officials that if Dr. Karadzic did not agree to leave Bosnia, the West would reimpose economic sanctions on Serbia. For now, Dr. Karadzic remains in his mountain hideaway of Pale, near Sarajevo, and the threat of sanctions has withered.
The signed agreement was negotiated with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who in turned exerted pressure on the Bosnian Serb leader.
The Bosnian Government and Western officials had considered Dr. Karadzic's presence as head of the major political party in the Serb part of Bosnia, and his control over the police, news media and politics there, as serious obstacles to fair elections.
Still, Dr. Karadzic's hard-line nationalist colleagues remain in power and there is wide suspicion that he will continue to exert influence behind the scenes. Mr. Holbrooke cautioned that in order for the Bosnian elections to be run successfully, the agreement, which was signed by Dr. Karadzic, his replacements in the Bosnian Serb power structure and Mr. Milosevic, had to be "implemented correctly."
In Sarajevo, the news of the agreement was welcomed by the Bosnian Government, which removed itsthreat of boycotting the election if Dr. Karadzic remained in office. Ejup Ganic, the Bosnian Vice President, said Dr. Karadzic's agreement would enhance the prospects of fair elections.
But Mr. Ganic said he remained concerned that Dr. Karadzic, whose campaign posters are plastered all over Serb-held Bosnia, would remain a powerful influence unless he was sent to The Hague.
The international tribunal there says Dr. Karadzic bears responsibility for the Bosnian Serb policy of "ethnic cleansing," in which hundreds of thousands of Muslim civilians were uprooted or killed. In the most notorious case, thousands of Muslim men and boys are believed to have been massacred after the Serbian conquest of the town of Srebrenica last year.
In the agreement, Dr. Karadzic said he had handed over power as president of the self-styled Bosnian Serb republic to Biljana Plavsic, his equally nationalist deputy. Another loyalist, Aleksa Buha, replaces Dr. Karadzic as chairman of the Serb Democratic Party. The one-page agreement, signed Thursday night, also stipulates that Dr. Karadzic will not appear in public or on radio or television -- forums that Dr. Karadzic, a clever propagandist, has used to great effect.
Mr. Holbrooke said there was "no guarantee" that Dr. Karadzic would conform to the intent of the agreement, and suggested it was possible he could remain a strong behind-the-scenes influence.
But the envoy appeared hopeful that the dynamics of Bosnian Serb internal political rivalry combined with Mr. Milosevic's interest in avoiding reimposition of economic sanctions could mean the end of Dr. Karadzic's power.
Early this week Robert Frowick, an American diplomat who is supervising the elections in Bosnia, said Dr. Karadzic's political party could not take part if he did not resign his post. This added to the pressure on Dr. Karadzic to resign.
Today Mr. Holbrooke said that if Dr. Karadzic defied the new agreement, his political party would be banned during the election campaign and that Belgrade would face economic sanctions. He did not spell out what actions would set off these responses.
"As of this morning, Radovan Karadzic is no longer president of Republika Srpska and he has relinquished the office and all powers associated," with it, Mr. Holbrooke, using the Bosnian Serbs' name for their breakaway region, said at a news conference this morning after 10 hours of talks.
"I want to stress he knew what he was signing," Mr. Holbrooke said. "He knew he was signing the end of his political career."
To insure that Dr. Karadzic signed the agreement, which was faxed to him in Pale, the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters, Mr. Milosevic's chief of state security, Jovica Stanisic, was dispatched to Pale by helicopter Thursday night as a witness, Mr. Holbrooke said.
Mr. Stanisic, one of Mr. Milosevic's most trusted operatives, returned after midnight to Mr. Milosevic's Belgrade residence with the original signed document. Mr. Holbrooke and his team were waiting there with the Serbian President.
Mr. Holbrooke said the most powerful politician in Serb-held Bosnia would now be Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the Bosnian Serb parliament, who is as much against a multi-ethnic Bosnia as Dr. Karadzic is.
But Mr. Krajisnik is easier for the United States to accept because he is not indicted for war crimes and his candidacy in September as the Bosnian Serb member of the planned tripartite Bosnian presidency does not therefore fly in the face of the Dayton accords.
Mr. Krajisnik has been described as both a rival and an ally of Dr. Karadzic. Mr. Holbrooke appeared to be counting on Mr. Krajisnik's appetite for power to overtake his friendship with Dr. Karadzic.
Dr. Karadzic's replacement, Mrs. Plavsic, who assumes the title of temporary acting president of Republika Srpska, is as defiant about the Dayton, Ohio, peace accords as Dr. Karadzic. But she has not been indicted by The Hague tribunal.
The new head of the Serb Democratic Party, Mr. Buha, is also a hard-liner and loyal to Dr. Karadzic. He is the Bosnian Serbs' "foreign minister," and along with Mr. Krajisnik was present as part of an unofficial Bosnian Serb delegation at the Dayton talks last year. Both men were described as being very angry when Mr. Milosevic, their formal representative at Dayton, showed them the agreement on the closing day in Ohio.
Mr. Holbrooke's two days of negotiations started when he arrived in Belgrade on Wednesday afternoon and told Mr. Milosevic that the Serb Democratic Party would be banned from the Bosnian elections and economic sanctions would be re-imposed on Serbia if Dr. Karadzic was not removed from the political scene.
Further pressure was applied on Dr. Karadzic by the Russians, often an ally of the Serbs. Moscow sent a message to him Thursday night suggesting that he step down, a senior Western diplomat said. The British sent a similar message, the diplomat said.
On the second elusive goal of his negotiations with Mr. Milosevic, the dispatch of Dr. Karadzic to The Hague, Mr. Holbrooke said he faced a stone wall.
Mr. Holbrooke said he informed Mr. Milosevic on Wednesday that Dr. Karadzic and the military leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who is also indicted for war crimes, "have to go to The Hague." The answer, Mr. Holbrooke said, was: "They won't."
The envoy said there was "no chance" that Mr. Milosevic, whose security police force has heavily infiltrated the Bosnian Serb police and whose Yugoslav National Army formed the backbone of the Bosnian Serb army, would order the arrest of the two leaders.
"If we won't do it with 60,000 troops in the country, why would Milosevic do it and launch a Serb civil war?" Mr. Holbrooke said, referring to the number of NATO-led troops in Bosnia. "There are certain things he won't do."
Mr. Holbrooke's comments appeared to indicate that he believed the only way Dr. Karadzic would end up in The Hague was if he turned himself in or accidentally encountered NATO-led forces and they arrested him. NATO commanders, reflecting political instructions to avoid casualties, say they will not order their troops to search for Dr. Karadzic.
There has been some speculation among Western diplomats that Dr. Karadzic was toying with the idea of turning himself in to the tribunal. Dr. Karadzic is reported to have been paying very close attention to the televised proceedings of the tribunal.
The diplomats point out that Dr. Karadzic has also hired two criminal lawyers from law firms in the United States. These lawyers have been in The Hague monitoring proceedings and attacking the procedures, but they could possibly be sounding out prosecutors on the possibility of a plea bargain, the diplomats said.
General Mladic has become less of a target for Washington because since the signing of the Dayton accords, he has virtually disappeared into his military headquarters in eastern Bosnia and is rarely seen. Mr. Holbrooke apparently believes Dr. Karadzic will follow suit.

HEADLINE: Drifter Charged in Case That Gay Groups Said Showed Police Bias

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
At first, the killing of Sylvia Lugo seemed to be one of a series of robberies, sexual assaults and beatings of women in the brownstone neighborhoods of Park Slope and Boerum Hill.
But in the following months, the killing took on a wider significance. Groups representing the area's large gay and lesbian population said the failure to find Ms. Lugo's killer reflected the Police Department's laxity in pursuing crimes against lesbians. And they accused the police of downplaying the killing as a crime of passion. 
 Yesterday, a little more than a year after Ms. Lugo's death, the police said they had found the killer, and charged Alex Villanueva, a 19-year-old drifter, with her death, which they said occurred during a push-in robbery, in which the robber forces his way in when the victim opens the door. They also charged him in three other incidents, including the attempted murder and rape of Ms. Lugo's roommate and lover.
The arrest concluded a crime spree by Mr. Villanueva that started at least two years ago, the police said. Police officials would not say how they linked Mr. Villanueva to Ms. Lugo's killing, but they said they broke the case after he was arrested in the March 30 shooting of Gabrielle Kearns in the streets of Fort Greene, Brooklyn, during an attempted robbery.
Yesterday, advocates for gay and lesbian rights continued to criticize the Police Department's handling of the case, saying that it was solved only because the police stumbled onto the confession.
"If the police had, in fact, conducted a thorough investigation and not operated under an assumption they would have caught this man before another innocent person was injured," said Christine Quinn, executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project.
The tense relations between some lesbian groups and the police in brownstone Brooklyn stem in part from an earlier incident. In April 1994, a lesbian reported that she was raped in Prospect Park. But a police official suggested that detectives had doubts about her story -- an assertion that was later disavowed by the department.
Police officials strongly denied yesterday that their handling of the investigation into Ms. Lugo's killing reflected any anti-lesbian bias.
"The investigative process is a search for the truth," said Inspector William Taylor, commanding officer of Brooklyn North detectives.
The facts, the police say, were these: On July 5, Sylvia Lugo and her lover arrived home at their Boerum Hill apartment late at night. As they entered, an armed man forced his way inside with them. He shot Ms. Lugo fatally in the head as he was raping her companion, and then, in a struggle for the gun, shot the companion in the leg. He escaped with some jewelry in the couple's rental car, which was later found on a Brooklyn street.
As time passed and it seemed that the police were no closer to making an arrest, some of Ms. Lugo's family publicly accused her lover of being the suspect. Some detectives told reporters that her rape test results were inconclusive, that the bullet wounds to her leg appeared to be self-inflicted and that witnesses had told the police that they heard two or more females arguing loudly but heard no male voice.
"An enormous cloud has been lifted and we are relieved at that," Susan Tipograph, the lawyer for Ms. Lugo's companion, said after the arrest.
Ms. Tipograph said that the woman, a social worker whose identity is being withheld, has been unemployed since the incident, which left her with serious leg injuries.
After Mr. Villanueva was arrested in the case of Ms. Kearns, detectives began to question him as to the possibility of having committed other crimes, a common investigative method. The detectives said he was reluctant at first, but said he would trust them.
"He wrote down everything in his own handwriting and his own words," said one of the detectives, Harry Antoine of the 88th Precinct. "He described locations and addresses and we were able to put everything together through calling the precincts concerned."
Mr. Villanueva also confessed to the killing of Michael Turrell in May 1995 during an attempted robbery at his home, detectives said.
The police have also arrested Malik Torres, 19, and Glenford Richards, 16, both of Brooklyn, in the shooting of Ms. Kearns.

HEADLINE: Newark to Get More Teachers But Fewer Jobs

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: NEWARK, July 19

 BODY:
More than 600 employees of the state-operated school district here will lose their jobs as part of a plan to move money from the central administration to classrooms, state education officials announced today.
Dr. Beverly L. Hall, the Superintendent appointed by the state when it took control of the district last July, said that the job cuts would save $26.3 million that would instead be used to hire more classroom teachers and school security guards, create more full-day kindergarten programs and provide guidance services to all elementary pupils, among other things. She said the reorganization plan "delivers on the promise to put children first," eliminating unnecessary or duplicated jobs and funneling resources into educational programs and staff. 
 Of the 634 jobs to be eliminated -- 7 percent of the school system's total work force of 8,300 -- 124 are administrative and supervisory workers in district headquarters and an additional 317 are cafeteria workers, custodians or school bus attendants.
Although no classroom teachers will be affected, 89 speech specialists and members of child study teams, who evaluate children with disabilities and put them in special education programs, will not have jobs in September. The others are mostly school aides and clerks.
The plan calls for 28 new teaching positions and 80 "school staff development" jobs, which cover such duties as teacher training and curriculum planning.
Joseph DelGrosso, the president of the Newark Teachers' Union, called the plan "unfair and illogical," saying that the people who would be out of work were not the ones who had caused the widespread problems in the school system. He also expressed anger that Dr. Hall had created three new positions, with combined salaries of $210,000, in her own office.
"The vast majority of these people losing work are minority women living here in Newark," Mr. DelGrosso said. "Newark is economically devastated as it is, and now we are putting all these people out on the street with no hope."
Dr. Hall expressed regret about the job losses, but called the streamlining crucial, saying that the Newark district spent far more on cafeteria, custodial and pupil transportation services than was needed.
"It was a difficult decision, but I had to ask what was the mission of this organization," she said in an interview. "The mission is to educate children, and the resources must be directed toward the children and the schools."
The reorganization comes one year after the state seized control of the troubled Newark district, evicting top administrators and the elected school board. State law requires that superintendents in state-operated districts must produce a plan to reorganize the central adminstration within one year of the takeover.
During the last 12 months, Dr. Hall, a former deputy schools chancellor for New York City, has been working with outside consultants to pinpoint areas of waste and develop plans to improve class instruction. In announcing the plan today, she described the system she joined last summer as one in which board members and administrators profited and school children suffered.
"Prior to state intervention, the opulent and excessive world of the adults sharply constrasted with the deprived world of the children," Dr. Hall wrote in a description of the reorganization. She portrayed a system with "abysmally low" test scores, decrepit buildings and an administration that spent lavishly on restaurant meals and conference trips.
The State Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, said he supported the plan, noting that although Newark spends well above the state average per pupil, it ranks near the bottom in the proportion of money that reaches the classroom.
"One reason the Newark school district experienced decades of failure is that too much of the available resources were spent on a bloated central office bureaucracy," Dr. Klagholz said in a statement.
Dr. Hall said that several top administrative officials, including some on loan from the State Treasury and Education departments, had worked closely with her on the plan. Also, teams of outside consultants studied where money could be saved, and Dr. Hall's plan was based in part on their reports, she said.
Although no classroom teachers will lose their jobs under the plan, Dr. Hall left open the possibility of future cuts. Principals have recommended that certain programs in their schools be added or eliminated, she said, and those suggestions might eventually lead to the loss of classroom jobs. An evaluation of every principal in the district is almost complete, and at least 17 principals who have chosen to retire will be replaced in September, she said.
Phillip Danzig, a senior architect whose job will be eliminated under the plan, said that although some of the cuts sounded reasonable, he was upset that Dr. Hall and her staff had not discussed their strategies with district employees.
"Although on paper they make a lot of sense, they've neglected the human factor of morale," he said.
Dr. Hall said the district was creating a career center to help displaced employees file for unemployment benefits and look for new jobs. Training and counseling will be provided, Dr. Hall said. Although she expected the mood in various school offices to be somber in the coming weeks, she said she did not think it would prevent progress.
"Yes, morale is going to be low and people are going to be sorry this is happening," she said. "But there are people here who knew this had to happen. Our staff will work through it with them, yet set high expectations for them because we still have a big job to do."

HEADLINE: ATLANTA: DAY 1;
Promised Renewal Has Been Less Than Olympian

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 19

 BODY:
In the buoyant, everything-is-possible afterglow of Atlanta's victorious bid for the 1996 Summer Olympics, politicians and planners dreamed of using the Games as leverage to revitalize 15 of the city's most blighted and forgotten neighborhoods.
The Mayor at the time, Maynard H. Jackson Jr., captured the overheated optimism of the day by speaking of "the twin peaks of Atlanta's Mount Olympus," referring to the city's hopes for producing both a magnificent 17-day spectacle and a permanent legacy of civic renewal. 
 But as Atlantans welcome Olympic visitors to town, the second peak looks more like a foothill. An early wish list called for spending more than $500 million to demolish ramshackle houses, repair deteriorating streets and sidewalks, design new parks, install street lights and sewer lines, and build a vast new inventory of affordable housing. Three years later, perhaps a fifth of that amount has been spent, most of it in only five neighborhoods immediately adjacent to Olympic venues.
But while some residents complain about yet another round of broken promises, the modest investments have produced the only improvements seen in some poor, black neighborhoods for decades. In particular, the Summerhill neighborhood, site of a 1966 race riot, has shown signs of rebirth after being devastated in the 1950's by the construction of an interstate highway and then in the 1960's by the erection of the Atlanta-Fulton County baseball stadium.
In some quarters, the freshly poured asphalt and pastel-painted houses have excited hopes that the momentum can continue after the closing ceremony. The changes also have revived some long-lost faith in government.
"It's amazing that you could live in a poor section of town and see this happen that quick," said Moses Steele Jr., a Summerhill resident. "It looks good around here."
But in other areas, the failure to do more has reinforced a deep cynicism about urban renewal in Atlanta, which has the fifth-highest poverty rate among large American cities. And it has raised fears that any progress already made will be squandered once the city loses its Olympian incentives to tidy up for more than 1.4 million house guests.
After all, it was largely the threat of ugly neighborhood protests during the Games that helped persuade city officials to make improvements.
When the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games began discussing a plan to build Centennial Olympic Stadium right next to the baseball stadium, the surrounding neighborhoods mounted protests. The city ultimately bought peace, at least with some neighborhood leaders, by passing a $149 million bond act that provided much of the $76 million spent by the Corporation for Olympic Development in Atlanta, a city agency that made improvements in roads, sidewalks, parks, lighting and sewer systems.
"We didn't necessarily threaten them but we said to them that media people from all over the world would be in Atlanta and we didn't think they would turn their backs on reporting the conditions here," said Douglas Dean, a savvy former state legislator who heads the Summerhill Neighborhood Development Corporation.
Mr. Jackson remembers the message from Mr. Dean and others as being pretty blunt. "I think it was made plain and they meant it," he said. "And who could blame them? If you're going to have a neighborhood invasion and get nothing for it, there are going to be protests."
Mr. Dean, realizing that a second stadium would be built with or without Summerhill's acquiescence, accepted the bargain and began the work of remaking his neighborhood. Other neighborhood leaders never put down their protest placards, and there is now significant tension between the two factions.
"Anytime you go downtown and go behind closed doors and sell peoples out, in my book all you is is an Uncle Tom," said Ethel Mae Mathews, a longtime community activist from the Peoplestown neighborhood. "See, my hand ain't in Mr. Charlie's pocket."
City leaders say they are proud of what they have achieved in Summerhill and Peoplestown and other poor, black neighborhoods such as Mechanicsville, Vine City and the Old Fourth Ward. Their efforts are only disappointing, they say, when measured against the foolishly high expectations set six years ago.
"The expectations after the Games were awarded back in 1990 was that everybody in Atlanta would get a new house, new car, new spouse, new job, that everything would suddenly change," said Mayor Bill Campbell. "And things have changed. It is only that the change has not been perhaps to the degree that everyone thought."
Even Summerhill remains a work in progress. Many of the most dilapidated shotgun shacks have been leveled, but others remain, their windows broken and boarded and their yards invaded by kudzu.
Newly paved streets leading to the stadiums are lined with freshly poured sidewalks and antique street lamps. But they also wind past vacant lots, strewn with garbage and glass, that have been adorned with Olympic plantings of pink begonias.
Seventy-six attractive new townhouses, built by John Wieland, one of the area's most established suburban developers, have been built just around the corner from some of the most decrepit housing in the city. In a neighborhood where tenants are accustomed to paying rents of a few hundred dollars, the Greenlea Commons townhouses are selling for up to $139,900. Sixty-one are sold or under contract, some to white families.
Nearby are 10 new single-family homes in a development called Terry Place, financed by Nationsbank and selling for up to $80,000. "It's the first new housing built in that neighborhood in an awful long time," said Jim Lientz, president of Nationsbank of Georgia. "It's certainly not without risk, but we can't build them fast enough."
In other neighborhoods near Olympic venues, Habitat for Humanity has built 100 houses for low-income residents, and the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades has painted 250 existing houses without charge.
But few of the newly constructed houses in Summerhill have been purchased by residents of the neighborhood, where the 1990 census showed that 93 percent of the 4,169 residents were black, 87 percent were renters, and the average per capita income was $5,694. Throughout the city, residents of about 150 households have been displaced by Olympic cleanup projects, often to better housing but in unfamiliar neighborhoods.
Gentrification remains a concern for neighborhood residents. But government leaders are more worried about how to maintain the momentum for development once the Olympics leave town.
"How can you keep the sense of urgency going without a date that you can't push back?" asked Richard A. Monteilh, executive director of the Metropolitan Atlanta Olympic Games Authority, a state oversight board. "That's what held us together all this time and that's the challenge that faces us now. My knowledge of human nature says that it's an uphill battle."

HEADLINE: A Field of Visions Is His Dream;
Catskills Man Sees Tourist Draw In World's Largest Kaleidoscope

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: SHANDAKEN, N.Y.

 BODY:
Wading hip-deep in the sparkling Esopus Creek, two men cast delicate trout flies into green swirling pools. In a forested retreat in the woods nearby, Zen Buddhists meditate.
A hundred yards away, inside a former grain silo painted with blue sky, white clouds and a pair of eyes, 12 tourists stand in darkness and throbbing music and stare up at a seemingly levitating orb of swirling patterns, including images of crouching American Indians, past presidents and marijuana leaves. 
 In the hills and valleys around the counterculture haven of Woodstock, almost anything goes. Even, with some grumbling, a walk-in kaleidoscope.
The psychedelic silo, billed as the world's largest example of the familiar tubular toy, opened earlier this month as the highlight of a new complex that combines elements of an art gallery, curio shop and restaurant and is aimed at revitalizing the sleepy tourism industry along the main corridor into New York's Catskill Park.
"It's amazing," said Norman Tecker, a visitor from Philadelphia who noticed the oddly decorated silo while driving along Route 28 with his wife, Edith. They paid $5 each for a 10-minute 13-second visual and sonic journey through American history, as interpreted by local artists and musicians.
"This comes right out of that movie," Mr. Tecker said, referring to "Field of Dreams." "Build it and they will come."
That was certainly the goal of Dean Gitter, the Catskills developer behind the $3 million complex, called Catskill Corners. Mr. Gitter, long considered by neighbors as something of a local P. T. Barnum, owns almost a mile of frontage on both Route 28 and the adjacent Esopus Creek.
Mr. Gitter said he believes that the only hope for reviving the local economy, which is reeling from 13 percent unemployment, lies in tourism. About 70 percent of Shandaken is taken up by state parkland, and development on the remaining acres will soon be constrained as New York City institutes stricter regulations in the region, which lies within the watershed of the city's Ashokan Reservoir.
Mr. Gitter, sporting a silver ponytail, a cigar and a polka-dot bow tie, was every bit the impresario as he mingled early in July with several dozen tourists who had been lured by the silo's staring eyes, painted by a Tibetan artist as a symbol of wisdom and harmony.
Harmonious was not a term many visitors used to describe the decor at the complex, which includes a restored 19th-century barn and farmhouse, a restaurant with a vintage firetruck emerging from a wall and a 20-foot-tall model of a trout leaping out of a muddy pond. The barn contains exhibitions of nature photography and the work of several painters.
Some neighbors have complained that Mr. Gitter sold the community on the plan by focusing on the restoration of the old farm buildings. "We were pretty hopeful that something wonderful would be there," said Kathy Nolan, a spokeswoman for the Zen Mountain Monastery, which has a 40-acre nature preserve across the creek from Mr. Gitter's land. But the final product leans too far toward the "carnivalesque," she said.
Particularly disturbing for visitors to the monastery, she said, are the eyes on the silo, which are meant to be the eyes of Buddha. "In India, this is an extremely important religious symbol," she said. "There, it's never used to sell kaleidoscopes."
But people stopping at Catskill Corners were at the very least amused, and in some cases awestruck, by the kaleidoscope.
In groups of up to 20, people entered the base of the silo and leaned against cushioned neck supports that allowed them to gaze straight up into a pool of darkness. Overhead was a 2.5-ton, 37-foot-tall pyramid of mirrors with a small triangular gap at its peak where video art played on a rear-projection screen. The mirrors multiplied the single video image into a circular cluster of 254 facets that appeared to be a total of 50 feet across. As one group of visitors settled in, they were bathed in light from a video display designed by Isaac Abrams, a pioneer in the psychedelic art movement of the 1960's, and his son, Raphael, a computer artist. The room pulsed with a musical score by Gary Burke, a local composer and drummer who has worked with Francis Ford Coppola and Bob Dylan.
Mr. Abrams, who calls the kaleidoscope the "first cathedral of the third millennium," said the cascade of fragmented images was a voyage through American history, from wilderness to world power. Mr. Abrams and his son are planning a new show for Christmas, and another that is purely meditative, with viewers lying supine on the floor.
Overhead, the shifting displays took on the look of an animated stained-glass window as they accelerated toward a crescendo. As the viewers gaped at the pulsing blob, they formed a pose remarkably like that struck by actors in films about encounters with alien spacecraft.
Leaving the silo, the visitors were ushered directly into the Kaleido store, where they were confronted with dozens of kaleidoscopes, rendered in everything from cardboard at $6.95 to hand-crafted alabaster, stained glass and rosewood costing up to $2,400.
The giant scope, which cost $250,000, was conceived three years ago out of frustration over what to do with an empty silo, Mr. Gitter said. In a conversation with his architect, he recalled, "I said, 'I don't know, why not make it into a giant kaleidoscope?' "
The architect took him seriously and soon they were in touch with Cozy Baker, the president of the Brewster Society, a Maryland group devoted to the appreciation of kaleidoscopes that is named for Sir David Brewster, the Scottish scientist who invented the optical contraptions in 1816.
Ms. Baker -- whose collection of 1,000 scopes includes a 12-foot-long model that, until now, was the world's largest -- immediately referred Mr. Gitter to Charles Karadimos, a stained-glass artist and kaleidoscope designer who had thought about turning a silo on his Maryland farm into a scope several years ago but lacked funds. "It's thrilling that this has finally come about," Ms. Baker said.
Mr. Karadimos has since returned to designing smaller variations, Ms. Baker said, including an 18-karat-gold, gem-encrusted kaleidoscope. It is the size of a lipstick case.

Jobless Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
For the second month in a row, New Jersey's unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent in June -- half a percentage point lower than it was in April, the state Labor Department reported yesterday. The state added 5,100 service jobs, but lost 2,600 jobs in manufacturing. Despite the improvement, New Jersey's unemployment rate exceeds the national rate, which was 5.3 percent in June.

German Data Lift Hopes For an Early Rate Cut

 BODY:
German money-supply growth slowed abruptly in June, the Bundesbank said yesterday, providing new evidence of a sluggish economy and fanning hopes for interest-rate cuts as soon as next week. The Bundesbank said the M-3 money supply, a leading indicator of inflation, grew at an annual rate of 9.6 percent in June, slowing from a 10.5 percent rate in May. 
 Many economists said the central bank might trim its chief money market rate, the 3.3 percent securities repurchase rate, by up to 20 basis points next Thursday, its last policy-making meeting before a four-week break. The repo rate, which sets a target for overnight lending and is comparable to the United States Federal funds rate, has been frozen since early February. (Bloomberg Business News)

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Rambling in Sleepy Hollow Country

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
WHILE I was waiting for a New York Waterway shuttle bus at West Houston Street and Seventh Avenue in Lower Manhattan on the last Friday in May, a man mistook me for a tourist and offered to give me directions. I was three blocks from my apartment.
But I was wearing a backpack and probably had a dazed expression, because I'd been trying to imagine what downtown New York looked like in 1789 -- when Washington Irving (then 6 years old) and his Scottish nurse ran into George Washington in a shop nearby. The President blessed the lad, who grew up to write "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and, under the name Diedrich Knickerbocker, "A History of New York," becoming one of America's first literary lions. 
 I was on my way to Sleepy Hollow country; the day was glorious and I had a ticket in my pocket for a New York Waterway Kykuit Cruise. It included a boat trip up the Hudson River to Tarrytown, with a late afternoon return to Pier 78 in New York; bus transportation and admission to Philipsburg Manor, a Dutch colonial farmhouse on the banks of the Pocantico River, and a tour of Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in the Sleepy Hollow hills above town -- all for $50 (though right after I booked the package the price went up to $60).
Another trip on the same boat, the Sleepy Hollow Cruise ($35), tours Philipsburg Manor and Sunnyside, Washington Irving's eclectic country home in Tarrytown. But tickets to Kykuit, which opened to visitors in 1994, are hard to come by. (In mid-July, Historic Hudson Valley, which handles Kykuit tours for $18 a person, had no Saturday tickets available until early August, and fall weekends were heavily booked.)
I'd decided to make a Knickerbocker holiday out of the one-day cruise by staying over in Tarrytown and taking a Metro-North train home (for $5.50 off-peak) three days later. While there, I'd visit the Sleepy Hollow restorations on foot, via the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, which meanders along the river all the way from the Croton Dam in Cortlandt to the IRT local subway stop at 242d Street in the Bronx (though finding the trail can be tricky from there).
 When I got tired, I would hop on the train for trips between villages like Tarrytown and Irvington, which lie about three miles apart. I could have rented a car and driven up from New York, but that didn't sound like half as much fun.
The New York Waterway shuttlebus dropped me in front of a tidy complex of gray clapboard buildings surrounded by a white picket fence at the end of West 38th Street. I paused in the souvenir shop and actually considered buying a snow globe with little plastic replicas of Manhattan sights like the Empire State Building inside (for $2.50). Instead, I lined up with about 80 sightseers to board the Robert Fulton, a 97-foot vessel with room for 275, built in 1993. It had an enclosed lower deck with a snack bar where other passengers picked up their enticing box lunches (preordered for $9.50) and I wolfed down two hot dogs (for $2.10 each).
I sat on the airy upper deck and listened as the guide pointed out the 392-foot Gothic belfry of Riverside Church, one of the many beneficences of the Rockefeller family that I was to appreciate during this trip; Spuyten Duyvil at the juncture of the Harlem and Hudson Rivers, evoking a time when Westchester County was the domain of Dutch overlords like Adriaen Van der Donck and Vredryck Flypsen; the stern-faced Palisades, which line the west bank of the Hudson for 14 miles; and the Tappan Zee Bridge at Tarrytown, spanning the river in a place so wide the Dutch thought it oceanic.
We made land an hour and a half later in Tarrytown. Two buses waited to take us to Philipsburg Manor in North Tarrytown, the core of the 52,000-acre estate granted to Vredryck Flypsen by William and Mary of England in 1693. The Kykuit tour was scheduled to depart from there at 1:20, which allowed just 45 minutes to see the sweet, whitewashed Dutch farmstead and mill that look like something out of a children's book -- with a fragrant kitchen garden, shady barn, dopey-eyed sheep and a spotted cow.
In the low-ceilinged manor house a guide in long skirts and a bonnet showed me antique maps, Delft ware and a Turkey carpet, and in the mill a fellow in dusty white breeches was teaching schoolchildren how to grind wheat. It reminded me of wandering at age 8 with my family through Colonial Williamsburg, which like Philipsburg Manor and the other Historic Hudson Valley properties, was salvaged and restored by John D. Rockefeller Jr.
His father, John D. Rockefeller, was born in 1839 in upstate New York and later started Standard Oil. The family moved first to West 54th Street in New York City, and then built a rather simple country retreat on the ridge above Tarrytown in 1908. But Kykuit did not stay simple for long; by 1913 it had become a 40-room Beaux Arts-style mansion, eventually surrounded by 3,000 acres of verdant farmlands and lush gardens -- bursting with rhododendrons in the spring.
As the Rockefeller financial empire grew, John D. Rockefeller Jr. filled Kykuit with an exquisite collection of Oriental ceramics. But the tastes of Nelson A. Rockefeller, former Governor of New York, are most apparent at Kykuit. The basement level of the house is a gallery of the modern art he collected, including Picasso tapestries, paintings by Robert Motherwell, and Andy Warhol silkscreen portraits of Nelson Rockefeller and his wife, Happy. Outside, along the Linden Allee, around the rose garden, and at the fringes of a putting green lie sculptures by Giacometti, Moore and Brancusi, among others -- relatives of those in the Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art, one of whose founders was Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the governor's mother.
Back on the bus to the boat two and a half hours later, I asked the driver to let me off in Tarrytown (technically it's not allowed). With map in hand, I headed about a mile up a steep hill surmounted by the beautiful blue dome of Butler Hall at Marymount College, where I'd reserved a room in a dorm for $25 a night. I'd learned that this was possible by reading a book called "On Campus U.S.A. and Canada." Indeed, all around New York City, colleges and universities like Fordham, Hofstra, SUNY Farmingdale and Concordia College in Bronxville offer dorm rooms to independent travelers in the summer for low prices. But they aren't always easy to book, because the educational institutions cater chiefly to conferences and groups and don't have the housekeeping resources of hotel chains.
Actually, there's a Courtyard by Marriott about two miles from Tarrytown (with weekend rates sometimes as low as $89), and a Hilton about a mile south of town (with attractive indoor and outdoor swimming pools and weekend specials for $125, including breakfast). The closest B & B's, the gracious Alexander Hamilton House in Croton-on-Hudson (where the least expensive double costs $95) and pleasant Krogh's Nest in Hartsdale (with double room rates that start at $65) were too far away to suit a walker like me. So it's slim pickings for frugal travelers on foot in the environs of Tarrytown -- as pretty a Hudson River village as ever there was, full of nice restaurants and antique shops, but in desperate need of its own B & B.
Marymount solved the accommodations problem for me admirably. The small liberal arts college for women founded in 1907 has a compact, handsomely landscaped campus with Hudson River views. From the window of my fourth-floor room in St. John's Hall (inhabited largely by international students the weekend I was there) I could watch the sky grow a mottled pink and the lights of the bridge twinkle over the darkening Tappan Zee.
The dorm room was bare but for two freshly made single beds, a desk and two bureaus. The large clean bathroom (towels and soap provided) adjoined both my room and the one next door, which was empty during my stay. (Some rooms share more traditional dorm-style communal bathrooms.)
There was no air-conditioning; the elevator was on the blink; and early on Saturday morning a prankster set off the fire alarm, which is why I found myself outside on the lawn in my pajamas at 4 A.M., listening to knots of students chatter in Italian, Russian and French. But there was an indoor pool on campus that I was free to use, and low-priced breakfasts were served at the Teahouse in Marian Hall. (It is closed for the summer, but at Rita Hall, which serves three meals a day, an all-you-can eat breakfast costs about $4.)
AT dinnertime, I sauntered down to Tarrytown, trying whichever eatery caught my fancy. A convivial pub on Broadway, Horsefeathers, served juicy cheeseburgers for $7.45, and at a rather fancy Brazilian Portuguese restaurant called Caravela I had a bowl of delicious shrimp soup and a half carafe of white wine, followed by a double order of delicately spiced mussels -- a splurge that cost $28. Another night, over a plate of London broil for $12.95 at the Main Street Cafe, the waitress told me that Rockefellers sometimes stopped by; when I asked how she knew, she said she could tell by their credit cards.
For three days, the weather remained gorgeous, which made a joy of my two-mile walk south (partly along the Aqueduct Trail and partly along busy Route 9) to Lyndhurst, a striking Gothic Revival mansion completed in 1866, owned by the railroad and telegraph magnate Jay Gould. During a tour of the extravagantly decorated house (for $7), with vaulted ceilings and light streaming in through Tiffany-style windows, a fellow sightseer whispered in my ear, "Rich or poor, it's good to have money."
Cozy, quirky Sunnyside, which lies right beside the river and the train tracks about a 15-minute walk away, is much more modest in scale. But in designing the house he shared with his brother and a passel of nieces, Washington Irving let his romantic imagination run free, decorating the simple cottage with weathervanes, wild wisteria vines, a quaint stepped roof and a Spanish tower. After my tour there (for $13, which included admission to Van Cortlandt Manor), I picnicked on the lawn, then strolled about a mile into Irvington, where I caught the train back to Tarrytown (for $1.75).
On Sunday I put on my go-to-meeting clothes and set out walking again, about two miles northeast of Marymount, to attend a service at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills, with breathtaking stained-glass windows designed by Matisse and Chagall, commissioned by various members of the Rockefeller family.
Then I rambled over paths in the Rockefeller State Park Preserve, listening for the hoofbeats of the Headless Horseman and winding up on Route 9 at the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, built in 1685; caught the train at Philipse Manor Station for a 10-minute ride to Croton (for $1.75); and toured graceful Van Cortlandt Manor, dating to the 1680's, situated at a bucolic spot where travelers on the Old Albany Post Road ferried over the Croton River. The house has a gently pitched roof, Dutch doors, Delft tiles around the fireplace in the dining room and a Van Cortlandt family Bible, dated 1710.
I won't say I didn't have a few blisters by the time I boarded the train for home. But I calculated that I had walked no more than 15 miles during my three days in Sleepy Hollow country -- and more to the point, spent only about $275, including the cruise, train tickets, house tours, lodgings and meals.
There's an old Rockefeller family proverb that says: "Willful waste makes woeful want." To this I'd add a corollary: Spend carefully, want nothing.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Age Pays Off, If You Ask

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
A CLERK taking your reservation is not going to ask if you are entitled to a senior discount. So if you are shy, you may pay more than necessary for a flight, a night or a bite. You get no discount if you don't ask.
This may be a psychological hazard. For example, I was delighted to get a Metrocard for the New York City transit system: With a picture and a "senior citizen" label on the back, this card lets me ride the bus or subway for half fare -- 75 cents. But I got a rude shock when I swiped the card through a display mechanism, which said "elderly"! Me, elderly? I was not the only unhappy traveler. Termaine Garden, a Transit Authority spokesman, said the electronic display of "elderly" was changed to "senior citizen" about June 1, after many complaints. 
 Senior citizenship has a varying entry age. For most discounts provided by Government agencies, the age is 65, when one is eligible for a Medicare card, which is used as essential identification. For airline discounts, it is usually 62. For hotel discounts, the age is a youthful 50.
Here is basic information about discounts you can ask for on airlines and in hotels. Always ask, preferably when making reservations.

 
 
Coupons Clip Air Fares
 The airlines' plain-vanilla discount is 10 percent off any ticket price for travelers 62 or over. If you have just turned 62, tell your travel agent to note it in your personal record so you do not miss out. Most airlines give the same discount to a senior traveler's companion.
A better value for costly trips is a senior coupon book: The seven major airlines sell coupon books to those 62 and older, and sometimes to their travel companions. Except for a USAir child's program, only the identified holder can use a coupon, and the younger companion can use coupons only on the same itinerary. This way you may get a one-way trip to the opposite coast for $135 or less. The coupons come in books of four -- and books of eight, at a still-cheaper rate, now only on Trans World Airlines and Continental. The coupons expire in a year. Reservations must be made at least 14 days ahead.
Coupons may be used for a one-way trip, meaning travelers need not stay over a Saturday night although a return reservation must still be made 14 days ahead.
The 10 percent Federal tax on airline tickets lapsed and was not in force in mid-July. Except for Continental, the airlines have accordingly reduced coupon costs 10 percent.
T.W.A. sells books of four coupons for $498, or $124.50 a trip; eight for $938, or $117.25 each. One coupon is needed each way in the lower 48 states, to Puerto Rico, Mexico or the Dominican Republic; two each way for travel to Hawaii. The four-coupon book comes with a voucher good for a 20 percent discount on a trip to Europe; two vouchers are in the eight-coupon book. A companion traveling with the senior traveler may buy coupon books, too, but at a cost $100 higher for either book. Call (800) 221-2000.
Continental did not subtract 10 percent from its coupon prices when the Federal tax lapsed; the price for a book of four coupons is $579; eight, $999. One coupon is needed each way for travel in the United States and Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Bermuda; two for Alaska, Hawaii. There are holiday blackouts. In addition, Continental has a program permitting virtually unlimited travel -- one trip a week -- for a specified period. This Freedom Passport costs $999 for a four-month domestic pass; $1,999 for a 12-month pass; the world passes cost $4,499 for 12 months. Companions of any age may buy passes at the same price, but must travel with the primary holder. These also have blackout dates. (800) 441-1135.
American has a four-coupon book for $541. One coupon is needed each way for travel in the lower 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; two for Hawaii. There are no blackout days. (800) 237-7981.
Northwest sells a book of four coupons for $540, with no blackout dates. A trip in the lower 48 states, to Canada or to Puerto Rico requires one coupon each way; two coupons are needed each way for Hawaii or Alaska. (800) 225-2525.
United Airlines sells four coupons for $541. One coupon allows a trip in the lower 48 states; two are needed each way for Alaska or Hawaii. A blackout period applies to Hawaii, Dec. 15 to Jan. 10. (800) 633-6563.
USAir sells four coupons for $542. One or two children 2 to 11 may also use the coupons when they accompany the senior traveler. One coupon each way is needed in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico or Virgin Islands. One coupon provides a round trip between Florida cities. (800) 428-4322.
Delta sells its book of four coupons for $542. One coupon is needed each way for travel in the lower 48 states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; two each way for Alaska or Hawaii. No blackout dates. (800) 221-1212.
Most foreign airlines provide only the basic 10 percent discount. British Airways has an important plus. Starting at age 60, it waives the fee for change of flight and the penalty for canceling a reservation before the trip begins. (800) 247-9297.

 
 
Hotel Deals Vary
 Rare is the hotel that does not give at least 10 percent off for members of the American Association of Retired Persons or its Canadian equivalent, the Canadian Association of Retired Persons, and bear in mind that this requires only that you be 50. Ten percent is roughly a standard discount; younger people who belong to the Automobile Association of America frequently get the same thing. Ask when you reserve, and when you arrive.
Joan Rattner Heilman, author of the standard compendium on senior discounts, now in its eighth edition, considers Marriott, Omni and Choice to provide the best deals for seniors.
Marriott will provide a 50 percent discount on available rooms at 200 hotels for A.A.R.P. members in return for a pretty stiff requirement: reserve and pay 21 days in advance, no refunds possible. (800) 228-9290.
The Omni plan applies at most of its hotels in the United States and Mexico. It provides a 50 percent discount for A.A.R.P. members making reservations. (800) 843-6664.
Lodgings in the Choice chain -- Clarion, Comfort, Quality, Sleep, Friendship, Econo Lodges and Rodeway -- provide a 30 percent discount for those over 50 who reserve in advance and ask for it. (800) 221-2222.
Ms. Heilman's book, with the mind-boggling title "Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50" (Contemporary Books), is sold in most bookstores for $9.95. Morton Booksellers, 812 Stuart Avenue, Mamaroneck, N.Y. 10543, sells it by mail for $13.
If you are 50 and A.A.R.P. has not sent an invitation to join you can receive one by writing to 601 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049. Membership costs $8 a year for one person or two at the same address.
Because there are now 32 million A.A.R.P. members, hotel clerks tend to assume everyone of a certain age belongs. When a hotel provides an A.A.R.P. discount, and I reach for my wallet, the clerk usually waives this formality. If you are youthful-looking and forgot your card, clerks will usually accept a driver's license with a birth date on it.

HEADLINE: Strangers in a Familiar Land

BYLINE: By SUZANNE BERNE; SUZANNE BERNE teaches writing at Harvard University.

 BODY:
FOR every single summer of my childhood, my family packed a stack of suitcases in late June and traveled up the East Coast to a foggy little seaside town on Cape Cod, and there we remained until Labor Day. In that same town my uncle and cousins and grandfather were also "summer people," and had been for years. My great-grandfather had summered on Cape Cod as far back as the turn of the century. But the year I turned 8, my father -- who loved the Cape and hated the end of summer -- made the radical decision not to migrate in September with everyone else we knew. He put our house in Virginia up for sale (our "real house," as I persisted in thinking of it); my younger sister and I were enrolled in the local public school, and it was understood that from now on we were no longer summer people, we were "year-rounders."
On the first day of school I was surrounded on the playground and accused of being a summer person. I had been sighted on a sailboat; my family was a known summer family. "Bet your dad has a million bucks," one girl said, dark eyes narrowing. A grim-faced boy said, "Bet you have a swimming pool." I protested that neither was true. No one believed me. "So what's your dad do?" growled the first child. My father happened to be writing a book; dimly I realized this answer would not serve. "He stays home," I admitted at last, because it was all I could think to say. My classmates decided my father must be unemployed and that I was therefore all right, and no one accused me of being a summer person anymore. 
 My new status lasted only until Thanksgiving, when my father accepted a teaching job in Washington, D.C., and so I offer this anecdote to illustrate the worst aspect of being a summer person, which is what I have been ever since.
It involves, for me at least, a certain disequilibrium, the sliding impression that I may not be wanted where I want to be. In my experience, the inhabitants of resort towns resent summer residents. Summer people are frequently perceived as rich (richer than the townspeople, anyway), imperious, demanding and possessive about any available body of water. With summer people come squadrons of Volvo station wagons and Ford Tauruses, parades of golf pants and boat shoes, whole arsenals of flashy sports equipment. With summer people come the necessity for beach stickers and reservations at restaurants and venomous disputes over whether it's trespassing to walk below the high-tide line.
In the fall, I've been told, when the summer people and the tourists decamp, those who are left feel Cape Cod is theirs again. And herein lies the paradox of being a summer person: you can be deeply, passionately, even historically attached to a place that considers you an invader. No matter how many years you have been a colonist, the colony will never be yours. On Labor Day, smiling Cape residents crowd the overpasses along jammed Route 6, holding aloft hand-lettered signs that read: "See you next summer!" and "Bye Bye!" Some farewells are not so good-natured. My mother knows of a hardware-store owner on the Cape who, when asked by a wealthy dowager what on earth the local residents did after the summer folk departed, replied: "Madam, we fumigate." This story may be apocryphal, but the sentiment is not. That many resort-town residents rely on seasonal visitors for their livelihood does not always increase their affection.
Then again, many summer people appear to regard year-rounders as a kind of grumpy servant class that exists to mow lawns and sell overpriced groceries. A friend who became a year-rounder on Martha's Vineyard a decade ago once pointed out that summer people either behave too familiarly in their negotiations with the natives -- the "feudal lord approach" she called it -- or ignore them altogether. Summer people, she concluded, "don't really see the people who live where they vacation."
But here's another paradox: despite whatever complaints they engender, summer people love their summer homes, love them perhaps more carefully and inhabit them more thoroughly than where they live the rest of the year.
Our summer place on the Cape, for instance, is where we pay attention to tide charts and cirrus clouds, to the shifting sun and the smell of rain, where we forget to turn on the evening news and listen instead to mourning doves sighing in the locust trees. Our summer place is where both my husband and I might be home in the middle of the day in the middle of the week, where the baby cries less and the dog loses weight. Our summer place is really my mother's house, which she bought years ago after my parents divorced; she wanted to make sure that she would always have a place on Cape Cod. On some weekends my sisters and I all sleep down the hall from each other, nearly one family once again.
A summer place is home the way home ought to be, or so nostalgia tells us. This is the life, people say while on vacation, meaning they feel untroubled and gratified. This is the life, they murmur, already wistful. Because it is the life -- the one we dream of having on snowy afternoons in February when the children have fevers and there's nothing for dinner and you find yourself staring out the window, imagining warm green grass and a reach of bright water.
AND yet, to be a summer person is to be at odds with your summer home for the simple fact that it's regarded as temporary, and there is in all homes an intrinsic demand that you stay there. Even if, as in my case, that summer home helped determine where you chose to settle. You may love your summer home more than anywhere else in the world, but you would not say "I am from Cape Cod," if you live in New York or Boston most of the time; you do not claim to be of a summer place. Your intimacy is always limited, always a summer love, which must make your brief appropriation of that place all the more galling to its more constant denizens.
Even the term "summer person" implies someone transient, feckless, a fair-weather friend. A summer person is something more than a tourist and less than a resident, a kind of lingering house guest who stays a week or a month or a clutch of long weekends. When one set of summer people returns to their real home, they are usually succeeded by other summer people in the same house, who themselves will be succeeded, and so on. No one mourns their absence. And still each family has its own special claim to this place that they imagine will renew them, and often, amazingly, it does.
The year I turned 8, when our experiment in living year round on the Cape ended so quickly, I was sorry to leave. I'd grown to like my classmates and felt they liked me, too. The day before I left they gave me a farewell present, a little Scholastic paperback about Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan. I was touched and kept the book for years. It's only now that I begin to wonder at its subject, which of course was the relationship of an impoverished young teacher and a rich deaf-and-blind child. I'm sure the book was an innocent choice. On the flyleaf was written, in cherry-pink Magic Marker, "See you next summer."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Sidney J. Holbrook;
Clean Air, Clean Water, Tough Rules

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
SIDNEY J. HOLBROOK manages 1,100 employees and a $90 million budget in an effort to keep the state's air and water clean, the fish and wildlife healthy. As Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, he is also responsible for boating safety, hunting, controlling forest fires and monitoring Long Island Sound. The department also oversees its own saw mill in Portland Depot to supply boards for picnic tables and a 13-acre seedling nursery in Voluntown.
"Some people complain about the stringency of the environmental regulations here but I think it helps to to establish a quality of life in Connecticut that is second to none," Mr. Holbrook said. "You can feel safe breathing the air and drinking the water." 
 Mr. Holbrook came to the job early last year after 12 years in the State House of Representatives, including 10 years as Republican whip. Recently, he discussed some of the challenges his agency faces in an interview at his Hartford office. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. Could Connecticut's parks, forests and beaches be better utilized?
A. Connecticut has 126 parks and forests and they are absolutely a hidden treasure. Although at this agency 80 percent of the focus is on air, water and waste, personally my love is natural resources and outdoor recreation. I try to get out every week or so to a different park.
We are responsible for four state beaches -- Sherwood Island, Rock Neck, Hammonasset and Silver Sands in Milford. Local beaches are the responsibility of the municipalities and the Department of Health. By next year Silver Sands, the newest park, will have better beach access, better parking, new dunes, a beach and boardwalk.
Our campgrounds were sold out over Memorial Day. They're doing very well. The staff does a good job even though the staffing is thin. Currently 50 percent of the staff in wildlife management are prisoners.
 Q. Will the state add new parks?
A. I believe there will be new parks, yes. Will they be the kind of parks we think of in the traditional way? Probably not.
What we are doing in some of our state forests is developing more recreational areas that in essence turn those into parks. We're working more with utility companies to obtain easements and make their land available to public access. They have a tremendous amount of land. They have been very receptive to opening their lands. It doesn't have to necessarily be managed by us. The goal, the bottom line, is to provide more space to the public.
We work in partnership with groups like the Nature Conservancy that has acquired much land. A good example is Selden Island where we acquired an easement on an island in the Connecticut River.
Q. What about the urban areas?
A. We have a program where we work with the alternative incarceration program. It's about 14 months old. We go into cities to illegal dumping sites, lots that have been abandoned, and restore the sites to as pristine a quality as we possibly can.
These people, parolees or those sentenced to perform community service, clean and restore the sites in New Haven, Bridgeport and Hartford. We have cleaned up over 150 sites.
We find that when the sites are cleaned up they are not trashed again. I personally would like to see these sites stay more focused on nature than recreation but this is something the cities have to determine.
Q. What is the quality of Connecticut's air this summer?
A. With deregulation and restructuring of Midwestern power generating plants we have a problem. They don't have the same regulations or requirements as we do here in New England. They generate a tremendous amount of pollutants.
We have close monitoring of all emissions into the air within Connecticut. The Toxic Release Inventory released by the E.P.A. showed Connecticut is the leader in New England as far as reduction of toxic releases by industry -- 69 percent since 1988.
Q. Does your agency have any role in the possible power shortage this summer?
A. We only get involved in making sure they burn the cleanest fuels they can and that they come up with a conservation plan. The power companies are going to open some of their old fossil fuel facilities. They are supposed to do public service announcements to let people know if there is a problem with the demand going up and the generation down. I think it's important for the public to aware that this is a serious situation. We have basically lost our main source of generation in the state through the loss of Millstone. We hope for a cool summer.
Q. Some people believe that Connecticut is too densely populated for hunting to be safe. Do you think so?
A. Absolutely not. I don't believe that at all. There are certain laws and requirements that insure that safety of people is the No. 1 concern. We have setback requirements as far as shooting from roads and from homes or any dwelling.
We have a tremendous amount of state forests that are available to hunting. There's a lot of private lands open to hunting but it is constantly diminishing. That's why we try to constantly look for lands that we can buy or obtain through easements to make available to the sportsmen of the state.
Hunting is not only a sport but a wildlife management tool. We were embroiled in a controversy about a controlled deer hunt at Bluff Point in Groton. The deer population got out of control and we had hunters go in and take the deer. Some people actually suggested we release cougars in there. It was a very difficult time for me personally because I was harassed. It was a hot one.
Canada geese cause problems. We think one of the reasons we have had high coliform counts at Rocky Neck Sate Park is due to the number of geese there and the fecal matter getting into the water. We've had to close the beach already.
It is my intention to establish a hunting season on them this year. Last year the season was closed by the Federal authorities. Those were migratory geese. The geese we have are basically staying there.
Q. Will this be a bad summer for mosquitoes?
A. Here in Connecticut we have one of the only tidal wetland restoration programs in effect. We take out phragmites to keep a flow moving in and out of the tidal wetlands. That is long-term control because without stagnant water the mosquitoes can't breed.
As far as the short-term solution goes, we do not have the funds to do anything and I believe it falls under the Department of Health's jurisdiction. The municipalities also have to take steps.
Q. What is the condition of the Sound?
A. I lived in Westbrook all my life. I boated, swam, fished in the Sound. The advancements that have been made in over 25 years have been phenomenal. It is much cleaner.
Nonetheless, it is a never-ending battle. The storm sewers and the sanitary sewers are connected and when rain overloads them there is automatic discharge from the sewage treatment plants. We are putting in sediment basins, traps to catch oil, sand and debris that would normally flow out to the Sound. We are requiring this of all new construction and also where retrofitting is planned.
Statistics show that places where the environment is not kept clean there is an effect on the economy. Where regulations are adhered to that the economies are better. Long Island Sound is a perfect example of that. Think of the boating industry, the fishing industry. Think of the tourism, the restaurants. The Sound is a $5 billion asset. The Sound is not only Connecticut's greatest natural resource, it is Connecticut's greatest economic resource. That's dependent upon a healthy, clean Long Island Sound.
Q. What about chemical contaminants like mercury and P.C.B.'s?
A. Mercury is ubiquitous. It is due to out-of-state air pollution and to the inadequate disposal of fluorescent light bulbs. We have just permitted a new recycling facility in Windsor for a private company to recycle fluorescent light bulbs. It will be the first one in the state. A new mercury study by the E.P.A. is due out in November that will tell us a lot.
P.C.B.'s usually come from industrial pollution, especially in the Housatonic. We believe these are chemicals that industry put in the water in Massachusetts, although Connecticut did contribute to the problem.
Q. What is the status of the Superfund program to clean up toxic waste?
A. We have a lot of SuperFund sites; the Raymark site is almost completed. It is very expensive to deal with these sites. Who funds this cleanup?
There is some concern that the insurance companies are paying more than their fair share and that the liability is not being spread out enough.
It is a very difficult issue for me. It's actually a Federal concern. Without question these sites have to be cleaned up. It comes down to whether you want to fund it through tax dollars or do you want to fund it through business and industry. I am not a hundred percent convinced it should be funded directly through industry. I don't think it's fair that the public pick up the tab either. There's got to be some kind of balance.

HEADLINE: The View From: Greenburgh;
Ballroom Dancing Is Just a Step Away From the Olympics

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: GREENBURGH

 BODY:
HIGH diving or broad jumping it is not, but ballroom dancing is athletic. So say proponents of the pursuit, observing that, like figure skating, it takes excellent muscle control, coordination and stamina. Indeed, for the first time ever, ballroom dancing has received provisional recognition from the International Olympic Committee.
That does not mean that when the games opened in Atlanta last Friday, men and women in tuxedos and ball gowns were waltzing through competitions. Not yet. Within a few years, however, they could be competing alongside other athletes for gold, silver and bronze medals. 
 This is good news for those who love to tango and fox-trot, who love the mambo and the merengue. Betty Diamond, an instructor at and co-owner of Guys N' Dolls dance studio on Tarrytown Road here, said: "Ballroom dancing is a sport. It has an esthetic component, but it is also very athletic." Interestingly, she said that dances known as "smooth" -- waltz, fox trot -- actually take more intense muscle control than those in the Latin category -- cha-cha, samba, and so forth -- which entail a lot of fast, showy footwork. "In smooth dancing especially, you're using a lot of muscle control," she said. "It's more subtle, but also more rigorous. Ankles, thighs, hips, shoulders -- all must be in perfect control."
On a recent night at Guy N' Dolls, Ms. Diamond and another instructor and owner, Don Fischer, demonstrated. Mr. Fischer had on white tie and tails; Ms. Diamond was wearing a gown specifically designed for ballroom dancing, a confection of white silk and rhinestones with plunging back and swinging skirt. On her feet were white satin shoes, each studded with 288 rhinestones, which she had applied by hand.
As the strains of "Lara's Theme" from "Doctor Zhivago" came from the sound system, Ms. Diamond and Mr. Fischer whirled around the 3,500-square-foot room in a graceful waltz. After the applause ended, they asked the men and women attending their weekly Friday group lesson and dance party to line up for a little practice.
"One-two-three, one-two-three," Ms. Diamond intoned rhythmically, sounding like Anna in "The King and I" when she was teaching the King of Siam to dance. "One-two-three, back-back-back, step back, ladies, curve back with your gentleman partners, one-two-three."
Although Guys N' Dolls has been open only a year and a half, it has already gained a following. The studio offers private and group lessons as well as weekly dance parties and special events. Recently they held a Red Shoes Night in which anyone wearing red shoes was admitted for half price. Although some come in casual clothes, there are plenty of men who wear suits and ties to the dance parties and women who show up in short, glittery dresses. Some people come in pairs; others hope to find the right dance partner when they get there. "Ballroom dancing is a wonderful social activity," Marian Reilly, another of the owners, said. "It's not like going to a bar or being part of a singles' scene."
Ms. Reilly added that ballroom dancing "saved my life." A trim, energetic woman who will say only that she's in her 30's, she came to America from Ireland 10 years ago. Several years later she found herself going through a rough divorce and needing not only income -- she works as a waitress during the day -- but also a place to escape her loneliness. She began going to ballroom dance classes and parties and, 18 months ago, decided to open her own studio. Her partners are Mr. Fischer, Ms. Diamond, who also owns a title insurance company, and Dennis Satriani, who is also with Ms. Diamond's title company.
"When you learn to ballroom dance, you really are accomplishing something: you're learning a craft," Ms. Reilly said. "I went to a wedding last week; they had hired this lovely 10-piece band, and here were all these people out on the floor who couldn't dance."
No such problems loomed for the group at Guys N' Dolls on a recent Friday night. Among them were Esperanza Blair, a 43-year-old who works in finance, and Syrus Partian, 44, a chiropractor. Ms. Blair, a petite woman with dark hair cut Cleopatra style, was wearing a batik cotton sarong and the requisite dance shoes (suede soles for better traction), Mr. Partian had on men's suede-soled dance shoes and stylishly cut slacks. Together they did the rumba, the tango, the cha-cha and the Lindy, looking both like accomplished professionals and like a couple between whom romantic sparks were flying.
"We met here when the place first opened, and now we live together," Ms. Blair said. "But when we first danced together we were actually fighting. I felt he wasn't dancing well enough!"
Alpha Chiang, a 69-year-old economics professor and author, and his wife, Emily, 64, were married long before they began ballroom dancing, but now, they say, it is one of their favorite shared activities. "Usually, it's the woman who has to convince her husband to come dancing," Mr. Chiang said. "But I'm dragging her here every day. I'm supposed to be preparing a textbook on mathematical economics, but I'd rather be here dancing."
Elaine Warshaw, a teacher who would not reveal her age, said she leaves her husband, a lawyer, at home when she comes to Guys N' Dolls. The New Orleans native does a mean Lindy and, she said, she has music in her blood. "My husband's very cerebral, so I come here and dance with my teachers."
Lisl Deak also dances with the instructors. Like Mrs. Warshaw, Mrs. Deak would not reveal her age, but she did say that she is a widow, that her late husband, Nicholas, was in international banking and that she lives at the Westchester Country Club in Rye. And this evening she was impeccably dressed in a full white-and-black silk skirt, a black silk blouse and pearls; it is the type of outfit, she said, that she wears three nights a week to Guys N' Dolls. "I dance with Don, my teacher; we do very well together," she said. "I particularly like the waltz. I enjoy it here. It is my second life."

HEADLINE: Wage Bill's Rule on Tax-Free Bonds Could Dampen Plans for Lilco

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A PROVISION in the minimum-wage bill could mean the loss of some tax-exempt financing for Lilco, a move that could cost customers more than $30 million a year, officials have warned.
The provision is being challenged by Senators Patrick D. Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato, who have said they will try to revise the final bill that emerges from a House-Senate conference. 
 The provision, backed by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, William V. Roth, Republican of Delaware, involves changes in how utilities issue tax-exempt bonds.
The changes would benefit the Delmarva Power and Light Company of Wilmington, Del., which serves Delaware, Maryland and Virginia. That utility wants to avoid retroactive penalties on previously sold exempt bonds if it expands its gas business beyond two counties in Delaware.
The potentially negative effects in New York affect the Consolidated Edison and Brooklyn Union Gas Companies, as well as Lilco.
Mr. D'Amato's office estimated that the provision could cost New Yorkers $65 million a year, including the $30 million on Long Island, by requiring the refinancing of some of the billions of dollars in outstanding tax-exempt bonds.
"Without these tax-exempt bonds the cost of borrowing money would increase and that would increase the cost of electricity," said a spokeswoman for Lilco, Andrea Staub.
Mr. D'Amato, calling the proposal "an outrage," said, "Make no mistake about it, this is a back-door tax increase on residents of Long Island, New York City and Westchester County."
Leaders of the Long Island Power Authority, the state agency in charge of carrying out a rate-reduction plan, said they expected that the legislation would be changed in the final bill. "I heard it was dead duck," the chairman, Frank L. Zarb, said.
But in a letter to Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Moynihan this month, the chairmen of three utilities -- William J. Catacosinos of Lilco, Eugene R. McGrath of Con Edison and Robert B. Catell of Brooklyn Union -- wrote:
"This is a matter of utmost importance to each of us and the customers we serve. Any action that jeopardizes our ability to issue lower-cost financing will have an adverse effect on our effort to improve the economy and job- enhancement prospects for the region."
The executives said that the changes "could jeopardize the basis on which existing bonds were issued and require unwarranted refundings and millions of additional costs to New York utility customers" and would "create confusion in an already complex realm."
Touching on issues that could be crucial for Lilco and any plan for a state take-over of the utility, the letter said the revision would create uncertainties about the tax liabilities of "successors in interest."
The former chairman of the power authority, Richard M. Kessel, now a trustee of the agency, said Congressional interest in limiting tax-exempt financing in general was casting a shadow on state takeover plans for Lilco.
"If it is the desire of Congress to cut off tax-exempt utility financing," Mr. Kessel said, "that may make it impractical or even impossible for the authority to raise billions of dollars on the tax-exempt market."
Mr. Kessel said the new provision would mean an rate increase of 1 to 1.5 percent on Long Island.
Another tax issue could also affect a plan to reduce rates that the trustees of the power authority approved in February. That plan, shich Gov. George E. Pataki supported, envisions the sale of Long Island Lighting Company generators to other companies and the sale by the authority of $4.5 billion in tax-exempt bonds to buy Lilco transmission and distribution systems and to refinance the utility's debt. It projected an initial rate reduction of 12 percent. But negotiations between the authority and Lilco have stalled, pending an advisory opinion from the Internal Revenue Service on whether Lilco would face a $2 billion capital-gains tax on the sale of assets. If the I.R.S. denies an exemption, the plan would be highly unfavorable for Lilco and its shareholders.
Mr. Zarb, the top Federal energy official in the Ford Administration, said Lilco executives consulted last week in Washington with Treasury Department officials and would soon submit a formal inquiry to request a clarification of the tax questions.
The authority, Mr. Zarb added, would move ahead regardless of the I.R.S. opinion. "We are going to do something to improve the situation, and if the I.R.S doesn't do what they should do, then we are working on other options," he said. "There are other avenues available to us."
Mr. Zarb and his new executive director, Seth D. Hulkower, said they would not discuss the options before the I.R.S. issued its opinion. "I don't want to prejudice any of the negotiations by discussing these matters too early," Mr. Hulkower, a former vice president of Merrill International, an energy company in Massachusetts, said. "But we have alternatives if we are not happy with the I.R.S. opinion. The final plan will promote competition in the supply of electricity. But we are working on the details of how that would actually come to pass." he said.
Mr. Hulkower, who grew up in Port Washington and lives in Manhattan, said he expected a "structure" that would provide "double-digit rate reduction, a safe reliable system and the introduction of competitive pressure to the electric-supply system on Long Island" by the end of the year. "But all the transactions involved will take longer than that," he said.
Mr. Hulkower dismissed a suggestion that the authority, created in 1986 to alleviate high rates, appeared to continue to be at the beginning in its efforts for reductions. "A lot of people have been involved with this over time," he said. "It is a cumulative process."
Mr. Kessel said the plan that the board approved in February had been set aside. "That plan is gone," he said. "It isn't even being discussed. There is going to have to be an alternative."
Mr. Kessel said last week that he frequently spoke with Mr. Zarb and knew confidential information about possible alternative plans, but would not comment on them. "It's probably better to wait until we come up with something that makes sense," he said.
Mr. Zarb, whom Mr. Pataki appointed as chairman of the Republican-controlled board to succeed James F. Gill, has made an effort to consult with Democrats, including Mr. Kessel.
Lilco has declined to comment on negotiations with the authority that could lead to disbanding or a buyout of the utility. Ms. Staub denied a report that Mr. Catacosinos had asked the authority to lay aside any plans and make its best offer to buy the common stock.
An energy economist, Charles M. Studness of Manhasset, said the secrecy surrounding the plans was troubling. "Are people trying to do something in the public interest, or is there a hidden political agenda?" Mr. Studness asked. "Any Long Island person has to wonder how much of this is being driven by Wall Street and how much by the interests of Long Island."
He said Wall Street interests were served by any plan that would produce large fees for financiers and lawyers.
Mr. Studness said the State Public Service Commission could offer a quicker and less expensive solution by cutting rates. "Even with a favorable tax ruling," he said, "I don't think Lipa could achieve as large a reduction in rates as you could have through P.S.C. action and competition."
The commission is reviewing the rate structure and other financial issues.
Asked whether he agreed that the commission could lower rates sooner and more quickly than the authority, Mr. Zarb said he could not make an evaluation and was concentrating on what the authority could do. Mr. Zarb said he was perplexed by criticisms by the chairman of the Assembly Energy Committee, Paul D. Tonko, Democrat of Schenectady. Mr. Tonko said Mr. Zarb was one of several advisers on Mr. Pataki's transition team in 1994, a panel that issued a report opposing a large tax-exempt bond issue to lower Lilco rates.
Mr. Tonko said Mr. Zarb now appeared to be embracing a plan that entailed such a bond issue and was contrary to the report. "He inherited something that he probably never would have endorsed," said Mr. Tonko, who opposed the envisioned sale of tax-exempt authority bonds. He said regulated competition between private companies was a better way to lower rates.
Mr. Zarb said the report had "pretty much the same observations that you would make today."
"I have no idea what that was all about," he said of Mr. Tonko's criticisms.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Union Square;
And Now, Offices Blossom Around the Revived Park

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
"WHEN we opened in 1985, people said we were crazy to put a restaurant in this neighborhood and crazier to name it after Union Square Park," said Paul Bolles-Beaven, managing partner of the Union Square Cafe.
The restaurant, at 21 East 16th Street, has since become a fixture in the neighborhood, which has undergone a renaissance in recent years. The improvements in restaurants and retail stores are being reflected in a demand for nearby office space, which is now considered an attractive alternative to midtown. 
 A greenmarket operates in the park four days a week, giving city dwellers an opportunity to stock up on fresh produce, baked goods, flowers, fish and meat and bringing middle class people to a park the once seemed occupied by the homeless.
Retailers such as Barnes & Noble have taken long-vacant buildings and turned them into attractive places to shop. "That building that Barnes & Noble is in now was a total eyesore on the north side of the square," said Barbara Roberts, president of FPG International, a stock photography company on the east side of the square.. "When we moved here in February of '91, it seemed like half the real estate was vacant and we were the only ones here," she added.
Lured by the increasingly welcoming ambiance of the area, new restaurants have opened, which has had increased pedestrian traffic even further.
"This is a destination now," said Steve Hansen, who opened the Blue Water Grill seafood restaurant in an old bank building facing the park three months ago. "People know if they cannot get into restaurant A, they can walk a few feet and go to restaurant B or restaurant C."
Mr. Hansen said he was investing $2 million to remodel the facility, which will have 140 tables on three levels when renovation of a downstairs floor is completed.
"With all the improvements that have been made, the Union Square area has become a hip part of New York both day and night," said Glenn Markman, a senior managing director of the Grubb & Ellis, N.Y., brokerage firm.
"You have publishers, advertising agencies, marketing firms and Internet companies interested because it feels different from midtown or downtown, for that matter," he said.
"Midtown is too sterile for a lot of people," said Martin Turchin, vice chairman of Edward S. Gordon Company. Discussing Midtown South, which the Gordon company defines as the area between 23rd Street and City Hall, Mr. Turchin said: "In the past people moved there for lower rents. Now they go for a better neighborhood."
IT was Mr. Turchin who brokered the decision by C.S. First Boston to lease 1.1 million square feet of space at 11 Madison Avenue between 24th and 25th Streets, in a building owned by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. More recently, Emanuel/Emanuel Ungaro decided to move out of the garment district and lease 75,000 square feet, or most of the 10th floor, of the same building.
"Because of First Boston, Met Life said it would spend $300 million to rehabilitate the building," said Joseph A. Fabrizi, an associate director of Cushman & Wakefield. "That was a major commitment to the neighborhood. It said that it was acceptable enough for your employees to go there everyday and leave after dark."
He said Union Square, which sits atop the major subway station in the area, was formerly considered so unsafe that most employers did not even consider the area. "Ten years ago you could not give space away around there," Mr. Fabrizzi said. "The B.I.D. had a lot to do with cleaning the area up."
That group, formally the 14th Street-Union Square Business Improvement District, has crews that sweep streets and security guards that patrol on bicycle and foot to ease the concerns of workers, shoppers and residents. Like other such organizations, it is supported by special taxes from local businesses to supply services that have been scaled back by the city.
"I see real estate advertisements now that say 'view of Union Square Park,' said Robert W. Walsh, the executive director of the group. "That's something that was not mentioned in the past."
He said that, in addition to the retail developments, the area had been enhanced by hospitals, which are trying to move their services closer to their customers. When an earlier tenant collapsed, Beth Israel Medical Center bought the commercial space at Zeckendorf Towers, which faces the park from the east, and converted it into an ambulatory-care unit with 20 separate offices for doctors..
He said educational institutions provided another economic engine for the area, with New York University and the New School nearby. N.Y.U. has purchased the site of the old Luchow's restaurant on 14th Street and has said it plans to use it to build student housing.
In another improvement, the city is rebuilding the subway station under the park, to improve accessibility and attractiveness, with completion expected by 1998.
If the building at 11 Madison Avenue is one of the economic anchors of the area, it is also untypical. Built as the base of what was originally intended to be a taller tower, the building has some floors with almost 100,000 square feet of space.
M OST of the buildings in this area are older with floorplates of 10,000 to 20,000 square feet," said David Goldstein, a broker with Julian J. Studley. He said the issue of Class A versus Class B space was essentially nonexistent.
"Class A generally implies new construction," he said. "Most of the buildings here are older and in their second and third generation."
Nevertheless, Class A is the category the 64-year-old 11 Madison Avenue will be marketed in because of the renovation, said Mark Mandell, the building's leasing agent, who is with Cushman & Wakefield.
"We are having the facade cleaned, new windows installed and the entire guts of the building renewed," he said. "We will move it up to a Class A building. It will be a Midtown North quality building at rents that are a third less."
Brokers representing both landlords and tenants say that space is becoming harder to find and that effective rentals are increasing, largely by a reduction of the concessions packages offered by landlords during the recent period of slack demand. Most say rentals in Midtown South ranged from the $18 or $19 a square foot to $24 to $26 a square feet, compared to $24 or $25 to $30 to $31 a square foot in midtown.
I T is very tricky to compare one building to another and one submarket to another, but my gut says the spread is closer to $5 a foot than $8 or $10 a foot," said Mr. Markman of Grubb & Ellis. "Overall concession packages are becoming smaller, with less free rent and effective rental rates are inching up."
"The vacancy rate in Midtown South is at about 10 percent and there is a scarcity of large blocks of space," said Mr. Goldstein, of Julien J. Studley firm, which represents tenants. "The scarcity of space is having an upward effect on rental rates due to fewer concessions."
But brokers and tenants say the urge to move to the area is motivated less by economics than by the chance to locate in a newly attractive neighborhood. "No one is going to be motivated to move for $5 a foot," said Mr. Turchin. "The decision is not solely about economics; lifestyle is important as well."
Ms. Roberts, of FPG International, said she was convinced that the Union Square location has helped build her business, an agency that supplies stock photographs. "The photo editors and art directors like coming here to do their own research and that means almost a guaranteed sale."
She said that when she moved to 32 Union Square, she had 80 employees and occupied one floor of about 12,000 square feet. Now she occupies close to 50,000 square feet on three floors and a penthouse and has 230 employees.
She said the nature of the business required people to work until 8 P.M., which is after dark in the wintertime.
"When we first moved in I was a little nervous about people going home at night, and we got the B.I.D. security people to escort them," she said. "Now we don't worry very much."

HEADLINE: Biking for Backing For a Soup Kitchen

BYLINE: By BRENDA A. SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
YOU could say that 31-year-old Ray Aramini's quest is one of bread, sweat and gears.
Mr. Aramini, a probation officer dealing with juveniles in Willimantic who lives in the rural township of Windham Center, last week started off on a 500-mile, 5-day bicycle ride in the hope of raising $100,000 for a Bike for Bread program to expand the Covenant Soup Kitchen in Willimantic. 
 He set off last Wednesday, starting with one wheel in Canada and one in Maine, and is continuing through New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
The Covenant kitchen serves 26,000 sit-down lunches, 14,717 breakfasts and another 4,000 bag lunches each year.
Just as important, Mr. Aramini would tell you, the kitchen has provided solace to thousands of families, since first opening its now familiar little red door in St. Paul's Episcopal Church 15 years ago.
The kitchen doesn't receive Federal or state grants, "so we're not intrusive" in the lives of the people who come to the kitchen, says the operations director Gene Kupec. In these hard times, she added, "I've been seeing a lot of new faces."
The kitchen has grown to the point where it is overtaking church space, and it is badly in need of repair, including updating for access by people with disabilities. Thus Mr. Aramini's fund-raising efforts.
Volunteers like the bike rider have become essential as paying staff has become more difficult. "We're losing our workfare people because their hours have been cut back," Ms. Kupec said. "We've depended on them in the past to help, because they come in on a regular basis."
Mr. Arantini, who grew up on the family farm in Columbia (affectionately dubbed the Big-A Ranch), first went to the soup kitchen four years ago becuase he was hungry -- not for bread, but for purpose.
At the time, he was recovering from back, neck and shoulder injuries from a car accident which, for a while, left him too weak to stand for more than a few minutes at a time. As a volunteer working at the kitchen he could help at his own pace with dishwashing or serving food.
He has continued to volunteer in the kitchen since his recovery, and now he'd like to give something back. "Hunger is not just for food -- people need acceptance, love . . . I've taken away vastly more than I've given people," he said.
This wasn't Mr. Aramini's first experience with soup kitchens or good causes. When he was 19, he joined his cousin Gary Aramini in a run from California to New Hampshire -- 3,500 miles in 119 days -- to raise funds for cancer research
He also spent two years in South Kingston, Jamaica, with a tiny Roman Catholic men's order called Brothers of the Poor, helping to establish a soup kitchen there.
His ride includes a stop at the Keene Community Kitchen where he worked for two and a half years while attending college, and where a professor, Gerald Lenthall, helped him realize that this was the kind of work that suited his nature.
His mother, Nancy ("Mrs. A," as her husband, Raymond, calls her), a former nurse, says her youngest child has always been a ball of energy and goodwill. His older siblings, Dan and Nancy, were easier to track, but she used to dress Ray in red, she said, so she could find him in crowded places like supermarkets.
"Dan would be pushing a cart, Nancy would disappear reading, and we'd find Ray with a little old lady. They'd be having a grand conversation about gold coins or her old bottle collection," she says.
Mrs. Aramini guesses that it was a school trip to impoverished areas in the Appalachian mountains that first sparked her son's humanitarian projects.
In the last three months, Mr. Aramini has been swimming, lifting, biking and hiking to prepare for the ride. And with the help of a growing circle of volunteers -- who have also been selling T-shirts, bumper stickers and baseball caps for the cause -- he's been talking, talking and talking.
"Increasing awareness of the problems of the poor is a very important part of all this," he said.
He hopes that other riders will join him as he makes his way from state to state. Part of the Bike for Bread message is that all soup kitchens need support, particularly at a time when many people are without jobs for the first time in their lives. And many of the victims of unemployment are children.
Fund-raising efforts have drawn in everyone from the American Cribbage Conference to Fleet Bank, which recently presented Mr. Aramini with a $3,000 check and a Winnebago to track the route.

HEADLINE: Another Plan for Baby Boomers

BYLINE: The Associated Press 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT will take to the airwaves soon with a $15,000 advertising campaign to persuade baby boomers to plan for the future.
The initiative comes four years after the state began encouraging its residents to plan for old age by purchasing long-term care insurance. Under the program, the state teamed up with selected private insurers that agreed to meet state standards for long-term care. But while one million people are candidates for such insurance, only 2,600 policies have been sold. 
 "The hardest thing to do is for people to look in the mirror and look 30 or 40 years from now and being frail and dependent," said David Guttchen, 34, director of the Connecticut Partnership for Long-Term Care.
Through the program, residents can buy individual policies directly from the insurers or through group packages offered by some employers. The policies are not subsidized by the state or by employers, but there are some compelling reasons to get the coverage.
"Basically, what the state does is give these insurance companies the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval," Mr. Guttchen said.
Similar long-term care partnerships exist in three other states: New York, California and Indiana.
Unlike some nonpartnership plans, state-endorsed policies appreciate so that their value keeps pace with inflation. Most policies also offer the option of using insurance money to pay for home care -- an option not always available if elderly people get into financial difficulties and must have their long-term care paid for by welfare.
The state promises that people who buy partnership policies will receive a lifetime of care without draining their life savings.
State officials gave the following example:
An 80-year-old widow has a $100,000 house and $50,000 in mutual funds and bank accounts when she becomes too frail to care for herself.
After staying home for two years with the help of visiting nurses and homemakers, she enters a nursing home. Years earlier, she had bought long-term care insurance, and the policy plus Medicare and some other programs were worth enough to cover her care, both at home and in the institution for about three years.
If she had held a nonpartnership policy, the widow would have been forced to sell her home and run through her savings when the insurance money ran out. She would have to be virtually broke before the state would pick up the tab for her care.
A partnership policy would allow her to apply for Medicaid, the state-paid insurance for the poor, while keeping assets equal to the amount that insurance has already paid out.
So if the widow's policy paid for $150,000 worth of care, she could keep $150,000 worth of assets and still have her care paid for by Medicaid.
Why is the state being so apparently generous?
The answer lies in the growing Medicaid budget. At $921 million now, the cost of keeping impoverished old people in nursing homes already eats up 10 percent of the state budget.
A state study commission estimates that the Medicaid bill for nursing home care will grow to $1.4 billion by 2000. And that's 10 years before the state's huge population of baby boomers starts turning 65.
With the partnership program, the state hopes to reduce its long-term care costs by 7 percent by 2030, Mr. Guttchen said. Meanwhile, he said, the state might be able to help some people retain more of their dignity and their savings as they age.
Even with the asset-protection feature, the state thinks it can save money by making more private money available to pay for nursing home care. And because the average nursing home stay is only 2.5 years, there's a chance that insurance can eliminate the need for Medicaid in some cases.

HEADLINE: Getting Into Business, and Surviving

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
IT was nearly midday, and inside a hotel conference room in Cromwell, Aldonna Ambler was asking a hushed, spillover crowd how they would eliminate potential rivals.
"C'mon," she urged them, "let's get devious." 
 Suggestions poured forth, but she dismissed them as either tepid or likely to backfire. Finally, she offered a divide-and-conquer strategy.
"Maybe they have a great salesperson," Mrs. Ambler said. "You can try to hire that person away." Even if the person is not hired, she added, it is possible to use a job interview as a means of extracting potentially valuable information about a business rival. "You don't always have to be a charlatan, but you don't always have to take it, either."
One thing about which this audience of small-business owners knows well is "taking it." From investment pullouts to credit crunches, from layoffs to shutdowns, they have been taking it on the chin since the recession of 1989. Even now, with the fog lifting, the state is still lagging behind most of the country in economic growth.
Mrs. Ambler in fact had been preaching growth strategy long before the recession even began, as a charter workshop leader for the state's pre-eminent small-business seminar, the Success Symposium. Begun in 1987, before that year's Wall Street crash, the thrice-a-year seminars have been sponsored by SNET and the Small Business Administration.
Doing unto others before they do unto you was but one small part of Mrs. Ambler's presentation, entitled "Growth Strategies and Survival Tactics." Like others at the seminar, her overall message was one of optimism and resilience. "The best ideas come from fun, not frowns," she said.
Establishing a small business is an uphill trudge, and the odds against success are daunting. Traditionally, one-third of all small-business start-ups fail within a year, and two-thirds within five years. In Connecticut, a stubbornly depressed economy has made conditions particularly tough.
But the forecast is not so dire, according to the S.B.A. administrator in New England, Patrick McGowan. An economy in transition, easier credit terms, and developing niche markets in the wake of large corporate downsizing all bode well, he said. "It's a great time to start and grow a small business," he said.
Connecticut is dependent on small business as never before. Of an estimated 93,000 total businesses operating in the state, 98.7 percent are categorized as small, a definition that encompasses manufacturers with 500 or fewer workers, or retail, service and other businesses employing 100 or fewer people. Since 1993, small businesses have accounted for two out of three new jobs created in Connecticut.
Thus, seminar organizers see their work as vital. For a $99 fee, small-business owners and executives may attend up to five workshops on topics ranging from "Getting the Appointment" to "Customer Service Vs. Customer Serve Us." The all-day symposium also offers free workbooks and "a networking luncheon."
At the recent seminar, Noel de Caprio, owner of the Noelle Spa for Beauty and Wellness, offered introductory remarks, describing how she managed to jump various hurdles, including getting her Stamford salon up and running again 24 hours after it was gutted by fire.
"Determination is very important," she said. "You can do anything if you put your mind to it."
Mrs. de Caprio and S.B.A. officials spoke about the recession as a thing of the past, an outlook with which Peter Gioia of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association concurred. "The recession has been over since the last quarter of 1993," he said. "We have been in a position of slow growth, which has accelerated over the last 12 months."
But Connecticut has only partially recovered from the recession's effects. Of the more than 150,000 jobs the state lost between 1989 and 1993, a great many of them in the once-booming weapons industry, less than a third have been returned.
"We're going through what Texas went through in the downsizing of their oil industry," said Jo-Ann Van Vechten, head of the S.B.A.'s Hartford district. "They diversified, and now they have a healthy economy. We have to go through that kind of transition, which is what we are doing right now."
The small-business owners at the seminar did not seem particularly enamored by the idea of being pioneers of economic change. Nor did they share the view that the recession was totally over.
Frederick Stroiney, president of the Windsor Locks Savings and Loan, called business in the Hartford area "still fairly flat," with losses in the insurance industry hitting particularly hard.
As Lisa S. Murphy, who runs a computer tutoring business in Glastonbury, Techniques P. C. Training and Development, put it, "Our business serves other business, and people are still watching the bottom line before spending."
John Simboli, a partner in the Wyant Simboli Group of Norwalk, a graphics design firm that specializes in World Wide Web pages, remembered a time not long ago when he and his wife were thinking about moving to Texas or Florida because business in the state was so bad.
Now, he said, he sees "slow, measured growth" and "I don't think we were stupid in staying."
Mrs. Ambler, a New Jersey-based business consultant, recalled conducting her growth workshop with a much smaller audience when the recession was at its height. "There's a lot less fear now than there was three or four years ago," she said. "The recession snuck up on some people. Now we deal with people who were with big companies that downsized. They may not want to be an entrepreneur, but this is good for them."
Well, maybe not for all of them. It takes certain skills to be an entrepreneur, seminar organizers agreed.
"This seminar helps a lot of people who think they want to entrepreneurs but who really don't," Ms. Van Vechten said. "They aren't flexible or innovative. They don't want to spend long hours. The traits we are talking about are inborn or learned because people want to have them." Some people, she added, are just more suited to be employees.
Jonathan Costa, a learning coordinator at the Education Center in Litchfield, said his company, which normally has public schools as a customer base, needs to reposition itself in the wake of state budget cuts, and that the seminar was giving him ideas on how to do so.
"The days when you could simply serve public institutions are gone," he said. "You need to market yourself effectively."
Mr. Stroiney called the seminar "a refresher." Even though the Windsor Locks Savings and Loan has been around 80 years, he said, it remains one of the state's smallest financial institutions, with only eight employees. Attending the seminar, he said, stoked thoughts of growth.
"We aren't going to be mortgage lenders forever," he said. "There are opportunities. I'm thinking about larger banks closing up branches. Smaller banks can pick up the slack."
The seminars, begun in 1987, were designed to educate small businesses on the basic elements of success, according to its first director, the SNET executive Arthur K. Olsen. "We said if we can help small businesses grow, and reduce the failure rate, that would be good business for us," he said.
While telephone companies have set up small-business symposiums in other states, Connecticut's is the longest-lived. SNET's current manager for the seminars, Terri Smith, said no single symposium has yet failed to sell at least 250 tickets.
For their part, S.B.A. officials said the program complements an easier credit policy established in 1994, under which loans to small businesses leaped from 60 in 1990 to 773 in 1995.
Still, Mr. McGowan emphasized the ultimate success of a start-up depends on the person managing it. "I tell them it's like being in a room with 100 doors, and 75 are locked," he said. "Only 25 will open. Or maybe only 5 will open. The test you go through as an entrepreneur is to find those doors."
Seminars later this year will be held on Sept. 20 at the Trumbull Marriott Hotel and on Oct. 25 at the Four Points Sheraton in Waterbury. More information is available by calling 800-356-6868.

HEADLINE: Coke at a Price

 BODY:
To the Editor: I have just returned from Paris, with a cautionary tale.
Although you can find Diet Coke in French stores, most cafes and restaurants don't have it. When they do, it's usually a very small bottle, never served with ice, and costs at least $6. One afternoon my traveling companion and I, both tired and thirsty, flopped down at a cafe called Le Soleil d'Or not far from Notre Dame. When I asked the courteous waiter if they had Diet Coke, he said: "Certainly. Would you like a small, medium or large?" Without even thinking I said, "Large, please," figuring it would probably be about 12 ounces. 
 To my astonishment the waiter reappeared with a stein containing about a quart of soda, plus tons of blessed ice. My friend said, "Gee, I hope that doesn't end up costing too much," but I said I didn't care. An hour later we asked for the check. The cost of my soda? 96 francs -- $19! It was too absurd to get upset; I practically fell on the floor laughing. And no, I'm not rich, nor did I dispute the bill, since I'd already finished the soda. Next time I'll economize and order Dom Perignon.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Divided As Two Battle For Congress

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
IN a race that has attracted national attention because it has divided some conservative members of Congress and reflects the Republican Party's split on abortion, Joseph J. DioGuardi is the candidate who won't go away, and Representative Sue W. Kelly is the incumbent trying to deliver the final knockout punch.
The two will face each other in a primary on Sept. 10 for the Republican nomination for the House of Representatives in the 19th District. The predominantly Republican district includes northern Westchester, Putnam, part of White Plains and a part of Dutchess and Orange Counties. 
 For Mr. DioGuardi, a certified public accountant who served in Congress from 1985 to 1988, it has become almost a biennial venture for him to try to regain a seat in the House of Representatives. After his defeat to Nita M. Lowey in 1988 and again in 1992 in what is now the 18th Congressional District, he moved to Mount Pleasant and the 19th Congressional District. In 1994, he narrowly lost a seven-way Republican primary to Mrs. Kelly, then a first-time candidate, and lost again to her in the general election, where he ran on the Conservative and Right to Life lines.
"Why do I run?" Mr. DioGuardi said. "Obviously, the fire has to be in your belly to always campaign. Campaigning is not easy, and I have the energy for it, thank God. But I'm running because people are telling me something is wrong."
What is wrong, he maintained, is that the district has in Mrs. Kelly someone who is a "radical left-of-center liberal" on social issues, including abortion rights and gay rights.
Earlier this month, Mr. DioGuardi, who radiates confidence, was designated the party's Congressional candidate by the leaders of the four-county district, itself split, and he already had the Right to Life party backing. Under his scenario, Republicans with conservative leanings will dominate the primary, give him a victory in September and an easy victory in November over the Democratic candidate, Richard Klein, a Chappaqua doctor.
Mrs. Kelly, in contrast, said of Mr. DioGuardi's candidacy: "I don't think it's particularly a big threat. Every threat is a serious threat, but I intend to win because I know I represent the district. The people in the district talk to me. I've been there and lived in the district for more than 36 years. Joe has not. How can he say he knows what they need?"
She added: "I'm a Republican. Republicans believe in letting local people make their own laws. I believe strongly in personal freedom. Every time I've checked, the district is pro choice." Mrs. Kelly is also running on the Freedom Party line.
Supporting Mrs. Kelly in her bid for a second term is the leadership of the House of Representatives, including Speaker Newt Gingrich and the majority leader, Dick Armey of Texas, who are both against abortion. They and other leaders sent Mr. DioGuardi a letter in June urging him to withdraw from the race. "Should it become necessary, the House Republican Leadership is prepared to commit time and extensive resources to Sue Kelly's re-election efforts," the leaders wrote.
But Mr. DioGuardi refused to be intimidated by the letter, saying the leadership support was part of a policy of supporting Republican incumbents, not a commentary on his own credentials. Referring to the changes the Republican-led Congress has been pushing, he said: "Newt is still a friend. We started this revolution together."
Indeed, some of the most conservative, anti-abortion members of Congress have defied the Republican leadership to support Mr. DioGuardi. Representative Bob Dorman of California and Representative Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey participated in a DioGuardi fund-raising event.
Nonetheless, both Representative Kelly and Mr. DioGuardi agreed that this election would not be decided by Washington insiders but by the people of the district who will vote on the issues and the perceived integrity of the candidates.
While differing on some social issues like abortion, each is claiming to be fiscally conservative. Mr. DioGuardi said of Mrs. Kelly: "It's true she voted mainly with the Contract for America, but that's mainly a fig leaf for the problems of this country. And we still don't have term limits and a balanced-budget amendment. And in Sue Kelly's case, she did something very damaging to herself and the country. She didn't support the Health and Human Services appropriation bill that would have implemented the welfare-reform bill."
Mrs. Kelly's campaign countered by saying that during his last term in office Mr. DioGuardi voted with the Democratic leadership 40 percent of the time while Mrs. Kelly has voted with the Republican leadership 80 percent of the time. "We have reversed the spending habits of the Government," she said.
Both candidates see the economy and jobs as important issues. Mr. DioGuardi, calling Mrs. Kelly "ineffective," faulted her for failing to prevent General Motors from closing its plant in North Tarrytown. Mrs. Kelly countered by saying that the closing was announced during Mr. DioGuardi's tenure in office and that early action from him might have prevented the closing.
Mrs. Kelly said she was also hoping to get mileage out of a political scandal that has haunted Mr. DioGuardi since 1988 when Joseph Crabtree, a DioGuardi supporter, illegally reimbursed employees of his automobile dealership for contributions they had given to Mr. DioGuardi's campaign. Mr. DioGuardi was never charged with any election law violation and said he has been fully vindicated.
The Kelly campaign, however, is not reticent about alluding to the Crabtree matter and recent questions raised in the press about whether the DioGuardi Family Charitable Fund Inc., a tax-exempt foundation that Mr. DioGuardi oversees, violated Federal tax laws by its reported political involvement.
"I think Joe has abused those people who gave to his foundation and the taxpayers," Mrs. Kelly said. "We no longer in this nation can afford to have individuals in Congress who are not of the highest ethical and moral character."
Mr. DioGuardi countered by saying that the Kelly campaign was "recycling old things," trying to "create an aura that there is a problem when there is not." He said his foundation is a good-government organization that fully complies with the law. "There are several things that epitomize Joe DioGuardi," he said. "Joe DioGuardi is energy, perseverance and integrity."
Mr. DioGuardi said: "Whoever wins on Sept. 10, you can bank on it, is your Congressperson," that a Democrat does not have a chance in the November general election.
Mrs. Kelly disagreed, saying, "If he wins, this will be a Democratic seat."

Reviving Those Vacant Department Stores

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
OLD department stores vacated by bankruptcies or corporate restructurings in the late 80's and early 90's are making a comeback. The evidence is in a crop of conversions under way or planned across the state.
Many stores are being carved up and put back together as retail centers for multiple tenants on the lower floors with offices above. 
 A few are being converted to other uses, one as a medically oriented mall.
The key to the appeal of the vacant stores is location. Many occupy prime spots in downtowns or as part of highway malls. Other factors are the state's stable, if not robust, retail climate (the statewide vacancy rate remains flat at 6 percent) and economics.
Generally, it still costs far less to renovate an existing building than to construct a new one, industry analysts say.
Downtowns, which suffered during the regional mall movement in the 60's and 70's, are once again finding favor among shoppers and, in turn, among retailers, said William A. Farber, chief operating officer of Levin Management Corporation in North Plainfield.
The company manages 5 million square feet of retail space in the state.
Such conversions are not without challenges. For one thing many sites have inadequate, and often no, on-site parking -- a prerequisite for success. There is also the problem of what to do with floors above the second level.
"In the suburbs there is no real acceptance of vertical malls," Mr. Farber said. "The solution is that a project has to work on the ground and first levels."
That is the approach being taken by the developer doing the $6 million conversion of the Lord & Taylor store on Millburn Avenue in affluent Millburn, which closed in 1988. Irwin Ackerman, a Woodbridge-based developer, bought the building in 1992 because "locations like these in towns with strong demographics do not exist anymore," he said, noting that the store also had parking for 500 cars.
He has since divided the 120,000-square-foot store, now called Gateway Center, into a home for three retailers on two of its three levels.
They are Fresh Fields, a natural food market, with 30,000 square feet; Home Place, a home-furnishings outlet with 50,000 square feet, and a 10,000-square-foot Revco drugstore.
"You have to find the right mix of tenants," Mr. Ackerman said. But even with that, he added, "it's hard to move people to the third level."
It is also hard to get retailers to move there, so Mr. Ackerman said he was turning 15,000 square feet on the third level into professional offices.
THE same is true for the former B. Altman's in the Fashion Center Mall on Route 17 in Paramus. The 180,000-square-foot three-story building now houses Bed Bath & Beyond and TJ Maxx, each on a full 60,000-square-foot floor.
"We are working on a deal with service users for the top floor," said Richard Steinberg, executive vice president at At Mall Properties in Manhattan.
A group of developers, including principals of At Mall Properties, took over six B. Altman stores when the retailer went bankrupt in 1990 and have repositioned, sold or leased all of them.
The logical re-use for the Route 17 store was retail, said Mr. Steinberg. "We would have liked to find a single user and didn't want to create an interior minimall with lots of smaller stores, which was too dangerous," he said. "Having multiple large tenants works and is less risky."
Big-box retailers with their large appetite for space, said Mr. Farber, the management executive, are the "engine driving the market."
Such retailers want to be in strong downtowns, said Thomas Welsh, a Morristown-based real estate consultant. He is representing the Elblum Holding Company of Morristown, the owner of the former Macy's branch at the corner of Speedwell Avenue and Park Place. The Morris County seat's population of 17,000 swells to 50,000 during the day.
The three-and-a-half-story, 125,000-square-foot store, vacant since 1993, is involved in "active discussions" with single users and developers who want to divide it into several stores, said Mr. Welsh, adding that negotiations for a long-term lease on the property were under way.
Among the developers eying the site is The Applied Companies of Hoboken. If it acquires the store Applied will turn the space, at a cost of about $25 a square foot, into a home-furnishing market with one or two 20,000- to 30,000-square foot anchors, 10 smaller users and perhaps a restaurant, said Michael I. Barry, a company vice president.
"It is a retailing segment not found in the nearby malls," said Mr. Barry. He said in the short term the store's top level would probably be leased as offices.
Stores in urban settings are also being recycled. One is the 1.2-million-square-foot, 16-story former Macy's -- originally built at the turn of the century as the flagship of the Bamberger's department-store chain , which occupies an entire block in downtown Newark.
A Manhattan-based partnership, comprising Samuel Jemal and his brothers, Joseph and David, and Edward Friedman, are under contract to buy the building, where the bottom retail floors have been closed since 1991.
Until recently, the top floors were used by Macy's for its computer operation.
The plan, said Samuel Jemal, is to subdivide the two lower 80,000-square-foot floors into retail space for one or two 30,000-square-foot users and 15 to 20 smaller ones, from fast-food chains to apparel stores, needing an average of 3,000 square feet each.
The basement will be turned into 400 parking spaces, which he said would be an attraction and "key to the project's overall success."
The 240,000-square-foot, $6 million first phase, he said, will create the "cash flow" necessary to redevelop the upper floors as below market-rate office and warehouse space.
Mr. Jemal said the partners had bought the store at an attractive price and considered Newark's downtown retail climate "vibrant."
Construction on the first phase is to begin in September and occupancy is expected by next spring, he said. Rents have not yet been set.
THERE are also plans for 609 Broad Street, the four-story, 421,800-square-foot landmark former Hahne's store that was built in 1901 and closed in 1986. Its basement will become a garage for 160 cars, and the first floor will be carved into 75,000 square feet of shops and perhaps a restaurant and a nightclub.
The second and third levels will become offices, said Miles Berger. He, his brother, Bruce, and his cousin Solomon are redeveloping the store in anticipation of the completion of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.
It is taking shape just across Broad Street and is to open next year.
Mr. Berger said the more than $2 million retail conversion would begin once the city approved his application for a tax abatement.
He said the hope was to have the stores open by next May. Rents are to start at $18 a square foot net, he said.
Some stores, like the former 110,00 square foot Hahne's in downtown Montclair, vacant since 1989, are being recycled to different uses. A group of New York and New Jersey investors plan to turn the two-and-a-half-story store, at the corner of Church and South Park Street, into a mall-like medical center.
The $15 million project, Healthcare Center at Montclair, will have 40 percent of the space devoted to anchor tenants, affiliated with hospitals, and the rest to medical and health-related services and retail uses. A parking lot across Church Street, which is part of the property, will become a 315-car garage.
"The building's downtown location fit the future model for healthcare," said James G. Wurm, project manager for York Hunter, a construction management concern with offices in Newark and Manhattan that will renovate the store and erect the garage. The store's large floors also lent themselves to the new use and enough could be salvaged to be cost effective, said Mr. Wurm, whose firm has offices in Newark and Manhattan.
There are signed commitments for 20 percent of the space. "Half the building must be preleased to trigger financing and start construction," said Mr. Wurm. "It is not out of the question that work can start by year's end."

IN a search that lasted two years and pitted New York State against Connecticut, Swiss Re America finally decided to build its new North American headquarters in this countrified corporate community, best known as the home of I.B.M.
"It was a battle right to the end," said John A. Lombardi, the Supervisor of the Town of North Castle, of which Armonk is a part. "They made us work very hard, right to the bone. Every day I thought we were going to lose them." 
 In the last few months, after looking at properties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Swiss Re America narrowed its choice to two sites. One, a pristine plot of wooded property on King Street in Armonk, overlooks the Kensico Reservoir. The other, in sharp contrast, is an urban property at Tresser Boulevard and Greyrock Place in Stamford, near the site where the Swiss Bank Corporation is building its headquarters.
"People wondered at the choice between two sites that are so different," said Heidi E. Hutter, chief executive of Swiss Re America, a subsidiary of the huge reinsurer Swiss Re, which protects insurers against catastrophic losses. "Stamford had the attraction of being in a community of other reinsurance companies in an urban setting.
"But it came down not to what the company needed at this point in time, but looking through a 50- to 100-year horizon. And we decided we wanted to be in a campus-like setting and establish our own identity apart from other companies."
The esthetics and pristine state of the Armonk property were also in its favor, Ms. Hutter said. "Once we decided to go with the campus setting, this was by far the most beautiful site," she said.
Earlier in its search, Swiss Re America looked at existing buildings but could find none to its liking. "To be candid," she said, "I was initially in horror about the prospect of constructing a new building, but we found we had to in order to get what we wanted."
Swiss Re America occupies 330,000 square feet in five buildings in midtown Manhattan. Its head offices are at 237 Park Avenue. "The move to Armonk will enable the company to consolidate its operations," said Stephen B. Siegel, president of the Edward S. Gordon Company, which brokered the deal. "But it plans to keep its Financial Services Group in midtown. I'm now looking for a 180,000-square-foot space for it."
IN Armonk, the company plans to build a 300,000-square-foot building with rights for an additional 60,000 square feet. The project is expected to cost $100 million.
The site has already been approved for up to 720,000 square feet, built in two phases, Mr. Lombardi, the town supervisor, said. "It was done for another project in 1988, which never materialized when the real estate market declined."
The proposed design will include several wings "like long fingers," branching off a central core, said Sara Fox, senior vice president at Swiss Re America. It fits into the corporate culture established by the parent company, based in Zurich. "In Europe, there are strict regulations about building design and employee access to air and light," she said.
"In our new building, there will be floor-to-ceiling glass and no employee will sit more than 35 to 40 feet from a window," Ms. Fox said. "It might not be the most efficient design, like in speculative buildings designed for maximum efficiency with massive floor plates where people have to sit in cubicles. But we want all our employees to have access to the beautiful site."
Swiss Re America's decision to move to Westchester, which was announced on June 27, is expected to bring 650 new employees into the market. "It's very exciting," said Martin Berger, co-founder of the Robert Martin Company of Elmsford, the county's largest owner of commercial office space. "It will have positive residual effects in all areas, not just the office market. Our printing and advertising companies will benefit, as will housing and shopping centers."
When a major company leaves Manhattan, Mr. Berger said, "it usually keeps its umbilical cord attached there for a while until it realizes that using local companies is just fine."
"After about a five-year period," he added, "one will more easily see all the economic benefits that will be derived."
The deal does not, however, alleviate the office market's most pressing problem, which is vacant space. "But it's bound to have a positive impact on the county's image as a headquarters location," Mr. Siegel said. "This is also a growth company and its success at its new location will benefit the entire region."
Mr. Berger said he thought more companies might relocate to Westchester to build their own headquarters. "Manhattan is really tightening," he said. "We'll start to see more companies looking to the suburbs to expand."
One of the most immediate benefits will be the addition to North Castle's tax base. "Swiss Re will become the town's third largest taxpayer." Mr. Lombardi said. New York City, whose water system is in the region, is first and I.B.M. is second.
TO get the company, the town had to offer assurances of a speedy approval process. "That was absolutely critical," Ms. Fox said. "Now that we've made our decision, we want everything to happen tomorrow."
Ms. Fox is hoping for all approvals to be in place by early 1997. "We intend to start construction in the spring," she said.
The state contributed incentives, including a $500,000 interest subsidy grant, $400,000 in construction loans and grants and a promise of $50,000 to $60,000 in job-training funds.
The state Department of Transportation also promised to expedite a scheduled improvement of King Street, or Route 120. A 2.7-mile section will be realigned and widened from two lanes to four, including the improvement of two intersections, one at Route 22 and one at the Old Post Road. And exits 2 and 4 on Interstate 684 will be redesigned to handle more traffic.
"Without the road work, we couldn't have made the decision to move 650 employees to Armonk," Ms. Fox said.
The design work on the project has already begun, Mr. Lombardi said. "The various agencies are now meeting with the State Department of Environmental Conservation to prepare the impact statement."
Landing Swiss Re America required the effort of several government agencies "all working together to convince the company that Westchester would be a friendly business environment," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state agency designed to attract business to New York.
Gov. George E. Pataki got personally involved by placing several calls to Ms. Hutter. "He wanted to assure her that her company was wanted and we'd be willing to assist in their New York search in any way possible," Mr. Gargano said. "We're not in a position to throw money around. But we try to help where we can."

On Teaching and Coaching

 BODY:
Chatter recently asked for opinions on year-round schools and for advice to Coach Dan Reeves of the Giants. Here are some replies.
 
Entering the 21st Century
There should be year-round schools not only for economic reasons but also because today's students need every advantage they can get to survive in a fast-changing, highly technical world. 
 Teachers need to be paid according to their ability and time, but they too must move into the 21st century. Half-days and in-service days and administrative days and conference days are all dinosaurs from the past and need to be put behind us as quickly as possible and do what's right for my grandchildren and then some.

Old History, New Math
With Japan and Germany already implementing 240-day school years, what is America waiting for?
Schools used to close in the summer because many teachers as well as students went back to the farms to plant for the fall harvest. Hardly a reason in 1996 to give an active mind three months to do nothing!
The biggest obstruction to extending the school year are the powerful teachers' unions, which have figured out how to make 12 months' salary on 10 months of work!

Pre-Season Quarterbacking
1. Find a quarterback.
2. Hire all Joe Paterno's assistants from Penn State.
3. Release all players who had a 3.5 average in school and replace with 2.5-average students who can run, block and tackle and generally play football.

Is Dallas for Sale?
Dan Reeves should make superhuman efforts to bring together Donald Trump, Steve Wynn and Governor Whitman to purchase the Dallas Cowboys and bring them here. The Donald and Wynn can come up with the money and the Governor can oil the way with offers that no one can refuse.

Keep Your Eye on the Ball
SUNY Albany is a great place for the Giants to train. I work there. If they keep focused on practice and not the diversions (bars, etc.), they might actually come out looking good!

HEADLINE: Community Interests Vs. Property Rights

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
A SWEET summer breeze sends shallow waves rippling through the blue canvas awning on the terrace at the Bonnie Briar Country Club in Mamaroneck. Diners gaze over 150 acres of rolling landscape, a verdant palette of a dozen hues, from the deep emerald of the fir trees to the pale jade of the willows.
On the course, accompanied by bird songs and hovering squadrons of dragonflies, golfing parties (who are these people who get to play on weekdays, anyway?) make their way back and forth over the west branch of the Sheldrake River, which doubles as a water hazard for the 13th, 14th, 16th and 17th holes. 
 It doesn't appear as if anything is missing from Bonnie Briar.
But something very important has been taken away, say the owners of the acreage: their right -- their Constitutional right -- to develop the property. The owners, Bonnie Briar Syndicate Inc., had planned 71 homes along a curving, roughly A-shaped roadway, realigning the golf course around the perimeter of the residential cluster.
When new zoning frustrated their plans, the syndicate took the Town of Mamaroneck to court. In doing so, they joined a host of "takings" cases that have proliferated nationwide in recent years. Property owners, encouraged by several Supreme Court rulings, are turning more frequently to the Fifth Amendment -- "nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation" -- to escape what they see as burdensome land-use regulations. Wetlands and endangered-species laws are prime targets of the property-rights movement, but zoning provisions have also been challenged.
Until two years ago, Bonnie Briar was zoned to allow single-family dwellings on minimum lots of either 15,000 or 30,000 square feet. But in 1994, the Town Board rezoned the property, in the interest of preserving open space and recreational resources, reducing the potential for flooding hazards and maintaining the "suburban quality of the community as a whole." The new zoning limited uses chiefly to private recreation facilities (in other words, what was there already) and prohibited residential development altogether.
Bonnie Briar Syndicate, which leases the land to the Bonnie Briar Country Club, sued the Town Board. The syndicate asserted that its property had effectively been taken by the government, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Earlier this month, the rezoning was upheld by Judge Peter M. Leavitt of State Supreme Court in Westchester County. But a lawyer for the owners said an appeal would be sought, so the fight over Bonnie Briar is not over.
Nor is it the only significant "takings" case in New York. Another Westchester town, Cortlandt, is being challenged by the owners of a 128-acre former emery mine. The property was bought by Briarcliff Associates, a subsidiary of the Thalle Construction Company, a major road and utility contractor, with a view toward using it as a quarry.
The town rezoned the area for housing but the owners said residential development would be impossible, since there was not adequate septic capacity, an assertion the town disputes. Claiming that they had been denied all economically viable use of their property, the owners sued. The case is now before Judge Francis A. Nicolai of State Supreme Court for a decision.
Courthouses are not the only places where "takings" battles are being fought. An Omnibus Property Rights Act, introduced last year by Bob Dole, is pending in the United States Senate. It would require compensation to owners if a governmental action diminished the fair market value of their property by 33 percent or more. A similar measure was passed last year by the House of Representatives. President Clinton has already said he would veto the property-rights act or any other compensation-entitlement bill if it reached his desk.
Compensation laws have been enacted in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, according to Nancie G. Marzulla, president and chief legal counsel of a national group called Defenders of Property Rights, based in Washington. The compensation threshold in these laws varies from a 20- to a 40-percent loss of value, she said.
In the New York State Assembly, Robert A. Straniere, Republican of Staten Island, introduced a bill that would entitle owners to compensation if a government regulation, except one that prevented noxious uses or protected public health and safety, reduced the value of their property by more than 50 percent. It had not emerged from committee by the end of the session and would have to be reintroduced.
"We're not talking about speculators," Mr. Straniere said. "We're talking about people who bought property in good faith -- maybe to build a home for themselves or a few units -- in an area that wasn't obviously environmentally sensitive, who find out they can't use their property. The Supreme Court has identified this as an area for legitimate redress."
What the United States Supreme Court has done is to expand the concept of regulatory "takings." The underlying premise is that land-use controls can effectively deprive owners of the use their property every bit as much as outright seizure, leaving owners to pick up the tab for common benefits -- like waterfront access or undeveloped open space -- that should be borne by the public at large.
As a general proposition, a regulation must substantially advance a legitimate government interest and not deprive a property of all of its economic value. It was long ago established by the Supreme Court that if a regulation went "too far," it would be recognized as a taking. But for most of this century, the Court was largely silent on the subject.
"It used to be that when you talked about the Fifth Amendment, people thought you were talking about self-incrimination," said Roger J. Marzulla, who heads the environmental law section at the influential Washington firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. (He is also Nancie's husband.) "As few as five years ago, when you talked about the just-compensation clause, people had no idea what you were talking about."
He said the new cases "indicated that the Supreme Court is serious about property rights, that compensation is indeed due and that government at all levels must take into account the extent of private property rights."
But Jerold S. Kayden, associate professor of urban planning at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, said that recent legislative action "reflects a recognition by property-rights advocates that they have not yet achieved the victory they wanted in the judicial branch."
"We're still left scratching our heads about what happens when a regulation has a severe impact but the property value isn't diminished to zero," Mr. Kayden said. "The fact that millions of dollars may be foregone by the impact of regulation doesn't automatically trigger a constitutional finding of a taking. But between the cup and the lip is a large area for further exploration."
On everyone's lips these days are the words "rough proportionality," the latest addition to the Fifth Amendment lexicon, introduced by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the majority in a 1994 case known as Dolan v. City of Tigard.
"It has put a new arrow in the quiver of those who are challenging takings," said James M. Altman of Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn & Berman in Manhattan, lawyers for the Town of Mamaroneck in the Bonnie Briar case.
Tigard is a suburb of Portland, Ore., in which the Dolan family has a plumbing and electric supply store. The Dolans applied for a permit to double the size of the store and pave a parking lot. The city granted the permit on the condition that they dedicate part of the property along the flood plain of a creek for a storm-drainage system and public greenway and that they dedicate a 15-foot strip as a pedestrian-bicycle pathway. The requirement involved about 10 percent of the property.
The Dolans appealed the decision on the ground that the requirements were not related to the proposed development and amounted to a taking. The Oregon Land Use Board of Appeals upheld the city, noting that the paved lot would add runoff into the creek and that the new store would generate more traffic.
Chief Justice Rehnquist said that the city had not adequately quantified how the pathway would offset traffic demand and that it was difficult to see how recreational visitors "trampling" along the greenway was sufficiently related to the city's interest in reducing flooding problems.
"We think a term such as 'rough proportionality' best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirement of the Fifth Amendment," the Chief Justice wrote. "No precise mathematical calculation is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is related both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development."
Three months ago, the Tigard City Council revised the permit conditions, calling for easements through the property, rather than the dedication of property to public use. Liz Newton, assistant to the city administrator, said the Dolans could have reapplied for a building permit.
Dan Dolan, one of the plaintiffs, said the basic conditions had not changed. "It's just an easement instead of an outright taking," he said. "What's the difference?" He said the family suffered at least a "temporary taking" over the four years that it took to pursue their case. They are seeking damages from the city in a case that is to go to trial next month.
Mr. Marzulla believes the Dolan case will ultimately limit the "unreasonable demands" of local and county governments for the dedication of property as part of the approval process. "Everybody sits there and says, 'That would make a great park, we'd love to have a greenway or a riverwalk,' " he said. "That's the kind of deal-making cities do. The only way you can justify that now is to show that it's an even-steven trade, so that the property owner is not being required to hand over more than his fair share."
But Peter Byrne, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, said the influence of Dolan and related cases had been "quite slight" and that state courts "have not been particularly impressed by the rhetorical invitation in those cases to be much more vigorous for property rights."
A lawyer for the Town of Mamaroneck, Judith M. Gallent, noted that the Dolan case did not apply to all regulations but rather to exactions of property. Her colleague, Robert S. Davis, agreed that Dolan was not "earth-shaking," but said it was "important because it provides a new way of asserting the claim."
Indeed, Dolan's "rough proportionality" line was one of the arguments advanced on behalf of the Bonnie Briar Syndicate by its lawyer, Stuart R. Shamberg, of Shamberg Marwell Hocherman Davis & Hollis in Mount Kisco, as was the "nexus" between impact and exaction that the Supreme Court called for in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission.
"There is no close nexus between the deprivation of my client's right to construct residential housing on the property and the municipal goal of preserving open space," Mr. Shamberg said. "It was our position -- and it still is -- that it's unconstitutional to take away our right to develop the property if our plan would have preserved the open space."
"The remedy was disproportionate to the municipal goal," he said.
In his decision, however, Judge Leavitt said the invocation of catch-phrases like nexus and proportionality was "out of context and entirely inefficacious for the analysis required herein."
Judge Leavitt said that while Bonnie Briar had been zoned residentially for more than 70 years, no development proposal was submitted until December 1993, when the enactment of the new zoning was all but inevitable. "Such circumstances are hardly indicative that the use which had been preferred in the past is no longer 'economically viable' simply because another use, to which the property had never been put, is no longer permitted," he wrote.
In Mamaroneck, the owners protested losing the right to residential development. In Cortlandt, the owners, Briarcliff Associates, protested gaining the right to residential development -- since, they argued, such development is impossible on the 128-acre site, known as Salt Hill.
"They have unconstitutionally taken all of our economic benefit from that land," said Mr. Shamberg, who represents Briarcliff Associates as well as the Bonnie Briar Syndicate. "You cannot use that property for any residential uses. It is a mountain of rock. The highest and best use of that property is clearly as an aggregate mine."
Briarcliff Associates is suing the Town of Cortlandt for the value of the mine, which it estimates at more than $9 million, plus interest compunded back to the day of the rezoning. Mr. Shamberg said there was "no question" that Briarcliff would have received a permit from the state to operate a mine at Salt Hill.
A lawyer for the town, Daniel Riesel of Sive, Paget & Riesel in Manhattan, said Cortlandt taxpayers should not be required to pay Briarcliff Associates "as a reward for their efforts to circumvent state and local law in their attempt to convert a small innocuous emery mine into a massive crushed-stone facility."
"Nor can plaintiffs credibly argue that Salt Hill had a fair market value of over $9 million," Mr. Riesel said, "just two and a half years after they paid $400,000 and it remained an unpermitted, undeveloped and abandoned property."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
You're Stung by Stocks. Are Bonds the Balm?

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
AS the stock market seesaws, investors may be tempted by the security of the bond market. But in recent years bonds have quietly shed their image as safe investments for a much racier one. Moreover, their newfound volatility seems to be here to stay.
The overriding question, however, is whether now is a good time for people who have been battered by stocks to turn to bonds. 
 Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Domestic bond performance typically is tied to the United States economy; the more sluggish the economy, the better bonds perform. But today, top fixed-income analysts paint vastly different pictures for the economy, and they come to starkly opposite conclusions.
Yes, buy bonds, says William H. Gross, fixed-income manager at Pacific Investment Management in Newport Beach, Calif., money managers and advisers to the Pimco mutual funds. The current advantages of bonds are clear: you lock up a yield of close to 7 percent and pick up some price appreciation if interest rates fall. And he predicts they will, with the 30-year Treasury bond rate falling to 6.5 percent by the end of the year as the economy weakens.
"The two biggest spark plugs for the first half of the year are not with us for the second half," Mr. Gross argued: Consumers have lost their enthusiasm for spending as the stock market has given up a chunk of its gains for the year, and mortgage refinancing has all but evaporated as interest rates have crept higher.
Higher consumer debt levels will also help brake economic growth in the next 6 to 12 months, said Laird Landmann, a fixed-income portfolio manager with Hotchkis & Wiley, money managers in Los Angeles.
He has started buying already. "No one is smart enough to call interest rate turns, so we try to be disciplined," he said. He views the 4 percent real long-bond rate -- the difference between interest rates and the inflation rate -- as a signal. Then, he said, "we begin to move the duration and maturity of our portfolios slightly higher."
He pushed the duration of the Hotchkis & Wiley Low Duration fund up to 2 years from 1.5, and the Total Return fund to 5.5 years from 5. The longer maturity is expected to bring a bigger return.
A slowing economy gives bondholders confidence that inflation will remain under control and, if so, bond prices can rise and yields fall.
The biggest question mark is on the wage front. The latest employment report showed a sharp jump in wages, but on average they rose only 3.4 percent in the last 12 months, Mr. Gross said, "and that's relatively low for the sixth year of an economic recovery."
In Congressional testimony on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped ease wage-inflation fears, Mr. Gross said. "He suggested wages are controlled by global trade, accelerating technology and other secular forces, and didn't foresee any slackening off of those forces." Holding wages down would mitigate the need for the Fed to raise rates, Mr. Gross said.
H. Bradlee Perry, former president of David L. Babson & Company, investment counselors in Cambridge, Mass., finds that bonds offer good value based on their poor showing so far this year. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index lost 1.2 percent in the first six months, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.1 percent.
Why didn't bonds rally more when stocks tumbled this month, since the stock decline was at least partly because of worries about the economy?
Bonds' failure to surge "suggests that there's concern about inflation floating around the market," said Chip Norton, managing editor of IBC's Bond Fund and Money Fund Report in Ashland, Mass.
Mr. Norton takes a middle view. He is not recommending bonds now because of market uncertainty over short-term Fed policy. But he says short-term Treasury issues and money markets are good places to park money at the moment because top-performing money funds are yielding only about 1.25 percentage points less than 30-year bonds.
A contrarian position is held by Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in New York. Don't buy bonds, he said.
"Since the beginning of the year, investors have harbored the notions that the economy is weak, inflation is dead and the Federal Reserve has nothing to do," he said. But the economy has improved every month, he said, and now it is strong enough that inflation poses a threat in 1997.
The Fed must shape policy based on what it believes will happen a year out, and "I think they will conclude interest rates are too low, even relative to today's inflation rate," Mr. Roach said.
Bonds would rate a buy if the economy weakened appreciably in the next six months, but that won't happen, he argued, because "the economy is well supported by fundamental income growth, still-competitive currency, the need for business to boost productivity and the dynamics of the inventory cycle."
Referring to Mr. Greenspan's comments, Mr. Roach said, "I saw the Fed laying the framework for eventual monetary tightening." Bond rallies, like the one after the Greenspan testimony, he said, should be seen as opportunities to sell.
Even people willing to take the plunge into bonds best beware, Mr. Perry said. The image of bonds as tranquil investments with predictable returns began to fray when inflation accelerated in the mid-1960s, and was destroyed when inflation and interest rates jumped to double digits from 1979 to 1982.
More recently, most investors expected bond prices to resume their placid nature once inflation eased. But while inflation has been a steady 2.6 to 3 percent during the last four years, long-term bond prices have fluctuated as much as 20 percent since late 1993.
A variety of factors have caused this basic change, which is likely to persist indefinitely, Mr. Perry said. They include the increased speculation in more complex bonds and derivative securities, the growing amount of government debt worldwide and the globalization of financial markets, which has limited the Fed's influence. The growth of bond mutual funds, from $300 billion in 1985 to $800 billion just before the bond market slump in 1994, has not helped either.
At least for now, bonds will remain volatile, Mr. Perry concluded. What can investors do? He recommends intermediate-term bonds, which have about half the price volatility of longer-term issues over time. Most important, he said, an investor can no longer be sanguine about bonds and should be careful about their maturities and quality.

HEADLINE: Who's Hanging Together? Club Owners

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
IT is no secret that New York club life is hurting.
The crackdown on clubs by City Hall, the end of the libertine 1980's and the eclipse of a diverse clientele of artists, celebrities and outrageous personalities by a largely under-21 crowd -- all have led to the demise of dance clubs as hip hangouts. 
 Then there is the indictment in May of Peter Gatien on charges of turning two of his megaclubs, Limelight and the Tunnel, into Ecstasy bazaars.
In an effort to climb out of the sump, about a dozen normally rivalrous club owners agreed to found a trade group last week to fight common woes. The New York City Cabaret Association, as it is likely to be known, arose from a meeting last Monday at the Bottom Line in Greenwich Village.
The get-together was organized by Andrew Rasiej, the owner of Irving Plaza, and David Hershkovits, the editor in chief of Paper magazine. Mr. Hershkovits said that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's vaunted quality-of-life campaign has included an effort to close clubs.
"Anything construed as trendy or hip that will attract too many people or the wrong kind of people has a real problem," Mr. Hershkovits said. "I think there's a cultural bias against people who stay up late."
Bar and club owners complained of harassment by the police and other city departments for noise and traffic violations in neighborhoods that have gentrified after clubs pioneered them. Hilly Kristal, the owner of CBGB in the East Village, said he was fined $2,000 when a band played without his consent on a truck outside his club.
"It seems to me the community boards have a system to stop places from opening up," said Nur Khan, the owner of Wax bar in SoHo.
The meeting also included city officials. "While your bottom line is that you want to make money, my bottom line is I have constituents who want to sleep at night," said Kathryn E. Freed, a City Council member.
Capt. Thomas Lawrence of the 10th Precinct in Chelsea said that on Sunday nights, when the Tunnel holds a hip-hop party that draws as many as 2,000 young people, neighborhood car thefts and robberies rise. "It's not harassment," Captain Lawrence said of the police efforts. "We go to community board meetings and hear we're not doing enough."
Club owners have rarely made common cause. A number are secretly hoping for Mr. Gatien's fall, Mr. Hershkovits said, so that they can carve up his empire. The eye-patched Mr. Gatien, who was present, donated $3,000 to the cabaret association.
Mr. Hershkovits, whose magazine depends in part on nightlife advertising, has been urging the owners for months to unite to promote clubdom as vital to the New York economy.
"The music industry, P.R. people, magazine editors -- they all go to clubs when they're young, and this is how they get into the business," Mr. Hershkovits said.

HEADLINE: NEIHBORHOOD REPORT: DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN;
New Hopes, Old Worries Over Big Mall

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
At Triangle Sports on Flatbush and Fifth Avenues, Bill Shapiro keeps a framed photo of his grandmother, Bessie. It was taken in the summer of 1916, when Bessie Shapiro first opened the shop and posed next to a sign advertising Army cots for $3.50.
Today, Mr. Shapiro, 58, fears that his sporting goods and Army surplus store will fade into history, like those $3.50 Army cots. Mr. Shapiro and other small-business owners in the area fear that they will become casualties of the giant Atlantic Center shopping mall under construction at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. The 380,000-square-foot shopping center is to open this fall. 
 "The world is going to change," Mr. Shapiro said, surrounded by stacks of sneakers and hiking boots. "We're really an anachronism. Now, with these big stores coming into the city, it's a challenge."
For others, it's a renewal. Although there is grumbling among Flatbush Avenue and Fulton Street merchants, there is also a sense in the surrounding communities that the $85 million mall will revitalize the area. Pathmark will provide the neighborhood with a desperately needed supermarket, some residents say, and retail chain stores will bring a wider variety of goods at lower prices.
William Vinnecomb, the chairman of Community Board 2, which includes the mall area, said that although he is concerned about traffic and the fate of small shopkeepers, he hopes the supermarket and other retailers at the mall will keep dollars in the borough with cheaper prices, better services and greater variety. "We're happy to see the development move forward," he said. "It is continuing the renaissance of downtown Brooklyn."
But residents have some concerns, too. There is anxiety about the traffic that the mall will draw and complaints about the noise and inconvenience that construction has wrought. Several neighborhood groups are pressing the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, to insure that local residents will be hired for the estimated 1,250 permanent jobs projected at the mall's retail shops.
"We fully support the hiring of local people," the developer's spokeswoman, Joyce Baumgarten, said. "These individual stores do their own hiring. We have nothing to do with it. But most of these retail stores do hire locally. That's what is so wonderful about this development."
Today, residents and shopkeepers are waiting to see what the giant mall will do for their slice of brownstone Brooklyn.
Ron Shiffman, the director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development and a city planning commissioner, said that the "big-box stores" at Atlantic Center signal a shift in downtown Brooklyn's commercial development, which has been led primarily by local entrepreneurs and a few chain stores. The mall, he contends, threatens the viability of smaller shops and detracts from the urban nature of brownstone Brooklyn.
"It is designed with a suburban mall mentality in an urban area," he said. SOMINI SENGUPTA

HEADLINE: VOICES: VIEWPOINT;
Slicing the Last of the Regulated Monopolies

BYLINE: By LESTER P. SILVERMAN; Lester P. Silverman is a director of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, in Washington.

 BODY:
MERGERS, restructuring, alliances: We've become used to these headline-making events in the telephone industry. It is still unsettling, however, when such news involves electric utilities.
Well, customers and investors, get ready. The current takeover battle over a utility in Kansas, the recent merger of electric and gas companies in Texas and nontraditional alliances -- like the one including Ameritech and Wisconsin Electric to provide interactive energy information -- are only early indications of the revolutionary changes about to occur in the last remaining regulated monopoly. 
 Since 1978, when a Federal law opened power generation to private companies, the market has become more competitive. Today, marketers -- both utility affiliates and independents -- offer to supply power at about 40 percent below the costs that utilities are passing along to customers. Including the transmission and distribution of the electricity, these prices are still 15 percent lower, on average.
Evidence from other industries, like telecommunications and natural gas, and from other countries shows that customers who gain the right to choose their electricity supplier will exercise that right. Almost half the large customers in Britain, for example, have switched suppliers since they were given this choice five years ago.
In this country, it is not surprising that Federal regulation has accommodated these market forces by providing wholesale customers like municipalities with access to the transmission system. And pilot experiments, allowing consumers to choose their electricity suppliers, much as they do their long-distance telephone companies, are under way. Soon all customers in California will have the option, and Massachusetts and New York are likely to follow suit. Federal legislation introduced this month would provide for customer choice nationally.
The results of all this will be the end of the electric utility industry as we know it. In its place, three distinct, but linked, businesses are emerging: power generation, wires and energy services.
Power generation will be a highly competitive commodity business. Power producers -- utilities as well as independents -- will be fighting it out in regional markets defined primarily by constraints in the transmission network. Price transparency, aided by the proliferation of spot markets and futures contracts like those recently initiated by the New York Mercantile Exchange, will stimulate even more competition.
The transition will be painful for many of today's generators. Costs that customers will no longer cover for expensive plants and contracts -- "stranded costs" in industry jargon -- could require the eventual write-off of about $135 billion, about equal to the equity of American utilities.
Successful generators will have low costs and will be astute in playing regional power markets. Many of today's players won't cut it, and a huge consolidation of generating plants by efficient producers is inevitable.
THE wires business -- the transmission and distribution of electricity -- will remain regulated but will be operated by utilities or third parties, with access to the wires open to all.
Operators of distribution wires will seek regulation that encourages efficiency. Regulators are expected to go along, provided that the savings are shared with customers. Some competitors will seek economies of scale by consolidating assets and activities with neighboring electric and other utilities, including providers of natural gas, water and possibly telephone and cable service. The recent merger of the Texas Utilities Company, a power company, with the Enserch Corporation, a gas utility, and the acquisition of a British water company by its local electric distributor are early moves toward "wires and pipes" companies.
The energy services business, which involves the packaging of different types of energy and other services, is just getting started. The leading edge of this business is the marketing of power -- generated by low-cost providers and moved for a fee across the wires of intervening utilities -- to wholesale customers. Since it was first allowed in 1992, more than 200 companies have entered this business. The early leaders have been natural-gas marketers and financial traders who have had a decade to perfect their game. But the big contest is still ahead.
Consider, for instance, the service businesses born of telecommunications deregulation. Cellular phones, paging, conference calling and a host of other services now account for about 25 percent of telecommunications revenue. Several companies are looking for the energy equivalent of these services by offering packaged natural gas, electricity and related services to grocery, fast-food and hotel chains; residential customers are next.
What will the electric power industry look like in about a decade? There will probably be a small number of national-scale generators -- perhaps a dozen or so --, supplemented by regional and niche players. Many of today's electric utilities will be little more than regulated wires companies, but some will have grown by acquiring neighboring wires and other operations. Many companies -- maybe banks, retailers or other service companies -- will offer electricity, usually bundled with other products and services.
Although electric mergers have become more frequent, the industry's future probably holds more horizontal than vertical consolidation. Companies that aspire to be regional or national generators will seek only generating assets, not the forever-regulated wires attached to today's integrated utilities. Others will shun the competitive generation business but may be interested in acquiring distribution assets to consolidate wires-only or wires-and-pipes businesses.
Tough choices are ahead. Investors, who have seen electric utilities underperform the market in recent years, have the difficult task of picking winners. Policy makers must sort through the competing interests to balance demands for lower rates with the need to establish rules for effective long-term competition. Perhaps the toughest decisions are faced by the utilities as they try to remake themselves. Customers should benefit from lower prices and more options, but how much they do so will depend on how astute their choices are.

HEADLINE: MINDING YOUR BUSINESS;
In Search of the Best Market Barometer

BYLINE: By LAURA PEDERSEN 

 BODY:

Q. What is the best stock market indicator to watch?
 ERIN SLEET
 Kansas City, Mo.
 
A. If I knew, I'd be -- as the old song goes -- as rich as Rockefeller. Anyone who even dabbles in stocks knows how hard it is to divine which way they are headed. When J. Pierpont Morgan Sr. was asked what the market was about to do, he snapped, "It will fluctuate," summing up many investors' frustration. 
 But there are a host of indicators, trends and theories -- some, of course, more reliable and economically significant than others -- that traders and analysts use to guide their investing strategies.
The Jewish New Year, Rosh ha-Shanah, celebrates renewal and turning over a new leaf. So how do many investors greet it? By unloading their portfolios. The maxim goes: Sell near Rosh ha-Shanah; buy close to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which always falls 10 days later.
Other Wall Streeters invest ahead of the "Santa Claus Rally" -- a rise in stock prices that often occurs between Christmas and New Year's Day. Or they heed the "January effect" -- the almost inevitable rise in stock prices just after New Year's as pension funds invest year-end cash contributions.
"Everyone's looking for that magic bullet," said Yale Hirsch, whose Hirsch Organization in Old Tappan, N.J., publishes "The Stock Trader's Almanac" ($27.75 plus shipping for the 1996 edition). Among his favorite indicators is the advance-decline line -- the ratio of the number of stocks that have advanced to the number that have declined over a certain period. The line is believed to tell the general market direction: bullish if more stocks advance than decline, and bearish if declines outnumber advances. When the line points down, as it has for some time, it usually signalstrouble.
Mr. Hirsch cautioned that the daily advance-decline line had lost some of its appeal since the advent of program trading, which has made the market more volatile. Stick with the weekly number, he said, "because it smooths out much of the volatility."
For a hint of what might be ahead in this election year, check the Presidential cycle, Mr. Hirsch suggested. The indicator holds that stocks decline soon after a President is sworn in, presumably because he takes immediate steps to reduce inflation, Government spending and the deficit. "Which is why the gains in the President's third and fourth years usually tower over those in his first and second years," Mr. Hirsch said.
Should Bill Clinton be re-elected, "think bearish," Mr. Hirsch said. History records a bear market 9 times out of 10 when a sitting President is re-elected. The exception: Ronald Reagan in 1984.
What indicator would a Wall Street pro pick, given just one choice? "The long bond," said Michael Schwartz, an independent floor trader on the American Stock Exchange. He takes his cues from interest rate fluctuations by watching the 30-year Treasury bond, the "long bond" in trader parlance. It normally pays investors the most for their money. "With the long bond yielding above 7 percent and dividends on stocks only 2 percent," Mr. Schwartz said, "stocks are starting to look pretty unattractive." When rates rise, people tend to move out of the market and into fixed-rate investments like Treasuries and bank C.D.'s.
There is a name for this, but it might be confused with a 12-step recovery program. Called the "three step and stumble rule," it is Wall Street's version of "three strikes and you're out." The theory is that stock and bond prices will fall if the Federal Reserve raises the discount rate three times in a row. By raising this key interest rate, the Fed both increases the cost of corporate borrowing and makes alternative investments, like money market funds and C.D.'s, relatively more attractive than stocks and bonds. If you're keeping score, we took Step 1 when the Fed reversed course and raised the discount rate early this year. That means there are two steps to go. The next Fed meeting is on Aug. 20.
A money manager who dismisses most indicators as hocus-pocus is Jim O'Shaughnessy, the president of O'Shaughnessy Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., and the author of "What Works on Wall Street," to be published in September (McGraw-Hill, $29.95). "Let's face it, if someone had a really great indicator, you wouldn't be able to get on the phone with that guy," he said. "And he'd be so rich he wouldn't want to be on the phone with you."
Mr. O'Shaughnessy, who probably doesn't even read his daily horoscope, is more of an empiricist when it comes to market judgments. His favorite tool can be called the "total market return rate."
When I try to explain this indicator, I'm reminded of Chevy Chase, a.k.a. Gerald Ford, engaged in a mock Presidential debate on an episode of "Saturday Night Live." He complained of being blindsided by economic numbers and argued, "I was told there wouldn't be any math."
Having myself flunked high school algebra (asked to add 2A and 2B, I once answered, "ABBA"), I realize this is dangerous, but here goes:
Start with the earnings yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 (for those unfamiliar with the measure, it's the inverse of the price-earnings ratio of the index). Add that measure (now 5.44 percent) to the S.& P. dividend yield (2.25 percent). Divide the sum by the latest 13-week T-bill rate (5.13 percent). When the final number falls below 1.5, Mr. O'Shaughnessy said, it's a bad omen for stocks because investors are not being compensated enough for the added risks of the stock market, versus the risk-free return in bonds. Right now, the indicator is a sliver below the threshold, at 1.499, though in recent weeks it has darted further into the danger zone with the market's gyrations.
Mr. O'Shaughnessy loves this calculation; he has tested it back to the 1950's, and it has been consistently on target.
The trouble with all sorts of indicators, most of which had been spelling gloom and doom well before the recent market rout, is that they may turn out to be fads -- hot today, gone tomorrow. Remember the odd-lot theory? It held that the odd-lot buyer -- usually the individual investor who trades in lots of less than 100 shares -- is most often a victim of bad timing and that, therefore, money can be made by becoming a contrarian. Its advocates maintained that heavy odd-lot buying in a rising market was a sign of technical weakness and an impending market reversal. They haven't been heard from lately, in large part because small investors made a mad rush to mutual funds.
What accounts for the short shelf life of many indicators? The constant change in the stock market. "It's like fighting a new war with old tools," Mr. Hirsch said.
So what is an investor to do? "Don't try to time the market," Mr. O'Shaughnessywarned individual long-term investors. "More money is lost heeding the indicators than just leaving your portfolio alone."
Had you left all your eggs in the market back in September 1929, you'd still have come out ahead 20 years later.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Is It a Bear, Or the Cub That Roared?

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
EVEN the most complacent investors must have winced over the rumbling of the stock market last week. It gyrated wildly early on, recovered a bit but still ended on a down note.
When all was done, the Dow Jones industrial average had shed 84 points, or 1.5 percent of its value. Was it just some momentary indigestion, common in even the most vigorous of bull markets, or was it instead the first growl of a long-coming bear market? 
 Four professionals, each of whom has a different perspective on the ways of the stock market, was asked to answer two questions: Is this a correction or the beginning of a bear market? And what advice would you give a relative wondering what to do?
Though their answers are conflicting -- as are their interest-rate forecasts and market theories -- the experts describe the forces that will determine whether stocks and mutual funds continue their bull run. REED ABELSON
 
Byron R. Wien
U.S. investment strategist
Morgan Stanley
Well, I think the downturn is bigger than we've seen, and it probably is the beginning of a bear market, but not definitely.
There are reasons for a bear market, including valuation. The market is not undervalued. If interest rates go higher, the market will become overvalued. There were also enormous flows of equity capital into the market at the beginning of the year, but that is diminishing. Volume peaked in March, and that tends to occur five or six months before the market makes a top.
If you have good long-term holdings with big gains, don't sell them. On the other hand, if you have had some profits, you could use the current rally to raise reserves. I think you will get better prices later.
 
Eric Miller
Chief investment officer
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
We're treating it as a correction, still within a secular bull market. Corrections can last a few weeks or a few months. We're not convinced this one is over. For the very short term, we've had some relief.
The next five to six weeks is an important time in terms of data and events that could prolong or deepen the correction. There is still the open question of whether the Federal Reserve will move to tighten this summer. Our own view is that there is going to be a visible slowing of economic growth in the second half.
If you do not own stocks at all and have been intending to and have the wherewithal, you should do selective buying. If you have been very aggressively invested, you should probably use rallies to lighten up some positions.
 
Elaine Garzarelli
Chairwoman
Garzarelli Investment Management
My indicators are neutral. On a scale from 0 to 100, they've dropped from 80.5 percent in April to 48.5 percent, which is still neutral. The correction is over now. The market can have a fairly nice move.
I'm very positive on interest rates. The key things I look at are inflation and the budget deficit. If the 3-month Treasury bill goes up a point from here, and the 30-year and 10-year Treasury bonds go up a point from here, I would have a "sell" signal. The market could go up to 6,400 at current interest-rate levels.
If people are nervous about the market, I would tell them to get an index fund. You could sell out easily if the Fed hikes interest rates by a full percentage point.

Alan Blinder
Princeton economics professor
Former Fed vice chairman
The difference between a "correction" and a "bear market" hinges, I suppose, on how long stock prices keep falling. Since the long-run trend of the stock market is decidely up, a bear market is really just a correction that lasts a long time. (Was October 1987 a correction?)
I do not pretend to be able to forecast how long stock prices will fall. But I certainly don't see why current economic conditions -- steady growth at a moderate pace, low inflation, low unemployment and high profits -- should be bad for stocks.
The advice I'd give to my brothers and mother is that stocks are the only place to be for the very long run. Buy a broadly diversified portfolio and measure time in years, not days. And don't try to time the market; you will probably fail.

HEADLINE: The World;
Talk Multilaterally, Hit Allies With Stick

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Clinton Administration came to office three years ago heralding a new age to end the constant economic warfare among the world's trading nations -- an age in which countries could settle their arguments in a host of new international courtrooms.
It started with the North American Free Trade Agreement, which created panels of judges to interpret a treaty so thick that one American diplomat swears she used her copy to clobber a rat to death in her apartment. Then the United States led the way in creating potentially the world's most powerful international court, the World Trade Organization. 
 But these days America's allies unanimously complain that while Washington talks a great game of international consensus, it tosses the rhetoric aside whenever the stakes are truly high. Then it unleashes its economic clout to force other nations to toe the line. This, the allies say, is exactly what the Administration is doing to them as it works to isolate Cuba, the last Communist holdout in the Western hemisphere, and Iran, viewed as a prime sponsor of terror.

 
 
'Bullying'
 President Clinton has joined Congress in threatening to impose huge penalties against foreign companies doing business with either offending nation. Lawyers call this "extraterritorial reach," a practice the State Department used to scream about when Arab states used it against American companies doing business in Israel. Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian Foreign Minister, has another word for it.
"This is bullying," he said the other day. "But in America, you call it global leadership."
The sting of that leadership was felt the other day by Sherritt International Corporation, a Canadian mining company. Under the Helms-Burton Act, the company's top executives and their families have been prohibited from entering the United States because Sherritt is "trafficking" in property President Fidel Castro seized from American companies in 1959.
Last week, President Clinton tightened the screws another half-notch, under pressure from Cuban-Americans in Florida and, to a lesser extent, New Jersey -- not coincidentally two key states in the coming election. Under the same law -- which the President first opposed, then signed after Cuba shot down two planes piloted by anti-Castro exiles -- Mr. Clinton said he would allow American citizens and companies to sue any foreign concern using their now-decrepit property in Cuba, from old factories to the aging phone system. But in a gesture to Canada, Mexico and Europe, he also suspended that right for six months in hopes that the allies would change their attitude about "engaging" Mr. Castro. The European Union and Canada were unimpressed, and said they would pass laws calling for retaliation against American companies.
Mr. Clinton's aides bristle when they hear what one official called "all this whining" that they are abandoning multilateral solutions to problems. "It's simply an unfair complaint," said Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser. "This is a Government -- whether the issue is Bosnia, GATT, NATO expansion or relations with the former Soviet Union -- whose instinct has always been to do these things in a collegial way. To extrapolate from a few instances that the U.S. is going unilateral is a bit ridiculous."
To understand why the allies are so upset, imagine a similar law enacted by Canada -- aimed not at the Cuban revolution but the American. After all, thousands of colonists loyal to King George fled north, abandoning their graceful houses in Boston and their factories up and down the Atlantic coast. A Canadian Helms-Burton law would permit their descendants to sue companies now occupying that factory land, and yuppies now living in those old mansions -- a throwback to an era when the Americans built forts on the shores of Lake Champlain.
At least that's the sort of parallel drawn sarcastically by those on the business end of Helms-Burton. But some of those who complain of American bullying speak transparently from self-interest.
When the United States took on Japan on its barriers to selling American autos and parts last year, Tokyo tried to bring the case before the World Trade Organization. It doesn't take an international trade lawyer to figure out why: the conflicting evidence about what constitutes an open or closed market is so complex it would have have required months or years of hearings. And presumably Japan could use its own considerable economic clout to assure that other members of the organization would think twice before rushing to Washington's side.
Wise to the strategy, Washington went head-to-head, threatening sanctions if Japan failed to sign a satisfactory agreement. The result was faster action: The most recent trade figures, released on Thursday, show a big improvement in auto-related sales to Japan. Score one for staying out of court.

 
 
Muscle-Bound
 But over the long term, the United States is not likely to be free to flex its muscles whenever it wants to. "The spread of our companies to every corner of the world, and our inability to call the shots ourselves, will push us to take the multilateral route," said Jeffrey Garten, who was part of the negotiating team in the car talks and is now dean of the Yale School of Management. "We would like to do what we did in the cold war, to go to our allies and decree an outcome. You can't do it any more. Now there is always a huge amount of arm-twisting and tradeoffs."
Sometimes that arm-twisting is easier to explain than at others: the Administration makes the case that Europe's continued investment in Iran has done nothing to curb the country's terroristic tendencies. But Cuba, even some of Mr. Clinton's advisers concede, is a very different case. Without a looming election, it's hard to imagine him risking relations with the nation's biggest trading partners to destabilize a tiny island on the brink of economic disaster. And when Administration officials are asked why the United States hews to a policy of "engagement" with powerful Communists in China while urging isolation of weak ones in Havana, the answer comes right out of Clausewitz: you wage the economic wars you can win.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
A Marathon of Disruption For Corporate Atlanta

BYLINE: By JERRY SCHWARTZ 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
OR most of his working life, Mike Sweeney has donned the corporate uniform of suit and tie and driven to work for an ordinary business day as an administrator in the midtown Atlanta offices of the Nationsbank Corporation.
But for the next two weeks, he will work at the bank only from noon to 5 P.M. He then will slide into a pair of bright red shorts, a golf shirt spangled with red, white and blue and work until midnight as a volunteer at the Summer Olympics, conducting visitors to and from events.. 
 Barbara Petit, a freelance events planner in Atlanta, lives only five minutes by car from the hub of Olympic activity, but she has moved into a downtown hotel, speaking once or twice a day by phone with her husband and daughter.
Ms. Petit expects her average workday during the Olympics to be from 15 to 20 hours.
"I'm hoping there will be a rhythm that develops somewhere along the line," she said. "Right now, it's just wake up, get to work and keep going."
Exhausting days, odd assignments and logistical headaches are expected to be the rule for the 100,000 Atlantans who work in the central business district, now converted into the capital of the sports universe.
Although some Olympic events are being held far from Atlanta -- yachting, for example, is in Savannah, Ga., almost 250 miles away -- these Games are in some ways the most compact in Olympic history. The sites for 16 sporting events and the athletes' Olympic Village are in a three-mile-wide circle in downtown Atlanta, called the Olympic Ring.
As a result, dozens of downtown streets will be closed to all but Olympic traffic. Ordinary business deliveries will be suspended and office workers have been told to be at their desks by 7 A.M. or to forget about coming downtown. Those who are taking the subway or public buses have been warned that their commute could be three times longer than usual.
Some companies have simply urged their workers to take vacations during the Olympics. But people still have to get to work, and many companies, including Suntrust Bank, Georgia-Pacific and Coca-Cola, with their headquarters within walking distance of the Games, have had to develop strategies to get employees to the office.
Several have formed a private, 24-hour bus system to collect workers in suburban areas and bring them downtown. Georgia-Pacific expects to transport about 400 of its 3,000 downtown workers on the private bus system each day.
Some companies have set up early-morning shifts so employees can be home by early afternoon. Others are allowing employees to telecommute, working from home using personal computers and modems.
Several companies have released workers to serve as Olympic volunteers. About 300 Georgia-Pacific employees have volunteered and will receive half their usual pay from the company. About 750 of Coca-Cola's 6,000 Atlanta employees have also volunteered, with their salaries during the period paid by the company.
Most of the rest of Coca-Cola's work force is assigned to various aspects of the company's Olympic Games sponsorship, like the Coca-Cola Olympic City, the company's Olympic theme park. "The Olympics is our business," said Mark Preisinger, a spokesman for the company. "About two-thirds of our employees have Olympic assignments. The other third are running the day-to-day operations."
Suntrust is using cots so essential workers in the company's check processing center can literally sleep on the job, said Hugh Suhr, a spokesman. Interoffice mail for several downtown Suntrust sites will be delivered between midnight and 6 A.M.
THE odd working hours and longer commutes can throw home lives into chaos. Some workers have had to hire nannies or get help from friends and relatives to care for children. "Our employees already have been told by their day-care centers that they can't expect to leave their children in day care for 12 to 14 hours a day," Mr. Suhr said.
That is not the case at the day-care center at the All Saints Episcopal Church, a half-mile from the Olympic Village. The center is extending its hours during the Olympics, opening an hour earlier in the morning, at 6, and closing at 9 P.M., two hours later than usual.
"We're not so concerned about people being able to drop off their children," said Paulette Fair, who works at the center, "but we recognize they may not be able to get back here when they planned."

HEADLINE: The Week of Investing Dangerously

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

 BODY:
IS it the Big One? That's what Californians ask every time crystal trinkets start to tap-dance on the bookshelves. And that's what investors ask these days every time this space-traveling stock market slips.
That can be a stomach-churning question indeed for investors old enough to recall a certain Monday in October 1987. They know what a market free fall can do to the gut or the nervous system, and now gladly play "Where were you that day?"
 No, last week won't join the disaster pantheon, even though for a time the crystal was audibly skittering on Wall Street. 
 In a sense, though, Tuesday was the Big One -- the busiest day ever on the New York Stock Exchange. And the week had its share of Little Ones, a thrill a minute -- a 161-point drop for the Dow industrials on Monday, a wild seesaw ride on Tuesday, a record rise for the Nasdaq on Wednesday, a sharp Dow rebound on Thursday.
By Friday the capitalist citadel had survived another week intact, but that doesn't mean there was any shortage of nervous stomachs and bitten nails along the way.
 A day-by-day look at the market's impact on some very different people, from experienced investors in glass towers to workers in out-of-the-way coffee shops, gives a sense of Wall Street's vast reach.
 
Monday: Seeing a 'Meltdown'
As the week began, Louis Navellier was upbeat but cautious. Mr. Navellier runs two mutual funds, managing more than $1 billion from his base in Reno, plus writing a newsletter.
In a telephone message for his newsletter clients recorded over the weekend, Mr. Navellier noted, "We had a number of our favorite companies report strong earnings last week." His favorite adjective: "phenomenal," which he used three times in about 30 seconds, as in "a phenomonal report for Ascend Communications."
In the recording, Mr. Navellier expressed optimism about earnings, despite the previous week's market weakness. But he was less rosy about the broader market. "I am not optimistic about the Dow and the S.& P.," he said.
Charles I. Clough was not optimistic at all. Mr. Clough, who as Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist mainly advises institutional clients, sees his role mainly as giving advice on "whether stocks are a good value or too high." He is partly removed from the fray, living in Concord, Mass., and venturing to New York three days a week. And he was distracted as the week began, his son having been married on Saturday.
Mr. Clough, bearish since February, turned more so in May. Companies have lifted profits by cutting costs, he said, but have done the easy part -- "picking the low-lying fruit." So if the economy slows, he argued, they will find it hard to raise profits.
 And the mutual fund boom, he worried, "has become speculative." Now, "it's not middle-aged people saving for retirement, it's people trying to make a fast buck."
Mr. Clough was in for a busy week.
 But these are the pros. What of the small investor? At a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, all the full-time employees are investors -- at least in Starbucks shares. Staff members get a percentage of their salary in stock options.
On Monday, though, news of the Dow's precipitous drop didn't penetrate the bustle of the shop. Coffee and conversation flowed.
Mark Chesney, Starbucks district manager, didn't hear about the plunge until he tuned in National Public Radio on Monday evening -- and after that he followed it through the week. But he was never too concerned. The stock did fall on Monday, to $24, and it "could drop to $15 and I wouldn't worry a bit," he said, "because I know over the next few years it would come back." The whole idea, he said, was to allow the options to build up for retirement, or for a house.
Another investor, Diane Haines, also took the long view. At no time during the market's wild ride did Ms. Haines, who is self-employed, look at her battered portfolio and consider climbing out on the window ledge.
For one thing, the rock ledge at her Clinton, N.J., home is just six inches above a goldfish pond. Also, Ms. Haines joined a local investment club 20 months ago to learn, with a divorce pending, how to manage her own affairs.
A central philosophy of the club is the idea of looking at a plunging market not as a disaster but as an opportunity to snap up quality stocks on the cheap.
Not that she stayed calm through it all. After work on Monday she got a call from a friend who told her about the Dow's dismal day, and a bolt of alarm shot through her. The next morning she called her discount broker's "800" number, punched in her account number, and a computer voice delivered the bad news. "Oh my goodness," she gasped to herself.
Mr. Navellier, the fund manager, felt that same jolt. Monday "was quite shocking," he said. "In fact," he added, referring to the plunge in the technology-heavy Nasdaq market, "we've had a bit of a technology meltdown here."
Still, "I would find it very hard to even think of selling right now," he said.
At Starbucks, Garry Novick, manager of the Chestnut Hill store, was also jolted -- though, busy all day, he did not hear of the drop till evening. Then he started checking the market "two, three, four times a day."
Mr. Clough, adviser to institutions, took it all in stride. In his opinion, the market actually cracked the previous Thursday on news of bad earnings, and hardly recovered on Friday.
As for the sudden plunge on Monday, he said, "I try not to be surprised by the market -- I've seen it come unhinged before."

Tuesday
 
'Oops, Here We Go Again'
Ms. Haines tried to shut the big market story out of her mind and concentrate on her work at the accounting and business service she runs. She was grateful, she said, that she didn't hear of Tuesday's 167-point midday dive until that evening, when, at a meeting, a local banker told her. "My reaction was, 'Oops, here we go again. Back-to-back losses of 160 points.' He didn't bother to mention until later that the market had quickly recovered," she recalled with a mock shudder.
"There were moments when the numbers were down and it took nerve to handle the temptation to sell," she said later with a smile that expressed relief that she had not succumbed to hitting the panic button during the darkest hours. "If I wasn't in an investment club, I know I'd be listening to friends saying it was the end of the world."
On the other hand, she resisted a temptation to pick up the phone and buy stocks that looked cheap. Her busy schedule made it impossible to track sliding stocks, and she wanted Wall Street to settle down before deciding whether to look for bargains. "Usually I keep a little list of stocks to buy if they go down to a certain level, but I haven't been mentally up to keeping one," she explained. On a bedside table lay three unread copies of Barron's.
Mr. Navellier sounded shell-shocked on Tuesday afternoon. "Well, we had a volume reversal, and that is good," he said, "but there was not a lot of news driving the reversal. We've got to get some follow-through before we get a real sign."
Mr. Clough was not surprised to see the market bounce back. It had, he said, dropped too far, too fast. "We had the combination of it being deeply oversold, plus a sigh of relief" about better earnings coming out. Still, he remained cautious: "That can lift it for two days," but not for long.
Certain traders, though, live in an upside-down world -- finding gloom in others' glee, seeing light when others see dark. These are the short-sellers, who make a living betting that stocks will fall. They do this by selling borrowed shares, and if their pessimism proves correct, they can replace them with shares bought later for less.
 In these circles, the market's tumble on Monday should have brought a sigh of relief. Short sellers have, after all, been retrenching since 1991, when the market's long bull run began. For most of them, though, the relief was decidedly short-lived.
"Until the market took off on Tuesday, everyone was fat, dumb and happy," said Benjamin Kopin, who manages $4.5 million in Lynx Partners, a short-selling fund in Chicago. Everyone, that is, who sells short.
Despite efforts to cover his losses, Mr. Kopin said he still "lost a little money" on Tuesday, probably because his fund is weighted toward small-capitalization stocks, which tend to be volatile.
Still, Mr. Kopin seemed to be taking the market's renewal in stride. "There are probably short-sellers who have made 40 to 50 percent over the past 10 days," he said.
For him, Tuesday was "really ridiculous." He found himself trying to buy back 10,000 shares of a particular technology stock he had shorted earlier. Even though the stock had been a recent favorite of investors, Mr. Kopin noticed on Tuesday morning that it had slid to his particular price target, which was $20 a share.
"All of a sudden I was trying to cover 10,000 shares, but there were simply no sellers," he said. "The stock hit bottom at 19 3/4, but when I put in a market order, I was lucky to get it filled at 22 3/8."
 
Wednesday
 
'Losing Money Is Always Scary'
As Wednesday dawned at Starbucks, Wall Street seemed light years away. Customers read newspapers over coffee or talked with friends. Classical music -- not CNN or stock reports -- provided the background noise.
Hermi LeFurge, the assistant manager, detailed the different tastes of Starbucks coffees for a customer new to the shop.
The stock market? "I don't really follow it," Ms. LeFurge said. "Starbucks is such a nice company to work for that even though the stock is going down, I know it will go back up." She admitted, though, that this week's volatility had caught her attention, and while she hasn't tracked Starbucks stock in the past, "I will now."
Mr. Navellier, meanwhile, was uneasy -- even with the market stabilizing. "I didn't like yesterday's reversal," he said, continuing to believe that the market was being driven by the whims of market makers.
Also unnerving him was the continued action in stocks that reported good earnings, like Intel, which after Tuesday's close reported better-than-expected earnings. "Intel was up four points at the opening and now it's kind of fizzled," he said about 10:30. "People like me ride wave after wave of institutional buying pressure. If the buying stops, we just sit there."
Often, an individual's reaction to market swings has much to do with age. It's an investing mantra that while there may be bumps along the way, in the long run stocks will do just fine. That's scant comfort, though, if retirement is around the corner.
 Mr. Novick, the Starbucks manager, is 49, and views his option plan as something that will be used for retirement, so he is able to take a longer look at the market's ride.
Ms. Haines, at 58, is watching from another angle. "Losing money is always scary," she said Wednesday evening. "Being as close to retirement as I am gives one a different perspective."
 
Thursday
 
'The Market Is Certainly Back'
By Thursday, the equity markets were bouncing back, partly because Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he expected economic growth to moderate. And Ms. Haines was having second thoughts about not joining the buying spree.
"You can talk all you want about taking advantage of a correction, but when it actually happens you don't know which way the market will swing," she said after the Dow jumped 87 points. But she didn't waver from her conviction that the markets should settle down before she waded back in.
"I'm fairly conservative and never could go wild with investing," she added, noting that she has bought only one Nasdaq stock lately. "The only bum stock I bought was from a 'hot tip' I got from a friend."
Mr. Kopin, the short-seller, spent a good chunk of Wednesday trying to cover his losses as technology stocks soared. On Thursday, one bit of luck became apparent when the stock he had bought Tuesday at 22 3/8 rose to 28. Despite his good fortune, Mr. Kopin noted late in the afternoon that the day had been "very hard on shorts" over all.
"If you'd looked at my screen today, you'd think the market had been up a lot more than 87 points," he said after the close. "If we get another day like this tomorrow -- especially another strong move in the morning -- I may start backing out."
Mr. Clough spent much of the week on the Delta Shuttle between Boston and New York, talking to clients, all hungry for advice. When the market goes up, he said, they want new ideas; when it goes down, they want defensive suggestions. "I sense that psychology is as volatile as the market."
By Thursday morning at Starbucks, the "big story" was no longer the market but the explosion of T.W.A. Flight 800 off Long Island. There was talk of little else, though some people did not forget to follow the market. After the sharp rebound, Mr. Novick said, "The confidence I felt earlier in the week followed through to a positive ending. The market is certainly back."
 
Friday
 
'We Don't Want A Dead-Cat Bounce'
On Wall Street, the day was mainly an anti-climax, with many traders -- and much of the rest of the nation -- preoccupied with updates on the T.W.A. crash. The Dow lost 37 -- treading water, by this week's standards.
Mr. Clough got a late start for Cape Cod, and as he drove he spoke of the week's close. Thursday's snapback, he said, had something to do with Mr. Greenspan's comments. Also, "it was so deeply oversold by midday Tuesday that it had to bounce back." But the rally wasn't really convincing, he said. It was "a ragtag kind of affair, just the usual suspects gaining a point or two."
What is important, he said, is "what happens in the next several weeks," since the market has been "acting emotionally." He expects choppiness to continue, though "it may be more like Chinese water torture."
Mr. Navellier shared his skepticism. "I'm increasingly suspicious of this rebound because there has been no news" to fuel it, he said. "What we don't want is a dead-cat bounce" -- when stocks rebound simply because they fell so far so fast.
Mr. Navellier travels 12 to 15 days a month to visit clients, but even on the road he is so focused on his beloved spreadsheets that he may be oblivious to what city he is in. But of one thing he is sure: "This is the most volatile week I can remember."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends;
If Market's a Yo-Yo, They Hold String

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
WHO makes the rain on Wall Street? In decades past, it was monopolist robber barons, industrial conglomerates, corporate raiders or high-tech program traders.
But these days the fate of the financial markets rests in less gilded hands: those of ordinary individuals, who over the last five years have quadrupled their investments in mutual funds that buy stocks, thus becoming the single largest force behind the stock market's upward climb. 
 In that time, stock prices have rarely taken an extended downward turn. Investors got a scare in the first half of last week, however, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 5 percent below its peak for the first time since 1994. From the beginning of July until Tuesday, the industrial average tumbled more than 500 points, or 9.5 percent. Only the calming influence of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who spoke before Congress of the Fed's vigilance against inflation, stayed a possible rout.
Now all eyes on Wall Street are turned toward Main Street, to see how average investors will respond to a wildly gyrating stock market. During the great mutual fund boom, the greatest fear among investment professionals has been that people who bought mutual funds thinking that stock prices could only go up will, at the first sign of a downturn, take their money and run, perhaps causing a global market crash.
"The market's rise since 1994 in particular has almost totally been a function of inflows to mutual funds on the part of the public," said Steven C. Leuthold, an investment manager in Minneapolis, who noted that the money comes from both those who passively deposit money in corporate retirement plans and those who actively invest cash they hope to use in a few months. While mutual fund managers make the decision about which stocks to buy, it is the surge of money from individuals that has been the greater source of the market's strength.
Several factors account for the trend, which was a long time in coming. From their start in 1924 through the end of World War II, mutual funds did not attract much attention, "because everyone remained cowed by the markets of the 1920's," said John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group, the country's second-largest mutual fund company. Even after the market's boom in the 1960's, a severe decline in the early 1970's again turned investors away.
 
 
 
The Ideal Vehicle
 But in 1981, the greatest bull market in stock and bonds in history began, as inflation fell and the economy began to expand. And the ideal vehicle for middle-class investment became the mutual fund -- simply, a pool of money contributed by individuals and managed by a professional spreading risk across dozens of investments. Total assets in stock, bond and money market funds grew from $100 million in 1980 to nearly $3 trillion today. Stock funds in particular have grown most rapidly in the last five years.
The mutual fund boom results in part from the fact that more and more companies are scaling back retirement benefit plans, finding it cheaper to hand over cash to employees now and let them invest the money. At the same time, Baby Boomers have begun shifting from a lifestyle of profligate spending and consumption to one of saving and investing. As inflation has declined, people have grown less enamored with owning "stuff" that increases in value with inflation -- artwork, precious metals and real estate, for example -- and more apt to invest in assets that can generate income.
"All of those factors coincided in about 1990," said Abby Joseph Cohen, an investment executive at Goldman Sachs & Company. Looking around for a place to invest, people realized that over the last 70 years, except for short periods when interest rates were abnormally high, stocks provided higher returns than nearly all other investments.
After the market gained more than 36 percent last year, investors poured $140 billion into stock mutual funds in the first six months of 1996 -- more than in any previous full year. Morningstar Inc., a service that monitors more than 7,000 mutual funds, notes that it tracks more stock funds -- 3,221 -- than there are companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- 2,755.
Last month, however, as the stock market started to dodge and dip, the amount of money flowing into mutual funds slowed down. And last week, when stock prices fell more sharply, the flow reversed. Investors were reported to have pulled $4 billion out of stock funds in the week ended Wednesday, the most in any week in nearly five years.
Whether that is a temporary blip or the reversal of a pivotal trend will not be known for several months at least. The mutual fund industry's major trade group, the Investment Company Institute, has long maintained that investors do not panic and flee when stock prices drop.
In a study of shareholders' behavior from 1944 to 1995, John Rea, the institute's chief economist, found that even the stock market crash of 1987 failed to trigger "substantial outflows" of more than 5 percent of the industry's assets. "Stock fund shareholders generally are experienced investors, have long-term investment objectives and horizons and have a basic understanding of investment risk," the report concluded.
Not even everyone in the fund industry agrees. "To say that fund investors stay strongly committed through thick and thin is a canard," said Mr. Bogle of the Vanguard Group. He said investors are holding mutual funds for shorter periods of time and are increasingly using them as a means of speculating on the near-term direction of the stock market -- or even small sectors of it.
Fund companies themselves have encouraged such practices. Most offer automated, toll-free phone numbers that allow investors to easily switch between individual stock funds or pull out entirely.
The growth in mutual funds, and the related eagerness of fund investors to chase whatever fund manager or investment trend is hottest at the moment, has affected the stock market in other ways as well. The volume of cash flowing into funds has increased the demand for stocks to buy.
 
 
 
Happy to Oblige
 Wall Street has only been too happy to supply that need. In May more companies "went public" -- selling stock to the investing public for the first time -- than in any single month in the past decade. New companies hungry for expansion cash found that they could skip the traditional route of going to venture-capital firms for seed money.
This speculative fever has helped to finance rapid advances in computers and other technology that in turn fuel consumer spending and economic growth, said Sanford R. Robertson, chairman of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a San Francisco investment bank that specializes in bringing technology companies public. In much the same way that the advent of public stock ownership helped to fuel the Industrial Revolution, mutual fund shareholders have been the driving force behind the technology explosion of the 1990's.
The mutual funds that eagerly bought the shares of many of those nascent companies, however, found that in addition to rising faster than the overall market, they fell more quickly when it dropped. Mutual funds specializing in the stock of small companies, after generating returns of 15 percent in the first six months of this year, have since fallen by an average of 10 percent, and many have fallen into the red for the year.
Up to now, fund investors have typically found themselves better off by investing after dips in the market. But Mr. Leuthold questions how patient they will be -- even those investing for retirement -- if the market goes into a prolonged slump.
He also wonders how many of the investors who flocked to mutual funds in the last five years know that a real market downturn can last years. Investors who bought stocks in 1968, just before the stock market collapse of the 1970's, did not recover their original investment until 1982. "Even on the part of those investors who are buying mutual funds for retirement, I think there is a gross misunderstanding of the dynamics of the stock market," said Mr. Leuthold.

HEADLINE: When Worlds Collide

BYLINE: By Ronald Steel; Ronald Steel, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California, is the author of "Temptations of a Superpower."

DATELINE: NORWICH, Vt.

 BODY:
There is something both normal and frightening about our reaction to the explosion that blew T.W.A. Flight 800 out of the air and killed 230 innocent people. Normal in that the unexplained destruction of any symbol of American power and influence -- a military base, a government building, a corporate headquarters, an American-based airline -- immediately leads us to suspect terrorists. Frightening in that such acts lie beyond the customary rules of innocence and guilt, cause and effect, by which we organize our lives. If this should prove to be an accident rather than a crime, the best that we will be able to say is that it was not terrorism this time.
Terrorism, the means by which the weak frighten and punish the strong, has become part of our lives. We are no longer shocked by it. We have even come to expect it. Sometimes, as in the case of the World Trade Center bombing, it comes bearing foreign accents and perplexing religious dogmas. Other times, as in Oklahoma City, it takes the form of the strangers who are one of us, with their familiar delusions of omnipotent enemies. 
 In truth they are one, the terrorists abroad and those at home: the ones we do not know, and the ones we spawn. They are both products of a world whose rules they do not understand and which they feel does not understand them. They want to return to an earlier time in which they believe that they would have an honored place. They are, to their minds, upholders of a true faith -- a faith that, whatever its tenets, will put them among the winners rather than the losers, the respected rather than the ignored.
Although they are people whom, rightly or wrongly, time has passed by, they are very much creatures of their time. They have taken the technology of the strong and adapted it to their own ends. Technology may be a liberating force, but what it unleashes resists and often defies those who create it. Chain reactions, whether in nuclear furnaces or the caldron of ideas, are constantly in danger of going out of control. Just as a gun is a terrible leveler, erasing status and privilege in an instant, so are the most awesome weapons of a state. The United States may be able to intimidate any other state with the sheer magnitude of its military power, but individual Americans are hopelessly vulnerable to those weapons in the hands of other individuals.
Terrorism eradicates the distinction, so essential in international relations, between the state and the individual. States challenge one another or even go to war. The wars may be terrible. But they are, for the most part, fought by certain clear rules. States rarely try to assassinate one another's leaders. Think how shocked we were by the C.I.A. schemes in the Kennedy Administration to kill Fidel Castro. They do not wantonly make civilians targets without some compelling military justification. Consider the continuing difficulty we have explaining to ourselves the destruction of Dresden and Hiroshima. Responsible states do not torture or kill their prisoners. When they do, we consider them guilty of war crimes.
States generally avoid such acts not because they operate under a higher moral code than do individuals, but because they fear retaliation in kind. Two can play the game of assassination and atrocity. Thus the "rules of war." But terrorists have no interest in such distinctions. They operate outside the contrived world of state-sanctioned violence. This is the source of their weakness, but also of their strength. They know that the kinds of retaliation that states use against one another -- war, economic sanctions, embargoes -- are useless against them. A few individuals may occasionally be caught -- like the bombers at Riyadh, the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City -- but the core group of true believers remains untouched.
Every modern state is highly vulnerable to such terrorism. Indeed, the more modern it is, the more technologically and sociologically complicated its structure, the more vulnerable it is. It takes only a power outage to shut down a great city, or an abandoned truck to instill fear among tens of thousands, as happened last week in Seattle. The U.S. is not alone in being a target or being vulnerable. Ordinary civilians, the more innocent the better, have been targets of I.R.A. and Algerian terrorists. Their objective is to neutralize power by assaulting it at its weakest link: public confidence.
Why the United States? Alas, the proper question is, why not the United States? Just as the American Government is the locus of power within this country (and thus the logical target for right-wing militia members who feel otherwise powerless), so the United States is the locus of power for a "new world order" that would render irrelevant traditional faiths and even whole societies. Americans pride themselves on being in the forefront of the modern, in being the world's leader. But not everyone finds that world as appealing, or even as inevitable, as we do. To many it is deeply threatening.
We proudly declare ourselves to be No. 1, the world's only remaining superpower. Naturally, the discontented of the world hold us responsible for their plight: their poverty, their ignorance, their weakness, their irrelevance. A nation cannot be No. 1 when it suits its convenience and be "Who, little me?" when it doesn't. In status begin responsibilities. We so much take for granted not only our status but our standards that it hardly occurs to us that others may look upon them with alarm. We extol such principles as democracy, individualism, consumerism and the marketplace of ideas as though they were uncontested virtues. We are sincerely puzzled when others find these notions threatening. We assume they must be either misinformed or obtuse. Like the Victorian traveler confronted by uncomprehending "natives," we start talking louder.
It was never the Soviet Union, but the United States itself that is the true revolutionary power. We believe that our institutions must confine all others to the "ash heap of history." We lead an economic system that has effectively buried every other form of production and distribution -- leaving great wealth and sometimes great ruin in its wake. We purvey a culture based on mass entertainment and mass gratification: one that extols hedonism and accumulation even as it describes them as individualism and abundance. The cultural messages we transmit through Hollywood and McDonald's go out across the world to capture, and also to undermine, other societies.
Unlike more traditional conquerors, we are not content merely to subdue others: We insist that they be like us. And of course for their own good. We are the world's most relentless proselytizers. The world must be democratic. It must be capitalistic. It must be tied into the subversive messages of the World Wide Web. No wonder many feel threatened by what we represent. We are the apostles of globalization, the enemies of tradition and hierarchy. A chasm runs through the center of the globe. On one side are the modernizers, with their absolute belief in science, rationality, individualism and progress. On the other are the defenders of the faith and moral certainty.
The war between modernizers and traditionalists will continue for a long time to come. Two worlds are in collision, and all of us are in the front lines.

HEADLINE: Pay for Play: Jordan vs. Old-Timers

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
In a way, Michael Jordan is cheap at the price.
It was reported last weekend that for a mere $25 million, the Chicago Bulls, and the world, will get another year of what you can bet will be inspired performance from Mr. Jordan, whose day job is being the world's most expensive pitchman. 
 The largest one-year contract in the history of team sports may seem excessive, but not since Babe Ruth sold baseball and the joys of consumer appetite as a globe-traveling ambassador of Yankee power (true, the chant soon became "Yankee, go home!") has a single athlete so dominated his sport and embodied his time. And Jordan can command more from a sports economy now vastly inflated by television money, a global audience, athletes rights' to control their contracts and 50 years of middle-class leisure. (So can Shaquille O'Neal, who last week jumped to the Los Angeles Lakers for more than $17 million a year.)
The Babe was beloved in the transitional '20's for simplifying life, evoking the myth of our arcadian past and providing a role model for immigrant and other throwaway children. Jordan, similarly, is used as a role model, though often at a disservice to minority youth. To many, he also represents cultural imperialism and avarice (the $25 million will probably represent less than half of his total annual income). Still, his intense dedication to perfection and his brand of romanticism (remember his minor league field of dreams?) make it hard to begrudge him anything.
Well, almost. There is a nagging thought: Does being Mike entail any responsibilities beyond doing your best on court?
Let's ask Inge Hanson, who runs Harlem RBI, a youth baseball and mentoring program. She was mugged earlier this year by a 14-year-old and his 10-year-old henchboys. After they knocked her down and took about $60, a mugger kicked her in the face. The next day, the bruise that had welled up on her left cheek bore the imprint of a Nike swoosh. It lasted for three weeks and she felt sad thinking she was probably robbed to finance a fancier pair of Nikes.
"But I can't honestly answer your question," she said. "How could Michael Jordan possibly know that by endorsing sneakers -- sneakers! -- he was involved in a crime? And yet, one does wonder if he has any responsibility to his audience beyond just saying, 'Just Do It!' "

Chart: "To Be Like Mike"
 Michael Jordan will be paid a reported $25 million to play for the Chicago Bulls next season.
 Is this an outrageous sum? Perhaps. For statistical fun, let's compare notable sports compensations over the past century or so by accounting for inflation between then and now.
 Hmmm. Jordan and his sports-superstar contemporaries still are doing pretty well by comparison -- though for perspective we must also consider the $20 million that Sylvester Stallone gets for a movie like "Judge Dredd."
 American values -- go figure.

CONTRACTS
In Another League
As President Clinton continues his contract negotiations with the American public, it's clear he's far more interested in job security than in landing any kind of raise, even a cost-of-living adjustment. That's just as well, given how salaries of elected officials have lost ground to those of sports stars over the years. In 1930, as Babe Ruth was trying to negotiate an $80,000 contract, reporters asked him if he wasn't embarrassed to be seeking more than the $75,000 that President Hoover earned. "I had a better year," the Babe answered. Well, Shaquille O'Neal just signed a $17 million-a-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, meaning he'll make every five days what Mr. Clinton makes annually. But did he have a better year?
 
CURRENCIES
A Strong Dollar Leaves
U.S. Manufacturers Moaning
With the dollar buying nearly 40 percent more yen than it did a year ago, Japanese manufacturers have a huge competitive advantage in the United States. The relatively weak yen gives them a choice of cutting prices to build market share, holding prices and increasing profits or mixing the two strategies. It probably spells good news for consumers, as most price wars do. But the Big Three auto makers and companies that make machine tools and earth-moving equipment are unhappy, indeed. But the Clinton Administration has consistently come down in support of a strong dollar, saying American companies were competitive and healthy enough to be just fine.
 
TURNAROUNDS
A Quick $490 Million
Sunbeam, that lagging appliance maker, is reaching for the stars. It brought in the noted turnaround player, Albert Dunlap, to increase the company's value, just as he did rather famously at Scott Paper. In just 18 months there, he aggressively, if not ruthlessly, cut one-third of its workers, 11,000 of them, and sold $2 billion of assets before selling the company to Kimberly-Clark for $9 billion. Now Sunbeam management is apparently hoping for a dose of the same medicine. The company named Mr. Dunlap chairman and chief executive late Thursday and Sunbeam's stock rose $6 on Friday. That immediately lifted the company's value by about $490 million. And that was before Mr. Dunlap even got a chance to sit in his new chair.
 
LABOR
Money Makes Relevance
Heavy spending on political advertising by unions has the Republican Party counterpunching and complaining about heavy-handed union bosses. "We're telling the truth," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. One analyst of Congressional races, Charles Cook, said, "It's the first time labor's been truly relevant politically in at least a decade."
 
FASHION
Drama in the Lanes
The fate of couture, the most exclusive and elitist of fashion's arts, seems to be up to a French businessman. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has supplied the only drama couture has had in the last year. He installed John Galliano at Givenchy and is now looking for a designer to replace Gianfranco Ferre at Christian Dior. His search was the buzz at the recent Paris shows, and he caused waves by declining to stand for an ovation for Mr. Ferre's last couture collection for Christian Dior. His departure marked the end of an era at Dior.

EARNINGS
Intel Saves the Day
 
When the going gets tough, the tough report record earnings. Say thank you to Intel, the computer chip maker, which after the close of a tumultuous day of stock trading on Tuesday calmed Wall Street by reporting surprising second-quarter earnings. Its effect was like a rainbow appearing after a storm. Traders who only hours before had seen gloom in the technology sector, were suddenly upbeat not only about high-tech stocks, but for the stock market in general. The numbers were so good that they helped lift the Dow industrials 18 points on Wednesday and by that time the cavalry had arrived: strong earnings from General Electric, Ford and Apple Computer. Despite disappointing results from AT&T on Thursday, the Dow climbed another 87 points, helped by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who cautioned that the economy's growth should moderate later this year, which reduces the likelihood that the Fed will have to raise interest rates soon. This week the market will be watching for earnings from Microsoft, RJR Nabisco and I.B.M.
 
TRADING
U.S. Settlement on Nasdaq
After a two-year investigation by the Justice Department, the Government and 24 securities firms reached an agreement on pricing practices that provides for closer Government oversight. Attorney General Janet Reno said the agreement, which is subject to approval by a Federal judge, would "deter future price-fixing on Nasdaq." The firms, which did not acknowledge any wrongdoing, still face a class-action suit in Federal District Court in New York.
 
MERGERS
Let's Make a Deal
The Federal Trade Commission has finally cleared the way for the $6.3 billion merger of Turner Broadcasting System and Time Warner. Sure folks, go ahead and do your deal, the F.T.C said, but do this for us, will you: carry a second news channel to compete against CNN, which is Turner's flagship news network. It is the first time the Federal Government has ever ordered that a cable channel carry a particular type of programming on such a scale. No big gulps were heard from the companies, and the deal seems sure to be approved by the agency in about three weeks.
 
AIRLINES
Crash Puts Pressure on T.W.A.
T.W.A. faces an agonizing sorting-out after a deadly crash that raised eerie associations to Pan Am Flight 103. The crash of T.W.A. Flight 800, on route from New York's Kennedy International to Paris, causing the loss of 230 lives, came as T.W.A. was on much stronger financial ground that it had been in years. Fliers may shy away from the airline for a while, but then come back in the months to come as pricing and scheduling conveniences wipe out the memory, travel agents predict. Still, T.W.A. has an aging fleet, and if security or maintenance lapses are found to have contributed to the crash, all bets on the airline's recovery are off.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
The G.O.P.'s Problem With Women

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHAT does a Republican woman want?
Republican men would like to know. At a critical moment, they seem a bit clueless. 
 Women in the Republican Party have always been a political minority, outnumbered not just by Republican men but by Democratic women. Now some in the party fear that its base of female support could shrink further, a bare 15 weeks before a national election that already looks perilous.
The instant reason is abortion: a furious battle between a mostly male Republican leadership that appears deeply and rigidly opposed to it, and a wing of moderate, pro-choice women leaders who want the party to be more flexible.
 
 
 
A Party Staple
 An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week suggested that the debate could force a staple of Republican politics, the affluent professional woman, to leave the party altogether -- or, perhaps, to begin waging a fight to retake it from social conservatives. And it implied that the furor could be affecting Republican women's support for the party's Presidential nominee-in-waiting, Bob Dole.
But abortion is the touchstone for broader, more subtle differences between moderate women and the party that some analysts and Republican politicians say may be ripe for exploitation.
Put one way, "Republican women show less of an ideological tendency than do Republican men," said Joe Cammarano, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who has studied Republican voting trends. "Republican men tend to be more ideologically consistent with the Republican Party platform."
Put another way, the most radical Congress in decades has unsettled even some of the women who elected it. "They're pretty concerned about the changes they see and those that are contemplated," said Representative Connie Morella, a Maryland Republican who has made a career of moderation. "They're very uneasy about the direction their party is taking."
The Republicans cannot afford to lose many more women from the centrist ranges; in the 1994 Congressional races, 54 percent of women voted for Democrats, and the gender gap was obvious in the primaries this spring.
Among those who identify themselves as Republicans, the differences between men and women are small. On Government spending and economic policy, on the military and foreign policy, on family and social standards and even on abortion the two sexes take sides in roughly the same proportion.
But on questions about the social compact -- on welfare, health care, unemployment and jobs, on affirmative action -- Republican women part ways with men. The men have moved dramatically since 1994 to limit or abolish bureaucratic safety nets and bootstraps. The women see a continued Government role in keeping unfortunates afloat.
In short, they are like Republican men, just less so. This has not escaped President Clinton as he has sought to rebuild his political constituency in the last year. And it may explain why Ms. Morella and others say the potential for defections is so high.
"The reason the gender gap became a gulch this year is that the Republican Congress wanted to affect the safety net," William Schneider, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a television analyst of the elections, said in an interview last week. "It's not just children or compassion. It's that women only began to achieve economic independence in the last 25 years, and they still feel vulnerable in the marketplace. They want the Government to be there to protect them should the net fall through."
 
 
 
Better Marks
 The NBC/Wall Street Journal survey found that Republican women tended to rate Mr. Clinton's ability to handle such issues somewhat higher than men did, and rated Mr. Dole's ability lower than did the men.
Whether that queasiness translates into votes is an unanswered question. The gender gap has swelled and ebbed over the years for many reasons, and while many pollsters say it is growing this year, others aren't so sure.
The Republican pollster Richard Wirthlin reports that the share of women who say they usually think of themselves as Republicans has dropped from the high 30-percent range in late 1994 to the very low 30's now, some 20 months later. Responses to a similar question asked regularly in the New York Times/CBS News Poll suggest that, on average, the share of women who say they consider themselves Republican has bumped along at 28 or 29 percent for the last six years, and now stands at about 28 percent.
One reason the disaffection of moderate women has looked like such a sore thumb this summer, experts say, is that the moderates make up a disproportionate share of the party's highly visible elite. Many were activists who built the party before forces on the right took it over in the 1980's. Most are better educated than average Republicans, and higher levels of education tend to go hand in hand with more flexible stances on issues like abortion.
They descend from an older strain of Republicanism that was fiscally conservative but more socially progressive, taking a hands-off position on Government intervention in personal matters. They were Eisenhower and Nixon voters, and they actually outnumbered Republican men for a while. Within the party, they have been displaced by the women of the religious right who may share their fiscal conservatism but are hardly libertarian on social standards.
 
 
 
'Just Blown Away'
 "For moderate Republican women," Mr. Cammarano said, "abortion is more than simply a symbolic issue. It really goes to the heart of their differences with their political party. The women who are involved in this fight really felt the Republican Party was the party of low taxes, fiscal austerity and progressive social policy without much intrusion. And that's just been blown away."
Mr. Schneider says the shift ultimately may bring more women into Republican ranks. Women generally are more religious than men, he notes, and the party's embrace of religion has struck a chord with many.
But in the short run, with the abortion debate still raging, the party and Mr. Dole have a problem. Mr. Dole, who takes a strongly anti-abortion position, made a peace offering to the moderates last week by awarding the keynote speech at the party convention next month to an abortion-rights supporter, Representative Susan Molinari of New York.
That only served to enrage Republican anti-abortion forces and their base of fundamentalists, a group Mr. Dole needs as much, if not more. And it is not at all clear what he can do that would make both of them happy.
"People think of the gender gap as symbolic -- throw a woman onto the ticket, and get rid of it," Mr. Schneider said. "Uh-uh." As the abortion debate shows, nothing about men, women and politics is that simple.

HEADLINE: Madagascar in Crisis;
The Land of Endangered Species in Danger

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar

 BODY:
MADAGASCAR'S newish Prime Minister gave his State of the Nation address last month, and nobody came.
That is, more than 100 of the 130 members of Parliament refused to take in their seats and listen, expressing their displeasure at his new Cabinet. He's a respected former chief justice and one of the chief authors of the new constitution, and they had hoped he wouldn't retain the same old presidential cronies that have left this country in such a mess. They were disappointed. 
 Why care? No special reason. That's part of Madagascar's problem. Few people except the French think about Madagascar at all unless they like lemurs and vanilla.

 
 
Ylang-Ylang and All That
 The French, of course, have a soft spot for their former colonies. And Madagascar, an island just east of South Africa, is a remarkably romantic place: It is a blend of Indonesian, Arab and African cultures, a place where people disinter their dead relatives and dance with them, where the perfume of ylang-ylang trees sometimes masks that of the open sewers, where betting on chameleon fights is a national boys' sport.
Chameleon fighting, come to think of it, is not a bad metaphor for Malagasy politics. Madagascar, the world's fourth largest island, is one of the world's basket cases. It is one of its 10 poorest countries, with an average annual income of about $200. Whole neighborhoods are filled with people eking out livings by selling trash -- nails they've restraightened, scavenged bolts they've found nuts to.
But why such poverty? Unlike Angola, Mozambique and Somalia, Madagascar has had no civil war. Unlike Rwanda and Burundi, its tribes don't hate each other to death. Unlike Malawi or Benin, it isn't tiny and overshadowed by big neighbors. It's the size of France.
It has lots of tourism potential -- strange animal species, long beaches and, for wealthy visitors, great French food -- and yet fewer than 100,000 people a year visit. Some are scientists, who don't spend much money, and some, far worse, are animal and reptile thieves.
Being an island near Africa is part of the problem. Having a population (nearly 13.9 million a year ago) that grows faster than the economy can create jobs hurts too. So do falling prices for its chief exports, including vanilla, coffee and cloves. When Americans skip dessert, Malagasy farmers suffer.
But the chief damage to the country has been political. Malagasy politicians have made a stunning array of bad choices.
Under the rule of a military tribunal headed by Didier Ratsiraka from 1975 to 1990, Madasgascar chose as it closest ally North Korea. It also nationalized its banks, mines, insurers, oil companies and export houses. And then Madagascar suppressed the French language, causing 50,000 of the 70,000 French who openly ran the economy and quietly ran many of the government ministries to depart. Even after Mr. Ratsiraka admitted in 1982 that his brand of socialism had failed and asked the West for money his government lacked the political will to undertake the austerity measures demanded by Western bankers.
Eventually, the Malagasy franc plummeted, halving public officials' salaries and forcing many of them to charge "fees" for doing their jobs, which encouraged widespread corruption. But the government didn't respond by cutting its own payroll. Nor did it reprivatize banks or give Esso back its piece of the national oil company. Instead, Madagascar tried to borrow money elsewhere -- even from princes in Lichtenstein.
"They ended up with money launderers and crooks," said Herizo J. Razafimahaleo, a leading opposition politician. "They got taken, and we lost our financial credibility." Madagascar's external debt is $4.25 billion, and it can't pay.

 
 
And Cyclones Too
 Since 1990, everything from cyclones to general strikes has hit, and the country has gotten steadily poorer.
Now the West, frustrated with the mess, won't cooperate. Esso, for instance, doesn't want its shares in the national oil company as repayment. It wants $25 million, in cash, from a government whose hard currency reserves are probably less than $2 million. Under a law sponsored by Jesse Helms, if the case isn't well on the way to settlement by Aug. 27, all new American loans and aid, even that for vaccinations and schoolbooks, can be cut off.
For now, American interests here are almost entirely ecological. Madagascar's ecology is fascinatingly weird -- about 80 percent of its plants and animals are found nowhere else. But even that national resource may be endangered. As the ever-growing population cuts trees for fuel, grazing land and rice paddies, Madagascar's biological niches are slowly vanishing.

New at Democracy
For Prime Minister Norbert Ratsirhaonama the trick now is finding a way to please the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, so the country can get its credit restored. Other banks follow the I.M.F.'s lead, and France has said its foreign aid will depend on cooperation. And the demands of the lenders can get quite specific -- early last year, they forced the dismissal of the governor of Madagascar's central bank. In that sense, the World Bank and the I.M.F. are "governing" Madagascar just as Wall Street and New York State "governed" New York City in the late 1970's.
Elements in Parliament, including Mr. Razafimahaleo's business-oriented party, Leader/Fanilo, seem eager to toe the I.M.F. line, believing that this is the way to push Madagascar toward recovery. But it won't be easy. "Remember, they've only been at this democracy thing for three years," said one diplomat. "This is definitely government as a work in progress."

HEADLINE: Olympic Fever in New York

 BODY:
The Olympics got under way in Atlanta this weekend with a spectacular display of international spirit and distinctly Southern heart. From Gladys Knight's "Georgia on My Mind," to the tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., to the touching moment when an ailing Muhammad Ali grasped the Olympic torch, the ceremonies were a reminder of why a city reborn as a place of tolerance and fair competition is an appropriate place for these international Games.
Yet even before the torch was lit Friday night, New York City, proud of its own international heritage, had begun thinking about trying to hold the Games in 12 years. The idea, which has won Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's tentative endorsement, raises exciting possibilities. 
 Like Los Angeles and Atlanta, New York could gain from the billions of dollars in spending, not to mention the good will and the sports facilities left to the city afterward. Even more important for the region's long-term development, the Games could spur private and public spending on infrastructure projects the city needs but has not undertaken.
But playing host to the Olympics also carries costs and risks. New Yorkers need to take a hard look at what benefits, financial and otherwise, would accrue from the Games and what public resources would have to be mobilized.
The Olympic Games can bring intangible benefits by stirring pride and civic feelings for the host city. They also bring money.
This year's Games may pump $5 billion into Atlanta. By the year 2008, with revenues rising rapidly, the Games could generate twice that amount in the New York City area. A new all-purpose Olympic stadium and other sports facilities, financed from revenues raised by the sponsoring committee, would serve as a permanent legacy for use by all New Yorkers and could help revive some of the city's rundown neighborhoods. On the other hand, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta and elsewhere in Georgia say the gains there will be limited and temporary.
What excites many business leaders is the prospect of spurring the construction of needed infrastructure. Taxpayers would have to foot much of this bill, however. In Atlanta, nearly $600 million in city and state government funds have gone to renovate sewers, repair roads, fix up the airport and help provide security. It is not clear that the increased tax revenues generated by the Games will pay for these expenditures. The Federal Government has helped with an additional $225 million over the last five years in Atlanta, but Federal spending may be tighter in the future.
Even if a New York organizing committee raises $3 billion from television rights, corporate sponsorships, merchandising, tickets and other sources, that money must then be spent to put on the Games themselves. Olympic rules say it cannot be spent for road or airport improvement, only for facilities directly needed for the Games. New Yorkers will need to look closely at whether they want to put scarce tax dollars into transportation projects to support the Games, or whether they would prefer a crash program to rebuild crumbling schools.
Another question is whether the money available for the Games would be enough to pay for all the facilities needed. The athletes could presumably use the New Jersey Meadowlands stadium, Madison Square Garden and even the Javits Convention Center, but probably not facilities on Long Island or Connecticut because they are too far away.
For that reason, organizers think the city would need to build a huge new stadium for track and field events, several smaller facilities and an Olympic village for 15,000 athletes and others. That sounds like too long a list for the money, though the village could conceivably be sold off and the stadium could be used later for other sports.
The main stadium, in fact, could be converted for the Yankees, as Mayor Giuliani suggests, or for the Mets, who want a new stadium in Queens. Some think it might make sense to build the other facilities nearby on the West Side or at Flushing Meadows, especially since Olympic events are supposed to take place in reasonable proximity to each other. Others have suggested the Harlem riverfront, the Brooklyn waterfront or even Governors Island in New York Harbor.
The Olympics would be a thrilling event for New Yorkers. The New York City Partnership, a leading business group, is to be commended for starting to raise private money for a feasibility study. All New Yorkers will eagerly await the answers to these difficult questions.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Beijing Bullets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's all Nafta's fault.
I have season tickets to the N.B.A.'s Washington Bullets and last week I heard the giant sucking sound of jobs moving south. Actually, it was only one job, but it was enough to make the front-page of The Washington Post. Bullets star forward Juwan Howard, the centerpiece of his team and a role model in this city, headed south after being offered $98 million over seven years by the Miami Heat. 
 Where is Ross Perot when you need him? I mean, none of this would have happened without Nafta, GATT, the W.T.O., APEC, the E.U., not to mention the N.B.A.
It's true. What you see with Juwan and other N.B.A. free agents, argues political scientist and disgruntled Bullets ticketholder Norman Ornstein, is how the integration and deregulation of global markets gives us more freedom of movement and more opportunity to profit from larger and larger markets, "at the same time that it severs the bonds of loyalty workers or employers might feel to any particular place." It is precisely because basketball (much more than baseball or football) has become a global sport, with a global TV audience and a global pool of loyal consumers for N.B.A.-endorsed products, that it can offer megasalaries that break any player's loyalty to team or community.
I was just in Moscow. The hottestselling matryoshka doll there -- those little wooden dolls with one inside another inside another -- is of the Chicago Bulls. Outside the Kremlin you can buy Scottie Pippen inside Dennis Rodman inside Toni Kukoc inside Michael Jordan. And if you aren't a Bulls fan, Moscow vendors offer matryoshka dolls of every N.B.A. team.
Juwan Howard's good fortune is that the improvement in his jump shot coincided with revolutions in global market integration and communications, which enable fans from Moscow to Mexico to help pay his salary -- by buying N.B.A. souvenirs or viewing rights. The N.B.A. already talks of expanding teams to Europe and Latin America. (Coming soon: "The Cali Cartels." The team logo is the poppy. The owners pay everybody in cash.) And just wait until China's workers get hooked on the N.B.A. and can afford to buy the high-tech sneakers they now make for the global market. Juwan Howard will make $980 million and his next contract will be with "the Beijing Bullets."
Just as the hometown player is becoming extinct, so too will the hometown owner. The net worth of Washington Bullets owner Abe Pollin was reported to be $100 million, derived originally from local Washington real estate. He was being asked to spend his entire net worth to keep one player. No wonder teams are now owned by I.T.T. or CNN's Ted Turner or Microsoft's Paul Allen. In a global economy only an owner with a global-size income can pay global-like salaries.
USA Today noted that Juwan Howard's $98 million contract would pay the average salary of an elementary school teacher ($30,000 a year) for 3,267 years. Michael Jordan's $25 million salary works out to $105 per second of playing time, or $315 for every three-second violation.
Juwan and Michael's fans may not begrudge them their salaries, as long as they win. But the widening gulf between winners and losers in the global economy that these sports salaries reflect will have social repercussions, argues Harvard University political theorist Michael Sandel: Rich and poor will increasingly live separate existences, sending their children to different schools, living in different neighborhoods and shopping in different stores.
And now, also rooting for the home team differently. It used to be that going to the game pulled a community together. But it will be able to do that less and less because to pay these huge salaries ticket prices are put out of reach to all but the rich, or stadiums are segmented with high-priced corporate boxes where only the wealthy sit. To pay for Shaquille O'Neal's $121 million salary, the Los Angeles Lakers had to raise their cheapest seats from $9.50 a game to $21, and most expensive from $500 to $600 per game.
"In the past," noted Mr. Sandel, "some sat in bleachers and some in box seats, but everyone ate the same hot dogs, drank the same beer and got rained on by the same storm. But now the wealthy can dine on lobsters in air-conditioned corporate boxes while the rest eat peanuts in the grandstands -- if they can afford to go at all. So even the ballpark is no longer the kind of shared public space that brings together people from different walks of life."

HEADLINE: In Peacetime, Vietnam's Army Turns to Business Ventures

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
In a recently refurbished army museum here, an exhibit on the war against the Americans has shrunk slightly to make room for a new display showing the military's role in the civilian economy, building dikes and electrification projects.
Since its founding in 1945, the People's Army of Vietnam has defeated the French and the Americans, held the northern border against a Chinese incursion and tamed neighboring Cambodia. But the army, while continuing to play a vital role in Vietnam, is now in transition, without a war to fight for the first time since its creation. 
 It is shifting its targets from foreign invaders to internal security threats and its energies from the battlefield to the marketplace.
At the recent Communist Party Congress, it strengthened its political clout and focused on a new mission, guarding against the "hostile forces" of Western influence unleashed by the country's newly liberalized economy.
"Without the military, disorder may occur," said Do Muoi, the Party's General Secretary. In a time of fundamental change, Vietnam is counting on its military and security forces to maintain party control and to insure that the West, defeated in war, does not win over the country through economic and social change.
The Congress increased the representation of military and internal security forces on the 18-member Politburo to 6 from 4 and gave them 3 out of 5 positions on a new standing committee that is to run day-to-day affairs. One of these men, Gen. Le Kha Phieu, 64, heads the army's political department and is viewed by foreign diplomats as a possible successor to Mr. Muoi, who is 79.
The increased political power of the armed forces reflects a desire to protect the country's political and social structure rather than any retrenchment of economic liberalization, foreign military analysts said. The army has already committed itself to the marketplace, they said.
Like the People's Liberation Army in China, which has become a major economic power there, Vietnam's military has quickly seized new opportunities and now owns 300 major state enterprises. But unlike the Chinese military, the Vietnamese military is viewed as largely free of the country's widespread corruption.
"At the moment, the army is one of the more popular institutions in Vietnam because of its relative image of not being corrupt," said Carlyle A. Thayer, who heads the School of Politics at the Australian Defense Force Academy and is an expert on the Vietnamese military.
Vietnam's military now has only half the estimated 1.2 million servicemen that it fielded less than a decade ago. According to one Western diplomat in Hanoi, it now includes an army of about 550,000 soldiers, a navy of 40,000, an air force of 15,000 and a paramilitary force of 15,000.
Even as it has shrunk, its budget has risen every year since 1992, to $890 million last year, and it has been buying foreign aircraft, ships and antiaircraft weapons, Mr. Thayer said.
As the military has grown smaller, it has also sought ways to turn a profit from its assets.
It has turned some of its vast rural and urban holdings into real estate enterprises and converted agricultural land that supported troops into agribusinesses including rubber, tobacco and coffee plantations.
And in some cases, demobilized units have remained essentially intact, with engineering battalions reinventing themselves as engineering companies and signal corps reemerging as electronics communications companies.
"What was formerly a military unit is now a construction company, and the officers of the unit have become directors of the company," said Chuck Searcy, who represents the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation in Hanoi.
In Vietnam's newly vibrant civilian economy, the military seems to be everywhere, managing hotels, a laundry service and a travel agency; mining coal; running a bank; chartering helicopters, and manufacturing electric fans, raincoats, transformers and bicycle parts.
Combined revenues last year in military-run enterprises were $360 million, up 25 percent from the year before, the official Vietnam News Agency said in February.
It reported that the military had entered into 49 joint ventures worth $445 million with foreign companies, mostly in mechanical engineering, construction, and ship and plane repair. Western businessmen here say these joint ventures include contracts with a Japanese candy company and with the South Korean conglomerate Daewoo, which plans to assemble automobiles here.
Thus for the military, as for the country at large, there seems to be no turning back. The difficult questions are how to move ahead into economic and social terrain they know far less well than they did the jungles of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
"I don't think the military is a constituency for going back to old-style Communism," said a Western trade official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "The issues have to do with power and control, and they have to do with rents and profits.
"They paid the price," he said. "Now they are saying, 'We want to make something out of this.' They want to send their kids to good schools, and they want to make money."
Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, 83, the military mastermind behind Vietnam's defeat of both the French and the Americans, supported the political and economic policies of the Congress, telling reporters: "Vietnam must at the same time be bold and cautious. We are Communists; we are pragmatists. We are very optimistic, but at the same time we see difficulties."

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Lifting Curb on Arms Sales to Latin America

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 20

 BODY:
At the urging of Defense Secretary William J. Perry, the Clinton Administration is considering easing a decades-old ban on sales of high-technology weapons like advanced fighter jets to Latin America, raising fears of a new arms race in a region that has been relatively calm after years of military conflict and dictatorship.
Mr. Perry and major weapons makers contend that the blanket restrictions, imposed in the 1970's, are no longer warranted because democracy has spread to every country in the region except Cuba. 
 These advocates maintain that the arms ban is costing the United States jobs by allowing foreign competitors to gain in the Latin American arms market.
But critics of lifting the ban, in the region and in the United States, say feuds between Latin American countries are still too volatile to justify access to state-of-the-art weapons, which they say will only add fuel to smoldering fires, perhaps inflaming minor border disputes into regional wars.
The debate is being closely watched in the region. Many people are asking why, if there is stability in Latin America, the United States should sell highly advanced weapons to countries that neither need them nor can afford them.
Argentina is adamantly opposed to a relaxing of the ban. Argentine officials say they have told the Clinton Administration that they do not want to enter an arms race with Brazil and Chile, particularly when Argentina has drastically scaled back its military spending.
The Argentines also maintain that Chile and Brazil, which have expressed an interest in acquiring advanced fighter planes like the F-16, still do not have full civilian control over their armed forces and thus are ill equipped to regulate the new military technology.
"Putting these weapons in the hands of countries that don't have complete civilian control over their militaries could have major consequences for the region," said Enrique J. de la Torre, a director of international security for Argentina's Foreign Ministry. "We believe the United States should use a stick-and-carrot approach and make these weapons available only as progress is made toward consolidating democracy."
The Clinton Administration began a review of the arms ban -- which was imposed by President Carter in reaction to military abuses of human rights during the 1970's -- at the request of Defense Secretary Perry.
Mr. Perry has said the United States should treat Latin America as it does Africa, Europe and Asia and approve arms sales case by case.
Meanwhile, Congressional leaders and weapons contractors in the United States are strongly lobbying the Administration to end the weapons restrictions.
In a recent letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, several senators said that "thousands of hard-working Americans depend on legitimate overseas defense sales" and that "the Administration should do everything possible to make sure it is American working people who are producing the hardware purchased by our friends in Latin America."
The senators noted that France had sold about 200 fighter aircraft to seven Latin American countries in recent years and that the sale of 200 American-made fighters would represent more than $4 billion in exports and provide 40,000 jobs.
Frank Simpson, vice president for Latin America of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which makes the F-16, said the United States did a disservice to Latin American countries by forcing them to buy from Europe and Asia. "The armed forces in these countries are mismanaging their limited funds by not being able to buy the best and most compatible systems," he said.
While the market for weapons in Latin America is relatively small, about $2 billion in sales last year, industry analysts and executives said they expected sales to increase as countries sought to replace outdated equipment and as new military conflicts arose.
Chile is one country that wants to buy advanced fighters. But Gen. Fernando Rojas, commander of the Chilean Air Force, said that he had stopped meeting with American aircraft manufacturers and that Chile was considering buying fighter planes from countries that had no such restrictions.
"I rather like the North American planes, and I know the sales brochures inside out," General Rojas said in an interview. "But until they get permission from the Government to sell them, I invite the contractors to stop talking about planes and start taking tours in Chile."
In the last decade, as military dictatorships proved to be social and economic disasters in Latin America, most countries have made the transition to relatively stable democracies. The new governments have greatly reduced military spending and liberalized their economies.
Except for Chile, Brazil and Argentina, few countries in Latin America are building up their military resources or have the money to buy the sophisticated weapons at issue. The weapons mentioned most often are F-16 fighter-bombers, advanced helicopters and electronics and radar systems.
Many Latin American experts say the likelihood of military conflict has been greatly reduced by economic integration. They cite a rise in investments between countries and recent trade pacts like Mercosur, which includes South America's largest trading partners: Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.
But critics of the proposed change in United States policy note that the Chilean military is still headed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who led the 1973 coup that toppled the leftist Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens.
Under the Chilean Constitution, which was written by General Pinochet, the civilian Government cannot cut military spending, and the armed forces receive 10 percent of Chile's copper sales, or up to $400 million yearly.
Military analysts said the sale of F-16's would change the air power balance in favor of Chile, which would have technology far superior to Argentina's, unless the Argentines also came up with the money to buy F-16's.
Defense Minister Oscar Camilion of Argentina said in a recent interview that military spending by his country had declined 75 percent in the last 10 years, and that it could not afford to buy new F-16's.
"We think it would premature to sell F-16's in Latin America at this time," he said. "We believe it would be very unstabilizing."
Chile's purchase of the advanced fighter planes would have little impact on Brazil, which is more than 10 times Chile's size.
Although Brazil has said it cannot afford to buy F-16's because of budget cuts, Ivan Frota, a retired top general who often comments on his country's military policy, said Brazil would probably find the money to buy F-16's, but only if they were fully equipped with the latest technology.
Some United States Congressmen who oppose removing the ban said its withdrawal would prompt Latin American countries to plow scarce resources into a costly arms race that would take money away from much-needed social reforms.
But Chile says it needs the F-16's to maintain a level of competence and to defend itself against historic enemies.
There is a persistent distrust in Chile of its three neighbors -- Argentina, Peru and Bolivia -- which all have had major conflicts with Chile. This sentiment is partly promoted by the armed forces in an effort to maintain support for a strong military.
"We are not threatened by our neighbors," General Rojas said. "On the contrary, we have excellent relations with them. But these countries sometimes have goals that are counter to our interest. At any given time it can come to a crisis."
Those opposed to changing United States policy cite several events they say illustrate the fragility of peace in Latin America: last year's border war between Peru and Ecuador, which left 78 soldiers dead and hundreds wounded; a standoff in Chile last year between the Government and the armed forces over the imprisonment of convicted military officers, and an attempted military coup in Paraguay in April.

HEADLINE: ATLANTA: DAY 2;
The South's Struggle to Define Itself

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 20

 BODY:
The images from the opening ceremony Friday of bubbly cheerleaders, chrome pickup trucks or Gladys Knight singing "Georgia on My Mind" were so bright and vibrant, it was possible to think the South's transformation from America's pariah region to sparkling center of its population and economic growth was complete.
But by focusing more international attention on the South than anything that has happened since the civil rights movement, the Olympics in Atlanta are also adding fuel to a furious tug-of-war over the symbols and realities that define the contemporary South. 
 Atlanta won the Games in large part because it sold itself as a model of interracial harmony that had transcended its racially tragic past. But, as controversies over Civil War re-enactments, the Georgia flag and even the Olympic mascot are showing, the Games come at a time when the traditional images that once defined the South are the subject of bitter disputes as never before.
And the Games pose the question about just which image is closer to the real South: the exuberant show of interracial regional harmony and shared Southern culture that 3.5 billion viewers across the world saw Friday night, or the escalating controversies over the Confederate battle flag and antebellum history that increasingly divide white and black Southerners?
Almost since Atlanta unveiled Izzy, its neutered, slug-like mascot to widespread derision four years ago, critics here and throughout the South have worried that Atlanta was likely to sidestep all the tortuous racial issues in the South's past and present by putting on a bland corporate extravaganza devoid of regional identity. Organizers have vehemently denied they would do so, and the evocative regional images from the opening ceremony and the numerous Southern-themed art shows, concerts, museum exhibitions and displays surrounding the Games would seem to support that claim.
"It will be a celebration of the South, but not a celebration of Southern stereotypes," said Andrew Young, co-chairman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and civil rights leader, former Congressman and former Mayor of Atlanta. "The one thing I'm very determined to do is not to sanitize the South, but not to run from it either. What percentage of the South was ever antebellum mansions? We'll be celebrating the people of the South, and I think we'll be redefining the South as well."
To be sure, there is something incongruous about battling over the Civil War and 19th-century images in this Olympics, whose main symbols are the Xerox, Coca-Cola, Swatch and Kodak logos of the international commercial culture.
And the Games, from the biracial team that brought them to Atlanta, to the way Atlanta's business and civic culture is based upon an unusual measure of black and white cooperation, reflects the flawed, but remarkable progress in the South toward Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream, also featured Friday night.
But, as the South has prospered economically and its politics have become increasingly biracial -- black-dominated in cities such as Atlanta -- disputes over Old South imagery, as exemplified by long-running bickering over flying the Confederate battle flag in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina, have become increasingly common.
Groups promoting traditional, largely white, Southern heritage say that Olympic organizers and corporate sponsors have become so skittish about the racial connotations of Southern heritage that they are trying to blot most of it out.
Members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, made up of the descendants of Confederate soldiers, were prevented from marching in a parade in suburban Roswell, Ga., coinciding with the Games. They finally went to court and were allowed to participate but not until the word, antebellum, was removed from the event's name and a sign showing where nearby slave quarters had been was removed. A number of Civil War battle re-enactors were denied permission to take place in various events, and some blacks burned the Georgia flag Friday.
Members of groups like the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is now growing at a faster rate than it has in decades, say they are the victim of a new form of cultural censorship in which the South's old symbols have suddenly become verboten. Many members of such groups these days take pains to decry the Ku Klux Klan and racist groups who use the Confederate battle flag, but they maintain it stands for Southern heritage, not racist hate.
"There's no doubt these are a p.c. Olympics," said David Thrasher, a spokesman for the Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, referring to political correctness. "There's a two-sided agenda at work. One side is to portray Atlanta as a city further advanced in race relations than the rest of the U.S., which we all know is not true.
"A second part is what we consider hate from some African-American groups directed at changing our symbols, masked by political correctness."
He added that, political feelings aside, there is no question that visitors from throughout the world cannot get enough of antebellum Southern culture.
To many blacks, almost any imagery from the Civil War, and particularly anything including the Confederate flag, are bitter reminders of slavery, and they have no place as public symbols. A group seeking to change the Georgia state flag said in a statement this week, "Only the hooded uniform of the Ku Klux Klan and the burning cross do more than the Confederate battle emblem to remind us of the evil side of our Southern heritage."
Dr. Moses Norman, an Atlanta civic leader, who is black, said divisive symbols like the flag have their place in private observances, but need not be part of a public spectacle like the Olympics.
"The question is how do they contribute to what we have evolved to as a multiple, pluralistic culture?" he said. "To the extent symbols add nothing positive but create walls that separate individuals then we say, 'O.K., keep that close to heart, but let's not advance it in such a way as it becomes divisive to what we're really trying to do.' "
John Shelton Reed, author, sociologist and University of North Carolina professor, said the disputes reflect real fault lines in the South.
"There was a consensus developed between white Northerners and Southerners in the decades after the war that basically said, 'We're going to allow Confederates their honor and respect in exchange for them agreeing to respect and preserve the Union.' The trouble is blacks were not consulted, and now that consensus is coming apart."
Reed, a fan of an earthier view of the South than that usually associated with the go-go booster world of Atlanta, said he had mixed feelings about the Hollywood-style portrayal of the South in the opening ceremony. But he said they did acknowledge Southern culture in a way he feared the Games might not.
"Especially after Izzy, I thought it would be all Greece and sports and nothing Southern about it, so I shouldn't complain," said Reed, who with his wife, Dale Reed, is the author of the recently published "1,001 Things Everyone Should Know About the South" (Doubleday, 1996). "New Orleans would have had more fun, Charleston would have had more class and Nashville would have had better music, but it wasn't bad for Atlanta."

HEADLINE: A Man's $11 Million Gift to a College Marks a Rare Friendship

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
As Harvey Wexler lay dying from cancer last year, some of his friends were concerned that he might not have enough money to pay his medical bills.
But last month, after Mr. Wexler's estate was settled, Bryn Mawr College received more than $11 million, its largest gift ever, from the unassuming man who lived in a modest one-bedroom apartment in northwest Washington, D.C. 
 "It's a very big gift for a private college," said Donna L. Wiley, director of resources and secretary of Bryn Mawr, a women's school near Philadelphia.
Mr. Wexler's fascination with Bryn Mawr sprang from his 30-year friendship with Joan Coward, a government economist who graduated in 1945. Miss Wiley called it one of the most romantic gifts she had ever seen. "Clearly, he adored her," she said.
Neither Mr. Wexler, who was 67 when he died, nor Ms. Coward ever married.
He was a deeply private man; not only did his best friends not know of his wealth, but some of them did not know of his relationship with Ms. Coward, either. But a picture of his life and his decision to make the gift emerge from letters that he wrote and from interviews with friends and business acquaintances.
Mr. Wexler met Ms. Coward in Washington in 1960, when both their careers focused on the airline industry. He worked for the Air Transport Association of America, a trade association, and later became a senior vice president and lobbyist for Continental Airlines. She was an economic analyst for the Civil Aeronautics Board. She moved to an apartment in his building, and they spent much time together. She told friends that she was not the marrying kind, drawing parallels between her idol, Katharine Hepburn, who was a Bryn Mawr graduate, and herself.
Although not an active Bryn Mawr alumna, Ms. Coward treasured her education there. Mr. Wexler recalled in a letter to Ms. Coward's sister, Nancy Urban, that on their first date in 1960, Ms. Coward had told him how they had used original documents rather than textbooks at the college. "I even tested her on one matter and she knew more than I," he wrote.
Ms. Coward grew up in Bryn Mawr and attended a local private school. After graduating from Bryn Mawr, she worked for Eastern Airlines as an economic analyst before moving to Washington in the mid-1950's.
After Ms. Coward died of cancer in 1990 at the age of 67, Mr. Wexler wanted to create a memorial, perhaps a scholarship fund. The more he talked with Bryn Mawr officials, the more enamored he became with the college, college officials said, and the bigger the gift grew.
He also struck up a running conversation with a Bryn Mawr economics professor, Richard Du Boff, who will hold the first chair in economic history. It will be named after Mr. Wexler's parents.
Another chair will be endowed in Ms. Coward's name for political economy, and two more chairs in Mr. Wexler's name for professors in economics, history, philosophy or political science.
Mr. Wexler's views on money, education and philanthropy owed much to the influence of his father, Samuel. In a letter to friends shortly before his death, Mr. Wexler recalled how, as a 5-year-old during the bank panic of 1933, he watched tellers at a bank that his father owned give depositors their money when other banks remained closed. The next day, people lined up to deposit more money.
Mr. Wexler made steady investments in blue chip stocks. But otherwise, his friends say that they have few clues to how he accumulated the money he left to Bryn Mawr.

HEADLINE: Strawberry Warning Costs Growers Millions

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 20

 BODY:
California strawberry growers are still trying to recover from a wave of negative publicity and more than $20 million in losses that began when health officials in Texas blamed the fruit last month for outbreaks of intestinal illness.
Federal health officials said this week that contaminated raspberries from Guatemala were the likely source of the cyclospora microbe that has sickened about 1,000 people in 13 states, the District of Columbia and Canada since early May. 
 Earlier investigations had suggested that strawberries, either domestic or imported, might be the source of the outbreak. Although Federal health officials never confirmed strawberries as the source, the Texas Department of Health issued an advisory on June 8 against eating fresh strawberries after 26 Houston residents became sick. Other health departments issued advisories urging consumers to wash the fruit thoroughly.
Because California produces 80 percent of the nation's strawberries, growers in that state were hurt the most by the Texas warning, which was lifted on June 23. Since the advisory was issued, California growers, who last year had sales of $608 million, have lost more than $20 million, according to the California Strawberry Commission.
"The Texas advisory hurt us a lot," Teresa Thorne, a spokeswoman for the group, said, adding that widespread coverage in the news media exacerbated the effect. "In a single day, consumer confidence was taken away, and we're still having a problem with it despite being given a clean bill of health."
Most troubling to California health officials and those within the produce industry is that Texas officials issued the advisory without testing strawberries from California or other locations. They instead based the advisory on interviews with people who had contracted the illness.
"We're very concerned about the public's health, but we feel Texas officials made accusations without backup information," said Sandra R. Smoley, California's Secretary of Health and Welfare.
But Doug McBride, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Health, said that his department was only watching out for the public's health and safety. "Had we not taken the action we did," he said, "it's conceivable that we could be answering another question from the public right now: 'Why didn't you tell us?' "
Strawberry shipments were down 15 percent nationwide last month compared with June of last year, when more than 1.4 billion pint baskets were sold. With four more months left in the strawberry harvesting season, Ms. Thorne said, "I expect total losses in the tens of millions of dollars."
In the New York area, the largest United States market for California strawberries, sales have dropped as much as 90 percent, said Alvin Nathel of Wishnatzki & Nathel, a New York produce company.
"A flat of strawberries is selling in the New York market for $3 to $4," he said. "That barely covers the cost of growing and shipping."
Cyclospora, a parasite that attaches itself to the small intestine, causes diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, weight loss, fever and fatigue. Identifying the source of the outbreak has been difficult, particularly because it takes a week or more for a person to become sick and even more time before cases are reported.

HEADLINE: Harriett Heywood Patton, 85, Founder of Recording for Blind

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Harriett Heywood Patton, a founder of Recording for the Blind and a managing director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, died on Wednesday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. She was 85 and lived in Bronxville.
She suffered a brief illness, her husband, Arch Patton, said. 
 Mrs. Patton is credited with contributing significantly to the growth of Recording for the Blind, which she served as president in 1954, and of the Opera Guild. She was managing director of the guild from 1959 to 1968.
She was born in Indianapolis and graduated from Wheelock College in Boston. During and after World War II, she worked for United China Relief and the Friends of France and played a pivotal role on the Committee for Economic Development, a national organization.
The committee brought together top corporate executives to plan for the postwar era; Mrs. Patton was recruited as deputy director.
Acting as a welcoming party of one, she kept track of the members' comings and goings and saw to it that they were fed, chauffeured and otherwise cared for.
In 1948, she was a founder of Recording for the Blind, and she helped build it from a local group in New York for the benefit of blind war veterans into a national organization. She crusaded across the country to get concerned people to band together in local chapters and open recording studios for volunteers to do the readings.
Eleanor R. Belmont, founder of the Opera Guild and a friend, persuaded Mrs. Patton to turn her attention in that direction and become managing director. During her tenure of nearly 10 years, the guild's membership and donations quickly increased, both in the United States and abroad.
Mrs. Patton, who had served as a director, was familiar with the operation and earned a reputation for running a trim ship. Annual gifts to the guild, $90,000 in Mrs. Patton's first year as chief executive, rose nearly fourfold, to $355,000.
She grew up in Portland, Me., and acted in summer stock for three years as a young woman.
Besides her husband, Mrs. Patton left no immediate family. An earlier marriage to Roswell L. Gilpatric ended in divorce.

HEADLINE: Bosnia Gears Up for Election, With 25,000 Candidates

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 20

 BODY:
Sejfudin Tokic, 35, a former pharmacist, went today from a seminar on running a political campaign to a meeting in the suburbs with campaign workers, then back to his office, with its broken windows and stained carpets, for another meeting.
It was opening day of the campaign for the Bosnian elections scheduled for Sept. 14, a campaign almost scuttled by a quarrel among outside powers over whether the field was ready, and then delayed by a scrimmage to wrest the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic from office, something accomplished only Friday. 
 No one would suggest that the Bosnian elections, a crucial element of the Dayton peace accord, are going to be a paradigm of democracy. The phones often do not even work, noted Mr. Tokic, leader of the Union of Bosnian Social Democrats, so how can he coordinate with party officials in other cities?
People question how democratic an election can be when citizens are not free to return to their homes and vote, and the media are controlled by different governing entities in various parts of this fractured country.
"But we have to have elections, to make a step toward pluralization and democracy," said Mr. Tokic, who wants to move away from ethnic-based politics.
If participation is the standard, this is an incipient Athenian democracy. So far, 25,000 people have registered -- to be candidates.
Voters will be electing a three-member national presidency of one Bosnian Muslim, one Bosnian Croat and one Bosnian Serb.
They will also vote for a 42-member House of Representatives, with 14 members coming from the Bosnian Serbs and 28 from the Muslim-Croat Federation.
The House members will choose 15 delegates -- 5 from each ethnic group -- to a House of People.
In addition, the Bosnian Serbs and the Federation will each choose an own assembly, and local councils will be elected throughout the country.
This will be no two-party election. Indeed, 47 parties have qualified -- some of them run by warlords -- including the Green Party, the Pure Party of Rights and the Party of Economic Prosperity.
The lurking issue is whether the elections will be another step toward the partition of Bosnia -- with Serbs and Croats joining their respective neighbor countries -- or a tentative step toward a unified democracy.
In trying to gauge the future, foreign and Bosnian analysts are looking at the municipal elections last month in Mostar, a Bosnian city divided between Croats and Muslims. Voter turnout was high, and for the first time in three years people crossed the confrontation line in large numbers.
"The election served as a great pretext for interaction," and showed that people can "interact peacefully, indeed warmly," says a report by the Sarajevo office of the International Crisis Group, a Washington-based research organization.
But the people voted along ethnic lines. A moderate multi-ethnic coalition of Muslims, Croats and Serbs, led by a popular former Mayor, received only 1,900 votes out of 58,000 cast. Given the anger and fear, so raw after years of war and propaganda, a similar outcome is possible on the national level.
Some Bosnian Serbs are already taking advantage of the election rules to move toward splitting from Bosnia.
In pursuit of the ideal of a multi-ethnic state, the Dayton peace agreement provides that people are to vote where they lived in 1991, before the war and the "ethnic cleansing." But refugees can apply for permission to vote where they are now living.
At least half of the potential voters are refugees, having been forced from their homes by the war.
In the Republika Srpska, to date an astonishing 125,000 Bosnian Serb refugees have applied to change their voting residence, according to statistics from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is supervising the election.
This decision has not exactly been voluntary, officials say. The Bosnian Serb authorities have been forcing refugees to register to change their voting residence to be eligible for international relief assistance, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said here on Friday, calling the situation "scandalous."
Even though there are several hundred thousand Muslim refugees in the Federation territory, only 7,000 have asked to change their voting residence.
As for what the people will be voting for, "it's complex," Mr. Tokic, the former pharmacist, said with a laugh.
The contests most closely watched will be for the national presidency and Parliament, and in the Republika Srpska. There, the opposition to the governing Serb Democratic Party, which Dr. Karadzic headed until he resigned on Friday, is based in the northern city of Banja Luka.
The opposition, which has split into two coalitions, is usually described as "moderate," compared with Dr. Karadzic and his colleagues.
The party regarded as having the best chance to make some inroads on Dr. Karadzic's party is the Socialist Party of the Republika Srpska, a branch of the Socialist Party in neighboring Serbia, which is run by the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic.
In the Muslim-Croat Federation, the strongest challenge to the governing Party of Democratic Action, a Muslim-led party headed by Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, will be from Haris Silajdzic.
Mr. Silajdzic, 50, a former history professor, resigned as Prime Minister earlier this year and is generally viewed as more inclined toward a democratic, nonsectarian state than the Democratic Action Party wants.
Public opinion polls show Mr. Silajdzic as the country's most popular politician. If Mr. Silajdzic and Mr. Izetbegovic split the Muslim vote, Momcilo Krajisnik, a nationalistic Serbian hard-liner who has replaced Dr. Karadzic as a candidate, could emerge as the top vote-getter and thus be the first president of the three-member presidency.
Against all of these parties is Mr. Tokic's United List coalition, which has in its leadership a former Bosnian Serb commander and a former commander of the Muslim-led Bosnian Army.
At the seminar, as the party leaders worked on their campaign themes, one that emerged was "togetherness and unity."
Mr. Tokic said his coalition would be pleased with 10 percent of the vote.

GOSPEL CHOIRS
Psalms of Survival for an Alien Land Called Home.
By Derrick Bell.
228 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $23.
This is the third of Derrick Bell's Geneva Crenshaw series. Like "And We Are Not Saved" and "Faces at the Bottom of the Well," "Gospel Choirs" is a collection of parables, dreams and dialogues about the present and the possible futures of race relations in America, gently threaded together by the author's own voice -- that of a black law professor and activist -- and that of his fictional friend and muse, Geneva Crenshaw. 
 Geneva is a civil rights lawyer who was injured, perhaps killed, in a car wreck after facing down some good ol' boys who were chasing her on a Mississippi road in the 1960's. Whether she died or not, she certainly has supernatural powers and -- what is even better -- preternatural insight. In the earlier books she was a source of inspiration and occasional reproach for the professor in his meditations on the prospects and politics of the African-American community. In "Gospel Choirs" she is more than that. Her presence and that of another character, Gwynn Gant, a lesbian attorney, are a reminder that African-Americans as much as anyone have to come to terms with issues of sexuality and sexism.
The book's distinctive stand on these issues emerges in a dialogue with another familiar character -- the professor's limousine driver, Jesse B. Semple. Jesse is inclined to wonder whether even the good Lord Himself could change the nature of men in their relations with women. "It's not a question of nature," the professor replies. "It's one of mind, of will." Jesse reads to the professor from a James Baldwin book that he often dips into while waiting for his passengers: black sexism, he says, is an understandable response to the hostility and humiliation that young men face every time they go out their door. The professor acknowledges the point, but insists again that political will must overcome even the most "natural" tendencies: "I'm not talking about blame, Jesse. I'm talking about . . . the best chance to survive our future dealings with white America." Black women have proved time and again that they have the strength and resolve to stand up for themselves and their people. African-Americans, Mr. Bell argues, must build on that as a source of strength, and proceed on a basis of equal respect.
Mr. Bell's position on sexism needs to be understood in the context of a broader argument about American race relations. The subtitle of "Faces at the Bottom of the Well" was "The Permanence of Racism," and the thesis is that the goal of racial equality -- the "dream" of Dr. King, the mythical color-blind society -- will not be achieved in the United States in the foreseeable future. If anything, Mr. Bell expects matters to get much worse. "Gospel Choirs" is prefaced by a grim review of the cynical policies of corporate America, whose effects are insecurity and rising unemployment in all communities, and a particular burden of poverty and misery for blacks compounded by "the rage of many whites who, fearful for their own jobs and future well-being, are all too easily convinced that the threat to both is our black presence rather than the real villain -- corporate greed." Since submission or surrender to racism, however it is caused, is not an option, the prime strategy must be the strengthening of black community to be "better able to fend off the myriad manifestations of hostility we will most certainly face during the transformation and possible destruction of our economy."
At the same time, the permanence of racism does not mean an end to the fight against discrimination and inequality: on the contrary, it means clear and dignified struggle against these things on the simple ground that they are wrong and unjust, a struggle that will not be muddied by the compromises that might be necessary or appropriate if victory were actually at hand. We no longer have any illusions, Mr. Bell seems to be saying, but still -- if the cause is lost and we are crushed, it must not be through our choices.
Besides the issue of sexism, what distinguishes "Gospel Choirs" from its predecessors is the presence of a soundtrack. Each chapter is prefaced by lines from gospel songs: "We've come this far by faith," "I'm comin' up -- on the rough side -- of the mountain," "Nobody told me the road would be easy." The music is woven into the text as well, sometimes quoted or sung by the characters, sometimes discussed as a topic in its own right -- how black churches had to find their way back to gospel music from forms of worship "a la Mozart" that had been thought more polite and acceptable in a white world. The author regards gospel as a well-spring of faith and cheer, and his use of gospel is one of the most attractive features of the work.
Derrick Bell was dismissed from Harvard Law School after he prolonged a leave of absence to protest the school's failure to hire minority women. He is currently a visiting professor at New York University Law School. Some of his academic colleagues will sneer at the style of this book. It is not a social-science study of American racism nor is it a jurisprudential treatise. In fact, it's not really a book about law at all: the Supreme Court hardly appears in Mr. Bell's stories, and then as a rather sad and impotent institution.
Many chapters are presented in dialogue form, which I guess has something in common with the Socratic method used in law schools, except that it is more conversational and respectful of the participants' perspectives. Certainly it's a more interesting back-and-forth than Plato's dialogues, where the interlocutor usually contributes something like "You're perfectly right, Socrates." Other chapters use fantasy, pastiche and dreams, even science fiction. These are not always successful: I wish, for example, that the professor's interview with the talk-show host Biff Rightwing had gone through a few more drafts. But when they do work they are magical: the power of the allegory "Equality's Child," toward the end of the book, approaches that of the Grand Inquisitor story in "The Brothers Karamazov."
I suppose there would be a problem if everyone wrote about race in the Derrick Bell style. We need analysis and we need social science as much as dream, dialogue and narrative. But we would certainly be the poorer if no one wrote like this; for even to be disconcerted by Mr. Bell's technique is to open oneself to the challenge of his thesis and the soaring power of the music that sustains it.

A RIVER LOST
The Life and Death of the Columbia.
By Blaine Harden.
Illustrated. 271 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25.
The Columbia River was once famous as the farthest reach of the Western frontier, a primordial salmon-choked torrent that had taken Lewis and Clark for a wild ride on the final leg of their cross-country journey. More recently, from the depths of the Great Depression to victory in World War II and the economic triumph that followed, the Columbia became a shining symbol of national power and virtue. In a providential feat of luck and good timing, the New Deal-financed Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams came on line just before the United States entered the war, delivering millions of kilowatts to the aluminum smelters, airplane factories and shipyards of the Pacific Northwest, as well as electricity to the Manhattan Project's secret plutonium factory along the banks of the Columbia at Hanford, Wash. After the war, the dams on the river made it possible for farmers to irrigate vast tracts of desert land and allowed the region to use twice as much electricity per capita as the rest of the country, at rates that were half the national average. The river even inspired a Northwest anthem of sorts in Woody Guthrie's "Roll On, Columbia." "Your power is turning our darkness to dawn," the 1941 song, which was commissioned by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, went. "So roll on, Columbia, roll on." 
 These days, however, things seem to have gone terribly wrong. The heroic era of dam building is over; the time when monumental concrete bulwarks and colossal turbines filled every Westerner with patriotic pride is past. The system of dams along the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake, produces more than a billion dollars of hydroelectric power a year, but the dams have transformed most of the great river into a series of sluggish slack-water lakes, suitable for barge traffic and windsurfers but not much else. The irrigation subsidies that the Federal Columbia Basin Irrigation Project provides to farmers turn out to have been spectacularly uneconomical, and taxpayers are footing the bill. The river is becoming more polluted every year. And now it seems that while Americans were celebrating the harnessing of the Columbia, they failed to notice that the treaty rights of the Indians who had lived along its banks for thousands of years were being trampled on, and that the dams were hastening the wild salmon of the Northwest toward extinction.
All this sounds like one more example of the kind of bleak story that the revisionist historians of the West have been offering lately -- another tale of disaster, exploitation and environmental depredation. Alternately, this situation could provide the occasion for a grieving, elegiac book by one of the neo-environmentalists who have contributed to the lyrical nature-writing boom of recent years. Sometimes, however, nothing serves like an industrious journalist, and Blaine Harden, who covered Africa and the Balkan war for The Washington Post, has written a hard-nosed, clear-eyed, tough-minded dispatch on the sort of contentious subject that is almost always distorted by ideology or obscured by a fog of sentiment. The result is a scathing indictment of technocratic hubris, and of those who play what Mr. Harden calls "the river game" for shortsighted economic gain.
"A River Lost" would be less heart-rending if its author's stake in the story were not personal. Mr. Harden's father helped build the Grand Coulee Dam, and he raised his family in a central Washington farming town that owed its existence and its prosperity to Columbia River irrigation. After college, Mr. Harden lived on the East Coast and abroad for nearly two decades; when he returned to the Columbia basin in 1993, he found that the peaceful home he remembered from his youth was now "a natural-resource war zone." Moreover, most people no longer worked in agriculture or similar industries; the majority of the population lived in the cities and suburbs west of the Cascades, where Microsoft and other high-tech companies were thriving. The affluent residents of the wet, arboreal West Side were willing to make moderate sacrifices to save the salmon and otherwise preserve "the giant civic park that the Pacific Northwest had become." They tended to view the pro-irrigation, pro-slack-water residents of the dry East Side as troglodytes and ecological criminals. Without letting the plugged-in, high-consuming West Siders off the hook, Mr. Harden ends up agreeing with them.
But he lets the facts, and his former neighbors along the Columbia River, speak for themselves. As a good reporter should, Mr. Harden takes a close look at the thing itself: he begins with an account of the days he spent descending the Snake and the Columbia on tugboats shepherding gigantic barges that carry everything from grain and computer chips to milk cartons and decommissioned nuclear submarine reactors. The tugboat crews and the barge companies believe, with some justice, that their livelihood is jeopardized by proposals to "draw down" the river -- that is, to lower its level and spill its flow over the dams, in order to assist the juvenile salmon that must now traverse warm, slow-moving pools and brave the often deadly turbines. The drawdown would also halt barge traffic for several months each year. The pilots and deckhands tell Mr. Harden, in no uncertain terms, what they think of salmon and Indians and yuppies in Seattle and Portland who are threatening their way of life.
Mr. Harden is equally adept at eliciting the rationalizations of other East Side denizens whom history has turned into presumptive villains: retired dam builders, heavily subsidized farmers, nuclear engineers and utility company lobbyists. Along the way, he encounters a shocking incidence of casual racism directed against Indians; he repeatedly hears the preposterous allegation that Indians themselves, through overfishing, are responsible for the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. In rebuttal, Mr. Harden presents the dismal record of fraud and callousness by the Federal Government, and makes it clear that a vast environmental and cultural tragedy could have been prevented if earlier generations had paid heed to the wisdom of the Indians' veneration of the salmon.
"A River Lost" is a far from perfect book. The prose is not always elegant; some of the material has already been effectively reported in other recent books; and some parts of the story, like the increasing role of Hispanic farm workers and other immigrants in the Columbia basin, are virtually ignored. But this is a precise and brave book. It must not have been easy for Blaine Harden to find himself turning his journalistic weapons against his own heritage, but he has done the conscience of his homeland a large service.

The New Jobs: A Growing Number Are Good Ones

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS

 BODY:
LAST fall, Kevin J. Mattakat was studying telecommunications and computer science at the University of Wisconsin. In his spare time, he tended bar and did computer work for the college. He earned about $5,700 in 1995.
Today, at 30, he is making more than $45,000 a year at a subsidiary here of U S West, the regional telephone company, fixing the bugs that inevitably haunt complex computer networks. 
 "I wasn't even in the market when I got this offer," Mr. Mattakat said, stroking his sparse beard and explaining that he was still a year short of a degree. "This was a job I couldn't pass up."
After years of corporate downsizings, many Americans have a virulent case of the economic willies. But the economy has another, more positive side. It is a story told by the millions of Americans who in the last five years have found new jobs that more than replace the lost ones, in industries as new as the Internet and as old as retailing.
Lately, the plot line has improved: In 1995, the percentage of new jobs that pay above-average salaries was double what it was in 1992, when the nation was just starting to recover from recession.
"The quality of jobs being created is steadily increasing," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
In an analysis for The New York Times using Government data, Mr. Zandi found that 45 percent of the jobs created across the country last year paid more than the national average wage of $29,420. In 1992, that proportion was just 22 percent. Of the new jobs created last year, fully one-quarter paid more than 30 percent above the average. In 1992, only 4 percent of the new jobs paid that well.
These jumps are encouraging, considering that many new jobs are for young people just entering the work force, and they typically earn less than experienced workers.
These statistics indicate that the economy is churning out better jobs than many Americans might think. As Mr. Mattakat and many other residents of the Minneapolis area demonstrate, many people are now getting "good" jobs -- way beyond the proverbial burger-flipping posts. And, writ large, what is happening here reflects the national picture.
"Minneapolis has a highly diverse economy that mirrors the national business mix quite well," Mr. Zandi said.
Mr. Zandi said there were no equivalent figures for past economic upturns, so it is not possible to compare the 1990's with other periods. But he said the rise in better-paying jobs appeared to be occurring at a somewhat faster pace this time.
"It has a lot to do with the sources of the new jobs," Mr. Zandi said. More than in past recoveries, he said, "we're seeing a lot of job growth in sectors and occupations that are high-paying." Among them are high technology, entertainment and construction.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, in a June report, agreed. It found that the greatest share of job growth from 1989 to 1995 took place at the high and the low ends of the pay scale, with the greatest gains in high-paying occupations.
The coming months, barring an unforeseen recession, hold even more promise. "We're now in the second phase of expansion," said David A. Wyss, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill Inc., an economic forecasting firm. "You will see a general improvement in job quality, and people trading up on jobs." Typically, as an economic expansion matures, the employee pool tightens and companies have to pay a little more to attract and retain workers.
For all this demand, though, many Americans can still only dream of a better job. They simply do not have the education or the skills to qualify for good jobs. Some are chronically impoverished, while others are white- and blue-collar workers who lost high-paying jobs in corporate downsizings even as new positions have been created elsewhere. They have been unable to find employment with pay and benefits comparable to those of their previous jobs.
Now there may be a new hitch.
The labor market is tighter than it has been in at least six years. Since the United States pulled out of a recession in March 1991, employment rolls have climbed by 11.2 million jobs, a strong 10 percent increase, and unemployment is just 5.3 percent, down from a peak of 7.7 percent in June 1992. With companies competing for employees, some economists are fretting that wages, which are just beginning to outpace inflation after lagging behind it for years, may rise enough to cause a resurgence of inflation. Worse, they fear that many companies will not be able to find enough qualified employees to meet all their expansion needs in the years ahead.
"The labor market is the primary constraint on growth right now," Mr. Wyss said. "Companies just don't have the employees to grow. I expect the labor market to stay this tight for the next four years or so." New jobs, then, could well pay better but be fewer in number.
Geographically, a few areas of the country are still dragging. Most notably, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Maryland are not adding jobs as fast as the rest of the country. The New York metropolitan area is one of the few places that has failed to replace the jobs lost in the most recent recession.
By and large, however, the job machine is working overtime. Many brand-name corporate giants, no longer slashing staff by the bucket, have joined small and medium-sized companies in actual net hiring -- sometimes in large numbers, although usually in small doses.
To fill the slots, companies are going way beyond want ads, employment agencies and executive search firms. Some are holding job fairs, listing on the Internet and using temporary-employment agencies to fill low-end jobs. Increasingly, they are counting on word of mouth -- even offering cash and prizes to employees who recruit qualified people.
Many companies are luring new hires from other parts of the country. Some are putting high-school graduates into positions that once required college degrees and dropping experience demands. Others are making temporary workers permanent.
Here in Minneapolis, hiring efforts are sucking in people who would not have dreamed of new posts a few years ago.
"I didn't feel I'd be a hot commodity," said Timothy R. Schmidt, 44, a software developer who felt stuck at his old company, Cray Research, a maker of expensive supercomputers that has downsized. "My experience has been eclipsed by new technologies."
But on one recent Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Schmidt received a job tip from a friend. By Thursday, he had an offer for a job with better pay and more opportunity from Platinum Technologies' fast-growing Viatech Laboratories unit, a computer software company based in Eagan, a southern suburb near the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.
Age was no barrier to Michael Mackany, either: At 57, he changed industries. After nearly 30 years in the sales and marketing of medical products, he is peddling the financial services of American Express Financial Advisors from Eden Prairie, a suburb 15 miles southwest of downtown.
American Express, which did not care about his relative financial naivete, expects him to make $75,000 his first year and more later.
"He had drive," said John Greiber, the vice president for recruiting, who expects to add 40 new financial planners this year. "We teach them how to be advisers."
Mr. Mackany heard about the opening from a friend. "My feeling," he said, "is that if you want a job here, you can find one."
Yet "Boomtown U.S.A. in 1996 is not Minneapolis," said Ken Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, a business research group in New York. "That would be Boise, or Salt Lake City or Las Vegas," where high technology, services and gambling businesses are bubbling over in the number of available new jobs.
In a crucial sense, Mr. Zandi said, Minneapolis is a template hinting at the nation's future. As the economy moves further away from jobs in heavy manufacturing and toward service and knowledge industries, Minneapolis is one step ahead.
That bodes well for the country, because the 13-county area ended 1995 with 2.9 percent more jobs than it had a year earlier -- slightly ahead of the national job growth rate of 2.7 percent. And 55 percent of the jobs created in the Minneapolis area in 1995 paid more than the area's average wage of $31,210, compared with 29 percent in 1992.
Set in rich farmland studded with glacial lakes, Minneapolis-St. Paul may be best known for ferocious winters. But the area has also contributed Scotch tape, Betty Crocker, the Mall of America, Roller Blades and a host of other business phenomena to the commonweal.
Its population, now 2.7 million, is growing by 1.3 percent a year. On the plus side of its economic ledger, it has a diversified economic base, an educated work force and a position as a financial, transportation and distribution hub for the upper Midwest. On the minus side, it saddles businesses with high taxes, labor rates and energy costs.
The Twin Cities area has seen its share of downsizings by the likes of Ceridian and Honeywell. Even Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, hallowed for its innovative culture, has cut staff.
But in the sparkling downtowns of Minneapolis and St. Paul and in the affluent suburban centers of Edina, Bloomington and the like, unemployment is low. Since 1994, the jobless rate has hovered around 3 percent. Minority groups make up less than 10 percent of the population here, versus nearly a quarter of the national populace, and many of the area's blacks, native Americans and other ethnic groups are partaking of the bounty, too, some people said.
"Minority folks with fairly good skills would be in demand for well-paying jobs," said Warren McLean, executive director of the Metropolitan Economic Development Association, a business-supported group that provides managerial assistance to minority-owned companies.
They are actively sought out by some companies. "Until two months ago, I had an all-white, all-male work force," complained David D. Wickhem, a manager at Mr. Mattakat's employer, Interprise Networking Services. Constantly in need of about 20 people who can earn anywhere from $40,000 to $85,000 in salary, plus a bonus, Mr. Wickhem has taken to attending meetings of black and Hispanic engineering groups. He recently hired a woman and a black man.
Technology skills may be most in demand at the moment. But good jobs are plentiful, too, in business services, health care, financial services and construction companies. On Sundays, in the hefty help-wanted section of The Minneapolis Star Tribune, job seekers can find everything from four-line ads for plumbers, at starting salaries of $16 to $20 an hour, to display ads starring the Pillsbury doughboy in an appeal for entry-level production workers at salaries of $18,285 to $28,270 a year.
Sometimes jobs even find workers. Kraig N. Hollingsworth, unemployed but equipped with a new certificate in accounting from a vocational school, was walking down Nicollet Mall downtown in March when opportunity stopped him in his tracks. Bruegger's Bagels had a "help wanted" sign in its window.
Mr. Hollingsworth, feeling not quite ready for the white-collar world, had worked in a bakery before. So when Bruegger's offered him a position as a morning baker, "I snapped it up," he said. "I said I was looking to get into accounting down the road, and my supervisor said that's a possibility."
Probably a good one. Mr. Hollingsworth, who is 30, has already had a 25-cent raise, to $7.50 an hour, and he is learning to run the registers and make bank deposits. By this time next year, he hopes to ease into an accounting job, where the salaries range from $20,000 to $30,000 and more. He would also get health benefits, for which hourly employees must pay extra.
No such job is open now, but in the last year Bruegger's local accounting department has grown from one part-time to three full-time positions. It will undoubtedly increase, given Bruegger's plans to open five stores, with 300 new jobs, in the area by year-end, plus many more by 1998. In the meantime, Mr. Hollingsworth is happy making "a livable wage," he said.
"I'm not scrambling," he added, "and it's a pleasant working environment."
Sarita Wood, also 30, found a job with even more ease. A software developer with a degree in computer science and mathematics, she started looking because her old employer, Cray Research, was shrinking. "It was emotionally tough" to watch, she said. "You learn to keep your options open."
After she went to a Platinum job fair, Viatech offered her a post. She said no.
"I told them what I was interested in, and they came back and made me an offer," she said. "It feels wonderful that they've created a job for me."
Ms. Wood, single with "a dog, a cat and a mortgage," said she took the job because of "its growth opportunities." But her new salary, which exceeds $50,000, also came with an 8 percent raise.
"My mother and father would be surprised that I am making this much money," she mused. Her father, she added, would "probably ask, 'what are you spending all that on?' "
To Viatech, Ms. Wood is well worth her salary -- and benefits. It is one of many small companies that now match health and pension benefits of big rivals.
It has to. Since March 1995, Viatech has gone from 6 employees to 27. The total would be higher if Richard Westgard, the development manager, could find more qualified people.
"A college grad with a year's experience gets $35,000," he said. "We'd pay $80,000 for, say, an ex-I.B.M. or Oracle developer with several years of solid experience, a bulletproof background with no gaps."
But such highly credentialed people are not the only ones who are getting good jobs, especially if they know technology. Jeffrey S. Pelkey, a 39-year-old former truck driver, has a new job as Viatech's systems administrator, thanks to two collisions.
The first took place in the early 1980's. Laid up after an accident, Mr. Pelkey was urged by his supervisor to learn more about computers so he could work at home and not need workers' compensation. By reading and taking courses at the Control Data Institute, Mr. Pelkey turned himself into a systems administrator.
The second clash occurred recently, when he and a boss at his old job at a hospital "didn't hit it off," Mr. Pelkey said. There, he was earning $36,000. But, with a family that includes three teen-aged children eyeing college, he started looking for a new job in January. He set his sights on a salary in the high $40,000's to low $50,000's.
"With my skills and experience, that wasn't hard at all," Mr. Pelkey said. He turned down one offer in San Antonio, in favor of Viatech, where he is making $51,000. One month into it, Mr. Pelkey was enamored of his new employer.
"There's variety -- you never know what you're going to do," he said. "The hospital was very political and everyone walked on eggshells. Here you see people walking around barefoot."
"I feel fortunate that I'm in demand," he added. "I crashed into this, or it crashed into me."
 
A Foot in the Door Leads Up the Ladder
Knowledge of another kind -- a love of books, really -- got Cindi Dean her new job, and made her a job creator.
Ms. Dean, who is 32, was recently named the manager of a brand-new Barnes & Noble bookstore just north of Minneapolis. She came from a nearby branch, where she had been assistant manager and then store manager. Her new store occupies a big chunk of the Northcourt Commons strip mall.
On this sunny Saturday morning, Ms. Dean is at a cash register, solving the problem of a young man in jeans and Reeboks. She could probably be in her office, back behind the biographies, the cookbooks, the novels. But making sure customers are satisfied is part of what makes the job a good one economically, because a portion of her pay is based on store volume.
Ms. Dean will not disclose her salary, but industry experts suggest it would be at least $40,000 and may well range into the $50,000's and perhaps beyond. To maximize it, she wants to make sure all the kinks have been worked out in the systems and with the 42 people she hired.
They are a mixed bunch: half full time, half part time. They come from all races, many directly out of high school and others with college degrees. Barnes & Noble will not say how much the pay is, except that it exceeds the minimum wage. Those who work more than 30 hours a week, on average, are entitled to health, pension and vacation benefits. "We've found we need to have good benefits to be competitive in today's job marketplace," said Michael J. Hejny, Barnes & Noble's Midwest director.
Hiring was not hard. "You have to find the right people," Ms. Dean said, "but there are always people who want to work in bookstores."
Part of the draw, according to Mr. Hejny, is that "two-thirds of the jobs in our company are entry-level, and people go on to other things. We're growing so fast that there are lots of opportunities. Booksellers become supervisory staff, who become assistant managers and then store managers."
Since Barnes & Noble moved into the Minneapolis market in 1990, it has opened 11 superstores, with 300 to 500 new jobs. "We'll probably open a few more in the next few years," Mr. Hejny added.
The new jobs are even more plentiful and varied across town, at the United Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest health insurer. In the lobby of its office in Edina, seven miles southwest of downtown, sits a 3.5 inch-thick loose-leaf binder of opportunities: customer service representatives, secretaries and nurses as well as the ubiquitous software developers. Starting salaries range from $10,350 to $65,350.
Management jobs pay much higher. Last year, Tom L. Anderson got one of them, recruited by a search firm to become United Healthcare's vice president for Medicare programs. His salary, industry experts said, is at least $250,000 plus a bonus and stock options.
Technically, Mr. Anderson's job is not new. Someone else had the title before. But "the company wasn't committed to it, and the Medicare product went nowhere," Mr. Anderson said. Now the company, which is also a big provider of managed care, wants growth in this area, and it is hiring as that happens.
So Mr. Anderson does much less administering and much more redesigning and marketing of Medicare management. When he joined the company, it managed six Medicare programs for local governments; now it handles 15. "And we have 22 more in the works," he said.
In the process, Mr. Anderson's staff has jumped from 4 to 14. Additional positions are being filled in the cities where the company has sold its services. Base salary ranges from $50,000 to $140,000, plus bonus, options, health care and pension benefits.
"The jobs haven't been open long," he said. "I don't like ads or recruiters, so it's mostly word of mouth."
Health care is growing so fast that industry experience is not necessary; many new employees come from banking, life insurance, retailing and government work.
Mr. Anderson, who is 49, made a big leap into the industry. In the mid-1980's, he had made enough money as a manager at Pepsi and Denny's to retire. Then he got married, and his wife wanted him to work.
"I wanted to do something meaningful," he said. With his mother having health problems, "I went through the Yellow Pages, looking at health maintenance organizations," he said.
"And I did cold calls," Mr. Anderson said, armed with his work record, an undergraduate degree in political science and an M.B.A. from Pepperdine University. "The first interview I had was with FHP International, and they hired me."
He stayed there until United Healthcare called.
 
The Tribulations of Life On the Ground Floor
For all the bustle, some people are not finding the job market quite so hospitable. Since Dallas Crow graduated from college in 1988 with an English degree, he has toiled in a half dozen bookstores, at a publisher and in graduate school for a year. "I've freelanced, and I've temped, too," he said.
In January, with his wife pregnant, he started sending out resumes. By June, when Hungry Mind Press -- a year-old small press in St. Paul -- hired Mr. Crow as marketing director half-time, he had just one other offer, in book wholesaling.
He took the Hungry Mind job because he knew one its founders, and they promised that his job would become full time next January. In the meantime, he is working in the nearby Hungry Mind bookstore 20 hours a week.
"I'd rather not work two jobs," he said. "But I saw this as a chance to get in on the ground floor of something and to make a difference."
He refused to say what he was paid. "People in New York would sneer," he explained.
Mary Dupont, who has a master's degree in English and is the only full-time employee of Hungry Mind Press, makes $19,000, with no benefits. But she is much happier with her job choice, despite earlier ambitions to teach at the college level.
"That's hard to get without a Ph.D.," she said, "And this is a great job. The company is designed to be nonhierarchical, it's the perfect alternative to being in a cube."
She manages virtually everything for the five owners who make the editorial decisions.
Ms. Dupont believes she could have found a higher-paying post in a bank or ad agency. "If I weren't married, I might think twice about this," she said, noting that her husband's salary from an advertising agency would be enough for a comfortable life even after they have a baby, due in December.
But right now, she said, sitting on a porch outside Hungry Mind's office, "this is how I want to spend my day."
"I don't feel a great desire to be part of the big financial and business complex," she added. "Most of the areas where you can make more money just don't interest me."
 
The Common Thread In the Career Quilt
Ms. Dupont echoed a common theme. While money is clearly important, what employees do all day weighs heavily on their minds, too. If corporate downsizing has taught them one thing, it is that they are responsible for their own careers. Today, personal growth and opportunity frequently matter more than immediate pay.
Vincent K. Hass, an assistant store manager at Bruegger's Bagels, even took a $2,000 pay cut when he jumped from a job as a Wendy's general manager in March. Mr. Hass, who is 34, prefers the management style at Bruegger's and believes his opportunities are greater.
And Mr. Mackany, the new financial adviser who had spent his entire career at 3M and retired early only because he had witnessed three rounds of downsizing, was not satisfied taking life easy. He grew bored consulting part time, and though he knew little about investments, he was eager to learn to provide for his own future and that of his teen-age daughter. Now, dressed in a snappy blue suit, Mr. Mackany is primed to do business again, almost bubbling when he said, "I'm really excited about this."
"3M was the only company I ever worked for," he continued, "and I still think it's a great company. I could have stayed. I have no bitterness, and I understand the competitive environment. I felt I wanted an opportunity to grow. At 3M, it would have been all sidestepping."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption last Sunday with an article about the quality of new jobs in the economy misstated the previous job of Jeffrey Pelkey, systems administrator at Viatech Laboratories. He had been a systems administrator for a hospital, not a hospital administrator.
A chart with the article, showing the pay breakdowns for new jobs, mislabeled the reference to jobs paying up to 30 percent above average. A corrected version appears today on page 9.
Another table with the article, showing job growth from 1991 to 1996, omitted two industry sectors from the list of those with the least growth. They are nonmetallic minerals, with an annual growth rate of one-tenth of 1 percent, and water transportation, with an annual rate of decline of 1.2 percent. Nonmetallic minerals had 107,000 workers in the first quarter this year, and average earnings in the industry were $39,474 in 1993. Water transportation had 171,000 workers, with average 1993 earnings of $38,121.

Tables: "Winners and Losers, Industry by Industry"
 More and more, Americans are serving each other. There has been a net increase of roughly 11 million jobs since the recession ended in early 1991, and almost all of the new ones are in industries that provide one kind of service or another. The fastest growth took place in business services, a catch-all category that includes everything from accountants and data processers to janitors and temporary workers; leisure services, from blackjack dealers to amusement park operators, and social services. The industries that lost jobs at the greatest rate include clothing and textile manufacturing, oil and gas extraction and coal mining. Some fast-growing industries pay extraordinarily well: annual earnings at brokerage firms average more than $96,000. But some of the biggest gainers pay well below average: many providers of social welfare services work for nonprofit agencies and earn little more than those they try to help. All in all, the gap has widened between those at the top of the job ladder and those at the bottom. Researchers have found that the largest gains in job growth in recent years took place in the highest-paying job categories; relatively low-paying industries and occupations have also grown, but at a slower pace. Employment has actually shrunk among job categories in the middle range.

"Where the Jobs Are, or Aren't"
 Job growth in the 1990's has been distributed unevenly across America. It is no surprise that many jobs were created in metropolitan areas of the Sun Belt, like Atlanta, Phoenix and Dallas. But several big cities that were once dismissed as lost causes, including Boston and Detroit, have actually added jobs since the recession ended in early 1991. The cities with the fastest job growth are concentrated in the West. Places like Austin, Tex.; Boise, Idaho, and Las Vegas -- which initially benefited from the job exodus from California -- have taken on a life of their own as magnets for high-technology businesses, leisure and recreation industries and business services. Among the nation's roughly 250 major metropolitan areas, only a dozen had no gain in jobs from the end of the recession to the first quarter of 1996. Except for Honolulu, all of those areas are in California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut or Pennsylvania.

Every Olympic Games has a defining identity, a personality and legacy that survive the test of time. The question that will linger through the heat and hot competition for the next two weeks in the Games of the XXVI Olympiad in how Atlanta will be catalogued into the Olympic movement.
 
 Not every host city has a choice of its Olympic destiny. And not every city is remembered for what takes place competitively. Some Olympic Games draw their place from individuals; others are wrapped around political landscapes. Still others are logged by a team, an event or, in the case of Montreal in 1976, the red ink that is still dripping from their debt.
 No city has been a perfect host. One that started with the sweet smell of success - Munich in 1972, with its colorful pastels and happy music and Mark Spitz - ended in the darkness of terrorism.
 One gifted athlete can grant immortality to a host city. Spiridon Louis, a Greek peasant, did it 100 years ago for Athens by winning the marathon. Jim Thorpe's decathlon skills so awed King Gustav V of Sweden at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm that he could only gush, "Sir, you are the greatest athlete in the world."
 Paavo Nurmi made Antwerp (1920), Paris (1924) and Amsterdam (1928) by winning nine tracka nd field gold medals and three silver; Fanny Blankers-Koen won four golds as London's Dutch heroine in 1948; Emil Zatopek was indefatigable in Helsinki (1952) in a sweep of the 5,000, 10,000 and marathon, and Tokyo (1964) remains the first place where the label of "world's fastest human" was stamped forever on Bob Hayes.
 Sometimes athletes and events shape a city's Olympic identity. Jessee Owens and Adolf Hitler came together in 1936 Berlin, on the eve of war. Bob Beamon was athletic perfection, ahead of his time, in the thin air of Mexico City, just as Tommie Smith and John Carlos achieved a political mission there, ahead of their time. Norway's Johann Olav Koss enhanced Lillehammer in 1994, but Tonya and Nancy were Lille-hammer's legacy.
 Then there are the teams that become synonymous with cities. The 1980 United States hockey team in Lake Placid. The Dream Team in Barcelona. The Hungarian water polo team winning its "blood in the water" duel with the Soviet Union in Melbourne (1956), weeks after 200,000 Soviet troops poured into Hungary.
 Politics, either internal or international, has been an Olympic curse for many cities. The second Olympics in 1900 in Paris, disorganized and poorly attended, were a mere appendage of the World Exhibition there; the 1904 Games, initially awarded to Chicago, went to St. Louis in a dispute, but precious few European competitors went. And in 1908, in London, bickering broke out between the Russians and the Finns, the English and the Irish, the English and the Americans, the English and just about everybody. World wars canceled Berlin in 1916, Tokyo in 1940 and London in 1944. The American-led boycott gutted Moscow in 1980.
 Economics saved Los Angeles in 1984, despite a Soviet-bloc boycott, which was a better fate than the 1932 Games in Los Angeles endured during the Depression.
 What is Atlanta's fate? Will the heat be the dominant story? Or Muhammad Ali's torch lighting at the stunning opening ceremony? Another drug scandal to rival the Ben Johnson saga in Seoul? Is Michael Johnson truly of Owens/Beamon stature? Will the self-described "Mag 7" U.S. gymnasts join other fabled American gold-medal teams at a time when figure skating, gymnastics and other women's sports are exploding?
 Atlanta has already achieved a milestone with its record number of 197 countries, an indication of political stability in the Olympic movement. And the television exposure, here and abroad, will be overwhelming, beyond even world Cup soccer extravagance.
 Do cities care? You bet. Munich was so close to heaven, but people there still wince over the bloodshed that enused. The bliss of Sarajevo '84 preceded Yugoslavia's descent into despair and dissolution. Athens remains bitter that Atlanta usurped its place as the centennial host.
 Atlantans desperately want their Games to succeed. They have opened their city to the world, and now they sit by anxiously - and I mean anxiously - and await their fate. They fear being to nice, but not good enough. What if we fail, they ask? What if the trains and buses don't run on time? What if athletes and spectators keel over from exhuastion?
 The stakes are even higher because so much is expected from an event staged by an American city. World Cup soccer succeeded as a show because it was played out on a national stage. Los Angeles in '84 was a corridor of venues. Barcelona was continental, with centuries of history. Atlanta is downtown - no, make that Downtown - compressed into an Olympic City that at times has the feel of an oversized Times Square on New Year's Eve.
 While Atlanta waits like the nervous diver preparing on the platform and pondering degree of difficulty, technical execution and final score, the world watches in judgment.

Where Banana Is King, a Revolt Over Farmlands

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: LA LIMA, Honduras

 BODY:
From the moment American fruit producers installed themselves in northern Honduras a century ago, this has been the quintessential company town. The large Chiquita banana logo on the water tower here announces it, and the dusty streets are dominated by faded company posters promising "riches and progress for Honduras."
For most of that time, the company's word has been law. But now workers on banana plantations are resisting efforts by Chiquita Brands International, which says it needs to trim costs here in order to increase production and remain competitive in international markets, to evict residents from land they have worked for as long as three generations and to offer those holdings to ranchers and developers. 
 Troops, police and Government mediators have all, at various points, been called in to resolve a dispute that the Roman Catholic bishops of Honduras in a recent pastoral letter described as "the symbol of all agrarian conflicts." But that seems only to have fanned popular resentment of the corporation once known as the United Fruit Company, which still maintains its Honduran headquarters here.
"The company wants to show the Government and Hondurans that they continue to be the power here," Oswaldo Martinez, news director of Radio Progreso, a local station, said of the efforts to dislodge the workers. "It's a caprice, a way of saying that they are still a state within a state and that Honduras, unfortunately, is still a banana republic."
The dispute began in July 1994, when families on the Tacamiche plantation here and on three others received letters saying the company had designated the land on which they lived and worked for "closing or final abandonment" because it was no longer fertile. Since many of the families have lived here since the 1920's, a decade before Honduras granted United Fruit title to more than 3,000 acres for $1, they were shocked and frightened at the order to leave.
"For the company, Tacamiche is just a former banana plantation that, after having the juice sucked from it, has been abandoned without a thought for the fate of those who lived here," said Jorge Antonio Reyes, a leader of one group of banana workers. "But for those of us from Tacamiche, this is our life, these are the cabins that watched as we were born and grew up."
Residents, convinced that the productivity of the fields was not the real issue, say they asked about acquiring the land so they could farm it themselves. Company officials contend that no such proposal was ever made and say they offered to relocate peasants to comparable parcels of land. The banana workers say that the quality of the land and housing they were offered was inferior and that the ownership titles are in dispute.
In the other three communities, each with about 400 people, residents remain on their land and they are still hoping that a special Government commission can resolve the issue. But in February, army troops, the police and Chiquita work crews marched into the Tacamiche settlement, evicting 123 families, uprooting their crops, making off with some of their belongings and razing not only the wooden cabins in which they lived but also three churches where they had always worshiped.
"It was very painful to see all of our corn, peppers, tomatoes, carrots and melons being plowed over by bulldozers, not to mention what they did to the churches," said Wilfredo Cabrera, a 34-year-old banana worker. "We have been peasants all of our lives, making the land produce, so we can never forgive that kind of destruction."
Both the Commission for the Defense of Human Rights in Honduras and the Roman Catholic Church have denounced the February raid as a blatant violation of Honduran law. Though the Government forces had a search warrant for some peasants accused of "encroachment," both groups said, no eviction order had been issued, and Chiquita had no authorization to demolish any buildings.
Arnoldo Palma, manager of Chiquita's holdings here, did not respond to telephone calls requesting comment, and a secretary rebuffed an effort to meet with him at his office here, saying that he was too busy for an interview. But officials based at Chiquita Brands International's headquarters in Cincinnati maintain that the action was both legal and justified.
"Our understanding is that all of the orders were proper for the actions that were taken," said Joseph W. Hagin, a company spokesman. "The company feels it acted honorably and bent over backwards to bring this thing to an amicable conclusion, but we were met with nothing but resistance from the very start."
Because of strikes and disease, said Manuel Rodriguez, a Chiquita lawyer and vice president, "Honduras has been a losing operation for our company for a number of years." The company's banana production here, he said, has dropped from 32.6 million 40-pound boxes in 1987 to 10.7 million boxes in 1994.
Over a comparable period, the minimum wage paid banana workers has slid from the equivalent of $8 a day to less than $3, and Chiquita's work force has been trimmed by more than half, to about 4,200 employees. To the Rev. Joseph Owens, a Jesuit priest who ministers to the banana workers, that is proof that Chiquita is pursuing "a progressive strategy to weaken the union and farm out production to non-union sources."
The banana workers' refusal to leave, he added, has become an impediment to those efforts, since the peasants continue to occupy land Chiquita wants to sell to real estate developers or to lease to "independent producers" not obliged to pay union wages, several of whom are former company executives.
"It's all a disguise to strip us of the gains we have made over 40 years," said Rene Martinez, president of the banana workers' union.
Since the eviction at Tacamiche, supposedly unproductive fields have been replanted with corn and sorghum, enraging the peasants, who are now living in a community center a few yards from the edge of the disputed property while their case slowly makes its way through Honduran courts. "Just because land is not productive for bananas does not mean it is unproductive for other crops," Mr. Rodriguez said when asked about the apparent inconsistency.
But even bananas have again been planted in some of the "infertile" fields, the peasants pointed out. "It might be economically viable for a small producer to do so but these aren't commercially exploitable quantities," Mr. Hagin said.

HEADLINE: Burmese Win Observer Status in Southeast Asian Group

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, July 21

 BODY:
The military Government of Myanmar took a major step toward international legitimacy this weekend as its Southeast Asian neighbors welcomed it into a regional partnership and told Western countries not to interfere.
"Heartfelt congratulations," Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon of the Philippines said today in Jakarta, Indonesia, where the seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations granted Myanmar observer status, a first step toward full membership in the group, which is also known as Asean. 
 Myanmar's Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, was greeted with warm applause on Saturday and told his new colleagues, "Today is a historic moment for Southeast Asia."
The celebratory atmosphere contrasted with the growing antagonism of Western countries, which have criticized Myanmar, formerly Burma, for human rights violations and urged steps to isolate it economically or at least to press it to make reforms.
An outcry against Myanmar has grown in recent weeks as tensions have heightened between the governing junta and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the democratic opposition, who is demanding the share in Government that she was denied after her party won an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections in 1990. Two years earlier, hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed by Government forces.
In May, the Government arrested 273 members of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's party to prevent a conference marking the sixth anniversary of the elections, whose results the Government refused to honor. Since then, a war of words and veiled threats has escalated between Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military leaders.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher is due to meet with his counterparts in Jakarta on Monday and Tuesday and is expected to urge them to use their influence to bring about changes in Myanmar. But the United States has so far stopped short of calling for the economic sanctions that Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi is now urging.
Mr. Christopher is to sit across the table from U Ohn Gyaw at the Asean Regional Forum, the regional security grouping, but the two men have not scheduled a direct meeting.
Foreign ministers from Europe and Australia were also expected to urge stronger action against Myanmar, but Asean leaders have already staked out a firm position.
"Asean has one cardinal rule, and that is not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries," said the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. He said the countries of the region "prefer to work quietly on issues of internal matters" and said Western countries must realize that "this is our organization, not theirs."
Last week, the association's Secretary General, Ajit Singh of Malaysia, was even more blunt, saying, "The West and the media are going on a witch hunt as far as Myanmar is concerned, because it is not an issue at all as far as Asean is concerned."
Indeed, the final communique of the two-day meeting of foreign ministers, issued today, did not mention the issue of human rights abuses in Myanmar, though it referred to more distant problems in the Middle East, Bosnia and Korea.
Myanmar's neighbors subscribe to the principle of "constructive engagement," arguing that a country's policies can best be influenced -- as they were in Eastern Europe -- by enriching diplomatic and economic involvement. They argue that sanctions and ostracism have had little effect on the Communist Governments of Vietnam and Cuba.
One of the least developed and potentially richest nations in the region, Myanmar offers tempting business opportunities, and Southeast Asian countries, led by Singapore, have plunged into trade and investment there since the Government began liberalizing its economic policies seven years ago.
In addition, their successful regional grouping holds to a dream of including all 10 Southeast Asian countries by the end of the century. Vietnam recently ended years of antagonism by joining Asean, which also includes Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Brunei. Cambodia and Laos also gained observer status this weekend.
"They want a Southeast Asian 10, without a loose cannon on deck that anyone like China can play with," said Carlyle A. Thayer, who heads the School of Politics at the Australian Defense Force Academy. "They want to get Burma inside the tent of Asean. They adhere to collectivist Asian values and argue that they will be more effective engaging Burma rather than isolating it."
Myanmar receives extensive military aid from China, and diplomatic relations between the countries are warm. The growing regional power of China is a main concern of the Southeast Asian grouping.
Nevertheless, the timing of Myanmar's inclusion as an observer is awkward, and any severe crackdown there would be embarrassing for the country's new colleagues.
One year ago the Government released Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi from six years of house arrest, apparently hoping to defuse international criticism. But its failure to open a dialogue with her and its continuing harsh treatment of her supporters have brought continuing calls for sanctions.
The death in prison one month ago of her godfather, James Leander Nichols -- who was the unaccredited honorary consul for several Scandinavian countries -- brought a new round of criticism that led to the pullout from Myanmar of the Carlsberg and Heineken breweries.
Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch/Asia, said last week that the policy of constructive engagement had clearly failed.
"With an increase in migrant and refugee outflows, stepped-up arrests and continuing forced labor," she said in a statement, "Asean must either conclude that its policy of engagement is bankrupt, or use its influence with Burma to halt the slide."
Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 51, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has stepped up her public challenge to the Government since the wave of arrests in May.
In a videotape smuggled from Myanmar in advance of the Asean meeting, she called for economic sanctions, saying, "We think this is the time for concerted international efforts with regard to the democratic process in Burma."
She has announced plans to draft a constitution that would reduce the military's political role, and she has asserted that she will continue to hold meetings of her supporters, although the Government has warned that both of these activities are illegal.
For its part, the Government has increased the harshness of its press commentaries against her, suggesting that her activities are subversive and that she is under the control of enemies from the West. The commentaries seem intended to alienate her from the public and also to lay the groundwork for any possible action against her.
On Saturday, as U Ohn Gyaw was being welcomed in Jakarta, the controlled press castigated Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi as a "fifth columnist," "power crazy" and "a stooge of the imperialists" who has been tainted by her marriage to a Briton, Michael Aris.
"Aung San Suu Kyi had her blood mixed with that of an Englishman and gave birth to two half-castes," it said. "Suu Kyi has been in the Englishman's arms."

HEADLINE: Goldman Agrees to Acquire British Coal's Pension Unit

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Goldman, Sachs & Company and British Coal said yesterday that Goldman, Sachs had agreed to buy British Coal's pension fund management company. Though no price was given, the bid, one of several, is said to have been between $65 million and $75 million.
The fund management company, CIN Management, handles $23 billion in assets for two British Coal pension funds. Including those, Goldman Sachs Asset Management will now manage about $85 billion of funds. 
 The deal, which has been under discussion for about three months, has already been approved by British regulatory officials and the trustees of the two coal pension plans. The trustees have had to make a commitment to leave the funds in Goldman, Sachs for six years.
British Coal, the former Government-run monopoly, which sold its mining business to private interests in 1994, has been trying to sell CIN Management for about a year. After several attempts fell apart earlier this year, British Coal split CIN Management into the pension fund division and a property division. CIN Property Management, with assets of about $2.2 billion, is expected to be sold this fall, British Coal said.
Neil Clarke, the chairman of British Coal, said, "At the final stage of the sales process, bids were sought and received from a number of very high-quality institutions."
Jon S. Corzine, the chairman of Goldman, Sachs, said, "This transaction reflects both our commitment as a business and our determination to deliver superior investment performance to our clients worldwide in Europe, Asia and the Americas."
The acquisition also strengthens Goldman, Sachs's position in the institutional fund management business -- a business that the company predicted, in a report issued last year, would soon be dominated by no more than 25 companies, each with managed assets of at least $150 billion.
Last year, Goldman, Sachs, which is based in New York, had considered buying another institutional fund manager, RCM Capital Management, from the Travelers Group of New York, though it later dropped out of the bidding and Dresdner Bank A.G. of Germany bought RCM.
Because it collects a steady stream of fees, the money management business provides a buffer against downturns in trading and underwriting, which makes smaller asset-management companies targets of bigger companies. Last month, Morgan Stanley Group Inc. of New York agreed to pay $745 million for Van Kampen/American Capital Inc. of Oak Brook Terrace, Ill., which would give it about $160 billion in managed assets, while Merrill Lynch of New York, with some $207 billion in managed assets, said it would acquire Hotchkis & Wiley of Los Angeles, which specializes in institutional investors. Paine Webber Group Inc. said it also was considering buying a money management firm.
With the acquisiton of CIN Management, about one-third of Goldman, Sachs's portfolio of managed assets will be from abroad.
"This acquisition will substantially strengthen our European, Japanese, non-Japan Asia and U.S. portfolio management teams," said David B. Ford, a co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. On a percentage basis, he added, "I would suspect we may grow faster outside the U.S., but on an absolute basis we will likely grow faster within the United States."
John P. McNulty, the other co-chief executive, said that the pressure for globalization came in part from the search for economies of scale. "But even more," he said, "clients are looking to money managers to be able to handle large management services around the world."

HEADLINE: Mr. Zedillo Wavers

 BODY:
Mexico, battered by corruption scandals, deep recession and mysterious guerrilla violence, is passing through difficult and dangerous times. But instead of stepping up to the challenge with a bold plan of action, President Ernesto Zedillo now appears to be retreating from the promises of open, honest government he made at the start of his term 20 months ago. That is exactly the wrong response.
The repeated political and economic shocks of the last two and a half years have shaken the confidence of Mexico's political and business elite. The latest blow has come from Swiss and American judicial inquiries into huge secret bank accounts maintained by Raul Salinas de Gortari, the brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Many Mexicans suspect that these accounts may have been used to park payoff money from major businesses and even drug cartels. What connection, if any, Carlos Salinas may have had with any illegal activity is unclear, but a serious public investigation by Mexican authorities is warranted. 
These revelations, combined with the prolonged economic slump and rural violence, have shaken the legitimacy of Mexico's long-entrenched political system. That system has delivered nearly 70 years of relative political stability, but at the price of letting top officials operate above the law and avoid prosecution for serious misconduct.
The United States has an enormous interest in the outcome of Mexico's current crisis. Two peoples deeply entwined by history, geography and large-scale migration have been drawn even closer by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Washington must respond sensitively to the Mexican crisis, respecting Mexico's sovereignty, the authority of its democratically elected Government and the right of its people to sort out their own political destiny.
But respond it must. The Clinton Administration, still nursing bruises from its battles to win approval for Nafta and last year's emergency bailout loan, would just as soon pretend all is well in Mexico, at least until November's election.
The wiser course would be to encourage President Zedillo to push through desperately needed political and judicial reforms. Specifically, Mr. Zedillo needs to distance himself from his party's corrupt and authoritarian old guard and insist on aggressive prosecution of compromised officials, no matter how politically well-connected they might be.
Instead, Mr. Zedillo seems to be moving in the opposite direction. Last week, his supporters abruptly cut off a congressional investigation that focused on a questionable Government payment seven years ago to a business owned by a political backer of Carlos Salinas. The inquiry was uncomfortable for Mr. Zedillo, who, as a budget official in the Salinas Government, approved the payment.
Mr. Zedillo also seems to have backed away from his efforts to clean up Mexico's notoriously fraudulent state elections. The most closely watched case involved the oil-rich state of Tabasco, where federal investigators found Gov. Robert Madrazo, an old-guard stalwart of the ruling party, had spent more than 30 times the legal limit in his 1994 campaign. Last month, Mr. Zedillo's Attorney General filed criminal fraud charges but left it up to Mr. Madrazo's own state officials to prosecute. A few weeks later, Mr. Zedillo flew to Tabasco, embraced Mr. Madrazo on the airport tarmac, and all charges were dropped.
Mr. Zedillo began on the right tack when he tried to bring new fairness to Mexico's judicial and electoral systems. By backing down now, he may buy a few months of political respite from worried members of his party's old guard. But he greatly heightens the risk of more radical challenges to the system, with disastrous consequences for his presidency and serious repercussions for the United States.

HEADLINE: In America;
The Mouths of Babes

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
There is something very creepy about the welfare debate.
The politicians have gotten together and decided it's a good idea to throw a million or so children into poverty. But they can't say that. The proponents of this so-called "reform" effort have gone out of their way to avoid being seen for what they are -- men and women of extreme privilege who are taking food out of the mouths of infants and children, the poverty-stricken elderly, the disabled. 
 They seek camouflage in euphemisms. So here is Clay Shaw, a Florida Republican, as quoted on the front page of Friday's Washington Post:
"This is a most historic bill. I would hope the President would join us in our efforts to rescue millions of Americans out of a corrupt welfare system."
Ah, it's a rescue mission. Can't you picture it? Clay Shaw as hero. A brave Floridian protecting small children from all those breakfasts and dinners they might otherwise have to eat.
The welfare legislation currently before Congress is in no way a reform measure. It will help no one. It is a form of officially sanctioned brutality aimed at the usual suspects -- the poor, the black and the brown, the very young, the uneducated, immigrants. Somebody has to be the scapegoat and they're it.
In a letter to a member of Congress last week, the Rev. Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities U.S.A., asserted, "The welfare reform before you reflects ignorance and prejudice far more than the experience of this nation's poorest working and welfare families." He described the legislative proposals before the House and the Senate as "largely a sham designed to appease the ignorant and to pander to our worst prejudices in an election year."
Expressions of dismay by Father Kammer and others have not had much effect. You have to wonder what has happened to the national conversation when, a half-century after Franklin Roosevelt, voices concerned about the plight of poor children can barely be heard. You would think, for example, that the potential dumping of a million children into poverty would be big news, but that aspect of the welfare story has drawn little attention.
When Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan stood up to address the issue last Thursday, he looked slowly around and said: "The Senate floor is all but empty. I see four senators. The lobbies are empty. There is no outcry against what we are doing."
Senator Moynihan's concern, first and foremost, is with the proposed repeal of the Federal guarantee of assistance to the nation's poorest children. The states will be given block grants and if that money (plus a small contingency fund) runs out because of rising unemployment, a recession, mismanagement, whatever -- well, that will be too bad.
"This will be the first time in history," the Senator said, "that we have repealed a core provision of the Social Security Act. Further, we are choosing to repeal the provision for children."
President Clinton opened the door to this potential disaster with his famous promise to "end welfare as we know it." Forgotten now are Mr. Clinton's elaborate (and expensive) proposals to assist welfare recipients in the difficult transition to work. The Republicans have seized the issue and their idea of reform is to lop recipients off the rolls.
Mr. Clinton has vetoed two welfare bills, but an election draws near. That is bad news for people who are already in bad shape. Congressional heroes like Clay Shaw are moving in for the kill.
The pending legislation would end benefits to well over a million legal immigrants, including many receiving Supplemental Security Income, which is assistance to low-income aged, blind and disabled persons. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, spoke poignantly on Friday about a "very elderly" woman she encountered on San Francisco's Grant Avenue.
"She was so hunched over she could barely walk," Ms. Feinstein said. "She's on S.S.I. She's a legal immigrant to this country."
Under the current proposals, Ms. Feinstein noted, "She would be summarily thrown off of S.S.I."
Old women, small children, the disabled. A country that would single out such individuals for deliberate harm falls somewhere well short of greatness.

HEADLINE: Gutting the Money for Poor Countries

 BODY:
Congress is threatening to renege on a worthy commitment made by President Clinton to wipe out America's debt to the World Bank program that lends money to desperately poor countries. The House voted to appropriate only $525 million of the $934 million the United States owes. A Senate committee voted for $626 million. Unfortunately, the Administration is not fighting very hard to restore the original target.
The danger is that once the United States falls short, other donor countries will withdraw their pledges, leaving sub-Saharan and other poor countries without any source of money to pay for investments in health, education and roads. 
 The United States and 34 other wealthy countries provide money to the International Development Association, an affiliate of the World Bank, to lend money to very poor countries on steeply subsidized terms. The I.D.A. is often the only source of external money for these countries because private investors are repelled by the risk of lending to countries that are hugely in debt.
The international agency requires that the recipients undertake prudent market reforms and use the loans to pay for important public needs like health clinics, schools and roads -- built and equipped, in general, by companies from the donor countries. It is the prospect of winning these contracts that helps create a political constituency for the program in the donor countries.
The United States helped create and sustain the I.D.A. but has now fallen more than $934 million behind its pledges. The other donors demanded, and President Clinton agreed, that the arrears be paid next year. But the huge payoff leaves Mr. Clinton no room to provide money for new I.D.A. loans next year. Rather than rejoicing that the United States agreed to wipe out its arrears, the other donors chose to add a politically incendiary form of punishment. Next year, when the United States would be contributing no money for new loans, its companies would be prohibited from bidding on contracts from recipient countries.
The prohibition angered Capitol Hill and companies in the construction and farm implements industries that would have expected to win contracts on I.D.A. projects. Congress, not about to ignore the squawking of powerful industries during an election year, is gutting Mr. Clinton's request, a foolish gesture that achieves little. Congress should have instead provided the full $934 million owed, but only if the other donor countries dropped the gratuitous shackles on American business.
Full funding would not be difficult to provide. There is fat in the pending foreign operations budget, including excessive spending on military assistance for foreign countries so that they can buy American arms they do not need and cannot afford.
Foreign aid programs are unpopular when Congress is cutting domestic programs. But I.D.A. is special. Most of the money goes to people squeaking by on $1 a day. A $7 trillion economy can easily afford to honor America's proud tradition of helping the world's poor. That way I.D.A. could survive at least for one more year.

HEADLINE: Planners of a New Public School for Girls Look to Two Other Cities

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
Planners of a new public school for girls in New York City have looked to the country's last two all-female public schools, one here and one in Baltimore, for indications that such a concept can succeed -- even in the face of legal challenges.
But while both the Philadelphia High School for Girls and the Western High School in Baltimore do offer plenty of evidence that young women prosper in a single-sex atmosphere, they do not provide the kind of legal comfort zone that New York's planners might seek. 
 Unlike the proposed Young Women's Leadership School in East Harlem, neither of the other schools says outright that its mission is to educate only girls. And both may owe their continued existence to their success at ducking the kind of major court tests that many predict await the planned New York middle school.
"Boys can apply," said Glenna M. Hazeltine, assistant counsel to the Philadelphia school district, who oversees legal matters affecting what is commonly called Girls High. "But they just have never come here."
A 1992 review by the United States Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, which investigated one person's complaints that the Philadelphia and Baltimore schools violated discrimination laws, found that both schools are "open to both boys and girls" and do not "deny admissions to boys." Neither school has been forced to go to court.
In New York, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's office has been in daily discussions with planners of the new school and with officials of School District 4.
"The last thing Rudy Crew wants is to put his impramatur on a school that might then be closed due to legal challenges," his spokeswoman, Chiara Coletti, said on Sunday. Among the options being considered, she said, are keeping the school focused on women's leadership skills but admitting boys, or creating a similar all-boys school. An important meeting is planned for Wednesday at the Board of Education.
Traditionally, legal experts say, it has been all-male schools, with reputations as centers of power and superior academic programs, that have come under attack. Just last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the Virginia Military Institute's all-male enrollment policy violated the Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection, a ruling that has thrown all single-sex programs receiving Government funds into question.
"It's not clear from the V.M.I. case how all this is going to play out," Ms. Hazeltine said.
A 1991 law in New York City actually prohibits single-sex public schools, but there has been no single-sex school in the city since 1986 and the law has not been invoked. Neither Philadelphia nor Baltimore has such a law.
In fact, Philadelphia's school administrators say, Girls High has held on to its girls-only status simply by virtue of a fragile blend of tradition, informal district policy and success in warding off the handful of boys who express interest. Both Girls High and Western have also avoided trouble by keeping an intentionally low profile, say students and administrators.
Geraldine Myles, the principal of Girls High, declined to be interviewed before September, saying through a secretary that she was unavailable until then. Philadelphia's schools superintendent, David W. Hornbeck, spoke favorably of Girls High but said he had not given much attention to its single-sex status. "I don't know why boys don't apply," he said. "It really hasn't come up."
Ms. Hazeltine said the city's school board "made a decision that it is important to maintain Girls High as a single-gender school."
In Baltimore, the high school pamphlets distributed by the city's guidance counselors have no language indicating that Western is a single-sex school. The school's principal, Anne Carusi, said simply, "It's just girls; it just is."
Girls High and Western werefounded in the 1840's, when single-sex public schools were commonplace. Although those schools began to be supplanted by co-educational institutions in the late 19th century -- a movement that gained momentum throughout this century -- Girls High and Western had the reputation and support to hold out. Both traditionally accepted only top students and produced high graduation rates.
But here at Girls High, there are some indications that competition from co-ed schools has taken its toll. Enrollment has dipped since the 1980's from 2,000 students to about 1,500, and the average Scholastic Assessment Test score is below state and national levels. The dropout rate at Girls High, however, is extremely low; virtually all the girls graduate and go on to college. There is almost no violence at the school.
Among Girls High alumnae are Judith Seitz Rodin, president of the University of Pennsylvania; Barbara Chase-Riboud, a writer and sculptor; Constance Clayton, the former superintendent of Philadelphia's public schools, and hundreds of doctors and lawyers.
Girls High, like Western, serves a wide constituency, drawing from economically and racially diverse neighborhoods throughout the city. The proposed school in New York would enroll mostly economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic girls from the surrounding neighborhood. At Girls High, which is in the Olney section of northwest Philadelphia, 50 percent of the students are black, 35 percent are white and the rest are Hispanic or Asian. Half of the students are from poor families and qualify for free or discount lunches. But some come from affluent families.
The school's decor, which includes a pink marble entrance with life-size copies of the Winged Victory and Venus de Milo statues, seems designed to appeal to young women.
Other special features include a "Virgin's Club," something like a buddy system in which seniors are assigned to help freshmen adjust, and a Junior Tea, an elegant party for 11th graders given by school administrators.
The curriculum follows the traditional college preparatory path: four years of math and English and three years of core science courses. Like Philadelphia's other magnet schools, Girls High has rigorous admission requirements.
But boys seldom indicate an interest in being considered for Girls High when they fill out the city's universal high school application form, according to district officials. This is not an uncommon reaction from boys, said Meg Moulton, executive director of the National Coalition of Girls Schools. "For whatever social and societal reasons, it just appears that it is not as attractive for boys to break the gender barrier," she said.
In 1983, Philadelphia's all-male Central High School, the oldest and most distinguished public secondary school in the city, was forced to admit girls after a state court judge ruled that Central's ban on girls violated the Constitution and the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment.
The judge found that while separate but equal single-sex schools could exist, Central had a richer teaching staff and educational program, including a 50,000-volume library, science program and campus, than Girls High. Central was also the only school in the city that enjoyed a "substantial private endowment."
In Baltimore, Polytechnic High School, once all boys, became co-educational in 1976 after a female student pressed for entrance, saying that Polytechnic's advanced math, science and engineering courses were not available elsewhere. The decision to admit girls was made by the school, not by a judge, said Ian Cohen, the principal.
On a handful of occasions, boys have listed Girls High as their top choice for high school. No boys, however, have been accepted. They have simply been assigned to another magnet school on their list of top choices, administrators said.
In Baltimore, although no boys are enrolled at Western, Polytechnic students can take classes there.
And, administrators say, Girls High and Western have nothing, other than an all-girls atmosphere, that is noticeably different from other magnet schools.
But if the all-girls element is the weak link in either school's legal armor, it is one of the strongest selling points for incoming students.
"When I came here to visit, I just fell in love with the teachers and the warmth of the place," said Gwendolyn Petrucci, 17, who will be a senior at Girls High this fall. "Besides, boys my age are still spitting spitballs and think it's funny," she said. "I don't think I could handle that."
Sheryl L. Sterling, another senior, said that she had been apprehensive about entering high school. But at Girls High, the transition was easy, she said.
Classes, some of which seat the students in a circle, is collegial, not competitive, she and others said. And friendships are close.
As he stood waiting for the bus after attending summer-school classes at Girls High, Curtis Williams, 19, said that his grades had not been good enough for admission, but that in any case, he would not have been eager to be the first male on campus.
"There wouldn't be any guys to mingle with," he said.

HEADLINE: Doors Shut to Poor Seeking Homes

SERIES: AN AMERICAN PLACE: Scaling Back Section 8

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ohio, July 19

 BODY:
For two decades, the Federal Government's Section 8 housing subsidy program has helped poor working people like Wanda Schott get off welfare. After spending two years on a waiting list, Ms. Schott, a divorced mother of two boys, became eligible for one of those precious Section 8 vouchers and, in 1994, used it to rent a trailer in this suburb of Canton.
Not long after, she got off welfare, taking a 25-hour-a-week job in the bakery at the I.G.A. supermarket in the Buckeye Village shopping center. A few afternoons a week she works a second job, for a lawn care service. 
 Then, in April, the county housing authority determined that the trailer no longer met Federal housing standards. Ms. Schott had 90 days to find another apartment that would accept her Section 8 voucher.
She was not able to, though she searched frantically, visiting 20 apartments a month. "I looked everywhere," Ms. Schott said. "I can prove it with my tiredness."
Recent Federal budget cuts have lowered the payments to landlords, causing apartment owners here and across the country to withdraw from Section 8, threatening the nation's biggest housing program for the poor.
For now, she has moved her two boys in with her mother, but there is no room for her. So Ms. Schott sleeps in her '72 Ford truck, which she keeps parked in her mother's driveway, filled with pillows and cushions and a windup alarm clock to wake her for work. "At night I climb in and throw the cushions over me," she said, "I put up this here curtain so I have privacy."
Even in a time of relative prosperity and in a community like Stark County with a strong tradition of volunteerism, a place where the Republican Mayor of Canton, Richard Watkins, has opened a free medical clinic for people without health insurance, there is evidence that the Government's safety net for the poor is unraveling.
The county's 300 homeless-shelter beds are full year round.
Federal transportation cuts have meant that the public bus system, which serves mainly the elderly, the working poor and the handicapped, has had to reduce service on most routes to once an hour, shut down after 6:30 P.M. and may close altogether next year.
Recent Federal cuts for the Legal Services Corporation, the primary program providing legal aid for the poor in civil matters, have reduced the local office from eight lawyers to five. Next month the poor will no longer be able to get a legal aid lawyer to represent them on certain child custody matters. Because of cuts in Federal Emergency Management Agency money for the homeless, a Canton soup kitchen at the J.R. Coleman Outreach Center had to close this month.
None of these developments has become a political issue in this place that mirrors national politics -- not even among Democratic politicians. "It's not a question that is being talked about," said Carol Duncan, an advocate for the homeless. "It just doesn't appear."
When President Clinton speaks like a Republican, calling for a two-year limit on welfare, he is playing to conservative communities like Stark County, where the sentiment against taxes and welfare is strong, even among Democrats. In the 1980's, many Democrats here deserted their party's Presidential candidates for being too liberal, returning in 1992 to help Mr. Clinton carry Stark.
At a time when the national political agenda has been set by the Republicans, conservative talk is not going to cost Mr. Clinton many votes here. Liberals like Ms. Duncan have no one else to turn to. "He does the best he can with the Republican Congress totally opposed to what he wants to do," she said.
In the case of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development -- which many conservative Republicans would like to abolish outright -- doing the best he can has meant watching the agency's annual budget shrink from $25.2 billion to $19.5 billion during his Administration. (For 1996 Mr. Clinton requested $21 billion; the Republican Congress appropriated $19.5 billion.)
Several cuts last fall have had a particularly harsh impact on Section 8, a program, begun in the Nixon Administration, that provides housing assistance for 3.6 million poor Americans. "Across the country landlords are being driven away," says Julio Barreto, director of legislative affairs for the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. "We'll be left with landlords who don't have the housing you want people to have."
The Section 8 program provides a certificate or voucher, which the renter can present to any landlord who is willing to take part. Tenants pay 30 percent of their monthly income toward the rent and the Federal Government makes up the rest.
In return, the landlord agrees to follow Section 8 rent guidelines. In Canton that means charging no more than $359 a month (plus utility costs) for a two-bedroom apartment. In time, as a tenant like Ms. Schott, 30, earns more money, she pays a larger share of the rent and the Federal subsidy decreases.
Tenants appreciate being able to use the voucher anywhere, blending anonymously into a neighborhood rather than living together in a public housing project. There are 150,000 on the waiting list for Section 8 in New York City, 47,000 in Chicago and 40,000 in Los Angeles, where officials have closed the list until 2001.
The program has political appeal because it relies on private landlords in an era when privatization is so popular.
But three recent changes enacted as Federal budget-cutting measures are driving landlords away.
First, the maximum allowable rent a landlord can collect through Section 8 was reduced last fall. In Canton that amounted to about $10 less per month. The cut comes at a time when the economy here is strong and rental prices on the open market are climbing, giving landlords little incentive to take part in Section 8.
When Ralph Swonger Jr., a Canton landlord who used to do a lot of Section 8, advertised two available house rentals recently he had 143 calls, 43 from people with Section 8 certificates. He did not bother with the Section 8 people. "You can't get as high rents now," he said. "Hey, I'm in this for business."
Second, the compensation to a landlord for damage by a Section 8 tenant vacating an apartment has been drastically reduced. Landlords used to be able to collect nearly three months worth of rent from the Federal program for damages; now they can collect just one month's.
This has discouraged Rudy Kulisek of Niebel Property Management from most Section 8 rentals. In his dozen years in the program, he says 95 percent of these renters have been good, but the other 5 percent can cause significant damage. Until this year he could collect as much as $1,200 for damages to a typical rental, saving him the time and cost of going to court to recoup the damages. Under the new guidelines, he can collect only one month's rent and winds up paying $250 for a lawyer to get a court judgment against a poor tenant who usually has no assets.
The third budget factor is stricter lead paint inspection standards that took effect for Section 8 landlords last October, without Federal money to pay for cleanup costs. In the early 1990's two Democrats, Senator Alan Cranston, of California and Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas, sponsored the legislation created to protect children.
But the effect, says Rhonda Webster of the Stark County housing authority, has been to set a higher, costlier standard for landlords willing to accept Section 8 tenants than for all other landlords, who do not have to be inspected. "These inspections can cost the Section 8 landlord thousands of dollars and then thousands more if there's a problem," says Ms. Webster. "Most of these landlords are mom and pop operations, they can't afford this. Our landlord list keeps getting smaller."
Among those dramatically reducing their role, she says, is Royal Estate Management Corporation, the largest local rental agency.
And so, people who have waited two years for a certificate, are now turning back those certificates, unused. "One of my staff was playing back her messages the other day," said Ms. Webster, "and I heard a woman's voice: 'What am I going to do? I'm looking every day, I can't find anything.' "
It is Ms. Schott's question too. Right now, the three-bedroom brick house owned by her mother, Shirley Salmen, a widow, is full.
Besides Ms. Schott's sons, aged 8 and 10, there is her brother and his daughter, plus Ms. Schott's furniture from the trailer.
The other afternoon, Ms. Schott and her mother, who works a midnight shift as a nurse's aide, sat in the backyard discussing what to do.
Ms. Schott started listing all the places she had looked for an apartment.
"I know what you mean, sweets," said the mother. "You went clear over to Malvern looking."
They remembered when she moved into the trailer two years ago.
"There was an old smelly mattress, animal poop under the sink," said the daughter. "I hauled trash to Mom's and I paid for extra pick up. We painted it ourselves."
"We're a team," said the mother.
The trailer's interior had been dark blue, even the ceilings. "We painted everything white," said the daugther.
"Snow white," said the mother. "Kitchen took three coats."
One reason the trailer's owner flunked the housing authority's inspection last spring was problems with the water. "One day she had water," said the mother, "then two or three days, no water. She'd come over my house and bring a couple of gallons of water home."
'When she moved out of the trailer in early July her brother asked if she would be going back on welfare. "I can't," said Ms. Schott, who makes $4.90 an hour at the bakery. "Everyone says 'welfare' like you're low scum and I'm not."
"You're not," said the mother, "I know you're not."
But she can't spend the winter in the truck, either. For now she has no set plan, she is just thankful for the summer heat.
Living midway between Democratic Cleveland and Republican Columbus, the citizens of Canton, Ohio, and surrounding Stark County have a history of voting for the winning Presidiential candidate. As the November election approaches, this is the 18th article in a yearlong series that seeks to explore the forces shaping the political debate at the grass roots. (Previous articles are available to computer users on The New York Times on the Web, at http:// www.nytimes/specials/canton.)

HEADLINE: Tribe Is Now Wanted as a Resource

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: JOSEPH, Ore.

 BODY:
They saved Lewis and Clark from starvation, helped many an Oregon Trail straggler find the way west, and outfoxed the United States Army in battles that are studied by military historians to this day.
Yet for all their standing in the history books, the Nez Perce Indians have never been able to regain a foothold in the land they were forced from in 1877 -- an exile that led to one of the last major Indian wars in North America. 
But now, in a turn of history and uncommon fate, the people who live in the mountain valley that was taken from the Nez Perce want the Indians to return and are even assembling the financing to buy a large patch of real estate for them. They regard the return of the Nez Perce as a way to help replace the dying logging and ranching economy that was created as a justification for removing the Indians in the first place.
"They're opening the door for the trail home -- I never thought I'd see the day," said Earl (Taz) Conner, one of about 4,000 Nez Perce in North America. Mr. Conner is a direct descendant of Old Chief Joseph, for whom this town is named and whose burial site is a prime tourist attraction here in the Wallowa Valley, in northeastern Oregon. "It is really ironic, asking us Indians to return after booting us out of there in 1877."
These days, the people in the valley see the tribe as a potent economic resource. They hope to set aside land for an interpretive center they believe will be a tourist magnet, as well as a year-round cultural and camping site for the Nez Perce.
A remote, mountainous area, four hours of hard driving from the nearest city of any size, Wallowa County has suffered economically in the last decade as timber mills have shut down and cattle prices have plunged.
The Nez Perce have long since disappeared, leaving behind only a little cemetery at the foot of Wallowa Lake. Also known as the Sahaptin, they were given the name Nez Perce (meaning pierced nose) by the French because some of the Indians wore nose pendants.
Tourists from all over the world come to see the cemetery and the heart-stopping scenery. In Germany, where the fascination with American Indians knows few bounds, the Wallowa Valley may be as well known as Cooperstown is to American baseball fans.
Until now, among the ranchers and cowboys here, there has been ambivalence about the Indians who were driven out.
"I wouldn't call it guilt, but now that some of the old-timers here have fallen on hard times, they can appreciate a little better what happened to the Nez Perce," said Paul Henderson, the National Park Service coordinator for the Oregon end of the 1,100-mile Nez Perce National Historic Trail, which commemorates the 1877 war.
What has happened here has happened in other Western counties where Indian cultural events have become a big attraction. About 10 years ago, some Nez Perce Indians started to return for the annual rodeo here, setting up a powwow on nearby grounds. Before long, the powwows were attracting more people than the rodeo, which was named Chief Joseph Days.
In all the sorry history of American Indians, the Nez Perce story stands as a singular tale. This year, in Stephen E. Ambrose's best-selling book about Lewis and Clark -- "Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West" (Simon & Schuster) -- a new generation of Americans is learning about the tribe that saved the expedition known as the Corps of Discovery from starvation in 1805 and 1806.
For months, the explorers lived among the Nez Perce, marveling at their elaborate economy, their horse-breeding skills, their athleticism, their ability to prosper in the vast reaches of the Columbia River Plateau.
In part because of their longstanding good relations with the Federal Government dating to that expedition, in 1855 the Nez Perce were given official recognition of the land they lived on, about 13 million acres covering parts of what are now Oregon, Washington and Idaho. Included in that original treaty was the Wallowa Valley, where the Joseph band of the tribe had lived for centuries.
But trespassers inevitably came, as part of the gold rushes in the 1860's and 1870's; the treaty was broken; and by the 1870's, the Army ordered the Nez Perce out of the Wallowa region and onto a much smaller reservation in Idaho. Rather than be rounded up, the Wallowa band fled, led by Young Chief Joseph -- son of the older chief.
Their 1,600-mile march, with the military in pursuit, over several months was page-one news around the world -- with the Indians winning most of the battles.
"On our part, the war was in its origin and motive nothing short of a gigantic blunder and a crime," The New York Times wrote in 1877.
Finally, just short of the Canadian border in what is now Montana, where the tribe had hoped to be taken in by other Indians, the starving, freezing band of Nez Perce surrendered.
Some 250 Nez Perce warriors, joined by 500 women, children and old people, had fought with about 2,000 Army soldiers in 20 battles and skirmishes. Later, the Army estimated that a total of 151 Indians had been killed. It was, Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman said, "the most extraordinary of Indian wars."
Afterward, the Government scattered the Nez Perce all across the continent, from Canada to Oklahoma, but never allowed them to return to this valley. Young Joseph was buried in 1904 in the chalky volcanic soil of eastern Washington. He died, it was said, of a broken heart.
Though the Nez Perce made numerous appeals to the Government, and through the courts, to get their Wallowa Valley land back, they were rebuffed. The Government pointed to a revised treaty -- signed by some Nez Perce leaders in Idaho, but never signed by Joseph or his band -- as the legal basis for keeping the tribe out of Oregon.
Mr. Conner, whose great-grandfather Ollokot fought in the war, noticed a change in attitude a few years ago, as the Wallowa economy went into tailspin.
"I was working for the Forest Service, the only Indian walking around there, and I was approached by this economic development guy from the city of Wallowa," Mr. Conner recalled. "He said he thought the Indians could save this county. I had to laugh at that."
These days, tourists by the busload cannot get enough of the vanquished Joseph band, said Mr. Henderson, the Park Service coordinator.
"Joseph has become one of those transcendent figures in American history," he said. "There is just this huge interest. They come here, to the end of the road, and they see what Joseph was fighting for."
Down the road from Joseph, in the town of Wallowa, community leaders say the aura of the Nez Perce may be the No. 1 draw. Their visitor brochures now proclaim Wallowa as "Gateway to the Land of Chief Joseph," and the Nez Perce Powwow -- which is separate from the gathering in Joseph -- is now in its sixth year.
Seeing a chance for economic revitalization, the valley's community leaders have joined with the Indians to develop a big Nez Perce cultural and interpretive center. They obtained a $250,000 grant from an Oregon historical group, and plan to use the money to buy 160 acres atop a bluff not far from the river where the Nez Perce used to fish for salmon, just outside the town of Wallowa. They intend to begin a major fund-raising effort for the rest of the money, an amount yet to be determined, to build the center.
The Nez Perce, it turns out, have been something of a lost gem in this valley. "We're just a bunch of white folks -- we didn't have a clue at first," said Terry Crenshaw, one of the leaders behind the effort to build a cultural and interpretive center.
But the recent developments have a different meaning for Nez Perce like Soy Redthunder, a descendant of Joseph who lives on the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington State, where Young Joseph is buried.
"The whites may look at it as an economic plus, but we look at it as homecoming," Mr. Redthunder said.
He said the tribe would have to be very careful, given that anti-Indian sentiment still lingers in the valley. "I don't think we want to rush in there and take over the county," he said. "But I see a serious effort to return the Nez Perce people to the Wallowa Valley."
Until a few years ago, Mr. Red thunder said, he had always felt shunned here. "At their cowboy festival, they were highly indifferent to native people -- they considered us drunken Indians," he said.
Up in another part of this county, the Nez Perce are about to take possession of 10,000 acres along a creek where Young Joseph was born. This land is being bought by the Bonneville Power Administration, which sells electricity from the string of Federal dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Having destroyed the salmon runs on which the Indians used to depend, the dam operators are required by law to offer something in return.
In this case, they are buying Wallowa County land and turning it over to the Indians for management. No Indians will live there, but they will get hunting, fishing and management rights. It would be controlled by the band of Nez Perce living on the reservation in Idaho -- a group that has been separate from the Joseph band since 1860.
Standing near the Wallowa River, where generations of Nez Perce have long fished for the big chinook salmon and steelhead trout that make their way into the Oregon interior, Mr. Conner could scarcely believe the changes that are under way.
A Navy veteran, he has always felt that people in other parts of the world appreciated the Nez Perce more than people in his home in the Pacific Northwest.
"I was in Spain once," Mr. Conner recalled, "and this guy said to me, 'You're Indian, right? What are you, Sioux?' I told him I was Nez Perce, and his face lit up. He said, 'Nez Perce! Chief Joseph.' "
The return of the Nez Perce here, "would be a tremendous happening for our people," Mr. Conner said, adding, "We're pretty close to being home."

HEADLINE: Spanish Journalist Didn't Merit Post

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"A Chill in Spain" (editorial, July 15) presents only one side of the story of the dismissal of Spanish Television's New York bureau chief, Jose Martinez-Soler. 
 Mr. Martinez-Soler received his post during the previous Socialist government for no apparent professional merit. Before this he was director of a fledgling daily newspaper that failed. He was then given a program on Spanish state television that also failed. It was only after his predecessor in New York was dismissed that he was given that post.
Mr. Martinez-Soler lost all credibility among his peers long before the events to which you refer. His continued success under the Socialist government, despite repeated failure, earned him the nickname "rug of the regime."
You also repeat a suggestion too common in the United States news media, of Franco-era "anti-democratic practices" in Spain's political life. Franco died more than 20 years ago. Since then there have been peaceful, democratic elections for the national government.
The Franco legacy long ago gave way to Spain's more pressing concerns, like European Union membership, fiscal responsibility, education and double-digit unemployment.

HEADLINE: Olympics Stung By Technology's False Starts

BYLINE: By JERRY SCHWARTZ 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 21

 BODY:
Atlanta's Olympic organizers, who had promised the most technologically sophisticated Games ever, were scrambling today to repair their most basic information systems.
Two days into competition, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games was still unable to feed competition results to its own Internet site or to news agencies, preventing newspapers, radio and television from publishing and broadcasting up-to-date results. 
 The committee's much-promoted internal information system, "Info 96," was missing large blocks of data, including any warnings about the continuing troubles in the Olympic transportation systems.
Though they did not specify the problems, officials said most of the trouble occurred in computer networks developed by I.B.M., which had invested $80 million to be a worldwide Olympic sponsor and the lead "technology integrator" of this year's Games. I.B.M. also has agreements with the International Olympic Committee to be the lead technology sponsor for the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, and the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.
"These are start-up problems," Jeff Cross, a spokesman for I.B.M., said. "This is the largest sporting event in the world -- equivalent to a NASA space shot or two Super Bowls a day for 17 days. There are some legitimate start-up problems that people are working 24 hours a day to address."
Most of the technology problems seemed to be computer-related, but perhaps the most public failure was a 12-minute blackout at the Georgia Dome during Saturday night's first appearance by the American basketball "Dream Team." The Olympic committee said the problem was caused by a technician who pulled the wrong switch.
Olympic visitors also reported problems with telephone lines and cellular phones. Customers said that phone lines promised at Olympic venues were not always installed on time. Cellular service was spotty.
Robert R. Neal, director of technology for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, said the committee's principal difficulty was getting results from the 29 competition venues to I.B.M. mainframe computers. "We are looking at why the distribution is not 100 percent accurate," Mr. Neal said.
Even some results that were reported turned out to be inaccurate. One water polo score was reported in the Info 96 system as 12 to 7, but the individual goals listed in the same system added up to a score of 11 to 8.
Analysts said the computer difficulties could be a blow to I.B.M.'s plan to position itself as a major integrator of technology systems.
"It's an amazingly ambitious goal to provide all of this information in real time to the whole world," said Roger B. McNamee, principal of Integral Capital Partners, a technology management and investment firm in Menlo Park, Calif. "That said, dropping your shorts in front of the entire world is significantly more embarassing than doing it privately."
Andrew B. Whinston, professor of economics and computer science at the University of Texas, said the failure might complicate I.B.M.'s efforts to sell its Lotus Notes software, the backbone of the Atlanta results system, as an Internet tool and internal corporate data-base system.
"It's an extreme disaster for I.B.M. because they've been touting Lotus Notes as a solution for system integration and integration with the World Wide Web," he said. "They spent $20 million to $30 million in advertising and it has kind of exploded in their face. They've completely undone their arguments about Lotus Notes' abilities to interface with the outside world."
Late today, Olympic technology officials were organizing a manual results system that the ancient Greeks could appreciate. Results are to be transmitted by facsimile machines from outlying venues to a central office and distributed by runners.
American and international news agencies, which had been promised a sophisticated electronic results system fed directly from Olympic computers, said the system had failed. The agencies said they were forced to assign employees to watch the competitions on television and then type results into their systems.
"It is disappointing to know that what was billed as a state-of-the-art results service can't even produce bare scores in some cases," said Terry Taylor, the sports editor for The Associated Press.
The failure in the results system also led to a failure of the Olympic Internet site and a domino-effect failure of other Olympic World Wide Web pages dependent on the Atlanta committee for official results.
Olympic visitors also reported some problems with telephone lines and cellular phones. Customers said that phone lines promised at Olympic venues were not always installed on time. Cellular service was spotty.
The BellSouth Corporation, another Olympic sponsor, had said it would build a cellular phone system capable of handling all Olympic traffic. Still, some spectators at the opening ceremonies said they were not able to make or receive calls.
"The system is capable of handling 800 percent of normal capacity," a BellSouth spokeswoman said. "So far, we are only running at 200 percent of normal. If several hundred customers are near one cell site, it will be busy."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 24, 1996, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about technical difficulties at the Olympic Games misstated the nature of the computer-related problems in reporting results of the competitions. They did not involve I.B.M.'s Lotus Notes software. The company says it is investigating the cause of the problems.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Invitation To Murder

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Six months after Pan Am 103 and all aboard were blown up over Scotland in 1988, a commission appointed by President Reagan came to a specific central conclusion about defeating international terrorism and presented it in the first paragraph of its report:
"National will and the moral courage to exercise it are the ultimate means for defeating terrorism. The President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism recommends a more vigorous U.S. policy that not only pursues and punishes terrorists but also makes state sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their actions." 
 Now we watch or brood, mourning, knowing that we or those we love could have been on that sickeningly brief flight of T.W.A. 800, and died over Long Island -- if we were lucky enough to be dead before we hit the water. We do not know whether the 230 aboard went down murdered, as intelligence agencies tell the White House they believe, or through unprecedented accident. But we do know that whatever the truth, we ourselves will continue to be prey, meat for predators killing in the sky, a skyscraper in downtown New York, a community center in Buenos Aires or U.S. military housing in Saudi Arabia.
So this should be the moment to remember not only what the commission said, but that its point has never been fulfilled by the U.S. or its allies in the eight years and two Presidencies since then.
Nobody has been arrested for the slaughter of Pan Am 103, though the U.S. claims to know the names and addresses of Libyans it says planted the bomb.
The nasty fop who runs Libya still turns up at meetings of Arab leaders and still builds the world's biggest underground chemical weapons plant. Syria, the country that has the world's greatest collection of known terrorist camps, is honored by a visit of President Clinton. The only price its dictator has had to pay is to listen to hours of diplomatic wheedling from the American Secretary of State. We know the countries where the bombers of the World Trade Center were trained and financed, but not one has felt American retaliation.
And when we turn to our allies for help in containing Iran, terrorism's bank and quartermaster, they tell us we are interfering with their commercial interests.
For its sponsors and hosts, terrorism is the cheapest effective method of warfare. It can make a political giant out of an economic dwarf, force major countries to shift policies or to buckle and promote a local dictator into a world figure. But the "national will and moral courage" to fight it does not come cheap. In case there was any doubt, the commission, headed by Ann McLaughlin, spelled out what it would mean.
"While a law enforcement approach must always be a part of our response to terrorism, this commission finds unacceptable the idea of holding ourselves in all cases to a criminal standard of proof before we act. The U.S. must be ready to view some terrorist attacks as a matter of national security and indeed in some cases should be prepared to treat the act for what it is, an act of aggression against the U.S. A swift response could be directed against the terrorist group responsible and/or its state sponsor.
"The Commission recommends planning, training and equipping for direct pre-emptive or retaliatory action against known terrorist hideouts in countries that sanction them."
Since Pan Am, some improvements in airport security have been made but not the most important -- shifting responsibility to the government from the airlines who have to feed safety into profit-and-loss calculations. In any case, airport security without retaliation and punishment for terrorists and the countries that give them help and safe haven is like a criminal justice system without police, courts or jails -- an invitation to murder.
Every time there is a terrorist slaughter the West acts as if it was something new, or unrelated to those that came before or will follow. No price list exists for terrorists and sponsors, no action plan -- and none will come out of yet another "antiterrorism" conference of chickens and foxes.
Some day the democracies that defeated Communism and Fascism may have the national will and courage to confront terrorism where it is planted and nurtured. Until then we will remain prey, marching obediently to our assigned seat and role.

HEADLINE: Dole's California Hurdle

BYLINE: By Dan Schnur; Dan Schnur, a visiting instructor in politics at the University of California at Berkeley, served as communications director for Gov. Pete Wilson of California from 1991 through 1994.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
At the outset of the 1988 Presidential campaign, the Republican strategist Lee Atwater regularly pointed to California as his party's trump card. He knew George Bush could win a national election without the state's truckload of electoral votes, but recognized that for the Democrats it would be almost impossible. "They need it," he said. "So I want it."
Today, Lee Atwater is gone, and Bob Dole's troubles have his advisers pointing fingers and his allies heading for the tall grass. He is 27 points behind President Clinton in California, according to the latest Los Angeles Times poll. 
 To Republican operatives trapped inside the Beltway, the cultural distance from California may seem insurmountable. They see the millions of dollars needed to win this prize as a resource that could be better deployed in other battleground states. But such thinking represents the parochialism and risk aversion that cost the Republicans the White House in 1992. The Bush campaign folded its tent in California months before the election, effectively deserting Republican candidates across the state.
Californians' first prolonged exposure to Mr. Dole's campaign will come next month, at the Republican National Convention in San Diego. While the national television networks have substantially reduced their planned coverage, their California affiliates will go all out. Mr. Dole will likely be more visible in California that week than at any other point through the fall.
California's economy has just finished replacing the half-million jobs it lost in the recession of the early 1990's, and the memories of that experience remain fresh. Bill Clinton has done his best to feel California's pain. As President, he has visited the state 25 times, more often than Ronald Reagan did in his first term.
For Mr. Dole to compete effectively here, he must ignore the myth that candidates score points by bonding with the earring-and-Armani crowd in the Democratic enclaves of West Los Angeles and San Francisco. The voters he should speak to are farming in the Central Valley and struggling to meet house payments in Riverside and San Bernardino. They run small businesses in the high-tech environs of Silicon Valley and San Diego and raise families in the conservative bastions of Orange County and the North Coast.
Bob Dole doesn't need to turn up on "Melrose Place" to reach these voters. He needs to convince them that he understands the hardships they've endured and that he has an agenda to help make their lives better.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Concerns About Rates and Stock Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Falling stock prices in the United States and speculation that Japanese interest rates were headed higher pushed the dollar down against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday, currency traders said.
The dollar received a brief bit of encouragement overnight on remarks by the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer. He told the business daily Handelsblatt that he saw no reason the dollar should not return to its recent strength. The dollar was as high as $1.5488 marks in May. 
 Mr. Tietmeyer encouraged speculation on lower German interest rates by saying the Bundesbank would continue to check regularly whether monetary conditions would allow it to lower interest rates "a little."
News that the growth rate of the German money supply had fallen below 10 percent also encouraged talk that monetary policy might be eased at the Bundesbank's meeting on Thursday, the last before a monthlong summer recess.
But the dollar later reversed gains as stock market jitters reappeared in New York. The Dow Jones industrial ended the day with a loss of 35.88 points.
"People are looking at the stock market today and saying 'I can't buy dollars,' " said Gabriel Grippo, chief dealer at Credit Agricole.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.4850 German marks, down from 1.4865 marks on Friday. The dollar was also quoted at 107.44 Japanese yen, down from 107.95 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5505 from $1.5455.
Against the yen, the dollar gave ground on expectations that Japanese interest rates were headed higher and on bearishness linked to last week's news of a 13.2 percent widening in the United States trade gap for May.
Analysts expect that further deterioration in the trade deficit in the second half of 1996 will release a torrent of excess dollars into the currency market as Americans' demand for imports outstrips demand for American exports abroad.
"You have a turning trade picture," said Robert Fullem, assistant vice president at NatWest Bank P.L.C. "One that was looking very rosy is now looking fairly bleak."
Trading today is likely to be influenced by the release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic outlook.

HEADLINE: Courtship of U.S. Talent for Export

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE C. R. WHITE 

 BODY:
Even at its most virulent, the presumption that American culture -- with its movies, McDonald's and military might -- would dominate the rest of the world never pointed an accusatory finger at fashion. It has been the lot of American designers to be considered also-rans behind the chic French, the intellectual Japanese and those great apparel industrialists, the Italians.
It is Americans, however, who have now found themselves the favored consorts in a lusty international courtship for talent. Some of America's most gifted players, identified in the mid-1980's as its fashion heirs apparent, have entered contracts with European or Asian manufacturers to assist in the development of collections. 
 This demand, along with the difficulties that designers now face in securing investors to finance their businesses, has given rise to a new breed of American designers: those who are sculpturing careers from consultancies.
European designers have a long and lofty history of consulting. Gianni Versace, Giorgio Armani, Claude Montana and Romeo Gigli have all been consultants.
Until the late 1980's, designers like Anna Sui, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, Marc Jacobs, Randolph Duke and Rebecca Moses were content to turn out one central collection under his or her own name. But the economic downturns of the last decade and changing buying patterns have slowed the speed with which high-end companies can expand. Designers are now more willing to strike alliances with large concerns eager for input from the outside.
Interest in doing business this way rather than in investing millions of dollars in a designer's company is coming from manufacturers as well as retailers, both here and abroad.
Forced into the consultancy arena, designers are finding they rather like it. Selling a piece of one's business to an investor is one thing, but finding an investor who is compatible with one's vision and temperament is another.
"The whole concept of a cash cow, a backer, is obsolete," said Mr. Oldham, who is in the midst of a three-year consulting deal with Escada, the giant German company. "You would have better luck finding a dodo bird. It is and was a struggle, but every time I met with a potential backer, I could feel my allergies coming up."
When Onward Kashiyama, a Japanese company that in the last two decades has developed several licenses with European designers, wanted its own global brand, ICB, it turned to an American, Mr. Kors. He is the consulting designer for the collection, introduced in 1993.
"Worldwide, there's never been the interest in American fashion that there is today," Mr. Kors said. "The feeling 10 years ago was that the idea of a fast-paced life style was strictly an American problem."
In varied forms, sportswear dressing, an American invention, has recently infiltrated the style sensibility of countries as diverse as Japan, France and Nigeria. American sportswear ranges from Ralph Lauren's classic conservatism to hip-hop's on-the-edge street look.
"Because of CNN, MTV and the distribution of films, television and so on, different countries don't necessarily have distinct looks," said Ms. Sui, who consults on Cento X Cento, produced by Gilmar Spa, an Italian company. Gilmar also retained Mr. Jacobs as a consultant, for its Iceberg collection.
Three years ago, American designers, including well-known names like Calvin Klein, Donna Karan and Mr. Lauren, began staging runway collections in tents in Bryant Park, helping to raise the country's fashion profile around the world. Since then, hundreds of journalists and retailers have converged on the tents twice a year. The tents have also shone a spotlight on a new generation of designers -- in their 30's or early 40's.
When manufacturers look to American designers, they are invariably eyeing New York. All of these designers, though hailing from around the nation, were trained in New York, and New York is where they shaped their sensibility and -- with the exception of Ms. Moses, who now lives in Italy -- have their base.
"Living in a melting pot, it's very easy for me to go to Europe," Mr. Oldham said. "Certainly no place in the planet is like New York City. For total cross-culturalization and multi ethnicity, this is it."
The United States' predisposition to marketing has perhaps unwittingly aided the increased popularity of American designers.
"We have a very different approach to product," said Ms. Moses, who consults for Genny. "We don't make product just to exist, and this translates well. People now want an international appeal to their businesses. The style we were raised with is what's happening. I get calls all the time from people looking for English or American designers."
In choosing Ms. Sui and Mr. Jacobs as consultants for his collections, Paolo Gerani, a vice president of Gilmar, which is owned by the Gerani family, said that their American orientation was a decisive factor in their selection.
"The American designer right now is making a good interpretation of fashion today," he said. "Even Europe in many ways is looking to New York City as the center of energy."
Mr. Gerani has gone further in indicating his faith in American creativity, having introduced two licensed collections: Sui by Anna Sui and Marc Jacobs Look. But even though Mr. Gerani has said he is open to investing in these designers' companies in the future, he has stopped short of doing so.
In the 1980's, private investment money flowed into the coffers of companies like those owned by Ms. Moses and Mr. Duke, but the last 10 years have been joltingly difficult.
"The falloff of interest from backers tracks the retail situation," said Michael Mermey, a lawyer and business consultant specializing in fashion. "The young designers' only hope for survival is to create a critical mass of design projects so as to increase their visibility and to have positive cash flow."
Ms. Sui is following that path. In addition to her deal with Gilmar, she is developing a new beach-wear collection for spring 1997 for Domani, another Italian company. Capital can come in the form of cold cash or other resources like machinery and fabrics, she pointed out.
Robert Duffy, Mr. Jacobs's business partner, says consulting has been a life raft. Their company is also a consultant to Renown, which markets a collection in Asia designed by Mr. Jacobs, called Two: C.
It was through their consultations, encouraged by Mr. Versace, that Mr. Duffy and Mr. Jacobs were able to develop the Marc Jacobs Look line, which is produced by Gilmar and distributed in some Asian countries by Renown. "I know we could not have done it without consulting," Mr. Duffy said.
Barry Bryant, a senior director for equity research at Rodman & Renshaw, an investment firm, says that if sales continue to pick up, it will likely lead investors -- albeit more cautious ones -- back into the fashion business.
But indications are that designers themselves may prefer investors whom they have come to know through consulting. Mr. Oldham says he has had several casual conversations with Wolfgang Ley, the chairman of Escada, about investing in an Oldham franchise.
Designer-consultants could even give rise to a new breed of fashion broker, the designer's agent, Mr. Duke speculated.
Mr. Duke, who earlier this year became the design and creative director for Henri Bendel three days a week, has also done a collection for QVC and consults for Authentic Fitness and OAS, swimwear companies, after having ended an exclusive agreement with Anne Cole swimwear this spring.
"The emerging designers like me came along at a tenuous time," Mr. Duke said. "Little did we know we wouldn't be able to do it the way the mega-designers like Halston, Donna, Calvin and Ralph did in the 70's and 80's. There are changes at fashion's doorstep, and if designers are going to continue to evolve, we have to face them."

Treasury Prices End Day Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Treasury market ended lower yesterday as investors worried that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, might take a hawkish stance on inflation at his appearance today before Congress.
After Mr. Greenspan's appearance before a Senate committee on Thursday, Treasury prices rallied. The market seized on his comments that he expected economic growth to slow this year, which would forestall the need for higher interest rates. But Mr. Greenspan also indicated that the Fed might have to raise rates anyway, and it was this view that held sway in the market on Friday and yesterday. 
 "There's concern that Greenspan might change the tone of his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to make it more clear that the Fed is willing to tighten if the economy does not slow soon -- with 'soon' meaning by Aug. 20," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Kevin Flanagan, first vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said, "There's been talk that Greenspan was not happy with the market perception of his testimony and there's fear he might take a more hawkish stance."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to 87 13/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 7 percent from 6.98 percent.
"Today's action was really a set-up for Greenspan's testimony on Tuesday at 2 o'clock," said Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Government Securities Inc.
Mr. Greenspan heads to the House Banking subcommittee on banking and international monetary affairs for the second leg of his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony..
The Fed chairman's testimony comes as the market prepares to absorb a wave of new securities.
The Treasury will sell $18.75 billion in two-year notes today and plans to sell $12.5 billion in five-year notes tomorrow.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony comes at a delicate time, said Patrick Dimick, senior Treasury analyst with the CS First Boston Corporation.
"Do you think people will want to buy two-year notes when Greenspan will talk an hour after they are awarded?" Mr. Dimick said. "It's kind of a vulnerable position to be in."
At its regular weekly bill auction yesterday, The Treasury sold $27.0 billion in three- and six-month bills.
The bond market strengthened in morning trade on Monday but the bond market rally was capped when the stock market was able to contain its losses.
"Bonds started to turn lower when it became evident that the stock market wasn't going much lower today," Mr. Dimick said.
Dollar weakness also pressured the bond market, analysts said.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills yesterday:

HEADLINE: Home Ownership At 15-Year High

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Home ownership in the United States has reached a 15-year-high of 65.4 percent as buyers take advantage of good times and relatively low mortage rates, the Clinton Administration said today.
The ownership rate rose three-tenths of a percent in the second quarter, reflecting about 700,000 new homeowners in that period. 
 The Administration said that the improvement followed successful efforts to reduce the United States deficit, which has helped to keep interest at relatively low levels recently.
President Clinton's economic adviser, Laura Tyson, said, "Lower deficits, lower mortgage rates and higher job growth are a good recipe for higher homeownership rates."
The highest ownership rate was 65.8 percent, in 1980.

HEADLINE: ATLANTA: DAY 4;
It's Business as Usual, And Nobody Is Happy

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, JULY 22

 BODY:
For a lot of Atlanta businesses, the Olympics coming to town held out the promise of hordes of customers and tons of new business. But from the downtown Underground entertainment complex to nearby restaurants and malls, it isn't turning out to be Christmas in July.
Instead, business during the first few days of the Games has been slow to spotty. Among the few to cash in so far have been the city's taxi drivers, who had expected to be idled by the offer of free public transportation and shuttle buses, but have seen business pick up because of glitches and overcrowding on the city's public transportation system. 
 It has been an especially rude awakening for the operators of Underground, who decided early on to charge a $5 admission fee to the crowds of people they thought would be visiting its shops and restaurants. The fee, they said, would help not only to provide them an extra buck or so of profit, but also help pay for security.
But when people stayed away in droves on Friday, they lowered the admission price to $3 on Saturday. And when there were still so few people coming that Barbara Anderson, an Underground vendor, said "you could fire cannon down the main corridor without hitting anyone," Underground management dropped the admission on Sunday.
"We thought we were a value-added location with free entertainment and everything, but it turns out that that's not a big deal because other places, like the Centennial Olympic Park, are value-added too with entertainment and they are free of charge," said Martin D. Fortes, the vice president and general manager of the complex.
Anderson, who owns three pushcarts among the hundreds that line the cool brick corridors of the Underground complex, calls the original decision to charge admission "a bad management move." Since it was lifted, she said her business has picked up to what it normally is during July. But that is a far cry from what she and others had expected from the Games.
Rafih Benjelloun, who is a volunteer envoy for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, as well as chairman of the Atlanta Restaurant Marketing Association, is disappointed to the point of anger.
With business at his Imperial Fez Restaurant a quarter of what it usually is this time of year, Benjelloun says a lot of the city's restaurants are suffering because large corporations are relying on caterers to put on sumptuous receptions in tented pavilions, rather than booking local restaurants. But he also suspects that the attendance at the games has fallen way below the anticipated 3 million spectators.
"Right now we have more advanced reservations for Christmas and New Year's than we do for the Olympics," Benjelloun said, "and that's the case with most of the members of the association who had been expecting a lot of business."
He said the International Olympic Committee and the Atlanta committee ought "to tell people 'Please feel free to explore the town.' "
To be sure, Benjelloun and others worried that the experience of Los Angeles, Lillehammer and Barcelona suggested that they Olympics might not be quite the bonanza many envisioned, but the current situation was worse than they feared.
In some ways the city has been victimized by its own public relations, suggested Sam Massell, president of the Buckhead Coalition, a local business group.
During the months leading to the Games, business leaders and others were admonishing residents about the expected crowds, discouraging driving in town and encouraging people to take vacations and even leave town during the Games, making many apprehensive.
Last weekend Massell spent time on local radio trying to undo some of this.
A member of the Atlanta committee, Massell conceded that some of this was probably exaggerated by "design," as part of "a marketing strategy" to boost the Games.
One of the few groups showing some signs of optimism are the city's cab drivers who, in the buildup to the games, felt left out of the transportation mix with all the emphasis on pedestrian malls, closed streets, limited numbers of taxi stands, shuttle buses and free public transportation.
With problems on the public transportation network, Chukwura Chambers, a driver stationed outside of the Westin Hotel sidled up to a party of five, who were debating whether to take mass transit.
He reminded them of the reports of crowding and delays, gave them an estimate of the cost of the trip -- and won a fare.
"He's a good salesman," said one of the party, Edwin Uchtman of St. Louis, explaining why he decided to take the cab.
Such adjustments are coming hard to many here who thought that everything would pretty much sell itself in Atlanta this summer. After weak attendance over the weekend, promoters of concerts at the downtown Rialto Center for the Performing Arts today started previewing acts in free street performances, and handing out advertising fliers in a downtown office plaza.
"There are so many messages out there, so many options," said Don Payne, the promoter for a concert by the South African band Inthsholo, "that we had to turn salesman and bring it to the street.
"There was this expectation that the streets would be shoulder-to-shoulder people, and it hasn't worked out that way."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Potential Running Mates: Down to About a Dozen

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Bob Dole has narrowed his list of potential running mates to about a dozen names, a group dominated by governors, officials familiar with the process said today.
The officials, speaking on the condition that they not be identified, emphasized that Mr. Dole was far along in the selection process and that every person on the list is a serious contender. Each of these candidates has now received detailed questionnaires -- seeking information on medical, financial and biographical background -- and at least two have already been interviewed by Roderick DeArment, a lawyer on the search team. 
 Govs. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Jim Edgar of Illinois were interviewed late last week by Mr. DeArment, the officials said. Two other Midwest Governors, John Engler of Michigan and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, were also being interviewed, the officials said, adding that those sessions were delayed because of Mr. Dole's visits to Ohio and Michigan late last week and back to Michigan and Kansas today.
Three others who have been sent questionnaires by Mr. Dole's search team are Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania; former Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Dan Lungren, the California Attorney General.
"The people being interviewed are serious candidates," said one of the officials. "The universe has been circled. Now it's a question of being winnowed down."
Mr. Edgar and Mr. Ridge stand out from the other governors mentioned because of their support for abortion rights. But Mr. Dole said earlier this month that he could accept a running mate who backed abortion rights. The officials said the remainder of the list included some governors, but would not say whether Gov. Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey was among them. One official said that "they are people you would know" and no particular surprises.
Dole campaign officials said that the plan now -- assuming that the name of the candidate does not leak out sooner -- is for Mr. Dole to announce his choice on the Friday before the party's national convention, which opens in San Diego on Aug. 12. One campaign official said Mr. Dole is considering announcing his choice of running mate in his hometown of Russell, Kan.
Mr. Dole returned to Russell today, as he often does on his special occasions, to celebrate his 73d birthday. It was a day of celebration that started here in the capital, where Mr. Dole brought gifts to a "reverse birthday party" at a community center for senior citizens before flying to Michigan and on to Kansas.
Campaign officials said Mr. Dole was leaving this stage of the search for a running mate to his staff, and that the candidate himself would probably only interview his final three choices.
The officials said it was not beyond the realm of possibility that, at the last minute, Mr. Dole would add a name or two to the list, including Colin L. Powell, although they say they are virtually certain that the retired general would not accept an offer.
But those familiar with the process also cited once talked-about candidates who are not on the list. They include Gov. Pete Wilson of California; James A. Baker 3d, a former Secretary of State; and Dick Cheney, a former Defense Secretary. Officials said Mr. Cheney was disqualified because of his history of heart problems.
As campaign officials ground through the details of the search process, Mr. Dole and his wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who turns 60 next Monday, arrived at the community center with three dozen gifts, including toaster ovens, blenders and a lamp, all of which had been requested by the recipients, many of whom the Doles have known during their decade-long association with the center, Sarah's Circle.
Mr. Dole, who retired, last month after 35 years in Congress to devote himself full time to running for President, also presented Sarah's Circle, which provides housing and community programs to low-income senior citizens, with his first month's pension check -- for $6,650. The former Senator could receive a pension as high as $107,000 a year and has said he would donate it to different charities. This was his first presentation.
Mr. Dole said that his wife had given him a CD player that played seven disks "so I can listen to my Johnny Mathis records."
Asked how it felt to be 73, Mr. Dole told reporters at Sarah's Circle, "You always feel a little older in the morning. By noon I'll feel about 55."
Mr. and Mrs. Dole have been involved with Sarah's Circle, located in an ethnically mixed neighborhood close to downtown Washington, since they hosted a Thanksgiving dinner there in 1986. Today, Mr. Dole's daughter, Robin, accompanied them and they brought their dog, Leader, as well.
With Mr. Dole's age a potential liability to his candidacy -- he would be the oldest person elected to a first term as President -- the Dole campaign confronted the inevitable head on.
"I don't think age is a negative for us," said Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's press secretary, explaining the backdrop of senior citizens and noting that Mr. Dole's doctors say he is in excellent health. "Health answers age, and Bob Dole has been completely forthcoming with his medical records," Mr. Warfield said. "Bob Dole has released his comprehensive medical history going back to the 1940's, while Bill Clinton has released only summaries."
The couple continued their birthday celebration throughout the day, flying on a campaign plane strewn with blue, red and yellow streamers, party hats and noisemakers.
They left Washington for Dearborn, Mich., where Mr. Dole participated in an economic forum with Govs. Engler, Voinovich and Thompson, each of whom boasted of what they had done for their local economies, as if auditioning for Mr. Dole.
The Doles then continued their celebration in Russell, where they joined in an old-fashioned ice cream social, complete with pony rides.
Arriving in Russell this evening, Mr. Dole told a crowd of about 300 people in a local park: "My first call this morning was from Senator Strom Thurmond. He's 94. He thinks I'm a little young to be running for President, and he wants to be my running mate."

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Their Decline, Heightening Investor Concern

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
The relief investors felt last week was short-lived as stocks declined yesterday for the second consecutive trading session, heightening concerns that the worst may not be over.
The latest losses, among big and small stocks alike, continued to erase many of the gains that took place toward the end of last week and suggested no end in sight to the market's recent volatility. 
 Stocks of small companies, especially in technology, were hardest hit. The Nasdaq composite index, which consists of many of these companies, tumbled 16.29 points, or 1.5 percent. While the index closed at 1,081.39, well above its lows of last week, it remains down almost 14 percent from its high in early June.
The selling also spread to blue chip stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average, for example, shed 35.88 points, or about seven-tenths of a percent, to 5,390.94. The index fell by more than 50 points twice during the day.
Investors seemed particularly concerned about the possibility that individuals, who have been one of the primary forces behind the surge in stock prices over the last five years, had lost their enormous appetite for mutual funds.
"If you look at how the market has behaved this year, especially small-cap or aggressive growth stocks, it's been very much of a liquidity-driven bull market," said William B. Keithler, a portfolio manager for Berger Associates in Denver. The recent fall-off in the amount of money individuals have been pouring into stock funds "has people spooked," he said.
Without the rush of money into stock funds like aggressive growth funds, which have tended to be big buyers of technology and small-company stocks, investors are paying more attention to earnings and stock prices and are not finding much to like. They continue to be anxious over the outlook for corporate profits, especially in technology, which is suffering from a combination of summer doldrums and a recent spate of disappointing announcements by leading technology companies like Hewlett-Packard and Motorola. While stock prices have fallen, many stocks continue to trade at expensive levels.
"Nasdaq is under a lot of pressure," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist for Salomon Brothers. "Most folks are not done selling."
While many market analysts contend it is too early to tell whether individuals are abandoning the market in any meaningful way, recent reports suggesting the clamoring for stocks is dying have increased the fear that good times may be over. Liquidity Trim Tabs, a newsletter in Santa Rosa, Calif., is estimating that investors pulled out about $2 billion in stock funds from Tuesday through Thursday last week.
Anecdotal evidence from some of the major fund companies, however, suggests that many investors, encouraged by the short rally last week, were putting money into mutual funds by the end of the week. The Montgomery Funds in San Francisco, for example, said there were more purchases than redemptions by Friday. At T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, investors began to put money into funds Thursday and Friday, and the complex ended the week with a "very modest net outflow," according to Steven E. Norwitz, a spokesman. The Vanguard Group ended the week with positive net inflows.
And some analysts argued there was little evidence individuals were bailing out. "I think it is very premature and presumptuous to assume that individuals have stopped their love affair with stocks," said Alfred Goldman, chief strategist for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "Despite the stealth bear market in 1994, individuals continued to be buyers."
Mr. Shulman of Salomon agreed. "One week does not make a trend," he said. While mutual fund flows will slow in the second half of the year, compared to a strong first quarter, he predicted they would still represent the best second half in history.
But even if individuals are eager to put their money into mutual funds, investors are still likely to have a hang-dog expression for the remainder of the summer. Any slowdown in the economy is likely to crimp earnings, said Arthur A. Micheletti, the chief investment strategist for Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser in San Mateo, Calif.
Investors are also concerned that the Federal Reserve will eventually raise interest rates, despite their initial enthusiasm last week over the remarks of Alan Greenspan, the chairman. "I think we'll go through this for the next several months: will they or won't they?" said Mr. Micheletti, who predicted continuing volatility.
The forecast for the technology sector, which had led much of the rally earlier in the year, is not much sunnier. Market analysts say it is likely to remain in its slump until well after Labor Day.
"I think we're seeing the summer correction that we have not seen for two years," said Michael Carmen, the manager of the Montgomery Small Cap Opportunities Fund, who noted that the traditional seasonal slowdown seemed even worse this year compared with last year because of the introduction of Windows 95, which helped technology stocks during last year's dog days.
And some managers have been reluctant to start buying just yet. "It hasn't been as easy to pick off bargains as you might think or might like," Mr. Keithler of Berger Associates said. Unable to find stocks at good valuations, he has allowed cash in his fund to rise, he said.
Even Mr. Carmen, who described himself as a "net buyer of good stocks," agreed that some stocks continued to be too expensive for his tastes. But while he said he thought that the correction in small stocks was not yet over, he has been finding some stocks to buy. "It lets you coil the spring for the bounce back," he said.
The market decline hurt a broad variety of stocks, including those in companies reporting strong earnings. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks by 1,770 to 649 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sears, Roebuck, which had exceeded analysts' earnings estimates when it reported its results last Thursday, fell 1 5/8 yesterday to 42 1/2. Mobil, which announced higher earnings yesterday, also fell 3/8, to 114 3/4.
Among the technology stocks battered yesterday was Microsoft, despite talk on Wall Street that the software giant would announce solid profits. The stock fell 1 1/4 to close at 119 3/4 before the company reported earnings of 87 cents a share, exceeding Wall Street estimates. Other technology stocks that suffered were Iomega, one of the year's technology high fliers, which fell 2 5/8 to close at 19 7/8, and Cisco Systems, which fell 1 3/8, to 50 5/8.

HEADLINE: Bankers Trust to Pay $210 Million for Wolfensohn

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The Bankers Trust New York Corporation disclosed today that it would pay about $210 million in cash and stock to acquire Wolfensohn & Company. The price was higher than analysts had speculated.
Bankers Trust announced the acquisition of the New York-based investment bank in May, hoping to strengthen the bank's investment banking business and profit from Wolfensohn's ties to some of the best known companies in the world. The purchase price was not disclosed then, and analysts estimated Bankers Trust would pay roughly $150 million. 
 The higher-than-expected purchase price shows how much the bank was willing to pay for contacts in the world of corporate mergers developed by Wolfensohn's partners, who include the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker.
Bankers Trust is buying a firm with 10 partners and 55 bankers that worked on $37.4 billion in acquisitions last year.
Bankers Trust is giving Wolfensohn's partners a powerful voice in the entire bank, making Mr. Volcker a director and putting three other partners on its operating committee.
All but $7 million of the purchase price consists of 2.88 million shares of Bankers Trust common stock, valued at $202.89 million, which will go to the firm's partners, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm's partners include Mr. Volcker, Raymond Golden, Glen Lewy and James Wolfensohn, who left the firm last year to become president of the World Bank.
Bankers Trust also said in a separate statement that the acquisition had won Federal Reserve approval.

HEADLINE: Suburbia Can't Kick the Nozzle;
As Gas Guzzling Becomes a Way of Life, Oil Imports Soar

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: CLIFTON PARK, N.Y.

 BODY:
Like most residents of this fast-growing bedroom community 20 miles north of Albany, Janet Mulvey cannot do anything away from home without first hopping into one of the cars in her driveway.
To deliver her son to preschool, to buy new window shades or pick up the dry cleaning -- not to mention doing her job as a roving children's speech therapist for adjacent Schenectady County -- Ms. Mulvey has to slide behind the wheel of her 1991 Toyota Landcruiser and negotiate the winding roads out of her housing development past all the other four- and five-bedroom homes. And her husband, Martin, who sells extended warranty programs to car dealers, burns up even more miles in his 1994 Toyota Camry. Both carry cellular phones and laptop computers wherever they go, turning their vehicles into instant mobile offices. 
 "There's no way to do anything about it," Ms. Mulvey said of the 1,200-plus miles a week the couple often put in behind the wheel. A car is, simply, "independence," she said, and maneuvering her huge, four-wheel-drive vehicle from mall to mall and drive-through window to drive-through window is "my village."
This is America, two decades after the oil crises of the 1970's that left a suburbanized nation shell-shocked at its utter dependence on imported petroleum. According to figures released this month, the United States is more reliant on oil imports than at any time since 1977 -- and it is hard to find many people who seem to care.
Briefly this spring, a spike in gasoline prices reminded Americans of the potential costs of their suburban life style. And the bombing of a housing complex for American, British and French troops in Saudi Arabia last month brought home the vulnerability of the United States' foreign supplies.
But as the Mulveys and their neighbors in Clifton Park show, day-to-day worry about foreign oil supplies, and accompanying acts of conservation, have slid out of most Americans' consciousness, while the need for that oil is embedded even more deeply into their lives.
"The availability and the price of gasoline are no longer even on people's radar screens," said Cheryl Trench, executive vice present of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in Manhattan. "What people want is comfort, safety and the convenience of being able to cart the entire football team around town."
In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo that led to long lines at the pumps, the United States imported nearly 35 percent of its oil. It dropped that figure to 28 percent in 1982. But today, with the economy booming and shortages a fading memory, the country has reverted to its old ways. Daily oil consumption in the first half of this year has risen above 18 million barrels for the first time since 1979, and imports have surged to 8.3 million barrels, or 46.3 percent of the total, a near record.
Even so, with gasoline cheaper than it was in the 1950's after adjusting for inflation, Americans are embracing gas-guzzling vans, pickup trucks and utility vehicles with a vengeance.
And if the Mulveys are any indication of the national mood, it will take nothing short of another oil crisis to jog Americans out of their complacency.
"My job depends on travel to meetings," declared Mr. Mulvey, the general agent for Upstate New York for Automotive Professionals Inc., a company that supplies new-car dealers with vehicle-service agreements underwritten by the Travelers Insurance Companies. "It's not negotiable," he added matter-of-factly. "I have to be there." Mr. Mulvey calculated that he drove an average of 150 miles a day, and sometimes covered 500 miles.
Janet Mulvey is no less dogmatic. "I have to drive, no matter what it costs," she said in an interview in the office she has set up in the couple's huge four-bedroom house in the Olde Dater Farm Development that was carved a few years ago out of the countryside.
When she is on the job, Ms. Mulvey says, she always eats and drinks in her car. She buys gasoline only at Mobil stations because they have a wide assortment of snacks -- and clean restrooms. "There are no restrooms on this job; I rely on gas stations and fast-food restaurants," she says somewhat ruefully.
She says she drives about 40 miles a day when she is working; last week, she took maternity leave from her job to prepare for the birth of her second child next month.
Mrs. Mulvey said that even modest attempts to form school car pools broke down in her neighborhood over people's unwillingness to bend to the schedules of others. Asked if public transportation is available in her town, she replies, "Not that I know of." (In fact, there are commuter buses to Albany, but there is no local service within Clifton Park.)
But the people who live here did not come for the public transportation; they came for the housing. Where else could they afford such big houses, situated on half-acre and one-acre lots and crammed with all the energy-driven conveniences and comforts that the 1990's have to offer?
The Niagara Mohawk Power Company says that a growing number of new homes in the area it serves, including Clifton Park, have central air-conditioning and features like outdoor lighting, saunas, and Jacuzzis and swimming pools. Indeed, Clifton Park epitomizes the life style that America began embracing four decades ago, as interstate highways spread across the farm and woodlands that were carved into the suburbs and the more distant exurbs of the modern metropolis.
So no matter where they are going, the residents of Clifton Park have to drive. Many of the main streets lack sidewalks, and walking or biking along them them is a dangerous proposition with traffic zooming along at 50 or 60 miles an hour. As a result, parents must drive their children everywhere -- and often buy them cars as soon as they reach 16, the age at which they can take driving lessons.
"All my friends have cars," said Claire F. Tosti, 17, as she sat sipping cappuccino with her friend Brianne Kellog, also 17, at Persnickety's in the Village Shopping Center. "You can't even ride a bike to from one development to another." Ms. Tosti had picked up Ms. Kellog at her home in her Dodge Omni and driven to another mall for a movie before coming here. Driving, Miss Kellog added, "is the only way to see your friends.
With gasoline costing less than $1.50 a gallon in much of the country, fuel efficiency is usually low on the list of car shoppers' concerns. As they closed a deal at Clifton Park Dodgeworld recently to buy a Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT Club Cab, a hulking pickup truck whose interior has the look and feel of a luxury car, Vern Huestis and his wife, Michele, were thinking mostly about power and carrying capacity, not energy independence. The sticker announced that the vehicle would get 11 miles a gallon in the city and 15 miles on the open highway, but the low ratings did not bother Mr. Huestis.
"I'm not worried about gas being shut off," he said, explaining that comfort and the ability to haul heavy gear for his job as a field-training leader for the Army National Guard, were his main considerations.
Likewise, his wife chose her Plymouth Voyager mini-van because it has the room to hold the dispensing machines and boxes of chewing gum that she hauls around as a service representative for the Ford Gum Machine Company.
"I'm self-employed," said Mrs. Huestis, who drives 200 to 300 miles a day, three days a week, sometimes going as far as Worcester, Mass., to call on her customers. "I have no choice but to drive something that has the space I need."
Such attitudes are music to the ears of David Reali, the general sales manager at Clifton Park Dodgeworld. "Today's customers pick their vehicles more for life style and work, rather than just for transportation," Mr. Reali said. "They need tremendous flexibility to carry computer equipment, golf balls, kids and adults. Mini-vans are my largest sellers."
But whereas Americans in the early 1980's pursued a course of almost fanatical energy conservation, in the 1990's even the experts tend to take a relaxed view of things. Ms. Trench of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, for example, says that the current situation "is certainly not a cause for alarm."
After all, Ms. Trench says, the oil industry, using a "panoply of new technologies," has shown how "stunningly responsive" it can be to shortages as they develop. "We don't need to fear dependence on imports," she says flatly. "It really is a different period, and a different market."
Similarly, Martin P. Meyers, associate director specializing in refined products at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Massachusetts, saw little need for worry about America's energy-consuming habits. Gasoline use is up less than 1 percent so far this year, he notes, even while the economy is humming along, and demographic trends -- more older people driving few miles -- suggest it will not increase sharply anytime soon.
And, he adds, "while there are more mini-vans on the road, even mini-vans are getting better mileage than they used to."

Naim Suleymanoglu became the first weight lifter in history to win three gold medals, and he also set a world record, in the 141-pound competition today at the Summer Games.
Suleymanoglu, known to the world as Pocket Hercules, won in one of the most dramatic confrontations possible as he and his closest rival, Valerios Leonidis of Greece, traded three straight world-record lifts. 
 Not quite 5 feet tall, Suleymanoglu snatched 324 1/2 pounds and then raised 413 3/4 in the clean-and-jerk for a total of 738 1/4. Leonidis failed in his final attempt for the gold medal, but did set his own world record in the clean-and-jerk in his next-to-last lift.
When Suleymanoglu was in New York three months ago, he was asked who his biggest competition would be. He said, in two of the few words he used in English, "the Greek."
He was right about that. Leonidis matched him right up to the final attempt today in a competition that had the joint rocking.
The championship was held in the cavernous basement of the Georgia World Congress Center, an exhibition hall hard by the Georgia Dome. It had three distinct advantages -- it was air-conditioned, there was excellent rock music blasted over the sound system and it was underground, with no exposure to the tacky tents and trailers and the offensive food smells just outside near Centennial Park.
The two Greek weight lifters had a large cheering section, and they played to the crowd, particularly Yorgos Tzelilis, who alternately pounded his chest and waved his palms toward the heavens, asking for more cheers.
The first half of the competition was the snatch, in which the bar is raised from the floor to the overhead position in one motion. The lower-rated lifters risked hernias and falling bars first, and then the favorites took over.
Leonidis went first and lifted 308 pounds. At 4:45 P.M., Suleymanoglu strode to the floor and lifted 319 pounds. At 4:50 P.M., Leonidis came back and lifted 319. At 4:56 P.M., Suleymanoglu came back and tried 324 1/2 pounds but never got it above his waist and dropped it, almost daintily.
At 4:59 P.M., Leonidis could not raise 324 1/2 pounds but he was still ahead of Suleymanoglu because of his lower body weight, nearly a pound and a half less.
At 5 P.M., Suleymanoglu raised 324 1/2 pounds, held it and then dropped the bar before raising his two fists nearly shoulder high, an extravagant gesture for him. He had the lead halfway through.
The second half was the clean-and-jerk, which involves two motions, one to the shoulders and then overhead. Again, the bottom half of the draw went first.
At 5:45 P.M., Suleymanoglu, with little emotion or extra motion, lifted 396 pounds. At 5:48 P.M., Leonidis equaled him.
Then two announcements were made: Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, was present, and Suleymanoglu would try to raise 407 pounds, which would be a world record.
Suleymanoglu came out and promptly set the world record, then pointed to himself and made an economic wave to his Turkish followers, waving their flags on the the left side.
Leonidis came back and lifted 413 3/4 pounds for another world-record lift -- temporarily. Then Suleymanoglu tried the same weight. He faltered once, then locked the weight above his head. He dropped the weight, threw two punches in the air with chalk flying and strode off the floor. He was ahead again, but Leonidis still had the world record in the clean-and-jerk because of his lower weight.
Now Leonidis had one more try for the gold medal and the overall world record. At 5:58 P.M. he went for 418 pounds. He raised the weight no farther than his waist, but quickly let it drop. With one wave, he walked down the step and disappeared down the runway. "At the moment, I feel the most worthy person won," Leonidis said later.
Suleymanoglu said he believed the gold medal would depend "on the most numbers of misses. He missed twice and I missed once."
This is the third time the world has turned on the television and discovered Naim Suleymanoglu. He was born into the huge Turkish community in Bulgaria and came up through the Bulgarian youth programs. He was not allowed to participate in the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles because of the Soviet Union's reprisal boycott, and then the Bulgarians began a repressive drive against the Turks.
He resisted the impulse to defect until 1985, when he was forced to accept a Bulgarian name, Naum Shalamanov.
He won a few championships under his new name, but in December 1986 he slipped out the back during a meet in Melbourne, Australia. He and his family were reunited in Turkey, where he was almost immediately a celebrity.
Turkey paid $1 million to Bulgaria to facilitate Suleymanoglu's changing citizenship in 1988 in time for him to be eligible for the Summer Games. He beat all the Soviet bloc lifters, which he did in 1988 at Seoul, lifting 755 pounds, while two of Bulgaria's lifters were disqualified after testing positive for diuretics.
Suleymanoglu became a national hero in Turkey. He retired for a while, but came back with no political fury, and lifted 705 pounds for another gold medal at the Barcelona Games.
Now he has accumulated 46 world records and 232 gold medals, including three Olympic championships.
"This is a hobby of mine, and I love it," he said. "But it is also true that the people of Turkey want me to win, so I do it for them."
Today he was asked if he was the greatest lifter in history, and he said people would have to make that judgment for themselves.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. WILL DELAY MONEY TO RUSSIA OVER TAX PROBLEM

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Citing the Yeltsin Government's problems with tax collection, the International Monetary Fund said today that it would delay its $330 million payment to Russia this month for the first time.
When Russia was granted a $10.2 billion three-year loan in February, the Fund set particularly stringent conditions, including monthly reviews of Russia's economic status. 
 The problem came to light several days after Russian officials said they would ask for an easing of some terms of the loan. It emerged less than three weeks after President Boris N. Yeltsin won re-election over a resurgent Communist Party. His victory was attributed in part to his widespread spending promises during the campaign that seemed to undermine his commitment to bring the nation's budget deficit and inflation under control.
American and I.M.F. officials said Russian expenditures had remained more or less on target despite Mr. Yeltsin's spending promises, and the auditors agreed to the monthly disbursements throughout the presidential race this spring.
But they said cash receipts from taxes were running well below projections, in part because some companies had refused to pay taxes until they were sure the Communists would not win the election.
Officials said that they were still struggling to get a clear sense of the scale of the problem, and that they were working with the Russians on plans to improve collection and possibly to levy new taxes to raise revenues quickly.
Withholding the loan disbursement should not have any direct impact on Russia's economy. But if the problem is not resolved next month, when a more intensive review of Russia's performance is scheduled, it could hamper the program of support for Russia's bumpy transition to capitalism. Even this one-month delay could unnerve foreign investors, who had earlier been scared off by the prospect of a Communist victory.
The officials said that they expected Russia to act swiftly to rectify the problem, and that the disbursement could be made within weeks.
"What we will most likely have is a delay, then a catch-up," said Stanley Fischer, the I.M.F.'s deputy managing director, who met with Russian officials in Moscow last week. "We don't think we will miss a disbursement if things go according to plan."
Officials of the United States and of the fund said that the tax difficulties should not be a harbinger of any broader troubles, and that despite the delay in the disbursement, there had been progress by Mr. Yeltsin's Government in stabilizing the economy.
"They've brought inflation down more than we expected," Mr. Fischer said. "They've kept the ruble stable despite the election. If they've done all that while not quite meeting all our numbers, our numbers might have been a little tougher than they needed to be."
Russia has prided itself on meeting all of the fund's strict requirements, both for the current loan and for a $6.4 billion loan that was disbursed starting in the spring of 1995.
But the review for July, which was conducted in Moscow over the last week, ended with the fund's team saying it could not complete its work because it could not get all the information it needed. Without a completed review, the monthly payment cannot be released.
The Interfax news agency reported today that tax revenues in the first half of the year were 12 percent below expectations. It was unclear whether the figure included tax "offsets" by which some companies are receiving credit for paying bills owed by the Government to other companies in the form of products and materials. Offsets have accounted for a substantial part of the tax revenues, but because they cannot be spent, they do not have as much value as cash receipts.
Although American and fund officials gave a hopeful interpretation today to the need for a delay, some of the same officials have acknowledged being concerned in recent months as Mr. Yeltsin has stretched his economic resources seemingly to their limit. Last month Mr. Yeltsin ordered the Central Bank to transfer $1 billion to the federal budget to help pay for his campaign pledges, although the Central Bank later tightened credit to offset the inflationary consequences of the move.
The Yeltsin Government, having won re-election, has also begun trying to woo back foreign investors. Today Moscow agreed to give foreign investors wider access to the market for government bonds.
The tax system in Russia has always been one of the nation's biggest problems. Not only are there problems with collection, but also frequent changes in the tax code and the often arbitrary way it is enforced have discouraged many foreign companies from establishing operations in Russia.

HEADLINE: 3 Top Pataki Aides Were Paid by Inaugural Fund

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 22

 BODY:
Three top advisers to Gov. George E. Pataki said today that they had each received payments of at least $20,000 from a fund created from private donations to finance Mr. Pataki's inauguration and transition.
The advisers are Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications; Michael C. Finnegan, the Governor's counsel, and John O'Mara, the chairman of the State Public Service Commission. They said the money was for the work they did helping Mr. Pataki set up a new administration immediately after he defeated Mario M. Cuomo in November 1994. 
 Today's disclosures were among the clearest accountings yet of how the secret inaugural fund, which has been the subject of an Assembly investigation and a court battle, spent its money. Democrats have estimated that the fund raised $1.4 million, but Mr. Pataki's aides say the figure is closer to $1 million.
Ms. Mucha said she received between $20,000 and $30,000. Mr. O'Mara said he received $25,000 and Mr. Finnegan said he got about $45,000.
Financial disclosure forms filed with the State Ethics Commission also showed that at least six other members of the Pataki administration had been paid salaries or reimbursed for personal expenses by the transition and inaugural fund, though it was unclear how much they had received.
Democrats and government watchdog groups questioned the payments today, saying that the state's top policy makers should not have taken money from a fund financed largely by corporations and individuals who are regulated by state agencies or have state contracts.
"You don't want people holding important government positions to be paid by people who are then going to depend on the favors and decision-making of these recipients," said Senator Franz S. Leichter, a Manhattan Democrat. "It represents a real conflict."
But Ms. Mucha said that none of the people who received money from the fund knew who had contributed to it, and therefore could not have been influenced.
"People were doing a job," she said. "They were working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, trying to put a transition together, trying to organize an inauguration, putting together a government. No one was interested in who was contributing, no one had access to the names of contributors. And for people to make something out of nothing is preposterous."
Soon after the fund was created in late 1994, the Pataki administration promised to release detailed information about the names of contributors, the size of their donations and how the money was used.
But despite those pledges, the Governor's allies who controlled the fund refused to release the financial records last November, saying they did not want the Governor to know who had contributed to it, for ethical reasons -- even though Mr. Pataki had met many of the contributors at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raiser in Manhattan and many of the donors' names were printed on programs distributed at the inauguration.
After that refusal, the Democratic leadership of the Assembly launched an investigation, issuing subpoenas for the financial records from the two private corporations that controlled the fund. Mr. Pataki's supporters challenged those subpoenas in court, but lost in a decision released last week. Lawyers for the fund said today that they expected to release some of the financial records this week.
Ms. Mucha said she was paid between $20,000 and $30,000 -- she said she could not recall the exact amount -- for working full-time for the transition between the election on Nov. 7, 1994, and Jan. 1, 1995, when Mr. Pataki took office. She said the payments also compensated her for having lost five weeks in vacation time she had accumulated while working for Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato before joining Mr. Pataki's campaign.
"I was compensated for my work and for what they felt I would be losing by not going back to the Senate," she said.
Mr. Finnegan said his $45,000 payment was for his work directing Mr. Pataki's transition team, a job he said consumed all his time for seven weeks. Mr. Finnegan's former law partner, Stephen J. Mignano, also was paid about $25,000 from the fund for "professional services," said H. Neal Conolly, a lawyer for the fund. Mr. Finnegan said he did not know what that payment was for, and Mr. Mignano did not return phone calls.
Though a spokesman, Mr. O'Mara, who is the state's chief regulator of the electric and natural gas industry, said that his $25,000 payment compensated him for quitting his law job and working full time on Mr. Pataki's transition between November 1994 and mid-February 1995.
Robert E. Boyle, who was the fund's treasurer before being appointed by Mr. Pataki as president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, received at least $10,000 from the fund in 1995, Mr. Conolly said.
Several other top Pataki advisers have reported receiving payments of at least $1,000 from the fund in their annual ethics reports to the state. Those officials included Health Commissioner Barbara A. DeBuono; Bradford J. Race, Jr., Mr. Pataki's chief of staff, and three top officials at the state Department of Economic Development, Caroline Quartararo, Robert Ryan and Carolyn Bachan. The ethics reports did not require the officials to list exactly how much money they were paid.

HEADLINE: Bad Neuenahr Journal;
To Tighten Germany's Belt, Take a Look at the Spa

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BAD NEUENAHR, Germany, July 19

 BODY:
For the last 20 minutes or so, Gerd Ruhs, still as a pharaoh's mummy, happy as a hippo, has been encased in a coating of volcanic mud whose temperatures run to 120 degrees.
Contrary to appearances, he says -- moving ever so slightly, sweating ever so much -- there is a "taste of luxury" to this and to the massages and other treatments associated with being a patient at the spa here. 
 Outside the clinic where Mr. Ruhs, a 55-year-old technician in a food factory, is about to be unpeeled and hosed down by Theresia Doppelgatz, the nurse who wrapped him in the mud known as fango, Hedwig Wilming is taking a smoking break from her therapy, and she seems to agree.
"Mornings it's fango, evenings tango," said Mrs. Wilming, a 50-year-old nurse, getting a laugh from other people who, like her, wear bathrobes and track suits to undertake the travails of a four-week, state-financed spa treatment, known as a "health cure," that has come to stand in microcosm for one of the most ferocious debates in Germany as it gropes toward unfamiliar austerity.
The question, in essence, is this: can Germany's welfare state continue to afford not just routine health care but also a system whereby, on a doctor's prescription, Germans like Mr. Ruhs and Mrs. Wilming may take a free four-week spa treatment every three years?
In Bonn, just north of here, the Government's answer is no. And, among measures supposed to save some $33 billion in public spending, it has proposed that spa entitlements be reduced to three weeks every four years. The German Government reckons that by trimming spa care and some other smaller benefits, it will save about $5 billion a year.
At present, the state-subsidized spa guests pay roughly $8 a day for their treatment. Bonn wants to double that. The market value of a spa retreat, by contrast, is much more -- up to $250 a day, said Rainer Mertel, the director of Bad Neuenahr's privately run Spa Administration.
To outsiders -- particularly those not raised on the Central and Southern European culture of bathing in often noisome thermal springs and wallowing in volcanic, mineral-rich mud -- Germany's spa system may seem a parable of excess.
"In America you don't have this," Mr. Mertel said. "So you can smile about the crazy Germans."
But along the leafy banks of the River Ahr here, where fat trout loll under bridges and people toss bread to them to watch them rise, there are many different arguments.
Each year 1.5 million Germans take state-financed treatment at some of 1,200 clinics in 320 places officially recognized as curative centers or spas, said Rudolf Forcher, chairman of the Association of German Spas in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg.
On top of that, he reckoned, 7.6 million Germans -- 40 percent of the German vacationers whose travels appear on Government statistics -- pay for annual spa vacations that combine Mrs. Wilming's fango and tango with thermal baths, bracing walks, jolly exercise, oxygen baths, massage, fine food and much else. Older workers are more likely than younger ones to be prescribed a stay in a spa by a doctor.
But many Germans ask themselves: are Germany's state-financed spas no more than the ultimate boondoggle, a four-week break on top of the annual six weeks' vacation that has bred a multibillion-dollar industry?
"Of course, you can't filter out the freeloaders," Mr. Ruhs said with a sigh as the clock ticked toward his release from heat. "But all I can say is that if I hadn't had my four cures, I'd have had to be operated on and that would have cost a lot more."
Reinhardt Buchhorn, a 45-year-old municipal worker from Hanover, said: "You are here for your health, not fun. If you're sick, you're sick."
And, besides, said another patient, Manfred Schmidt, 44, from southern Germany, it's not exactly free, either, since German employees pay 13 or 14 percent of their gross salaries in health care contributions, an amount matched by their employers.
"This word 'cure,' it's very controversial," said Dieter Hamann, the director of the Klinik Kurkoln, one of four clinics operated by the privately run spa company that dominates Bad Neuenahr's thermal baths and spa industry. "There's a lot of hostility. People call it a holiday with therapy. But it's not. Our patients are busy from 7 A.M. to 8 P.M."
Indeed, people like Mr. Ruhs and Mrs. Wilming, all clutch personal timetables setting out busy schedules to be treated for ailments of the spinal column and other orthopedic afflictions that they say are eased here. Apart from those maladies, Bad Neuenahr and other spas offer a range of treatments for rheumatism, diabetes, post-operative rehabilitation, circulatory problems, stress and exhaustion.
The spa system is based on what Alexander Gorbing, Bad Neuenahr's marketing director, described as a twofold philosophy. State pension funds, he said, finance treatment for people who are still working to keep them well enough to work until retirement age. And state health care funds finance retirees' treatment to keep older people in good health so that they do not clamor for more expensive health care.
"This German system is unique in the world," he said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Prices Head Higher In Unexpected Summer Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices rallied in New York yesterday as a decline in stockpiles was taken as a sign of unexpectedly strong demand.
On other markets, natural gas prices rose while wheat fell. 
 The London Metal Exchange said its copper inventories had fallen by 4,625 metric tons, to 224,100 metric tons, from Friday through Monday. That was the ninth consecutive drop posted in the twice-weekly report. In the last two months, stockpiles have fallen 29 percent, to their lowest level since Dec. 5.
"Demand for copper is still very, very good in the U.S.," said John Gross, publisher of The Copper Journal. "It's consistent with the strength in the economy."
The inventory drop comes even as many factories are slowing operations or shutting down entirely for seasonal retooling and summer maintenance. Copper demand is typically lowest in July, traders said.
"For the middle of the summer, demand is really not that bad," said Michael Frawley, a copper trader with Dean Witter in New York.
Copper for September delivery rose 2.55 cents, to 91.95 cents a pound, at the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest since June 20.
In the natural gas market, prices rose for the first time in a week on concern that inventories remain uncomfortably low.
Inventories have been rising, aided by relatively mild weather recently that reduced air-conditioning demand, and the shortfall has narrowed to 28 percent below the level a year ago, according to the American Gas Association. Earlier this year, the gap had been 60 percent.
Nonetheless, August natural gas for delivery at the Henry Hub in Louisiana surged 20.9 cents, to $2.39 for a thousand cubic feet, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Wheat fell to its lowest price in almost 11 months after China canceled plans to buy 725,687 metric tons in a continuing dispute with the United States over fungus contamination in some shipments. Soft red winter wheat for September delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 6.75 cents, to $4.5375 a bushel.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole at Ease In Preparing A Film View Of the Man

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: RUSSELL, Kan., July 23

 BODY:
Bob Dole spent his day today making memories to share with the country next month at the Republican convention in San Diego.
With a film crew in tow and small-town America as his backdrop, Mr. Dole ambled around his hometown, chatting with friends, reminiscing with his sisters, narrating a tour through the house where he grew up and examining the artifacts of his life. 
 Under the guidance of Don Sipple, Mr. Dole's chief media strategist, cameras whirred at every move, starting with an ice-cream social in a local park Monday night and concluding with a chocolate milkshake at the Dairy Queen this afternoon.
All the hours of film are to be boiled down to a 10-minute movie that will help introduce Mr. Dole to the nation in August when he gives his speech accepting the nomination to be the Republican candidate for President.
"What a lot of Bob Dole is about is rooted in Russell," Mr. Sipple said at the modest Dole homestead here on Maple Street, during a break in a five-hour shoot.
"The values are strong, the people are strong and life is not so complicated as it is in a lot of other places," Mr. Sipple said. "That's the essence of Russell -- hard work, perseverance, respect for others. That's what we're finding out, and that's what's reflected in him."
As part of the film project, Mary Ellen Mark, a photojournalist, has joined the entourage.
The film crew was unobtrusively standing by and waiting for useful visuals to unfold, unscripted. Aides said the crew was looking for "genuine moments."
Several occurred on Monday night in the park as many well-wishers greeted Mr. Dole and squads of children sought his autograph. He chatted at length with one of the few black families there, whom campaign aides had spotted and escorted to a table near Mr. Dole and who, it turned out, were all Democrats.
He also spent several minutes with two boys in wheelchairs, kneeling before one of them, Jimmy Rodriguez, and talking quietly. The boys need electric wheelchairs, which cost more than $11,000, and Mr. Dole said he would see what he could do, taking their addresses and phone numbers.
Mr. Dole, who has lived in Washington for the last 35 years, has used Russell as a touchstone for big moments in his previous bids for national office. He plans to use it again this summer as the staging ground before he heads to the convention, with a stop first at the Eisenhower Library down the road in Abilene. Then he plans to announce his Vice-Presidential choice from here and "spend a day or two to get our batteries recharged," as he put it, before heading to the Republican convention in San Diego.
The reporters and camera crews who travel with Mr. Dole's campaign have been kept at arm's length during the filming because the campaign does not want a stray reporter to wander into the frame and disrupt the authenticity of the shot.
But this morning in Mr. Dole's sister's backyard, a small group of reporters was allowed in for a brief picture-taking session while Mr. Dole ate breakfast. In a newly disciplined mode, the candidate is resisting talking with reporters, so when he was asked when he might present his long-awaited economic plan, he replied, "It's a secret."
He confirmed that he planned to visit former President George Bush on Friday in Kennebunkport, Me., in part to mark the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Americans With Disabilities Act, which Mr. Dole was instrumental in enacting.
"He's been very helpful," Mr. Dole said of his former rival. "I talk to him now and then."
Eyeing a boom microphone over his head, Mr. Dole advised his companions -- his daughter, his sister Gloria and his sister's husband -- to keep mum. "They can pick up a flea scratching," he said.
Inside his former home, Mr. Dole submitted to what Mr. Sipple described as an "extensive interview" as he pored over mementos. These included the sound scriber he used to tape his law school classes in the 1940's. The machine was necessary because he had been severely injured in World War II and could not write. Standing before a cabinet, Mr. Dole pointed out several little knick-knacks he had sent home to his family.
"No one lives here, except when I'm home," he noted.
As he left the house, Mr. Dole was asked how the filming had gone.
"I was on my best behavior," he replied.
Mr. Sipple was asked how much of the project was scripted, and he said almost none.
"You mean you don't tell him what to say?" a reporter asked.
"No," Mr. Sipple said.
Then, aware that everyone listening was familiar with Mr. Dole's legendary resistance to being told what to do, he added with a laugh, "Absolutely not."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up On Soft Retail Indicators

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rebounded from early lows yesterday to close higher on a combination of factors, including a weak stock market, neutral remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and softness in retail-industry indicators.
Investor nervousness about supply and the testimony by Mr. Greenspan before the House banking subcommittee applied downward pressure on market prices going into the afternoon. While the weekly Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi/Schroder Wertheim index of chain store sales showed a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent for the week ended July 20, it was the 1 percent decline in the Johnson Redbook survey of retail sales that gave the market support in the afternoon -- rallying on rumors first -- that it would show a decline, squeezing short positions along the way. 
 The 30-year bond rose 13/32 , to a price of 8729/32 ; the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, slipped to 6.97 percent, from 7 percent on Monday.
News reports that Elaine Garzarelli, a highly regarded stock market analyst, had told some clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would slip 15 percent to 25 percent from its highs set this spring, prompted weakness in stocks that some in the bond market saw as a buying opportunity in short-maturity Treasury securities.
The figuring was that money flowing out of stocks would likely find its way there.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony in the afternoon produced no fireworks, except for some relief buying. The Fed chairman said he saw growth slowing, though the timing of that slowdown remained uncertain.
Yesterday's Treasury sale of $18.75 billion in new two-year notes was in fact aided by the late rally in the Treasury market brought on by a slide in the stock market.
Larry M. Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said the two-year note auction "actually came in better than expected."
He added: "All in all, it was an average auction. However, all interest in the auction was muted because the bond market was waiting to see if the Fed would pull the trigger and raise rates, though it appears that they will not raise rates before Aug. 20. But if the economic data at the end of this month is stronger than expected, there is no reason to wait."
The high yield at auction was slightly lower than expected at 6.288 percent, with the noncompetitive bidding above average, but the bid-to-cover ratio -- the total amount bid at auction for all prices against the size of the auction -- was weak. So far this year, the average bid-to-cover ratio has been 2.33 to 1; yesterday it was 2.16 to 1.
Mr. Greenspan said little that was sensitive to the market ahead of the futures close, traders said. The gains came mainly on the weak Redbook retail sales figure and the slip in the Dow on the prediction of a 15 percent to 25 percent correction.
"Technically, last week, we saw the reaction off of Fed chairman Greenspan's Senate testimony, which produced headlines that appeared bearish, and rightly so, the market traded down," Mr. Berman said. "The market has been light in volume and the dealers have been looking at the large leverage hedge funds and their biases, and going with them.
"Given the risk that Mr. Greenspan could say something today, there is no great rush to jump into the market at this moment. There was some relief buying on the auction's results and the buildup of shorts during the day's selling were squeezed out at the end. Nothing new has been given to the market to develop a new trend. Still, 6.90 percent to 7.10 percent will likely be the range in front of the end- of-the-month data."
Following are the results of today's Treasury auction of new two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Casino County

BYLINE: By James Thomas Snyder; James Thomas Snyder writes for The Daily News in Memphis.

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
Congress has passed legislation to create a commission to examine the rapidly expanding gambling industry, and President Clinton has said he will sign it. All this comes not a day too soon. It's too bad, in fact, that the commission wasn't in place before the casinos came to Tunica County.
The small cotton county in northwest Mississippi where 10 casinos have opened since 1992 offers a lot for the panel to look at. It also demonstrates why we need such a forum for debate and a clearinghouse for information as many poor communities look to gambling to generate development, growth and revenue.
Growth was what the county's residents were after when they voted to allow casinos on the banks of the Mississippi south of Memphis.
By almost any standard, Tunica was once the nation's poorest county. Per capita income in 1989 was $6,449. In 1991, more than half of the residents received food stamps, and more than a fifth received welfare. In 1985, after touring a poor community there, Jesse Jackson labeled Tunica County "America's Ethiopia."
What happened in Tunica defies exact judgments about gambling as a good or bad influence. Take the unemployment rate. It hovered around 13 percent in 1990, fell to 8.7 percent in 1993, then climbed to 12.9 percent in 1995. More residents are employed now than ever before. But more are unemployed, too, since so many who had stopped looking for jobs have rejoined the labor market, lining up for the easy work and quick money the casinos were supposed to offer, only to find there weren't enough opportunities to go around.
By 1995, three years after the casinos opened, food stamp use fell from 54 percent to 35 percent of the population and welfare dependency from 22 percent to 10 percent. But the population has not changed, and, except for a boom in hotel construction, development is nonexistent. Moreover, some gaming halls have shut or moved 15 miles north to the other end of the county, nearer Memphis, which hurts in a rural area where distance affects whether workers can keep jobs.
A Federal commission would be a clearinghouse for these kinds of considerations. It would do what regulatory agencies do: set objective standards to evaluate information. As it stands, we have to sort through endless propaganda.
Take, for example, a brochure published by the American Gaming Association, the industry's lobbying group, written to dispel "myths" about the evils of gambling. The association cites Tunica County's huge spurt in retail sales -- nearly 600 percent in three years -- to counter the argument that gambling nabs customers who would otherwise patronize small local businesses. What the association fails to mention is that there is little evidence that small businesses are profiting. The retail sales are mostly at the casinos, which sell souvenirs.
Also, to rebut claims that casinos put addictive gamblers on the road to financial ruin, the brochure cites declining bankruptcy rates in southern Mississippi, where the state's other gambling center is located.
The gaming lobby isn't telling the whole story. The brochure boasted that bankruptcies in southern Mississippi dropped from 1992 through 1994. But in that time bankruptcy rates were also declining nationwide. In 1995, they started to climb again, both in southern Mississippi and nationally.
The most absurd claim -- made in the brochure and by the association's president, Frank Fahrenkopf, in a television interview last week -- is that casinos don't cause crime.
Explain that to the court workers in Tunica County, who have faced at least a tenfold increase in their caseload -- 1,200 filings to 12,000 -- since the casinos opened. Though Federal crime statistics are not yet available, felony indictments for the county increased from 13 in 1992 to 172 in 1995.
In coming years, we'll be sure to hear more arguments about whether gambling is a pernicious influence or a clean and rich source of economic growth.
A Federal commission would help us wade through the slosh of information, misinformation and disinformation to provide a clear, accurate reflection of what gambling does to communities that turn to it as a savior of last resort.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Salomon Inc. Earnings Are Stronger Than Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Salomon Inc. yesterday reported surprisingly strong earnings for the second quarter, as revenue from bond trading and investment banking surged.
Salomon, the parent company of the securities firm Salomon Brothers Inc., earned $291 million, or $2.58 a share, compared with a loss of $60 million, or 73 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations of $1.48 a share, according to a survey of five analysts by IBES International Inc. 
 "Both trading and investment banking did well and contributed to the results," said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company who follows Wall Street. "It's another quarter on the road to turnaround," though it remains to be seen how the company will fare when financial markets decline, he said.
Pretax earnings at Salomon Brothers, the second-largest American securities firm in terms of capital, jumped more than ninefold, to $525 million during the second quarter from $56 million a year earlier. The unit lost almost $1 billion before taxes in 1994.
Salomon Brothers' revenue, net of interest and interest expense, more than doubled to $1.2 billion, from $552 million in the second quarter of 1995. Bond trading paced the increase. Salomon is the world's biggest bond trader, and its balance sheet averaged $193 billion in the second quarter.
Revenue from fixed-income sales and trading rose to $706 million, from $93 million in the quarter a year ago, while investment banking revenue jumped 63 percent, to a record $251 million. Salomon was the No. 2 underwriter of American stocks and bonds and the seventh-ranked adviser in mergers for the first half of the year, according to the Securities Data Company.
Salomon's better-than-expected results are in line with the rest of Wall Street's earnings, which swelled as mergers soared to record levels, the stock market hovered near all-time highs and interest rates remained relatively low during the quarter.
Salomon's Phibro unit, which trades commodities, lost $17 million before taxes in the second quarter. The loss narrowed from $162 million a year earlier. Basis Petroleum, the company's oil and refining business, lost $13 million before taxes. In the quarter a year ago, the unit earned $1 million before taxes.
Last week, Salomon announced plans to combine Basis Petroleum's crude oil gathering, marketing and trading operations with the Howell Corporation's gathering marketing and pipeline assets in a master limited partnership.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
G.O.P. Leaders Seeks Tax Cuts Wide in Scope

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
With Presidential politics and Congressional races both clearly in mind, the Republican leadership on Capitol Hill called today for a program of broad tax cuts, raising the pressure on Bob Dole to follow suit as he formulates his own economic platform.
Speaker Newt Gingrich, the majority leaders of the Senate and the House, and the chairmen of the tax-writing committees all generally endorsed short-term tax cuts followed by a sweeping overhaul of the tax code as the key to improving the nation's growth rate and giving Republicans a powerful campaign issue. 
 Mr. Gingrich said he would like to see a rollback of the 1993 tax increases and possibly an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates during the first month or so of a Dole administration.
"I would love to see us jump-start with President Dole, in the first 30 or 40 days of his administration, an immediate tax package with immediate pro-growth consequences and immediate tax relief before the April 15 deadline next year," Mr. Gingrich said. "Then, in a more orderly way, over a five- or six-month period, have the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee really dramatically get the Internal Revenue Service out of the lives of working Americans."
Mr. Dole is widely expected to make a tax cut the centerpiece of his economic strategy; he said in a television interview this month that a "tax cut will be a part of it" and that he thought that tax rates should be "flatter and fairer." But he has not offered any details or said how he would pay for such a cut. Campaign aides say they expect his plan to be announced in the next several weeks.
Mr. Dole, who has long argued that bringing down the Federal budget deficit is the nation's most important economic task, has been searching for a formula that would permit a politically popular tax cut without undermining his credibility as a deficit-fighter.
But his slow pace in developing an economic plan and his apparent qualms about embracing a big tax cut have worried Republicans in Congress, who fear that he is undermining their own political standing and depriving them of what they see as a red-meat issue: the tax increases enacted at President Clinton's behest by a Democratic-controlled Congress in 1993.
The Republican Congressional leaders spoke today at a forum on Capitol Hill that was organized largely at the initiative of Jack F. Kemp, the former Congressman and Housing Secretary, who in the last several years has been the most visible Republican proponent of big tax cuts.
Mr. Kemp has long occupied the end of the Republican economic policy spectrum opposite Mr. Dole, and has had a strained relationship with the Dole campaign since endorsing Steve Forbes, a strong advocate of a tax overhaul, late in the Republican Presidential primary season. But the Dole campaign sent its top policy adviser, Donald Rumsfeld, to speak at the meeting today, and other Dole aides said they did not feel that Mr. Kemp was pressuring the candidate to adopt policies he was not comfortable with.
"Republicans in Congress want a more concrete plan to run on," one aide to Mr. Dole said. "There is absolutely no divergence between the needs of the Dole campaign and the needs of Republican politicians who must draw distinctions in their campaigns, the clearest of which is Republicans' cutting taxes versus Democrats' raising taxes."
The forum served as something of a campaign kickoff for the emerging Republican theme that Mr. Clinton's fiscal policies have condemned the nation to disappointing growth in jobs and income.
"We've had three and a half years of Clinton economics now, and we know what that feels like," said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. "We also know what the economy will look like with Bob Dole in the White House working with a Republican majority in Congress: Tax cuts and tax reform will stimulate growth; more jobs and higher take-home pay."
The White House repeated that it would portray any large tax-cut proposal from Mr. Dole as a blow to bipartisan deficit-reduction efforts that have already yielded economic benefits like lower interest rates.
"It's a step back for balancing the budget if Bob Dole allows Newt Gingrich to talk him into a major across-the-board give-away that relies on sham financing and the very supply-side magical assumptions that Bob Dole spent the 1980's criticizing," said Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to the President.
The Republican leaders at the forum today gave no indication of how they would pay for any tax cuts. But they appeared to edge closer to accepting the much-debated theory that tax cutting pays in part for itself, by promoting economic growth, and that tax cuts therefore do not necessarily lead to an increase in the budget deficit. Mr. Dole long derided that supply-side theory.
"I believe we can cut taxes and balance the budget," the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said in a statement issued at the forum. "Some people let themselves be drawn into the belief that the two are mutually exclusive. To the contrary, cutting taxes will provide just the boost this economy needs."
And Mr. Rumsfeld suggested that Mr. Dole, or at least his advisers, were more open to supply-side theory than he was in the past.
Mr. Rumsfeld said that he agreed with critics of so-called static revenue analysis, which holds that reducing tax rates leads to lower tax revenue, and that he accepted its supply-side counterpart, dynamic revenue analysis, which holds that reducing tax rates spurs people to try to earn more money, thereby generating more revenue.
"There is no question but that there is a flowback or feedback that occurs," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "There are people who would argue about the extent, but I think most people who've looked at it carefully agree that it's there, and it's not trivial."
But Mr. Dole also received a veiled warning from one of his closest colleagues from his years in the Senate, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and one of the fiercest Republican advocates of deficit reduction.
Mr. Domenici said he fully supported a broad-based program including a tax overhaul. But he said any such program must be credible, which in his view means it must include a credible budget-balancing proposal. "A growth plan that is not credible," he said, "is worse than not having one."

Alcoa Vacating Its Downtown Pittsburgh Landmark

BYLINE: By CHRISS SWANEY 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
A corporate restructuring at the Aluminum Company of America has brought with it a decision to relinquish the company's 31-story aluminum headquarters building in downtown Pittsburgh, a landmark on the city's skyline since its construction in 1952.
To replace it as the corporate headquarters, Alcoa is putting up a $40 million building on the riverfront on the city's North Side, about a 15-minute walk from downtown. But the new building is designed for only 450 employees; the existing building has been home to about 1,500 of Alcoa's 1,700 employees in the Pittsburgh area. At one time 2,000 Alcoa employees worked there. The company has 10,000 salaried workers in the United States. 
 Alcoa's intention is to sell the building and the expectation is that the buyer will be a development company that will try to find new corporate tenants and will rehabilitate space for them. The addition of Alcoa's 442,500 square feet of rentable space to the leasing market means that the office market will have an estimated 3.7 million square feet of space available, for a vacancy rate of 16.5 percent, said Peter Sukernek, general manager of Hanna Commercial Real Estate Services, a commercial arm of the Howard Hanna Company, a real estate company based in Pittsburgh.
"This will be the best new space that has become available since the 80's," Mr. Sukernek said, a reflection of the fact that there has been no new construction downtown since Renaissance II, a series of office buildings produced as a public-private partnership at the junction of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in the heart of downtown in the 1980's. He said it was doubtful that a single tenant would take the space, and that leasing would take some time.
Alcoa's new six-story glass-and-aluminum headquarters building will have 236,200 square feet of space and be situated on two acres at Isabella Street between the Seventh and Ninth Street bridges. It has been in construction since May, with occupancy expected in the spring of 1998.
It will have two levels of underground parking for 375 cars, with valet parking available. A 22,500-square-foot park facing the Allegheny River and a 2.5-mile jogging trail will also be accessible for Alcoa employees.
The project architect is the Design Alliance of Pittsburgh and the general contractor is Turner Construction of Pittsburgh.
"Our new building allocates space to employees based on need, not title," said Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, "and creates an open architecture to encourage conversation and teamwork." All office space will be enclosed in floor-to-ceiling glass and no work station will be farther than 45 feet from the windows. Only about 60 percent of the space will be for offices or work space, with the other 40 percent for meetings or collaborative work.
"It is a design driven by function, not status," said Martin Powell, principal architect with Design Alliance. "People will be more visible and more accessible." The main entrance will open on an atrium where escalators will go to other floors. Elevators will be used mainly for freight or the handicapped.
The Alcoa project is one of several waterfront developments on the city's North Side. They include a 30,000-square-foot general-purpose office building and a 94-apartment $20 million town house complex.
Another project in construction is a $22 million community of 232 apartments on six acres adjacent to the new Alcoa building. Called Lincoln at North Shore, it will provide 160 one-bedroom apartments renting for $650 to $815 a month, and 72 two-bedroom apartments at $990 to $1,300 a month.
The Pittsburgh-based Mascaro Inc. is the general contractor for the city's newest residential community. Kaufman/Meeks of Houston is the project architect while the Lincoln Property Company of Dallas is the project developer. Lincoln Property, one of the nation's largest private development companies, owns and manages 100,000 apartments. The project is scheduled for completion in summer 1997.
There is also a possibility that a $140 million baseball stadium will be built for the Pittsburgh Pirates on land four blocks south of the Alcoa building. Owners of the team began negotiating with city officials three months ago on a new-stadium site.
The North Side represents about a third of the Pittsburgh waterfront, once home of many steel mills and warehouses. More than $100 million of public and private funds have been pumped into half a dozen projects to give the waterfront a contemporary function.
Still, there is concern that continued job contraction by large employers in Pittsburgh could hurt an already sluggish economy. A combination of bank mergers and corporate downsizing in the last decade has brought about a loss of more than 2,700 white-collar jobs in Pittsburgh over the last three years.

HEADLINE: European Beachhead For Korean Ambition

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
Oceans away from his home base, in a dark cavernous factory here covered with decades of grime left by Communist neglect, the South Korean magnate and chairman of the Daewoo Group, Kim Woo Choong, sees the future. He walks the aisles of antiquated metal pressing machines, unruffled by the thunderous noise or the disheveled Polish auto workers peering at their new boss.
"I can see a change in attitude already," said the silver-haired Mr. Kim, who is betting big on his ability to transform easygoing Polish job habits into crisp Korean style.
More than a dozen auto makers, including the General Motors Corporation, came to Poland to bargain over the country's state-run car and component manufacturer, a 20,000-employee behemoth with a record of producing inferior cars. 
 Without much ado, Mr. Kim, who heads Korea's fourth-largest industrial conglomerate, won the bidding, taking control of Fabryka Samochodow Osobowych, or F.S.O., for $1.1 billion -- part of a plan aimed at becoming one of the 10 biggest auto makers in the world by 2000.
The key to the plan is Central Europe, a region where manufacturing costs are still low -- auto wages are one-fifth the level in South Korea -- yet the appetite of consumers for cars and other products is growing. Car sales in Poland and the Czech Republic, for example, soared 30 percent in the first five months of this year. By the end of the year, Poles are expected to have bought 300,000 new cars, making the country the 10th-largest car market in Europe.
Central Europe will also serve as the production base for bigger markets in Western Europe and to the east. If Poland achieves European Union membership early in the next century, trade barriers would fall just as the new Daewoo ventures reach peak production. By that stage, Daewoo plans to have two completely new "world cars" -- the T car and the J car, both designed with Italian engineers -- rolling out of its Central European plants.
"It's a very bright market," said Mr. Kim, who may, however, see more brightness than others.
Financial analysts in Seoul note that as the South Korean market becomes more problematic because of mounting costs, all the major conglomerates there are hunting abroad for new markets.
But though many Korean and other foreign manufacturers are flocking to this region, none are putting more on the line than Daewoo, which is committing a total of $5 billion to projects in the area.
And few are facing more formidable obstacles. For openers, Mr. Kim must sharply upgrade Daewoo's lackluster engineering skills even as he overcomes cultural gaps in the workplace. How Daewoo, a debt-laden company, plans to finance the rapid expansion is not exactly clear. Nor is it certain that the appetite exists for so many Daewoo cars.
South Korean cars in general are hardly known as premier vehicles, and Daewoo, after an unhappy 14-year joint venture with General Motors that ended in 1992, has been dogged with a poor reputation. (During part of the joint venture, Daewoo produced Pontiac Le Mans cars for sale in the United States.)
But Mr. Kim insists that the group's auto company, Daewoo Motor, will fix the quality gap, even as it raises last year's production level of 520,000 cars, all made in South Korea, to 2 million worldwide by the end of the decade. Economies of scale, he argues, will improve quality and performance. One million cars, he says, will be manufactured in South Korea, and one million at plants in countries from Uzbekistan and India to Poland and Romania.
To accomplish his mission, which some believe is partly motivated by his determination to show G.M. what stuff he is made of, Mr. Kim has gone on a huge shopping spree.
Aside from F.S.O., over the last two years Daewoo bought a truck factory in southern Poland for $700 million, a car plant in Romania for $300 million and a Czech truck manufacturer for $200 million. As well, Daewoo recently bought 51 percent of a Romanian shipyard, is constructing a washing-machine and circuit-board factory in Warsaw and is planning a 30-story office tower here.
Financial analysts, competing car companies and stunned but happy local politicians have looked on with a mixture of awe and skepticism at the voracity of Daewoo's appetite.
The established car titans are approaching more cautiously. General Motors, for example, is planning to build a $340 million plant in southern Poland, to open in 1999 with initial production of 78,000 cars.
"If I was with G.M., I would be doing what they are doing," Mr. Kim said in his modern but Spartan Warsaw office. "We are a latecomer, so we take more risks than them."
Mr. Kim, who has legal problems back home, has been spending much of his time here and in Vienna, nurturing the new businesses. He is one of a group of high-level Korean executives indicted last year on charges of giving bribes to former President Roh Tae Woo in exchange for lucrative contracts. Mr. Kim is due to stand trial later this year, but is not expected to face any jail time if convicted.
As for financing all the new ventures, "it is not an easy task," said Cho Dung Sung, a professor of business administration at Seoul National University who closely follows Daewoo. Mr. Cho, who wrote a Harvard Business School case study on Daewoo in 1984, is writing a sequel but said that he did not yet have an "exact picture" of how Mr. Kim would raise the money.
Last year, the parent Daewoo Group had a net profit of about $530 million on revenues of $51.2 billion, from making ships, consumer electronics and computers, in addition to cars. The company also controls a construction business and has other activities. Daewoo Motor, which netted just $13.7 million on sales of $4.5 billion, had nearly $3.2 billion in debt last year, about 4.4 times equity. Most Daewoo companies trail their competitors at home, with Daewoo Motor in third place behind Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors.
Mr. Kim said he expected to borrow 60 percent of the cost of the new ventures from international banks. The rest would come from new equity issues, European bonds convertible into shares of Daewoo's profitable Korean companies, plus profits from the new acquisitions.
What is clearer than the financial picture is the hectic pace at which Daewoo managers -- more than 100 are in Warsaw -- are trying to turn around the newly acquired plants.
They are finding alienated workers, soured by decades of poor treatment at the hands of Communist managers. One of the first tasks was to clean the grease-soaked blackened floor of the factory that has the stamping presses. Polish workers scrubbed it with hand scrapers.
"With the Koreans, it's clean, clean, clean, then quality, quality, quality," said Tadeusz Papis, the deputy leader of the independent trade union, which is the second largest at F.S.O. "We have to get used to the Koreans. But they have to get used to us or nothing will happen."
But the Koreans, according to Mr. Papis, are solicitous. For example, workers were surveyed about possible quality-of-life improvements in the workplace. The first request was renovation of the squalid bathrooms. Soon, workers were asked about tile colors, and all bathrooms were brought up to Western standards.
Part of the challenge for Daewoo is to get more out of its new workers. The company started by sending 900 Romanian employees to South Korea for three months' work experience. The Romanians got a shock.
"They work very, very hard, over the normal," said Dan Ceausu, a body shop supervisor. "When we went there, everything ached -- not only our arms, but our backs, our legs."
In Poland, about 1,500 workers are destined for six-month stints in South Korea. An advance team of about 50 workers in quality control went for two weeks during the spring. They found the experience at times inspiring, at times exhausting.
"We got to know the quality control system there and we have to implement it here as fast as possible," said Wojciech Michalik, a supervisor. "The Koreans say: 'Eliminate all these failures; there's too much noise in the chassis; set up a team.' Sometimes it's too much perfection; sometimes it's too fast. I'm here every day 6:30 A.M. to 9 P.M. That's new."
Perhaps more than anything, the Koreans taught a sense of the competition in the marketplace. "They know and now we know," Mr. Michalik said, "that the difference between us and our competition -- Fiat and General Motors -- is big."
Kim Kwon Tae, the new chief of production and engineering at Daewoo-F.S.O., as the new venture is officially called, suggested that the productivity and quality control tasks were daunting but doable.
As he walked the assembly line recently, the production chief was upset to see workers smoking at their stations. Personal lockers where workers kept toolboxes -- and where stolen parts were often stashed away -- would soon be abolished, he said. "It was the same in Korea 20 years ago -- we were very poor, and people stole," he said.
More important, he intends to double the engineering team at the plant, mostly by hiring recent and eager graduates from Polish universities. He has inherited 817 engineers, but about 60 percent are more than 40 years old. "Under Communism, their duty was to just get older," he said. "They had no chance to be creative."
As Daewoo's Central European ventures get under way, the company has already given a segment of the West European market a small taste of how adventurous it can be.
Because of an agreement relating to its breakup with General Motors, Daewoo was allowed to start selling in Western Europe only last year. (It is planning to sell cars in the United States for the first time under its own name starting late next year or early in 1998.)
The company chose Britain as a launching pad. With its Nexia model, imported from South Korea, Daewoo recorded the fastest growth of any newcomer to the market, a feat that took competitors by surprise. In the first 12 months, it sold 18,000 Nexias -- many through the novel marketing technique of using outlets in the Savacenter superstores of Sainsbury, a supermarket chain.
Such a venture, however, is only a tiny step compared with Mr. Kim's overall plans.
While Professor Cho is taking a wait-and-see attitude, he cautions that Mr. Kim -- a manager who sold cheap textiles to Sears, Roebuck in the 1970's -- is not to be underestimated.
"He is a master in selling products abroad," Professor Cho said. "He's not timid in creating the challenge -- that's the mark of a visionary."

HEADLINE: District of Columbia's Budget Wins Senate Panel's Approval

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The Senate Appropriations Committee today unanimously approved the District of Columbia's $5.1 billion budget for the 1997 fiscal year, the second sign this week that Congress is satisfied with the city's progress toward solving its financial crisis.
On Monday, the House approved the District's budget by a vote of 332 to 68, attaching only two conservative social proposals, compared with the half-dozen that House members added last year. 
 The full Senate is expected to vote on the District budget next week and differences remain to be worked out by a House and Senate conference committee after the summer recess. But the votes this week are the latest sign that Federal lawmakers approve of the steps District officials are taking to reach a balanced budget by 1999, as required by a 1995 law that created a control board to oversee District finances.
"This shows our transformation plan is working," said Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., referring to a four-year strategy to redesign the city government and bring spending under control. "It means we have more credibility now; our plan for the future has been accepted by Congress and the control board. And it demonstrates the rightness of my policies."
The House approved a $4.99 billion budget for the District and provisions that the District could not spend Federal or local money for abortions and could not provide health-care benefits for unmarried domestic partners of city employees.
The House version also included a limit of $40 million for the 1997 budget deficit, which is projected to reach $99 million without more spending cuts. That stipulation came largely at the behest of Representative James T. Walsh of New York, chairman of the District subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, who has been pushing the District hard to make deeper cuts. He also insisted that an additional $59 million in cuts be implemented.
The control board and the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $5.1 billion budget for the year. The Senate version did not include the restrictions on spending for abortions and domestic-partner benefits.
"I felt it was important to reward them," Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the District, said after the vote, referring to the city. "I believe there are some areas where the priorities demand more spending."
For Mr. Barry, a Democrat who returned to office in 1994 to confront a deficit that was projected to reach $722 million in his first year, the votes this week were a major political victory in that a Republican-led Congress was validating his approach to solving the city's worst financial crisis.
Although Mr. Barry battled with the control board to save jobs and programs for the 1997 fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, he and the board reached agreement on a budget that brings the deficit down from $116 million for the current fiscal year. The district is required to balance the budget by 1999 and keep it balanced for another four years before the control board would disband.
But when the House subcommittee considered the consensus budget, Mr. Walsh insisted that another $59 million in spending be eliminated. Mr. Barry and Andrew F. Brimmer, chairman of the control board, argued strongly that cuts of that size would decimate vital programs for city residents.
"There's no rationale for his cuts," Mr. Barry said today. "I'm hopeful that the Senate will stand firm and Mr. Walsh will relent."

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES SWEEPING CHANGE IN WELFARE POLICY;
BIG ROLE TO STATES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
The Senate approved a comprehensive welfare bill today that would end the longstanding Federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children and give states vast new power to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money.
The vote was 74 to 24. Democrats split, with 23 voting for the bill and 23 opposed. Fifty-one of the 52 Republicans voted for the measure, which calls for the most sweeping welfare changes since the New Deal and is similar to the House bill passed last week. [Roll-call, page A22.] 
 The Senate approved only two of the four amendments most ardently sought by President Clinton, who said he would insist on further "improvements" as a condition of signing the legislation. One would guarantee Medicaid coverage for people who might lose such health insurance because of new restrictions on welfare eligibility. The other would retain the Federal guarantee of food stamps for the poor, denying states the opportunity to set eligibility and benefit standards for food aid financed by the Federal Government.
Campaigning in California, Mr. Clinton welcomed changes by the Senate but said more were needed.
"You can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle," the President said. "We want real welfare reform.
"Today the Senate took some major steps to improve the bill going through Congress. If we can keep this progress up, if we can make it bipartisan, then we can have a real welfare reform bill that honors work and protects children."
Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said: "History will praise this day. A system that has failed in every aspect will now be thrown away. We'll start over with a new system that has a chance of giving people an opportunity instead of a handout."
But Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, said: "I believe that the Senate will rue the day that we passed this legislation. This day, in the name of reform, the Senate will do actual violence to poor children, putting millions of them into poverty who were not in poverty before."
"This bill is election-year politics and rhetoric raised to the level of policy," Ms. Moseley-Braun added.
The Senate measure, like the House bill, would impose a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance payments to any family, and states would be allowed to set stricter time limits.
Democratic support for the bill eroded today as the Senate rejected several Democratic amendments, generally on party lines. The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, voted against the bill after hinting last week that he might vote for it. Only one Republican, Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, opposed the bill; he said it was not tough enough.
In a surprise today, the Senate narrowly rejected one of the four amendments sought by Mr. Clinton, a proposal that would have allowed states to provide vouchers or other forms of non-cash assistance to families denied cash benefits because of the time limits. The vouchers could have been used to obtain diapers, cribs, clothing, medicine or school supplies for children.
The House version of the bill does not allow the use of Federal money for such vouchers, and Republicans twisted arms in full view on the Senate floor today to make sure that vouchers would not be permitted under the Senate measure, either.
Democrats also failed to win approval for an amendments that would have allowed public assistance and social services for legal immigrants, who are denied aid under the Republican bill.
Moments before the final vote, the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said: "If you really want welfare reform, this is it. This may be the last opportunity."
Welfare has become a major issue in this year's elections. Mr. Clinton has said repeatedly that he wants to sign a welfare bill, but he has sent mixed signals on the latest version.
Mr. Lott said Republicans would win, regardless of whether Mr. Clinton accepted the measure. "If he signs it, the country will be the beneficiary," Mr. Lott said today. "If he doesn't, he'll have to explain why."
One Democrat backing the bill, Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, said: "This bill is not perfect, but it is a major step in the right direction."
Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, summarized the case for the bill this way: "Welfare was never meant to be a way of life. It was meant as a temporary helping hand, a safety net to be used for a few months."
But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who is a longtime student of social welfare policy and who led opposition to the bill, said, "Senators such as I cannot conceive that the party of Social Security and of civil rights could support this legislation, which commences to repeal, to undermine, both." Mr. Moynihan and five colleagues said Mr. Clinton should veto the bill.
In September, the Senate passed a somewhat similar welfare bill, 87 to 12. Mr. Clinton signaled support for that measure but later vetoed the final version, saying it would impoverish more than one million children.
The new bill now goes to a conference committee of negotiators from the House and the Senate, who will try to resolve differences between the chambers. Republicans said they wanted to complete work on the bill by the end of next week so they could send it to Mr. Clinton.
Several Democrats who voted for the bill said they had done so mainly to move it to the next stage of the legislative process, and they said they might change their votes if protections for children were dropped in negotiations with the House. They said Mr. Clinton should not hesitate to veto the bill if it moved sharply to the right in the bargaining.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said the more conservative House would prevail on many issues where the chambers disagree. That would please some Administration officials, who call the bill as a potentially devastating blow to children.
"I hope Armey can push this bill to the right in conference" so it will become unacceptable to the President, one Administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said tonight. But Mr. Clinton's political advisers said they hoped he would get a bill he could sign.
These were the major actions today:
*By a vote of 51 to 48, the Senate refused to let states use Federal money to provide vouchers to families who reach the five-year limit on cash assistance.
*On a voice vote, the Senate agreed to guarantee Medicaid for people cut from the welfare rolls. The House bill has a similar provision, but it provides slightly less protection for poor people.
*By a vote of 53 to 45, the Senate eliminated part of the bill that would have allowed states to receive their food stamp money as a lump sum, or block grant. The House bill permits such block grants. The President strongly opposes this option, saying it would cripple the Government's ability to meet the increased demand for food assistance in the face of recessions or natural disasters.
*By a vote of 52 to 46, the Senate upheld provisions of the bill that would ban food stamps and many other forms of public assistance for legal immigrants who have not become citizens. The Senate rejected a Democratic proposal to continue such benefits for legal immigrants already in the United States.
Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said the Medicaid amendment told states, in effect: "Go ahead if you wish, reduce eligibility levels for welfare. But Medicaid eligibility levels should remain as they are today."
The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would save $60 billion over six years, mostly by cutting food stamps and benefits to legal immigrants. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said her state alone would lose $17 billion over six years.
Ms. Feinstein said the bill would affect more than one million Californians.
"They are aged," she said. "They are blind. They are disabled. They are children. This bill would immediately throw them off whatever assistance they have with no other recourse."
But Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, said: "People who come to this country sign a document that says they will not become wards of the state, and what's happening? Millions of people are coming to this country. They're bringing moms and dads over. Mom and dad qualify for Supplemental Security Income benefits. You and the taxpayers of this country are picking up the tab as we become the retirement home for the rest of the world."
The amendment to preserve the Federal guarantee of food stamps for the poor was offered by Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota. It won support from six moderate Republican Senators.
The Senate also approved an amendment offered by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, that would deny welfare and Medicaid benefits to people convicted of drug crimes. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, criticized the proposal, saying it would prevent Medicaid from paying for drug treatment and prenatal health care in many cases.
Senator Roth denounced Mr. Clinton's proposal for vouchers, saying they "would seriously undermine the five-year time limit." Under the bill, Mr. Roth said, poor families could still receive food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance and other aid after reaching the five-year limit on cash benefits.
"Over five years," Mr. Roth said, "a typical welfare family receives more than $50,000 in tax-free benefits. Five years is enough time to finish a high school degree or learn a skill through vocational training."
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, invoked Franklin D. Roosevelt as his authority for saying: "If people stay on welfare for prolonged periods of time, it administers a narcotic to the spirit. This dependence on welfare undermines their humanity and makes them wards of the state."
 
HIGHLIGHTS
Welfare Changes
 
Following are major provisions of the Senate welfare bill, which is similar to the House welfare bill:
 
* The Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children would end. Each state would get a lump sum of money to run its own welfare and work programs.
 
* The head of every family on welfare would be required to work within two years, or the family would lose benefits.
 
* Lifetime welfare benefits would be limited to five years. (States may set stricter time limits.) Twenty percent of families may be exempted because of hardship.
 
* States could stop payments to unmarried teen-age parents. Payments may be made only if a mother under the age of 18 stays in school and lives with an adult.
 
* States that reduce births to unmarried women would be rewarded with additional cash grants.
 
* About 300,000 disabled children from low-income families would lose cash benefits because of stricter eligibility standards in the Supplemental Security Income program. (Source: Senate Finance Committee, Congressional Budget Office.)

New York City and state officials yesterday outlined their most comprehensive approach yet to rebuilding Columbus Circle, home to some of the city's most valuable real estate and some of its most reviled architecture.
Besides seeking developers to build a 59-story complex, including street-level stores and two slender towers, on the site of the New York Coliseum, economic development officials said they were also trying to sell 2 Columbus Circle, a 10-story, city-owned architectural curiosity that houses the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and the Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 The plan was described by the officials as they released a long-awaited request for development proposals for the Coliseum site, at the southwest corner of Central Park.
By enlarging the development plan to include the far smaller site at 2 Columbus Circle, "we can create something entirely new for the entire circle, which is now a cut-up mess," said John S. Dyson, the former Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, who has headed the city's planning effort for the Coliseum site.
The Coliseum plan announced yesterday would resurrect a development scheme that in an earlier, somewhat larger incarnation had provoked New York City's most bitter development conflict of the 1980's.
The earlier plan, by the developer Mortimer B. Zuckerman, was to have included towers rising more than 65 stories. It was scaled back in 1990 amid a torrent of lawsuits and a deep real estate slump, and the deal finally collapsed in July 1994.
But officials hope that the new plan, coming at a time when the city's real estate market is gradually improving, has a better chance of success, in part because of other work already under way around Columbus Circle.
Indeed, the city and state are making available half of the real estate around Columbus Circle at a time when almost all the rest is being upgraded. Other projects around the circle include Donald J. Trump's conversion of the former Gulf and Western office building into an expensive condominium and hotel tower and the renovation of the southwest entrance to Central Park.
The city is also planning to reconfigure traffic patterns around the circle, eliminating lanes that bisect it and creating a relatively simple traffic rotary.
The statue of Christopher Columbus at the center of the traffic circle would be surrounded by a plaza that is larger than the current one, and made accessible to pedestrians by crosswalks.
Although the plan for large new buildings may provoke some of the same neighborhood criticism that erupted in the 1980's, officials said yesterday that it offered a chance to redeem Columbus Circle as a showplace of urban design.
"We are going to the private sector and saying, 'Think up something clever that will replace what has been referred to as the Mussolini architecture of this building,' " Mr. Dyson said, referring to the Coliseum.
Officials from the city, the state and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- the owner of the Coliseum -- said they would consider several options for the Coliseum site, including various combinations of housing, offices and stores. In its request for development proposals for 2 Columbus Circle, the city said it would consider the same range of options.
Mr. Dyson said the plan did not depend on finding a single developer to purchase both sites, but that the request for development proposals at 2 Columbus Circle had been timed so a proposal encompassing both sites could be considered. Developers are to be selected by the end of December for the Coliseum site, and by the end of January for 2 Columbus Circle.
Unlike the previous development plan, the new proposal for the Coliseum site restricts the size of any new building to what would be allowed under existing zoning. Mr. Zuckerman had won approval for buildings 20 percent larger than allowed by normal zoning, in exchange for his pledge to upgrade the Columbus Circle subway station.
The new plan does not require a developer to pay for subway station improvements.
Government officials, who have been preparing the new development scheme for more than a year, are known to have been in close touch with architects, environmentalists and community groups who opposed the 1980's plan, and have won widespread, if still qualified, endorsements.
Still, experts said yesterday that the plan could encounter protests and even lawsuits because it was guided, as was its predecessor, by the goal of selling development rights to the highest bidder.
That objective was reiterated yesterday by E. Virgil Conway, chairman of the transit agency, who said that obtaining the highest bid for the Coliseum was a "top priority."
Neither he nor other officials were willing to speculate on what the price would be, but there seems little chance of a bid even close to the $435 million that Mr. Zuckerman was willing to pay during the real estate boom of the 1980's.
The transit agency, meanwhile, has included $200 million in its five-year capital plan in anticipation of the Coliseum sale.
"My big concern is that price is going to drive the project," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit research group that fought to block the earlier Coliseum plan.
"We are clearly at a much better starting point," he said, praising the restrictions on the size of the project and efforts to coordinate any new buildings with other improvements in the area.
"But nobody has indicated how much weight they will give to urban design considerations versus the selling price," Mr. Shostal said. "The proof will be in the review and reward process."
Real estate executives said there was intense interest among developers, at least in the Coliseum site. Mr. Trump, Arthur Zeckendorf, Edward J. Minskoff and Stephen Ross -- all large-scale Manhattan developers -- are known to be preparing proposals for the site.
"It is clearly one of the great sites in Manhattan," said Martin Turchin, vice chairman of Edward S. Gordon Inc., a real estate brokerage. He said he expected bids and development proposals for the Coliseum from at least 10 Manhattan developers, and offering prices that may exceed the $200 million sought by the transit agency.
The city's offer to sell 2 Columbus Circle appeared yesterday to catch the real estate industry somewhat off guard. The building, originally erected as an art museum, has been repeatedly ridiculed by architecture critics -- the Manhattan guidebook of the American Institute of Architects calls it a "white marble confection" -- sits on a lot that is far smaller and less valuable than the Coliseum site.
Nonetheless, some executives said the idea of building on both locations presented intriguing new options.
"I haven't taken a serious look at 2 Columbus Circle, but I intend to," Mr. Trump said.

HEADLINE: A Polite Warning to Mr. Yeltsin

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund delivered an appropriately gentle wake-up call to the Russian Government this week. It delayed a $330 million disbursement in loans pending Moscow's action to raise tax collections toward previously agreed levels.
The delay was entirely warranted. The I.M.F. had agreed to lend the Government of President Boris Yeltsin about $10 billion over three years on condition that it adopt tight fiscal and monetary targets. The fund could not have let the budget shortfall go unchallenged if it hoped to maintain the credibility of its agreements to lend money to governments that promise to undertake fiscally prudent economic reforms. 
 Russia's tax shortfall reflects a fundamental, though solvable, problem. The Russian tax system is riddled with corruption, loopholes and atrocious administration. It has left Government coffers half-empty. The Government is simply collecting too little money to pay for infrastructure, education and research programs that the public needs. Federal taxes in the United States -- a relatively low-tax country -- equal about 20 percent of aggregate income. In Russia, they are only about half as high.
The Russian budget is unsustainable. It needs more revenue to beef up public sending. It needs more revenue just to pay for the shrunken Government programs that Mr. Yeltsin has kept in place. It is running deficits modestly above levels that he negotiated with the monetary fund.
Yet for all these serious problems, the fund wisely downplayed its decision to withhold loan disbursements pending a review next month. It issued no heavy-handed threats or criticism. None are warranted. Mr. Yeltsin has permitted finances to drift off track, in part by spending money to assure his re-election. But he has not allowed the deficit to soar out of sight of I.M.F. targets.
Indeed, the economic picture is much better than most observers in the West expected from a beleaguered President who started out hopelessly behind his Communist challenger in the polls. Mr. Yeltsin did promise to jack up wages and pensions of Government employees. Tax revenues plummeted -- falling, as a percentage of total income, by about half. The danger, during a campaign, was that Mr. Yeltsin would outspend his revenues by any amount to assure victory -- in effect by printing money that would eventually drive the economy over the precipice of hyperinflation.
Mr. Yeltsin did not go that far. The deficit rose, but he offset much of the impact of lower tax collections by cutting many Government programs. Indeed, Western observers fear that the spending cuts went overboard, jeopardizing important education and infrastructure programs. The budget-cutting has brought inflation down from about 4 percent a month to 1 percent. The value of the ruble is stable. In short, there are real problems -- real enough to require I.M.F. action -- but no imminent financial catastrophe.
The precise reasons for the tax falloff are unclear. Mr. Yeltsin created some of the problem by eliminating a tax on "excessive" wages -- a wise decision because the tax was shackling fast-growing enterprises. But he did not put another tax in its place. Also, some companies stopped paying taxes, waiting to see if the Communists would win the election.
In any case, Mr. Yeltsin will have to summon the political muscle to go after the handful of enterprises, estimated at about 20, that account for fully half the unpaid tax bills. He will also have to address the tax system as a whole and reform its inept administration. By some estimates, Moscow collects only about half the money its tax rates should generate. Besides starving the treasury, the system imposes a ruinous burden on some companies that do pay according to the law.
Because Mr. Yeltsin did not let Government finances get out of control during the campaign, the corrections he must now make are possible. He also has a new political mandate to proceed. The I.M.F., to preserve its authority, needed to deliver a nudge. It was wise not to deliver a shove.

Congress Passes Sanctions
Against Iran and Libya Trade
Setting up another conflict with America's trading partners, Congress approved legislation that would require the President to impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest heavily in Iran and Libya.
Despite threats of retaliation by European nations that do business in those countries, the House without dissent approved a tougher Senate version of the bill; President Clinton has said he will sign it. The new conflict follows a dispute over trade with Cuba that has put the United States at odds with Canada, Mexico and the European Union. [Page A1.]
 
G.O.P. Calls for Tax Cuts
The Republican leadership on Capitol Hill called for a program of sweeping tax cuts to be followed by basic change in tax law, raising the pressure on Bob Dole to follow suit as he formulates his economic platform. [A1.]
 
New Meat Scare
For Europe?
The European Union announced preliminary scientific findings that may result in banning as food parts of sheep, goats and venison because of a possible link to mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which has ravaged Britain's beef industry. [A10.]
 
House Passes Food-Pesticide Bill
The House of Representatives approved an overhaul of laws regulating pesticide residues in food. The bill eliminates a law that bars even trace amounts of pesticides in processed foods and would create a standard allowing only those levels that with reasonable certainty would cause no harm. [A18.]
 
Suitors Assemble Plan for Barney's
Saks Holdings and the Isetan Company of Japan said they were assembling a plan to take Barney's Inc., the parent of Barneys New York, out of bankruptcy. But other suitors have also expressed interest. [D2.]

Chief of Bay Networks to Step Down
Andrew Ludwick, the president and chief executive of Bay Networks, said he would step down and that a succession plan was in place. But he declined to identify the successor or specify a time frame for the move. [D2.]

Strong Gains by 3 Drug Companies
American Home Products, Schering-Plough and SmithKline Beecham all reported higher second-quarter profits, as rising sales of their flagship and newer medicines were only partly offset by declines in older products. [D4.]

A Loss at RJR Nabisco
RJR Nabisco Holdings posted a loss of $27 million, which it attributed to costs of revamping its food business. [D2.]
 
2 Newspaper Companies See Gains
Times Mirror and Washington Post reported stronger earnings, citing several factors, while Knight-Ridder posted lower profits as a result of a big gain a year earlier. [D5.]

 
BBDO Dominates Olympic Ads
The 1996 Summer Games seem like the BBDOlympics. BBDO Worldwide represents 7 of 55 companies advertising during the Games, with clients including Visa Gold, General Electric and AT&T. Its "Delta Air Lines Marathon" campaign features Nigel Havers, left, who played an Olympian in the film "Chariots of Fire." Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
Tandy's Checkered Record
Many on Wall Street are bullish about Tandy's new alliances and what they can do to bolster sales at Radio Shack, long the company's flagship. But there is concern as well about a history of promises made and not delivered. Market Place. [D6.]

HEADLINE: THE FATE OF FLIGHT 800: LEGAL IMPLICATIONS;
Families and Lawyers Are Warned That Airline's Liability May Be Limited

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
Although many bodies from the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 last week have yet to be found, some lawyers have already found clients to sue the carrier. The frenzy is on: lawyers have sent out press releases praising their expertise, and inquiries to members of the small coterie of aviation-law specialists are pouring in. A handful of families have already signed on.
But the District Attorneys of Suffolk and Queens counties, and the bar associations from Pennsylvania, Florida, and Texas as well as New York, have been warning lawyers that direct solicitation of clients is a crime. City and state bar officials are assembling a team of lawyers who will give free legal advice to relatives while refusing to accept any cases themselves, starting possibly as soon as today. 
 From all the ruckus, one would assume that out of a great tragedy, millions can be made. But legal experts say compensation from T.W.A. for this crash could be as low as $75,000 for each passenger.
"This is a very difficult case and the amount you can recover is very, very limited," said Kenneth P. Nolan, whose New York firm has been called by representatives of a half-dozen T.W.A. families.
Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose 23-year-old daughter, Alice, died when a Soviet missile shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983, said families of the T.W.A. victims should be wary of lawyers hawking their services with promises of big cash awards.
"Clients should never even listen to any promises of money by lawyers because none of the promises are realistic," said Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, who has yet to see any money from the death of his daughter.
In fact lawsuits against T.W.A. could run into the same twofold problem that has slowed cases against Korean Air Lines: Flight 800 was an international route and it crashed in international waters.
Under the Warsaw Convention, a 1929 pact governing the liability of airlines, they do not have to pay more than $75,000 to families of passengers who died on an international flight. By contrast, a domestic aviation disaster would be subject to standard American law, in which plaintiffs have to prove only that the carrier was negligent to win their case. Awards are typically far more substantial, sometimes running into the millions of dollars.
In 1992, Japanese airlines announced that in some circumstances they might be willing to pay more than the $75,000 limit. American Airlines has also waived the limit in two recent crashes.
Some 40 American and international airlines have agreed to waive the limit, but this will not take effect until the agreement is filed with the Department of Transportation. T.W.A. is not yet part of that group, said Kent Martin, a T.W.A. spokesman. Such an agreement would not retroactively cover crashes.
There is another way for the $75,000 limit to be waived: if plaintiffs can show that the airline committed "willful misconduct" -- for example, that it knowingly ignored or violated standard safety measures. Then, new trials or settlements for more money can be sought.
Willful misconduct is difficult and expensive to prove. Lawyers have successfully overcome it in about 10 cases since the Warsaw Convention was signed. They did so in the Korean Air Lines downing, in which they proved that the pilot had strayed into Soviet air space; and in the 1988 bombing of Pan American Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, by proving that Pan Am did not match baggage with its passenger list.
But many awards in those two cases have still not been made. A ruling by the United States Supreme Court in January on the K.A.L. 007 case underlines the second potential problem in the T.W.A. case. If the Warsaw Convention limits are set aside by a showing of willful misconduct, another set of laws must be applied to determine damages.
To the chagrin of the Flight 007 families who had not settled their cases, the Supreme Court said that if a flight crashes in international waters and the plaintiffs are suing in an American court, damage awards will be based on a Federal law called the Death on the High Seas Act.
That act says survivors are not entitled to jury trials and that damages are confined only to the economic worth of the passenger to survivors. So the life of a middle-aged head of a family would be valued at far more than that of a retired person, a homemaker or a young child.
Teen-agers and college students like the members of the Montoursville, Pa., French club fall into a gray area: lawyers must show that the young person would have become a wage-earner and would have been able to give money to their parents out of their salaries.
Possibly anticipating such a situation, T.W.A.'s insurance agents have already asked families of Flight 800 passengers to fill out forms, stating whether the relative smoked cigarettes, said M. Victoria Cummock, whose husband died in the Lockerbie crash and who is advising T.W.A. families. While the medical examiner's office said it needed the forms to help identify the victims, Ms. Cummock said information in them could be used against families in settlement negotiations when the question of life expectancy and economic worth would be raised.
"I know that there were insurance forms and insurance agents who were there very, very early on," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remarked yesterday.
Calls to United States Aviation Underwriters Inc., T.W.A.'s insurance agency, were not returned.
The Death on the High Seas Act is invoked when a crash occurs more than a "marine league," or roughly three miles, offshore; the T.W.A. flight seems to have hit the water about 10 miles off Long Island.
The Warsaw Convention and the Death on the High Seas Act apply only to ticketed passengers. The T.W.A. crew and, possibly, off-duty staff traveling on the jet can claim even less than either the $75,000 or the economic loss: they can seek only worker's compensation.
But as Lee S. Kreindler, a lawyer for the Lockerbie plaintiffs, noted, if a problem with a security system or a mechanical malfunction is found that is not under the control of the carrier, all plaintiffs, including families of T.W.A. employees, may be able to seek much greater awards from other defendants. Those could include makers of the aircraft, like Boeing, or firms that oversee some aspect of security enforcement.

Clinton's Use of Incumbency: The Little Plans Loom Large

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., July 23

 BODY:
As President Clinton barnstorms the country these days -- ahead in the polls but running like an underdog -- his campaign proposals do not so much constitute a platform as a portable, flag-decked front porch planked with row after row of small but worthy ideas.
In the last few months, the President has come out in support of curfews for teen-agers, uniforms in schools, a national registry of sex offenders and a crackdown on deadbeat dads. He has come out against truancy, violence on television, teen-age smoking and teen-age sex. He hardly ever proposes spending Federal money or passing a new law or imposing an ironclad new rule. 
 Instead, Mr. Clinton asks cities, states and the private sector to join him, making it sound like an irresistible crusade, to "go raring into the 21st century united and strong," as he put it in an address to high school students outside Los Angeles on Monday. And in doing so, even his opponents concede, this President has refined the time-tested technique of taking credit for the sunrise into a high political art.
"They may be small, but they do something for somebody and in that sense, they're real news," Marlin Fitzwater, who was press secretary for both Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, said of Mr. Clinton's patchwork of proposals. "Under normal circumstances, you'd just let a Cabinet officer take credit for things like this. Some people will scoff at it, but nevertheless it's effective. I think it's working; he's doing a good job."
Today, Mr. Clinton's topic was domestic violence and, as the son of an abused mother, he's against it. But speaking at a women's crisis center here, he floated a fresh idea to help combat the problem: freeing up the chronically overburdened 911 operators so they can handle more serious calls, like those concerning domestic abuse, by establishing a new, nationwide telephone number for nonemergency calls. "We need a new, national community policing number that's just as simple and easy to remember as 911, so that if you have a tip for the police, if you see a suspicious activity, if a car alarm is going off, you will still be able to call a community policing number," Mr. Clinton said. "But if you have a real emergency, like domestic violence, you can call 911, and this time, your call will go through."
Mr. Clinton did not suggest what he thought such a number should be, or that he would require one to be created. He simply asked the Attorney General to work with the Federal Communications Commission, law enforcement leaders and the telecommunications industry to "develop" one, by an unspecified future date.
To be sure, in every speech, Mr. Clinton dutifully cites his legislative agenda and its more substantial items -- like raising the minimum wage, expanding health insurance coverage and passing new tax credits for college tuition -- most of which is stalled in the Republican-controlled Congress. But he seems to come most alive when he turns to the less sweeping topics.
The President's strategy, developed in collaboration with his adviser Dick Morris, was born of necessity after the Republican Congressional sweep in the 1994 elections tied his hands legislatively. But it has borne fruit beyond the fondest imaginings of most White House aides.
It has the added advantage of letting Mr. Clinton seem upbeat and forward looking, without simply bragging about an overall record of good economic news that he often acknowledges has yet to hit home with the public.
Or as Mr. Clinton put it in his speech to students at Monrovia High School, outside Los Angeles, on Monday, "We know that big statistics don't matter in individual lives unless good things are happening in individual lives -- in families, on blocks, in communities."
In traveling around the country making such proposals, Mr. Clinton has gone the traditional incumbent's strategy one better. Instead of just basking in the Rose Garden, looking Presidential, he is a figure of constant motion, combining a sitting President's majesty with a challenger's energy.
White House aides were quick to note that the original 911 number grew out of the recommendation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement in 1967. The Justice Department has been quietly working on the idea of a nonemergency alternative to 911 and is planning a pilot project with the City of Baltimore.
George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the President, said Cabinet members and agencies were conditioned to provide regular recommendations of such programs for Presidential attention.
The proposals fit several patterns: those that cost Government nothing (requiring school uniforms), those that are paid for by the private sector (the 50,000 cellular telephones to be donated by the cellular phone industry to neighborhood watch groups) and those that cost little and are paid for by reallocating money already appropriated (the $10 million from the Education Department to help school districts devise anti-truancy programs). Mr. Clinton has even gone so far as to simply re-announce programs already under way (the effort by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to track guns used by teen-agers).
Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Clinton, campaigning as a retooled moderate with an abiding belief in the power of Government to do good, has an advantage over his Republican rival, Bob Dole, in touting such programs.
"It's tougher for a conservative who's running on a deficit reduction platform, plus a possible tax cut," Mr. Fitzwater said. "I think this puts a big onus on Senator Dole to come up with his tax cut plan, so he can argue that people could take economic advantage of that to help themselves, open their business, hire two more people and so on."
The White House spokesman Michael D. McCurry said he had no worry that the profusion of such pronouncements risked making the President seem small.
"Is this a Presidential-level announcement?" he asked of the the 911 idea. "You bet. Let's work inch by inch to change people's lives positively."

Speaking at the Women Escaping a Violent Environment Counseling Center in Sacramento, Calif.
 
"We cannot do what we need to do on the issue of domestic violence unless we do something about the stunning fact that the 911 emergency number system today is completely overburdened. Today, it is groaning under the weight of hundreds of thousands of calls a year. Victims of domestic abuse, victims of all violent crime, are having a harder and harder time getting through. Sometimes they have to wait up to 30 minutes for the phone to be answered. That can be way too long. Sometimes they never get through at all. . . .
The reason for the problem is simple and straightforward. Today most calls to 911 are important and serious, but they're not emergencies. They should be handled elsewhere. In some areas, 90 percent of all the calls to 911 are not emergencies. Callers may have a legitimate reason to reach the police, but their calls don't involve crimes in progress or life-threatening situations that need immediate action through 911. It just is the only number they know and so they call it.
So I have asked the Attorney General to work with the Federal Communications Commission, our nation's law-enforcement leaders and the telecommunications industry to relieve the burden on 911 by establishing a new number like 911 for nonemergency telephone calls to the police."

HEADLINE: Sweatshops Contribute to Global Wage Gap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 18 front-page article that says that many workers see their employment in Honduran sweatshops as "the surest road to a better life" points up the complexity of the debate. But that debate should be centered not on whether the apparel assembly plants are good for a country's development but on the responsibility of corporations doing business in these markets to children.
These companies sell their products mostly in Western markets while producing them in areas with the lowest labor costs. Because of these corporations' access to the West, which recognizes basic notions of human rights and decency, it is also incumbent on them to carry out basic notions of human rights and decency in the markets that produce their products. These corporations often are the only ones with the economic power to adopt human rights in the emerging markets. 
 An illustration is Charles Veillon, a Geneva textile importer that implemented an ethical code of conduct for its suppliers in Pakistan and provided financial assistance for education, training and medical care for children there who were being exploited. Charles Veillon was able to make this investment because it reduced the number of its suppliers and entered into longer relationships with them. The suppliers agreed to random audits of their shop floors to assure that they complied with the new code of conduct.
For these achievements, Charles Veillon was awarded the first International Business Conscience Award by the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities last month.

HEADLINE: Land Clearing Starts for Brooklyn Hotel

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
After years of setbacks and with little fanfare, bulldozers began uprooting dozens of trees in a scruffy Brooklyn park last weekend to make way for a major development that will give Brooklyn its first large hotel since the 1930's and is widely considered a key to downtown renewal.
The razing of the park signals the end of 13 years of struggles to secure financing and prospective tenants for the $230 million hotel and office complex known as Renaissance Plaza, a 32-story tower that is to include a 384-room Marriott Hotel. 
 In a borough that has struggled somewhat self-consciously under the long shadows from across the East River, the development has been envisioned as the final validation of downtown Brooklyn's emergence as a business and commercial center.
The development, one of several major construction projects in Brooklyn that are reshaping the aging skyline, will add more than 2,100 new jobs. Developers and city officials hope the complex will give a renewed sense of vibrancy to the downtown district.
"It's a key element of the total revitalization of downtown Brooklyn," said Joshua L. Muss, the Queens developer of the project. "It's going to further prime the pump to start another wave of development."
Planned for a city-owned site bounded by Jay and Adams Streets, the 810,000-square-foot Renaissance Plaza is seen as the centerpiece that will link the area around Court Street, the courthouses and municipal buildings to newer developments nearby, like Metrotech, a $1 billion commercial and academic complex, and Atlantic Center, a $530 million retail and housing complex.
After years of delays, the project moved forward in the last two weeks after the final financial piece fell into place with the signing of an agreement between the developer and the Leucadia National Corporation, which is based in Manhattan. One of Leucadia's subsidiaries, the Empire Insurance Group, will be a principal tenant, renting nine floors.
The other principal tenant will be the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, which will lease 14 floors and consolidate its scattered operations under one roof. Marriott has signed to occupy the first seven floors as a hotel. The hotel is to include a business center, a health club, an indoor swimming pool, a major ballroom and more than 30,000 square feet of convention and meeting space.
Mr. Muss, the developer, and Geary Campbell, a spokeswoman for Marriott Lodging in Bethesda, Md., said extensive market surveys show that the hotel will attract business travelers and out-of-towners visiting friends and relatives in Brooklyn.
Greg Brooks, executive assistant to Borough President Howard Golden, said, "If you ask the Brooklyn business community what is the one thing they are really lacking, most would tell you it's a new hotel."
Small hotels and motels have been built along major thoroughfares in Brooklyn, but no large hotel has been constructed since the era of the great hotels in the 1920's, when the Granada and Towers hotels were built, and the St. George Hotel underwent an extensive renovation in 1930.
Since the latest project was conceived, it has been mired in discussions over financing, possible tenants and companies to manage a hotel. And with back rent due on the land and no firm plan to finance a hotel last year, the city had threatened to take back the property.
Partners in the development are Mr. Muss; Leucadia, a holding company, and the Carlyle Group, a merchant bank in Washington that specializes in mergers and acquisitions.
The financing for the project included the sale of $135 million in bonds backed by the leases and underwritten by Paine Webber. The city is to contribute up to $20.5 million to the project, including the construction of the underground parking garage, and up to $27 million for tenant improvements Mr. Muss said. The Borough President has allocated $3.9 million in capital budget grants for the project, with a portion of it for tree replacement, Mr. Brooks said.
The Renaissance Plaza is expected to generate $306 million in economic activity each year and as much as $9.9 million annually in tax revenues. The project is expected to be completed within two years.
Although final deals were worked out nearly two weeks ago, Lonnie Soury, a spokesman for the developer, said yesterday that there has been nervousness about making a public announcement because of the project's troubled past.
The project has suffered so many setbacks that many residents and office workers were stunned to learn that it was actually taking shape.
"I had my doubts," said Marcel Sager, a civil lawyer in Midwood who graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1986 and knew of the project when he was a student. "Brooklyn has had its ups and downs. They've been talking about this for such a long time."
John Breza, a contractor who lives in the neighborhood, has organized a citizens' group to investigate how the park came to be razed without notice and without regard for trees that date back half a century. "They really didn't expose this too well or try to look for alternatives and try to save open space," he said. "We believe city parks should not be touched."

Acquittal in Odd Drug Case

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE

 BODY:
When Matthew Jack of Plainfield got into a minor auto accident in Montgomery Township in February 1995, the police found something in his wallet that looked like a bouillon cube and contained the hallucinogen bufotenine. Mr. Jack, 31, an unemployed metal worker from Guyana, was charged with drug possession, but he claimed that the cube was "Black Stone," an over-the-counter product that is used to delay ejaculation. 
 Rejecting a plea bargain, Mr. Jack chose to risk five years in prison by going to trial. A state police chemist testified that since 1995, bufotenine has become increasingly popular, said Erin Smith, a Somerset County special deputy attorney general. But yesterday, a jury acquitted Mr. Jack.

HEADLINE: With Karadzic Out, 'Moderate' Serbs Are Hopeful

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 23

 BODY:
As they try to carry out the Dayton peace accord and its vision of a unified, multi-ethnic Bosnia, American and European officials have spoken hopefully about the emergence of "moderate" Bosnian Serbs.
Their hope is that the moderates could counter the power of Radovan Karadzic, the political leader accused of genocide and other war crimes. 
 Once Dr. Karadzic's tight grip on his people is loosened, the theory goes, a less hard-line opposition, willing to work with the Muslims and Croats in a single nation, might gain power, perhaps even in the elections scheduled for Sept. 14.
These hopes have centered on Banja Luka, the only city worth the name in the half of the country held by the Bosnian Serbs, a leafy city of sidewalk cafes and stately buildings with a cosmopolitan air that contrasts sharply with the peasant village of Pale, where Dr. Karadzic's government has its headquarters.
Opposition parties are indeed sprouting here, but moderate is a relative term, and how much the emerging leaders differ from the Pale crowd in their attitudes about Bosnia, and living in harmony with a Muslim majority, is not clear.
Groups emerging to challenge the Serbian Democratic Party, headed until last week by Dr. Karadzic and still controlled by his allies, range from monarchists and a party headed by the notorious warlord Arkan to extreme nationalists to Communists.
But the only opposition groups given any chance of doing well against the dominant party of Dr. Karadzic and his followers are both here in Banja Luka. They are strong because much of Bosnia's Serbian population is in the Banja Luka area and because their leaders enjoy popularity there and have established political organizations.
One is the Socialist Party of the Serbian Republic, headed by a former factory manager and former Mayor of Banja Luka, Zhivko Radisic, 58. This party is effectively the Bosnian branch of the Socialist Party of Radovan Milosevic in Belgrade -- the Serbian President whose drive for a "greater Serbia" is seen by many as a main cause of the four-year Bosnian war.
The other party is the Democratic Patriotic Bloc, led by Predrag Radic, 55, the current Mayor of Banja Luka. He watched as most Muslims and Croats were violently expelled from his city and all its mosques were burned down. But he is said by Western officials to be more a pragmatist than an ideologue, and he disclaims responsibility for war excesses.
The clash between the opposition and the ruling party here seems to be more about power than drastic differences in philosophy. It reflects a historic feud between Banja Luka and the rest of the Serbian-controlled parts of Bosnia.
The Banja Luka leaders also complain that Mr. Karadzic excluded them from his inner circle, and they say that a Pale clique has grown rich from war profiteering.
Ideologically, the differences between the opposition and the party in power are narrow. Mr. Radisic and Mr. Radic each said, for example, that he would not surrender Dr. Karadzic to the international war crimes tribunal. And each said the West had no business forcing Dr. Karadzic to resign.
Moreover, they said, his forced departure from office, if not behind-the-scenes power, last week, engineered by Washington and Belgrade, only gave Dr. Karadzic's party an electoral boost. More than ever, they said, he can be portrayed among Serbs as a hero felled by the West.
In interviews, Mr. Radisic and Mr. Radic avoided direct answers to a question central to the future of Bosnia and the Dayton accord: will the the Bosnian Serbs be part of Bosnia or unite with the Serbian motherland?
In this labyrinth of elections, each man is running for President of the Republika Srpska, as the Bosnian Serb political entity is known. Reflecting how little difference there is between their two coalitions, their parties share the same candidate for the Serbian spot on the three-member federal presidency of Bosnia.
"I'm very pessimistic," said Spasoje Perovic, 59, a Banja Luka journalist who calls himself an independent. "I don't think these elections will bring major change."
Mr. Radisic is a former Communist who was Banja Luka's Mayor in the 1970's when Yugoslavia was still united under Tito. In the 1980's he worked in the Defense Ministry in Belgrade. His two sons fought with the Bosnian Serb army during the 1992-95 war.
Mr. Radic has been criticized by Western human rights organizations because he was Mayor here during the war, when every mosque in this city was destroyed -- along with many Catholic churches -- and most Muslims were forced from the city, along with other non-Serbian ethnic groups.
Mr. Radic blamed the violence on mobs he could not control -- Serbs from other parts of the country who were taking revenge for the destruction of their houses, churches and cemeteries.
Among the opposition, the only democrat and believer in a multi-ethnic state, Western officials and local journalists say, is Miograd Zivanovic, 45, a philosophy professor at the University of Banja Luka, who is the head of the Liberal Party.
"I think that our future is with Bosnia and Herzegovina," Mr. Zivanovic said in an interview. Mr. Zivanovic has made several trips to Sarajevo since the Dayton accord was signed last November. Neither Mr. Radisic nor Mr. Radic has yet ventured to the Bosnian capital.
With that attitude, and a fledgling party, Mr. Zivanovic considered his chances of success in the elections so slim that he joined the Union for Peace and Progress, a coalition headed by Mr. Radisic's Socialist Party.
"Defeating the S.D.S., that is the most important thing," Mr. Zivanovic said, using the Serbian initials of Dr. Karadzic's party, in explaining why he joined in a coalition that includes an array of Communist organizations.
It will not be easy. The ruling party controls all of the radio and television in the Bosnian part of Serbia, and most jobs in a state-run economy.
But Mr. Radisic has a powerful benefactor in Belgrade -- President Milosevic. The Socialist Party of the Republika Srpska is effectively a branch of the Yugoslavia Socialist Party, which means, among other things, money.
"Choose your poison," said one Western analyst, noting the choice in an election that comes down to Milosevic Socialists, who have shown little inclination to democracy or a market economy in Yugoslavia, or the Serbian Democratic Party, still led by men and women who are strong Serbian nationalists and disavow Dayton.
"If you have to choose between two evils, better to choose socialists than nationalists," said Radmila Karas, 33, a Banja Luka journalist, explaining why she would vote for Mr. Radisic's alliance.
Mr. Radisic and Mayor Radic indicated that their preference was for a Bosnian Serb republic closely integrated with Yugoslavia, though how close, they avoided saying exactly.
Whatever the future, it should happen peacefully, like the separation between the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Mr. Radisic said.
"War for nobody, for nobody," he said, with deep emotion.
To that extent, they may offer a change from the past.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Bounces Back on News From Germany and Japan

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar shrugged off a drop in Wall Street stocks yesterday, as currency traders took heart from growing prospects of lower interest rates in Germany and receding fears of higher rates in Japan.
 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 107.86 yen from 107.44 on Monday. The dollar traded at 1.4890 marks from 1.4850. The British pound rose to $1,5526 from $1.5505.
 The dollar briefly dropped to a two-month low of 106.95 yen over-night in Asia on lingering worries over a possible rate increase in Japan. The dollar moved back above 107 yen, however, as traders awaited the Bank of Japan's quarterly economic outlook for clues on the direction of Japanese interest rates.
 Some traders expected the central bank's survey to point to a credit tightening, but the surprisingly bleak tone of the report halted speculation of higher interest rates, helping lift the dollar toward 108.00 yen. The Japanese central bank said the economy was moving toward and self-sustained recovery but at a slow temp.
 "People were expecting a rate hike and disappointment was reflected in the market, with the dollar rising close to 108 yen," said Jeffrey Yu, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank.
 The dollar advanced against the mark in Europe on expectations of a 25-basis-point cut in German interest rates when the Bundesbank's policy-setting committee meets tomorrow. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 Expectations of lower German rates were encouraged by comments by Ernst Welteke, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-setting committee meets tomorrow. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
 Expectations of lower German rates were encouraged by comments by Ernst Welteke, a member fo the Bundesbank council, who said the central bank would seriously discuss a change in short-term rates if economic data allowed.
 "The impression that the Japanese are not going to raise rates and the possibility the Germans will lower rates is a counter to the general negative sentiment on the dollar," said Peter Wadkins, vice president at Standard Chartered Bank.
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin also helped the dollar when he told reporters in Washington that he saw no signs of inflation heating up and predicted the continuation of solid economic growth with low inflation.
 Marginally higher stock prices helped lift confidence in the dollar in early New York trading. But stocks later tumbled.

HEADLINE: Art and Sobriety, One Day at a Time

BYLINE: By MOLLY O'NEILL 

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y.

 BODY:
THE asphalt-shingled house in Troy looks like thousands of others that were built for laborers in the late 1800's, when work abounded. Such houses faded, like the ambitions of those who inhabited them, when opportunity moved elsewhere.
But 437 Sixth Avenue shelters neither dwindling expectations nor broken dreams. It is the headquarters of the Hermitage des Artistes, a collective of five artisans, all recovering alcoholics, who have whittled together a renaissance of tramp art and reclaimed their own lives in the process. 
 In the last five years, Michael Lavery, Andrew Stutter, Paul Cunningham, Ira Rogoff and Jim Kennedy have ferreted out discarded fruit crates, the preferred medium for contemporary tramp art, shaped the wood slats into decorative objects and carved some whimsy, some beauty, some hope into each piece. Notch by notch. One day at a time.
They have created music boxes and picture frames, patriotic and religious installations and allegorical sculptures in the rococo carving style that was first practiced by itinerant men after the Civil War.
Change the word "hobo" to "homeless," replace "an obsession with riding the rails" with "an addiction to alcohol and drugs," and the Hermitage des Artistes mirrors the cultural confluence that has always bred tramp art: a disenfranchisement that makes idle hands itch for useful work.
On a summer afternoon, electric fans creaked through the warren of carving nooks on the first floor of the house shared by the five Hermitage members. The scent of varnish mixed with the garlicky aroma of a stew simmering in the kitchen. Above the steady chip, chip, chip of knife blade against board, Pat Boone crackled on a battered radio, and Mr. Kennedy had one question for the dealer who called to announce a significant sale.
"Yes, of course, I know they bought it," he said emphatically, squinting through his bifocals like a batter trying to discern a hit from a foul ball. "But did they like it?"
Previous generations of tramps didn't deal in mass marketing. But pieces by the Hermitage des Artistes are now sold in 50 galleries and stores across the United States. The artists' work is displayed at the Smithsonian Institution, in dozens of folk-art museums, even in the Vatican Museum.
Today's tramps see a certain poetry in creating art from what society has discarded. They themselves were discards, they say. Tramp art is their spiritual path, their sobriety.
In the wake of the Civil War, the original tramps had their knives and "they had their pride," Mr. Rogoff said. "They didn't accept something for nothing, they didn't rob, they didn't hurt people, they took what society had thrown away and turned it into something beautiful."
Whittling a statue of Uncle Sam, Mr. Lavery said, "St. Frances told the monks that they could pray and meditate alone all they wanted, but if they didn't work at a craft, they'd never have a spiritual life."
The Hermitage des Artistes is more than a woodworking shop. It is a communal home, open to troubled wanderers, headquarters for lobbying on behalf of the Mohawk Indians, a meeting spot for environmentalists, a tramp-art archive and the spiritual center of a five-man support group of recovering alcoholics.
For each man, every notch he carves puts that much distance between himself and the streets. Or worse. "Eight years ago, I was homeless, I was insane, I was a drunk," Mr. Lavery, 48, said. "Today, I have a spiritual life, I have a craft, I have a home."
Every piece carved at the Hermitage tells the craftsman's story again and again and again. First there was alcoholism, spiritual bankruptcy and destitution. Then there was surrender, a sort of redemption and a covenant that included good works and abiding faith. Next came food, shelter and clothing. And finally diligence, art and serenity.
Like his colleagues, Mr. Lavery sees life in threes. To him, it is no coincidence that the basic cut in tramp art is a three-sided notch, the basic shape a pyramid.
"You need food, shelter and clothing to have belief, work and a spiritual life," he said, "but you need a spiritual life to appreciate food, shelter and clothing."
Hunched over the accumulating layers that will become Uncle Sam, Mr. Lavery is himself a burly pyramid: paint-spattered jeans and denim shirt, thick handlebar mustache, blue eyes piercing through folds of ruddy skin, a navy blue tam-o'-shanter. He has been carving since the winter of 1988.
Homeless, he had been a squatter at 437 Sixth Avenue, an abandoned store with adjoining tenements. His bed was a plank propped on two discarded radiators; he sponge-bathed in a sink that had no running water; he tried to stay warm. And he carved.
"I always carved," he said. Growing up in Rensselaer, N.Y., in the 1950's, restless and poor, he played in the rail yards and learned notch carving from the men who rode the trains. Unlike the other members of the Hermitage, Mr. Lavery dreamed of being an artist.
Mr. Stutter, 40, was formerly a fire-extinguisher repairman; Mr. Cunningham, 43, taught homeless children; Mr. Rogoff, 41, was a health-care worker; Mr. Kennedy, 59, foraged for rare books, which he sold when he could bear to part with them. Among his finds: first editions of Thomas Merton and Freud.
Each was handy and, as their drinking progressed and their careers foundered, each worked sporadically. Mr. Lavery renovated buildings, concentrating on using discards and found objects.
BUT by the winter of 1988, he was unemployable, he said. Huddled in a ratty sleeping bag, he put down the bottle of Gypsy Rose wine and picked up a carving knife again. He worked alone at first, peddling his wares outside the state office buildings in Albany. Through a series of coincidences -- though Mr. Lavery does not believe in coincidence -- he met Mr. Stutter.
Mr. Lavery taught Moose Stutter, the group's strong man, to carve; Moose, who had stopped drinking two years previously, taught Mike Lavery to pray. Then they met Huggy Cunningham, the tree lover, then Stats Kennedy, the brains of the Hermitage. Last fall, Mr. Rogoff, nicknamed Watercooler because he stands around gabbing, joined the group.
"I had to teach other men so that I'd have company, and I had to have company to stay sober," Mr. Lavery said. "We're a male support system, like a family, but better."
He considered the patriotic statue in his hands. "Troy was the home of Uncle Sam, you know," he said. "He was a butcher during the Civil War." In an adjacent cubbyhole, Mr. Stutter tacked layers of wood together to create a music box. In another tiny work area, Mr. Cunningham used cardboard templates to trace and then cut shapes that would become a picture frame.
The Hermitage des Artistes uses about 6,000 fruit crates a year, collected at dawn from supermarkets' Dumpsters. From discarded grape box to carved object, the wood, like the men who transform it, remains within the cramped 500 square feet that is their office, studio and shipping department.
Last year, the Hermitage produced 3,500 decorative objects, which typically sell for $50 to $150. Mr. Lavery also carved a diorama-size version of Noah's ark, populating it with Mohawk Indians fleeing the smallpox plague; a desk shaped like a locomotive; various pieces with a baseball motif, and a life-size statue of Kateri Tekakwitha, a young Mohawk who lived from 1656 to 1680 and is being considered for sainthood by the Roman Catholic Church.
"Kateri wants to be sainted, and we're part of the process," Mr. Lavery said. "We're leaning on the Pope." His statue of her is now in the Vatican collection.
As Mr. Lavery talked, Mr. Rogoff used hoof clippers to dismantle fruit crates, and Mr. Kennedy took telephone orders and scribbled a production plan.
After being discovered last August by Clifford and Gayle Wallach, Manhattan collectors and tramp-art experts who began to promote their work, the Hermitage artists received enough orders to keep them busy well into the next century.
"We're not a factory," Mr. Lavery said. "Every day we have to accept who we are and what we can do. I am working with some prisoners. I mean, you can give these guys all the psychotherapy in the world, but put a knife in their hands and give them some wood, and you'll see real changes."
Mr. Lavery's 15-year-old son, Chris, is showing promise as a carver, and Mr. Rogoff has ambitions for his son as well.
"Most of us were married," Mr. Lavery said. "We all miss our families. We all want to pass our craft, our experience, our strength and our hope along. That's part of the tradition."
Those who have studied tramp art question the romance of the road that the Hermitage des Artistes contends it is maintaining.
"The notion that these pieces were made solely by itinerant men in exchange for food and shelter and only in America is questionable," said Helaine Fendelman, whose book "Tramp Art," a catalogue for an exhibition at the Museum of American Folk Art in 1975, was published by Dutton.
"Notched carving," she said, "is common throughout northern Europe, Scandinavia and Russia, suggesting that immigrant craftsmen may have pioneered its use in this country."
While many small mirrors, frames and boxes were certainly carved by tramps in exchange for food, she said, larger pieces like tables and beds took decades to construct and were carved by settled, professional men.
Gerard Wertkin, the director of the Museum of American Folk Art in Manhattan, said that tramp art emerged initially just after the Civil War, when unemployment was high and industrialization was growing. The form was most common in upstate New York and in Pennsylvania, where cigar factories (hence the proto-American medium, the cigar box) were plentiful, but pieces have been found as far south as Texas and as far west as California. Tramp art faded when economic prosperity returned. The tradition was briefly revitalized in the years preceding the Depression.
As cybertechnology has emerged in the last five years, interest in tramp art has increased, and prices have taken a big jump. "The picture frame I bought for $400 five years ago recently sold for $1,200," said Mr. Wallach, the Manhattan dealer.
Why now? "Nostalgia, the simplicity, the ingenuity and the comfort of something handmade," Mrs. Wallach said. "And it's still affordable."
As Mr. Stutter wrapped the music box he had finished in pages of old sheet music, Mr. Lavery taped together discarded cardboard boxes to create a shipping container for his Uncle Sam.
He will paint the box with a scene from the life of the Hermitage des Artistes. Maybe a painting of the guys on the bus they bought from the Albany County Jail, which they use to tour the country, seeking out the homeless as well as other folk artists. Maybe the scene around the campfire when they stop at the end of the day and forage along the roadside for the makings of a stew. They've used squirrels, raccoons and stray cats, Mr. Lavery said.
Every shipping container bears hand-painted scenes from the men's lives. There is Mike Lavery, playing his banjo. There is Andy Stutter bowling on Friday night. There's Jim Kennedy reading, as usual.
The U.P.S. truck comes every day at 4 P.M. Everybody seemed a little sad to see the boxes stacked on the dolly. Mr. Lavery was pensive as he began to paint a picture of the Statue of Liberty holding a bundle on a stick.
Was he worried about the future?
"Not really," he said, "I've accomplished everything I set out to accomplish. I mean, it's going to be hard to top the Vatican Museum."
Did he have regrets about the past?
He ran his thick, calloused finger through the series of pyramids that formed the Uncle Sam he was about to ship. "I had to have my past to have my present," he said.
He waved his arm in an arc that seemed to bless the cramped workshop. "This," he said, "is as close to doing the Sistine Chapel as you can get."

THE antique tramp art above, all from private collections, dates from 1910 to 1940. Dealers at the Fall Antiques Show, Sept. 26 to 29 at the Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street, are expected to display about 1,000 pieces of tramp art. These stores in Manhattan carry contemporary tramp art, some by the Hermitage des Artistes: ABC Carpet and Home, 888 Broadway (19th Street); Leo Design, 413 Bleecker Street (West 11th Street), and the Museum of American Folk Art's shop, Columbus Avenue at 65th Street.

USAir and America West Report Big Earnings Gains

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Two airlines, USAir and America West, reported healthy gains yesterday in second-quarter earnings.
USAir Group Inc. said its earnings increased 77.9 percent, as the airline cut capacity and filled more of the remaining seats with paying passengers. The company's net income rose to $200.8 million, or $2.71 a share, from $112.9 million, or $1.47 a share, in the second quarter last year. 
 Revenue rose 8.4 percent, to $2.15 billion from $1.98 billion.
Wall Street had expected the airline to earn $1.34 a share, based on the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. USAir shares rose 75 cents, to $17.625.
"Beneficial economic and industry conditions, coupled with the keen focus of our employees toward making USAir the carrier of choice, produced a record quarter," Stephen Wolf, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
The company, based in Arlington, Va., said its load factor, or the percentage of seats filled, rose to 71.1 percent from 67.0 percent.
Traffic for the quarter inched up six-tenths of 1 percent, to 10 billion revenue passenger miles, which represent the number of miles flown by paying customers. Capacity declined to 14 billion available seat-miles from 15 billion.
The company's cost for each available seat-mile rose almost 13 percent in the quarter, to 12.75 cents from 11.30 cents.
Much of that was caused by aviation fuel expenses, which rose 10.9 percent, to $170.6 million. Fuel prices rose 17 percent, to 61.87 cents a gallon from 52.71 cents. USAir's consumption of aviation fuel dropped 5.5 percent, to 276 million gallons.
USAir said it had set aside $41.2 million for its profit-sharing plan during the quarter. It also received $29.5 million from the subleasing of certain aircraft whose value had previously been written down.
The profit-sharing plan covers employees who took pay cuts in 1992 and 1993, when the company had heavy losses. The employees are now entitled to payments because the company is again earning money. About $73.7 million was paid in March as a result of profits for 1995.
Also yesterday, America West Airlines Inc. said an expanded flight schedule helped increase its earnings by 36 percent, even though they were depressed by special charges lingering from its bankruptcy.
America West, which is based in Phoenix, earned $28.4 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $464 million in the second quarter. Last year, it earned $20.8 million, or 46 cents a share, on revenue of $400 million.
The average estimate of 7 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc. was for earnings of 55 cents a share. The stock of America West slipped 12.5 cents yesterday, to $15.625.
The company's latest quarter included an $8 million noncash charge tied to the more than three years that the company spent under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The airline emerged from bankruptcy in 1994.
For the first half of 1996, America West earned $42 million, or 84 cents a share, up from $26 million, or 58 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue was $877 million, up from $746 million.
Last year, America West announced layoffs of 1,000 employees. The airline said last September that it would increase capacity by 29 percent over the next two years. America West, which has its primary hub in Phoenix, has also begun service to Anchorage, Detroit and San Antonio and has increased its service to 12 other cities. It also plans to start service to Miami and Cleveland.

Municipal bond investors could wind up in an I.R.S. crackdown.

BYLINE: By Sharon R. King 

 BODY:
BUYERS of municipal bonds beware: The Federal Government is cracking down on an illegal price-gouging practice in which bond underwriters overcharge municipal issuers for securities used to set up bond escrow funds. In the process, the I.R.S. may wind up hurting investors who bought the bonds.
This week, the Treasury outlined rule changes aimed at increasing bond issuers' reliance on a special type of Treasury security specifically intended for escrow accounts. By making the securities more attractive, Treasury officials say, they hope to encourage their use and eliminate the opportunities for underwriters to sell issuers Treasury securities at illegally high prices -- a practice known in the municipal bond market as yield burning. 
 Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service is setting up a one-year amnesty program to allow issuers who have sold deals tainted by yield burning to pay up.
If the issuers do not comply, the agency's weapon of last resort would be to declare that the tax-free bonds are taxable after all: a step that would, in effect, require investors to foot the bill for the underwriters' illegal behavior.
James Lebenthal, chairman of Lebenthal & Company, the New York City municipal bond retailer, called the I.R.S. strategy "a Kafka-esque nightmare." He added, "The lunacy is putting the issuer on the spot and saying 'Somebody is going to pay -- and I don't care if it is the victim, the perpetrator, the bystander or the bystander's mother-in-law.' "
The Treasury's latest moves are part of a broader effort to address yield burning, a practice that may have cost the agency billions of dollars in lost tax revenues. Here is how the practice works: To refinance their old, expensive debt when interest rates fall, municipalities often sell new bonds and put the proceeds into temporary escrow accounts. By law, those accounts cannot generate a higher rate of interest than the rate on the newly issued bonds; if they do, the excess is considered to be arbitrage profit, and it must be rebated to the Federal Government.
To comply with that law, issuers typically buy a mix of ordinary Treasury securities in the open market or special securities, called slugs, from the Treasury. In yield burning, underwriters sell the issuers Treasury securities at inflated prices, which cuts the yield to levels that appear to meet the escrow requirements but that also generate substantial profits for the underwriters. By some estimates, underwriters may have earned $2 billion to $3 billion of illegal profits from yield burning since the late 1970's.
The I.R.S. will not say how much money it thinks it can collect through this campaign, which could affect more than $270 billion of bonds issued since 1986. The bonds in question are known as advance refundings, which require the establishment of escrow funds and are vulnerable to yield burning.
But the I.R.S. initiative seems to offer little incentive for municipalities to bear the cost of checking the prices they paid for Treasury securities on those long-ago deals. And if issuers do not come forward, the tax agency has to catch them through a formal audit, which is likely to be aimed only at the largest issuers.
It is virtually impossible for nervous investors to determine whether their bonds were subject to yield burning, Mr. Lebenthal said, except perhaps by calling the issuing municipality and asking whether any yield burning occurred in the transaction. A response is unlikely, he added.
Some bond experts say the I.R.S. is likely to strip disputed bonds of their tax exemption only as a last resort. But the agency has taken such steps before. In the late 1980's, the I.R.S. declared taxable five municipal bond deals including two underwritten by the former Matthews & Wright investment bank. In the end, investors were spared the tax consequences only because those involved in the deals paid penalties to settle the dispute.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Duty on Welfare

 BODY:
President Clinton says he might sign welfare legislation if Congressional negotiators improve the House- and Senate-passed bills in a conference committee. He should stop shadow-boxing. The House's bill is odious. The Senate's is only slightly less so. The conferees will produce a compromise somewhere in between. That is not a place a Democratic President should stand.
The conferees will hand the President a bill that, like the bills they will work from, will hurl more than a million children into poverty. It will slice food stamps by an average of $600 for families earning less than $6,300 a year. It will strip legal immigrants, including some elderly, of health insurance. It will, for the first time ever, tell workers who lose their jobs after years of steady work that they cannot collect food stamps for their children. President Clinton will find no honorable reason, in his own promises of welfare reform or the history of his party, to sign such a bill. 
 The President is right that the Senate softened some of the worst provisions of the House bill. The House bill would allow states to take over the food stamp program, thereby wiping out the Federal guarantees and benefit levels. The Senate bill would not. The House bill would set a limit of 90 days for food stamps for workers under the age of 50. That provision would deny food stamps to a worker who collected the stamps for three months in his 20's, worked steadily for the next 25 years and was then laid off. The Senate would limit food stamps to four months in any year. The House bill would strip Medicaid coverage from current and future legal immigrants. The Senate would cover many current immigrants.
Though better, the Senate's bill is offensive in other ways. It imposes a five-year time limit on benefits and some tight limits on food stamps, throwing millions into poverty who run out the string before they can find work. The Senate tells states to put recipients to work, but provides little money -- for job training and day care -- to make that mandate a reality. The Senate makes no effort to provide clothes, medicine or other necessities for children whose parents are cut off welfare. It also allows states to make huge cuts in their welfare spending without penalty. Nor does the Senate bill provide much money to handle swollen welfare rolls during recessions.
To find serious fault with the House and Senate bills is not to deny the need for reform. The welfare system discourages work, encourages dependence and can foster family breakdown. But Congress's arrogance in reshaping 61-year-old institutions is shocking. No one knows how time limits and many other provisions will work out in practice. Critics say they will pummel children and many innocent parents. The G.O.P. says that time limits will force recipients to take responsibility for finding work.
Maybe so. But there is no evidence that time limits will work as promised. If they do not, it is the children who will suffer most. If Congress were serious about reform, and not waging ideological vendettas, then it would watch what happens when states experiment with time limits and other reforms. Wisconsin has asked Washington for permission to impose time limits on welfare benefits and guaranteed work opportunities. Before Congress sets up an untested system nationwide, it might at least see whether such limits work in Wisconsin, which benefits from a flush economy and competent state government.
The Republicans think they have cornered Mr. Clinton. Either he will alienate his liberal constituents by signing their bill, they think, or he will alienate a huge chunk of the middle class by vetoing it. Mr. Clinton vetoed two previous G.O.P. measures, contending that they would hurt children.
With November looming, Mr. Clinton is wavering. He stopped his staff from producing a new estimate of the Congressional proposal's impact on children -- an estimate that would surely have shown that the new legislation is only marginally different from the bills he vetoed. Even without those official estimates, he knows very well what the consequences will be. He should also know he will be harming children and blemishing his record of compassion if he signs the Congressional bill.

Treasury Prices Post Sharp Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday after demand at an auction of five-year notes was weaker than expected.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 25/32 , to 874/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.04 percent, from 6.97 percent on Tuesday. 
 The Treasury sold $12.5 billion of new five-year notes, with the high yield at 6.625 percent -- higher than the 6.58 to 6.59 percent dealers had expected.
"Originally expectations were for a 6.58 percent yield, but had to push the yield back to 6.625 percent in order to get the auction done," said Jack Regan, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
The bid-to-cover ratio at the auction -- the total amount bid against the size of the auction -- was an unimpressive 2.16 to 1.
"The low bid-to-cover ratio we had yesterday and today," Mr. Regan, referring also to Tuesday's auction of new two-year bills, "have been the lowest in a long period."
Traders said it was likely that securities dealers ended up holding more of the issue on their shelves than they wanted, noting that there was a lack of interest among investors further along the yield curve.
But Mr. Regan said the poor auction results did not damage the bullish tone of the market, but dented it.
Robert R. Giordano, first vice president and Treasurer of Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, said the poor outcome of the auction was understandable, especially with so much uncertainty swirling through the market.
"No one was bidding aggressively at this auction," Mr. Giordano said. "There was no real good reason to bid strong, especially with more supply coming in a few weeks and so close to the July employment report next week on Friday, which will have a huge impact on the market. And that number represents the last hope for those who still believe the economy will slow. If there is no sizeable reduction in the number, the Fed will tighten."
The bond prices did receive support from the stock market in early trading, after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 70 points. But as stocks rebounded, bonds gave back those gains.
Still, "bond participants focused more on the bond market's internals today," Mr. Regan said, "and did not necessarily trade against the stock market's volatility."
Next week promises a number of critical economic reports. The data "could be chock full of surprises for both bonds and equities and could be the mental trigger for Fed action, perhaps earlier than the Aug. 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee," Mr. Regan said. "With that much apprehension there are few in the market that are willing to take strong positions now."
Mr. Regan says that for the balance of the week it appears the market will be trading in a range of between 6.90 percent and 7.10 percent on the long bond. "We did get to 7.05 percent today and we were at 6.93 percent earlier in the week," he said. "Tomorrow's June durable goods orders and existing-home sales should be market friendly because of the strong data in the prior months. Plus we will have the weekly initial jobless claims, so there will something for everyone."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

The big story on President Clinton's Western swing this week was that Newsweek sent Anna Deavere Smith as its White House correspondent.
Let's put aside the absurdity of Newsweek assigning the writer and actress, who played a White House press secretary in the movie "The American President" and is now working on a book and a play about political reporters, to cover a news story. 
 The White House was philosophical. "She writes plays and Joe Klein writes novels," said a top Clinton aide, slyly. "Newsweek has a precedent."
And certainly, if Ms. Smith was looking to document the fecklessness of the press, what better evidence than her own instant and bizarre accreditation?
Besides, the news magazine's editors were busy fitting Joe Klein for a hair shirt, wallowing in ethical angst and insisting that the author once known as Anonymous endure a short season in purgatory. The managing editor, Richard Smith, said Mr. Klein had to subject himself to "the full force" of the feelings of his hurt and jealous colleagues, allowing them to vent "individually or in small groups." (A 12-step program for pseudonymous authors.)
The real issue in sending the talented Ms. Smith on the campaign trip is whether it was unfair to give the President such tough competition in performance art.
Bill Clinton, after all, is a metamorphosis artist, performing the roles of New Democrat, Old Democrat, radical liberal and conservative all in his first term. He has gone from being a President with sweeping plans about changing the way government works to a President who wants to change people's lives "inch by inch," as his press secretary put it here on Tuesday.
Instead of the Great Society, Mr. Clinton now brings us the Itsy-Bitsy Society. Instead of a rendezvous with destiny, he has an appointment with detail. From grand, epic-making schemes of social engineering, he has come around to suggestions that we cross a few t's and dot a couple of i's.
What bold new visions will the President come up with next?
Will he ask Health and Human Services to make doctors stop putting really old magazines in their waiting rooms? Will he ask the Department of Transportation to take action on rumble strips?
Bob Dole's campaign is so clueless -- he's 27 points behind in California, a state he still thinks is in play -- that some in the party are faxing each other ideas about how to persuade him to step down.
But at least Republicans can take comfort that their 1994 revolution lives on at the White House, where Dick Morris, the protean consultant for the protean President, churns out teensy-weensy pronouncements on truancy, school uniforms, curfews and deadbeat dads that give Mr. Clinton the aura of principal, if not principle.
In Sacramento, the President took a firm stand against busy signals on 911. He bemoaned "the stunning fact that the 911 emergency number system today is completely overburdened," and said there should be another national number for non-emergency calls.
George Stephanopoulos puts the best gloss on the President's voluntary simplification, saying he's getting small because he's "already taken care of all the big things like the economy and inflation and unemployment."
But maybe the President who rode out of the West, Ronald Reagan, was the end of the era of big themes and big issues, fighting the Commies and getting government off people's backs. Maybe when Bill and Hillary Clinton's big ideas backfired in 1993, and when Newt Gingrich's big ideas backfired in 1995, Americans decided they preferred little stuff that speaks to their real lives, lives shaped by the end of the cold war and yuppie narcissism.
We seem to have decided that if we can't have a straight-talking President who articulates a consistent vision, we'd at least like someone who can get us some cellular phones for our neighborhood crime watch groups.
So it's come down to this: Bill Clinton is running for re-election on the promise that he will make himself useful. If he's not going to be a leader, we want him to be a fixer.

HEADLINE: U.S.-China Talks Continue; Tone Is Warmer Despite Differences

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 24

 BODY:
As relations between the nations continue their tentative thaw, the United States and China agreed today on an ambitious schedule of high-level meetings that could lead to the first Chinese-American summit meeting since 1992.
At a meeting here, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China emphasized the positive aspects of the often difficult relationship, while touching only generally on areas of deep disagreement, including China's human rights record, according to a senior American official. 
 "As the post-cold-war agenda unfolds, it has become clear that there are some essential areas of cooperation that are emerging," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
He said Mr. Christopher, who has now met Mr. Qian 14 times in countries around the world, accepted an invitation to China in November. At that time, if President Clinton has won re-election, Mr. Christopher and Mr. Qian could discuss a possible summit meeting, the official added.
The official also outlined a series of cabinet-level meetings planned before the end of the year on trade, the economy, the military, national security and science and technology.
"We continue to believe there should be a productive base for these meetings, and we think we have been laying that base in recent months," he said. He cited discussions on nuclear nonproliferation, the extension of China's most-favored-nation trade status, the easing of some tensions over Taiwan, the agreement reached on intellectual property rights and China's continued cooperation regarding North Korea.
The official acknowledged that relations with China will never be easy, but said it appears that both Governments have decided to focus on areas where they can work together, like combating international crime and the narcotics trade, dealing with the smuggling of aliens and confronting specific issues like North Korea and Cambodia.
The American official said Mr. Qian had listened without objection when Mr. Christopher expressed the hope that China would honor its political and economic pledges when it takes over Hong Kong next year.
And he said Mr. Qian did not rule out acceptance of a draft nuclear test ban treaty that the United States and Russia agreed on Tuesday to support.
At the same time, the official said, human rights were discussed only in general terms, with Mr. Christopher refraining from his past practice of raising specific Chinese violations.
"The Secretary made it clear that the full potential in our relations could not be realized without progress on human rights," the official said.
But the official added: "We are realistic and we know that this relationship, because of conflicting perspectives and cultures and ideologies, is always going to be difficult to manage."
The meetings here are part of the Administration's effort to manage the relationship through personal contacts, the official said. Mr. Christopher is in Jakarta for four days of bilateral and multilateral meetings with the members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, or Asean.
Among his talks today, Mr. Christopher met with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts to discuss their attempts to persuade North Korea to join them for a briefing on issues on the peninsula.
Mr. Christopher has also used various forums here to urge Asean members to join the United States in pressing Myanmar to improve its human rights policies.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Tiger Economy Has Become a Fading Vision For Vietnam

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
After a Communist Party congress in early July, the American assessment of Vietnam's newly announced economic policies came down to this: "Nothing horrible happened."
That is a far cry from the optimism of a year ago when Washington improved relations with Hanoi and investors saw Vietnam as Asia's next tiger economy, rich in natural resources, cheap labor and with a big, hungry market. 
 The party congress, while confirming that there will no turning back from Vietnam's drastically liberalized economy, endorsed the slow and cautious approach that has frustrated many foreign business executives recently.
That left most of these investors resigned to the fact that if they wish to do business here, Vietnam may offer good long-term prospects but not quick profits.
"We are not scaling down; we are here for the long haul," Edgar Melicor, who represents Caterpillar in Hanoi, said with a touch of weariness. "We will play the game as it is played now. We just don't have any very big short-term expectations," he said, echoing the sentiments of other American business executives.
While Vietnam's leaders set ambitious goals for growth at the congress, they were determined to maintain central party control and to keep major industries in Government hands.
Although declaring war on the corruption that saps the economy, they sidestepped vexing uncertainties in investment law and financing regulations that foreign businessmen say are holding them back.
They did, however, ease the restrictions on "social evils," including foreign advertising, that had sent a chill through the overseas business community.
"Before the congress, people were definitely worried," said Michael J. Scown, a lawyer with Russin & Vecchi who heads the American Chamber of Commerce here. "There is a sense of relief now. Nothing horrible happened, so we are all happy about that."
Eugene A. Matthews, an investment consultant who heads the Ashta Capital Group, said the most important message of the congress was political stability. Although it balked at replacing the country's three top leaders, all in their 70's, it sent a message of careful, managed political change and a steady and measured opening of the economy.
"Hey, you guys, this is an engine that is not going to go 100 m.p.h.," Mr. Matthews said. "This is not a Ferrari. I think they're learning as they go. They're just going to take their time."
Luu H. Le, the country manager for the Bank of America, views the situation from the useful perspective of a Vietnamese-American.
"It is a typical case of Eastern and Western value systems," he said. "For the Vietnamese, one generation, two generations, so what. But if an American does not bring in results in one month, he's in trouble. That's the basic challenge for foreign companies. If you come in for a quick buck, forget it."
Despite the difficulties, the American business presence in Vietnam has continued to grow. As many as 400 companies now operate in Vietnam, including representatives of close to 100 of the Fortune 500, Mr. Scown said.
Two-way trade between the nations doubled over the last year, to $500 million, including $361 million in exports from the United States, principally in transportation and communications equipment.
From just $3.3 million in 1993, American investment in Vietnam rose to $1.2 billion last year, making the United States the sixth-leading foreign investor here, still trailing Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. Most of this investment has been in transportation, light industry, agriculture and oil and gas.
The next steps to improve business opportunities here could come from Washington, a number of American business executives said. While diplomatic relations have improved, there are still moves to be made on the economic front.
American executives are eager for Congress to grant a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment that withholds certain advantages from countries that do not allow free emigration. Such a waiver would help American exporters and infrastructure companies by giving them the kind of Federal Government financing that most of their Asian and European competitors receive.
Over the longer term, the business leaders are pushing for a trade agreement and ultimately for most-favored-nation status for Vietnam. But to conclude a trade agreement the Vietnamese are faced with a list of detailed American demands. These involve questions of market access, Government transparency and nondiscrimination as well as such issues as intellectual property rights that will require difficult political decisions by the Vietnamese.
Peter Rider, the chairman of a joint-venture property development company in Hanoi called Doan Ket, took the long view, saying: "If you look back over the past 10 years it's pretty impressive. They've come a long ways. They have a long ways to go but you can't ignore that they've just opened up enormously.
"For anyone who expected the congress to come out and say, here's a new mortgage law, new regulations for convertibility of the dong, a new and easier process to extend visas -- that was just unrealistic."
But a Western diplomat noted that continuing economic liberalization -- including tax and tariff changes -- were all but locked in by Vietnam's commitments in joining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asian Free Trade Association and a verbal commitment to join the World Trade Organization.
"The message to foreign business investors is: Vietnam will not be an easy place -- a contract is still not a contract in the usual sense -- but reform is clearly on," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against the Yen On Doubt Over Rate Increase

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen as stocks in the United States erased most of their losses and currency traders bet that the Bank of Japan would refrain from raising interest rates anytime soon.
The dollar fell even before stock markets in New York opened amid concern stocks would extend this month's losses, then rebounded as shares recovered, traders said. 
 "We saw a lot of selling first thing in New York because a lot of people thought the Dow would open lower," but the drop didn't last, said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at the Republic National Bank of New York.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks rebounded from a loss of more than 76 points, or 1.4 percent, and closed up 8.14 points at 5,354.69.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar settled at 108.40 yen, up from 107.86 yen on Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.4890 German marks, unchanged from Tuesday. The British pound was also unchanged at $1.5525.
The dollar was bolstered against the yen by a view that the Bank of Japan would be slow to raise interest rates from record lows.
In its quarterly economic report on Tuesday, the Japanese central bank said the economy was recovering at a slower pace than in the past. Analysts took the lukewarm assessment as proof the central bank was not poised to raise rates.
"The dollar should be higher," said Marc Chandler, currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "No matter how uncertain the U.S. economic outlook is, Europe is worse and the Japanese economy is still suffering."
The early decline in United States stocks had less of an impact on the dollar against the yen because Japanese stocks also plunged, fueling expectations that the Bank of Japan would be reluctant to raise rates until an economic recovery takes root. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 2.5 percent yesterday.
The weakness of the German economy has led many analysts to predict the Bundesbank will lower its securities repurchase rate, now 3.3 percent, at a policy meeting today.
Still, some investors and analysts said that the Bundesbank might defer a rate cut until it is certain that there is no danger of inflation.

HEADLINE: Technology's Edict: Adapt Or Lose Out;
Change Drives Growth, But Puts Labor at Risk

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: NEW MILFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Louie Pokrywka made a false start before bringing an elaborate schematic of the Kleenex production line to his computer screen. "Until a few weeks ago I hadn't sat down at a keyboard since high school typing class," apologized the line operator at Kimberly-Clark's paper products mill here. But his job is rapidly evolving from grunt work -- such as lifting boxes -- to the more demanding tasks of monitoring precision machinery.
Mr. Pokrywka, one of the handful of employees who oversee the sophisticated robots that churn out Kleenex Pocket Packs, isn't feeling sorry for himself, though. And for good reason: he is on the right side of the invisible line dividing the industrial labor force into two camps -- a well-paid minority that tends machines and an unprivileged army of workers who, in effect, compete with them. 
 Indeed, while the percentage of adults working in the United States has not been higher since World War II, many sense they are trapped in a Darwinian struggle, with the computer literate atop the food chain. The resulting anxiety has raised anew a question older than Karl Marx: Is technology destroying the good jobs, leaving the unskilled and just plain unlucky to survive on the economy's scraps?
To Jeremy Rifkin, the anti-corporatist writer, the answer is clear. "Human labor is becoming increasingly tangential and irrelevant in an ever more automated world," he wrote in "The End of Work" (Putnam). But in the view of mainstream economists, the latter-day Luddites are tilting at windmills.
Technological change, they argue, does not so much destroy jobs as redistribute the fruits of everyone's labor. In recent decades it has also widened the gap in wages between the skilled and unskilled, violating most people's sense of economic justice. By the same token, though, technological change can be reined in only at the risk of undermining the economy's capacity to grow.
The challenge, then, for the technology-age economy is to find a way into balance. "In a better world, we'd use some of the fruits of technological change to compensate the losers," Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas, said.
Everyone at the Kimberly-Clark plant understands the uneasy relationship between technology and jobs. When Mr. Pokrywka (pronounced po-KREEF-kuh) started at the mill in 1980, a staff of 16 produced fewer than half the Pocket Packs a crew of 5 can deliver today. Since the early 1990's, employment at the plant has fallen from 1,250 to 1,100. And while Ben Pruet, its manager, noted that the cuts have been made "entirely through attrition," it is undeniably more difficult for local residents lacking specialized skills to earn a middle-class income.
If technology did not eliminate certain jobs, however, overall living standards could not grow. Take the case of electromechanical switches, which largely replaced telephone operators before World War II. If they hadn't, there would be tens or even hundreds of thousands more Ernestines making a living at switchboards. But telephone service would still be a near-luxury, and the communications revolution -- which created tens of thousands of new, better-paying jobs -- would have been strangled in the crib.
Labor-saving technology does typically lead to falling product prices, which sometimes stimulates sales enough to sustain or increase employment. The mechanization of the textile industry in the early 19th century, which transformed cotton clothing into a staple, fits this description. More typically, though, employment shrinks as sales expand -- think of farmers, say, or movie projectionists, who used to change reels every 10 or 15 minutes and now preside over automated multiplexes.
But economists argue that the job creation-job destruction dichotomy misses a central point. If competitive labor markets are working according to Hoyle, they say, most workers will find different jobs. That is certainly the case in the United States, where total employment has grown as rapidly as the labor force, even through the wrenching changes of the 1980's and 1990's.
Hence, mainstream economists agree that the level of unemployment is largely determined by the luck and skill of the Government in manipulating its levers over the economy. "You can have full employment at any level of technology," concluded Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Carnegie-Mellon University.
That does not mean technology affects all workers equally. For one thing, said James Heckman, an economist at the University of Chicago, "it puts a big premium on their capacity to adapt."
The point is not lost on managers at Kimberly-Clark. "When we hire now, we're thinking about how easily a person can be trained to do different jobs," said Lizanne Gottung, who manages the production of Huggies at the New Milford plant.
That's fine to Mike Thomas, a 41-year-old line worker in Ms. Gottung's department who has been at Kimberly-Clark for 16 years. Diaper-making, which used to be a matter of attaching piece A to tab B by hand, is now a computer-driven process in which humans monitor the electronic monitors and service the moving parts. "I'm an old dog who's adjusted to three product changes in the last year," Mr. Thomas explained proudly.
But William Baumol and Ed Wolff, economists at New York University, argue that older, less educated workers are at a serious disadvantage. And the resulting increase in employer selectivity helps explain why people who lose their jobs are, on average, staying out of work longer.
The biggest worry, though, is a widening wage gap. While other factors certainly come into play, researchers generally agree that technology has helped to drive the wedge between the wages of the winners and losers.
"For a long time economists assumed the rising tide of productivity would carry all boats," Frank Levy, an economist at M.I.T., recalled. "We've learned better."
Lawrence Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, specializes in measuring how far the boats are out of sync. He estimates that in 1979 the average hourly wage of workers in the top 10 percent of the pecking order was 59 percent higher than for those in the middle. By 1995, that had grown to 76 percent. More ominously, jobs paying wages that could not support a family above the poverty line had jumped from 24 percent to 30 percent of the total.
Could the trend reverse on its own, with future technological change raising the relative demand for unskilled workers? Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, economists at Harvard University, point out that the 19th-century transition from artisan workshops to assembly lines did strongly favor unskilled labor. Gun-making, for example, was transformed from a complex task for metal cutters and shapers to a much simpler process of fitting machine-made parts together.
By contrast, with modern technology the winners in the last two decades have been the workers with the smarts and adaptive skills to keep the machine running well or to build new ones. In theory the pendulum could swing back again, reducing the demand for the skilled and raising demand for the unskilled. But while there is some tentative evidence that the gap is no longer widening as rapidly, nothing on the admittedly cloudy technological horizon suggests that the trend will reverse soon.
A more intriguing possibility is that workers will respond to increasingly obvious financial incentives, and that the resulting growth in the supply of skilled labor will swamp demand. If enough people invest in education, the wage imbalance could correct itself. "We're already seeing a very large supply response" as measured by the percentage of Americans going to college, Mr. Katz noted.
Equally important, upgrading skills is becoming the rule, not the exception, for workers in the middle. Mr. Heckman points to survey data showing that 40 percent of sales workers and 23 percent of materials handlers are receiving training at least once a year.
But the price tag for a far more skilled labor force would be substantial. Mr. Heckman estimates that it would cost $400 billion to give low-end workers the skills to return their real wages to the levels of the early 1970's. An ambitious, G.I. Bill-style push for mass higher education, he says, would cost $1.6 trillion -- far more than even the $20 billion annual training budget Bill Clinton proposed in the 1992 campaign.
It is hard to find an economist who does not see some merit in education, at the very least in easing access to college and midcareer technical training. But it is also hard to find an economist who thinks investment in "human capital" is the whole answer.
Traditional liberals like Mr. Mishel would use Government regulation to offset unfavorable wage trends. He favors a considerably higher minimum wage, along with mandatory employer-paid benefits like health insurance and long vacations -- in general, the sort of benefits provided in the generous welfare states of Western Europe.
The catch is that Europeans live with 10 percent unemployment for adults and much higher rates for the young. "I'd settle for European-level unemployment if we could have European wages," Mr. Mishel responded.
Economists from the center and right prefer income or wage subsidies that do not raise the cost of labor. One indirect route to raising the living standards of low-wage workers, for example, is national health insurance or child care. The more direct route is to stimulate demand for less productive workers by subsidizing businesses to employ them.
Edmund Phelps, a Columbia University economist, has long crusaded for cash grants to employers who hire low-wage workers, arguing that this is the least intrusive approach. But he acknowledges that Federal cash to the workers themselves -- a beefed-up version of the current earned-income tax credit -- would have much the same effect.
The catch, of course, is cost. While the Clinton Administration managed a significant expansion of the earned-income tax credit in 1993 and still talks wistfully about ambitious training initiatives, "nobody wants to spend the money to seriously address the wage gap problem," Mr. Heckman argued.
Meanwhile, technology marches on -- and workers scramble to stay on its benign side. "You just jump in," Mr. Pokrywka at Kimberly-Clark explained, "and do whatever, whenever."

HEADLINE: English as Official Language Wins Backing of House Panel

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
A House committee narrowly approved a bill today making English the nation's official language.
Republicans and Democrats, in five hours of sharply partisan debate, agreed that English is already the main language of government, commerce and everyday life in this nation. But they were widely divided on whether to codify that fact in law and, more deeply, over what cultural, moral and language traits defined what it means to be an American. 
 Republicans, at a hearing of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, said their bill would halt a worrisome trend toward creating "language ghettos" that are leaving immigrants unprepared for the job market and forcing the Government to accommodate non-English speakers with documents, services and bilingual classes in several other languages.
"I do not want to see the country become ethnic enclaves," said Representative Marge Roukema, a New Jersey Republican.
But Democrats said the bill was unnecessary, unconstitutional and racist. "This is just a guise for a bill that's built on bias and bigotry," said Representative Matthew G. Martinez, a California Democrat.
The vote to send the bill to the House floor, where it will probably be considered in September, was 19 to 17, along party lines. A similar bill is pending in a Senate committee.
The Clinton Administration strongly opposes the bill, which is the latest effort in a decade-long campaign by English-only proponents to declare English the sole language used to make policy and to curb bilingual education and bilingual ballots. Bob Dole, the apparent Republican Presidential nominee, has supported the idea of making English the country's official language.
As written, the bill seeks to "help immigrants better assimilate" and "empower" them with new language and literacy skills.
To attract support from moderate Republicans, the bill's sponsors did not try to eliminate financing for bilingual education. The bill's definition of official business that must be conducted in English also exempts language instruction and documents or policies necessary for national security, public health and safety.
Proponents of the bill say accommodating non-English speakers is costly. In 1994, for example, the Internal Revenue Service printed and distributed 500,000 income-tax forms in Spanish at a cost of $113,000. Only 718 of the forms were returned.
But critics of the bill said more than 97 percent of Americans already speak English well, and that 99 percent of all Government documents are published in English. Moreover, Democrats said, the most pressing need is not a English-language law, but more English classes for immigrants. English classes in community colleges in Los Angeles are filled 24 hours a day, and the waiting list for some English classes in New York City is as long as three years, legislators said.

HEADLINE: Under Solar Bill, Homeowners Could Cut Electric Cost to Zero

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
New York state residents may soon be able to turn their rooftops into small-scale solar-power plants and see their electric bills drop to zero or even register a credit.
A little-noticed bill passed by the State Legislature in the closing hours of its last session would allow 30,000 owners of single-family homes to install solar cells and run their electric meters backward as they send spare electricity back to their utilities. 
 Although the cap on households would allow the power generated to be no more than one-tenth of one percent of New York's total power supply, energy experts say the measure could lure a solar-cell manufacturer to the state, cut pollution and help avert blackouts on scorching summer days.
Gov. George E. Pataki -- faced with dozens of bills awaiting his signature and focused on last week's T.W.A. plane crash -- has not reviewed the solar choice act. But he is likely to view it favorably, administration officials said, because he has long championed renewable, nonpolluting energy sources. "This concept is something he's always been interested in," said Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha.
But the utilities, which oppose the measure, are pressuring the Governor not to sign it.
The bill resembles one passed in California last year. About a dozen other states -- including all the New England states -- have long had laws allowing homeowners or businesses to sell back to utilities power that is generated using anything from solar cells to windmills to small dams.
The New York bill was strongly backed by Republican politicians and business groups on Long Island, who see it as improving the chances that one of the world's fastest-growing manufacturers of photovoltaic cells, Solarex, a joint venture of Amoco and Enron Corporations, will build a plant there.
Solarex, based in Frederick, Md., built the solar photovoltaic cells that cover a dome at the Olympic Stadium in Atlanta -- forming the world's largest solar array -- and a slightly smaller array installed by the New York Power Authority last month on the roof of the bus depot on East Gun Hill Road in the Bronx.
Many energy experts feel solar technology is finally poised for global growth after two decades of false starts. Solarex and similar companies have been expanding rapidly to meet soaring demand for solar cells, both overseas and in the United States. Unlike the 1970's, when a solar boom was sparked by tax breaks and later fizzled, this time the market is real, said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and an author of the legislation.
New York is hardly in the Sun Belt, but the high price of electricity here makes the state one of the best places for photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight directly into electricity, energy experts say. Although the systems are still expensive, prices are dropping and efficiency is rising.
The Solarex plant would only create 75 jobs, but it would indirectly spur more high-technology growth in the region, say the bill's sponsors, Steven C. Englebright, a Democratic Assemblyman from Setauket, and Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican Senator from Oyster Bay, who is chairman of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee.
Utilities oppose the bill, saying it unfairly benefits wealthier homeowners able to invest the $10,000 to $30,000 it costs to install such systems -- depending on the size and output of the unit -- while forcing utilities to buy solar-generated power at the same retail price that they charge their customers. Other customers would have to absorb the cost of buying the premium-priced power, they say.
Such a law, they say, would impose further burdens on an industry already strained by rising competition and costs associated with existing power plants, said Stuart Silbergleit, general counsel for the Energy Association of New York, a lobbying group for the state's power producers.
But proponents of the bill won easily by focusing on the appeal of two-way meters. The cost to power users without the luxury of rooftop panels would be "around 2 to 4 cents for every $100 spent on your electric bill," Mr. Gupta said.
Mr. Englebright said the bill would benefit, not harm, utilities. "Utilities here have their peak loading problems during the hottest days of the year," he said. "And that's exactly when solar kicks in."
In California, utilities like Southern California Edison have embraced the idea of buying some solar-generated power from homeowners, saying the process can reduce the need to build power plants and will help cut pollution and satisfy the thirst for power at peak times.
Under the law, the most power a New York homeowner could produce is 10 kilowatts, or about the amount needed to run two typical households.
So far, only a scattering of homes in the state have solar photovoltaic power systems -- mostly in rural spots where the cost of installing power lines is prohibitive. Unconnected to the outside world, such systems must store power in bulky, costly banks of batteries.
Under existing laws, if someone chooses to feed power from solar cells back into the grid of transmission lines maintained by utilities, two separate meters are run, one charging the homeowner the retail rate for power taken in from the grid, the other registering a credit for solar power, but only at the utility's own wholesale electricity rate, which is many times lower.
Under the new bill, existing solar pioneers and other homeowners who invest in the systems would have a single meter -- installed at the expense of the utility -- which would run ahead for power used and backward for power dumped into the grid. At the end of the month, the bill would reflect only the net electricity used, and could register less than zero, with the difference being credited on the next month's bill.
For places like New York City and Long Island, where the demand for electricity sometimes nearly exceeds utilities' ability to send power to customers through transmission lines, solar power could be a significant boon, Mr. Gupta said.
It is likely to help the state's solar entrepreneurs as well.
"This law will be a real boost," said Larry Brown, a home builder and solar-cell installer in Olive Bridge, N.Y., in Ulster County, who expects his business to grow substantially if the bill becomes law. "I don't think there's anyone in the country who wouldn't want to see their electric meter run backwards," Mr. Brown said.

1. The solar panel converts sunlight into direct-current electrical power.
 
2. Power is then transformed from direct current to alternating current.
 
3. The electrical panel then controls whether energy from the solar panel is used in the home or sent out for use by other buildings. If electricity is sent out, the homeowner receives a credit on their bill. (Source: American Solar Energy Society)

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Banking help for inner cities: not needed, its critics say.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
THE creation of a community-owned development bank was not the most newsworthy event in Atlanta yesterday, but will be remembered long after the Olympic gold is gathering dust on mantelpieces. That, at least, is the hope of Andrew M. Cuomo, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose agency is supplying the seed money. "Community banking is critical to empowering people in inner cities," he said.
Others aren't so sure. While economists are in theory open to the idea that traditional lenders cannot or will not provide adequate capital to poor people, many remain skeptical. "The assumption is that private institutions are either bigoted or don't know what they're doing," said George Benston at Emory University's Business School. And he finds neither very plausible in the competitive world of commercial finance. 
 The risk, apart from wasting money on ill-conceived investments, suggests George Kaufman of Loyola University, is that inefficient subsidized enterprise will supplant more efficient private institutions. "You could force niche players -- mostly small-loan companies -- out of the market," he says.
The idea is fairly simple. Atlanta is taking $5 million of the $100 million Congress set aside for the city's "empowerment zone" to leverage a much larger infusion of capital for a for-profit, inner-city lending authority. Some of the additional capital must come from residents in the form of stock purchases; equity owners, in turn, will gain voting rights on the board as well as the rights to any profits. Some capital will probably come as loans from the City of Atlanta. Yet another portion could come from local commercial banks, which can use the community bank to funnel money to the inner city as part of the obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act.
While loans could finance housing, most, presumably, would go to businesses. The charter contemplates everything from "micro" loans to finance inventories for, say, a grocery or a video store, to $500,000 for "established firms whose expansion needs exceed internal financing capacity." With the cash would go technical support like training programs and accounting assistance.
Why not just leave it to the private sector? One reason, Mr. Cuomo argues, is that "inner-city businesses don't speak the language of commercial bankers."
"They don't know how to sell themselves," he says, "to white-collar loan officers whose judgments of creditworthiness are, in part, subjective." Another, he says, is that the money will be better spent when residents have their own money on the line.
Mr. Benston is not convinced. "The first thing you want to know before starting another Government program is whether there's a problem," he says, "and I know of no studies showing that inner cities are underserved by lenders."
The economist from Emory University is not suggesting that everybody with a business plan has access to sufficient capital at low interest. Rather, he is applying the narrower test of the competitive market: Are private lenders, out of ignorance, bad will or incompetence, passing by opportunities to make money?
Even if, by the cool logic of free-market capitalism, there is no need for new lenders, surely there is no harm in having them. Not so, Mr. Kaufman says. Inner cities are already served by niche lenders, mostly finance companies and pawnshops that do not show up on the radar screens of Federal regulators because they do not take deposits or clear checks. If community banks undercut these existing lenders by passing on Government subsidies to their clients, he says, they would distort competition and defeat the broader purpose of revitalizing free markets in central cities.
This problem may be particularly serious if local commercial banks use the community bank as an excuse to drop their own retail lending efforts in the inner city, meeting Federal antidiscrimination requirements by lending wholesale to the community bank.
The debate over community banking is really part of a broader debate about the empowerment of the poor. On one side are economists who, at heart, think the only important difference between the poor and everyone else is money. On the other are policy types from both the left and right who are convinced that poverty is at least as much a state of mind -- one that will not change until people share both a sense of community and a sense of control over their own destiny.
Wise heads still find the economists' view compelling. But warm hearts are with the empowerment crowd, and always have been: few stories are as attractive as the myth of self-redemption.

HEADLINE: Stock Market Ends Weaker In Busy Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average snapped a three-session losing streak, and the market steadied after a shaky opening yesterday, but stocks ended mostly lower as rising interest rates worsened fraying nerves.
In another highly volatile day, the blue-chip Dow industrials rose 8.14 points, to 5,354.69, after dropping 76 points at the open, rallying to a gain of more than 32, then retreating. 
 "If you don't like where the market is, just wait a minute," Arthur Hogan, the head stock trader at Dean Witter Reynolds, said. "These things are fluctuating so much it's just driving everybody crazy."
Despite the Dow's rebound, broader market measures ended lower, demonstrating a growing discomfort with any but the biggest, most established companies.
There were nearly three declining issues for every advance on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq market, dominated by technology and speculative companies, was even weaker.
"People are selling their secondary stocks and using what they have left to go into the top tier," said Michael Metz, vice president of Oppenheimer & Company.
Stocks started to rebound around midday, but the rally faltered as the bond market stumbled on an unenthusiastic reception to an auction of new Government debt. The drop in bond prices forced the yield on the 30-year Treasury -- a key determinant of corporate and consumer borrowing costs -- back above 7 percent to 7.04 percent.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.70, to 1,042.37, recovering from an opening slide of more than 30 points amid some bargain hunting. The American Stock Exchange's market value index, which is also dominated by more speculative issues, fell 7.96 to 529.00. The Big Board's composite index fell 1.07, to 336.07, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.22, to 626.65.
Big Board volume totaled 463 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
Compaq, which reported stronger than expected earnings, jumped 3 1/4, to 48 1/4, in active Big Board trading, helping lift other depressed technology issues from the day's lows. Hewlett-Packard rose 2 5/8, to 43 5/8, and I.B.M. rose 1 1/2, to 91 3/4, as one of the Dow's biggest gainers.
Among Nasdaq technology issues, Microsoft rose 2 5/8, to 114 3/4; Intel slipped 1/2, to 69; Sun Microsystems rose 1 3/8, to 50 1/8, and Cisco Systems rose 2, to 49 1/8.
Other big Dow gainers included Du Pont, up 2 5/8, to 77 1/4, and Boeing, up 1 7/8, to 85 7/8.
However, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, the world's largest rubber company, was down 3/4, at 41 7/8, despite reporting that earnings increased 8.1 percent in the second quarter, in line with analyst expectations. Goodyear attributed the improvement to its operations in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
Similarly, Baxter International, a health products company, was down 1/2, at 42 1/4, despite reporting a slightly higher than expected 7 percent rise in second-quarter profits, due in part to expanding foreign sales of a genetically engineered blood-clotting drug for hemophiliacs.
In Nasdaq trading, Allied Healthcare Products fell 25/64 , to 659/64 , after saying it expected to report a loss of about $2 million for its just-ended fourth quarter. That is below expectations. The company said its board would recommend suspending the 7-cent quarterly dividend.

HEADLINE: Planned U.S. Sanctions Anger Europeans

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 24

 BODY:
Congress's approval of sanctions against countries investing in the energy sector in Libya and Iran has drawn stinging criticism from Europe as another manifestation of United States muscle-flexing, but industry officials say the measures will have little immediate impact on the ability of the two countries to produce oil.
The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said today that it would defer for a week any decision on countering the legislation, which penalizes anyone investing more than $40 million a year in the Iranian or Libyan oil and gas industries. 
 The European Union is already fuming over the recent Helms-Burton Act, which allows Americans legal redress against foreign businesses that use buildings or equipment in Cuba that were expropriated from American citizens.
"We remain firmly opposed to the extraterritorial nature of both pieces of legislation," said Peter Guilford, spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's Trade Commissioner. European leaders say the measures are a projection of United States domestic concerns that could provoke retaliation.
Some anti-Syrian sanctions are also being contemplated by Congress, European officials said and American officials confirmed. "There is legislation already afoot on Syria that basically came before the Iran-Libya bill," said Jerry Lipson, spokesman for the House International Relations Committee. "It basically denies export licenses for dual-use technology to terrorist states, and obviously Syria is on the list."
Reactions from individual countries to the Iran-Libya sanctions were swift. The French Foreign Ministry rejected "the principle of extraterritorial applications of national laws," characterizing the American measure, which won final approval on Tuesday in the House of Representatives, as a contradiction of free trade.
The German Federation of Industry warned that "jobs created by German companies in the United States could be endangered" by the impact of the legislation on trade between the two countries.
Italian, German, French, Spanish, British and Austrian oil companies all have large-scale investments in Libya, which remains a major supplier of light crude oil that is cheaper, closer and far more convenient for European consumers than oil from other sources.
By comparison, Iran has little to lose, with only one major French company in its oil sector, the Total group, which operates the Sirri oilfields. French industry officials said the continued operation of the Sirri field was not likely to be affected because most of the huge investment there had already been made.
For the moment, oil supplies from Iran and Libya seem secure.
"If the threshold is $40 million a year in investment, you can do quite a few things with that," Christian Weyer, a financial consultant to oil companies in Geneva, said. "It may not be massive, but it is significant enough to keep things going."
Pierre Terzian, editor of Petro- strategies, a trade weekly in Paris, said: "There are several ways to get around the legislation. The impact will not be now, but in the future, when they negotiate bigger projects with huge investments, like gas pipelines or new fields."
It was precisely with an eye on the future that the European Union leaders said at their meeting in Florence last month that they reserved the right to retaliate if the United States tried to punish companies doing business with Cuba, Iran or Libya.
Italy is by far the biggest importer of Libyan oil and the biggest investor in Libya's oil industry, and a spokesman for the its Foreign Ministry said Rome would wait to see how far the legislation will go. But the Ministry noted that "we have the same concerns that we have expressed many times before" over Washington's imposing its laws on third parties.
Italy and Libya have been negotiating a underwater gas pipeline that would require investment of several hundred million dollars.
"The problem is that such legislation will scare the hell out of any investor thinking of doing business in these countries," said Fakhry Abdelnour, president of the Africa Middle East Oil Corporation in Monte Carlo.
A senior Arab intelligence official from a Persian Gulf country said the punitive American measures directed at "the so-called terrorist states," as he put it, may be "inviting just the sort of thing the Americans are trying to prevent -- more terror."
"Such measures are dabbling with the very livelihood of these nations," he added, "and they are creating a club of miseries that can turn into a flood of anger."

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Sinks as Investors Turn to the Blue-Chips

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Small-company stocks, which for more than 18 months acted as the engine of growth for the stock market, mutual funds and the economy as a whole, continued to erode yesterday, as investors turned further away from that increasingly volatile sector of the market in favor of blue chips.
That brought the decline in the Nasdaq composite index, the most-watched barometer of high-growth companies, to 16.6 percent for the seven weeks since June 5, when the index closed at its highest lever ever. The decline is more than twice that of the Dow industrials over the same period. 
 But while the Nasdaq market is dominated by well-known companies like Microsoft and Intel, the slippage has spread far beyond technology stocks, which have gained much of the attention. Indeed, several other sectors, among them some of the fast-growing industries favored by the managers of recently hot mutual funds, have borne the brunt of the decline.
Many of the dozens of industrial sectors that make up the Nasdaq index have performed worse than technology, according to an analysis of the Nasdaq performed for The New York Times by Birinyi Associates, a Greenwich, Conn., research firm. Among the poorest performers are transportation companies and retailers, as well as makers of pharmaceuticals and electrical equipment.
"Technology stocks have been the favorite whipping boy in the market, but the selloff has not been confined to them," said L. Keith Mullins, a managing director at Smith Barney who specializes in emerging-growth stocks.
In some cases, poor earnings contributed to the decline, he said. But many more stocks have fallen simply because their "concepts" have fallen out of favor, because their share prices rose too quickly in the last 18 months, or because the sectors are no longer being viewed as safe havens.
Yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index fell for a fourth straight session, dropping 6.70 points, to 1,042.37. Combined with a stunning 3 percent decline on Tuesday, this week's selloff left the small-stock average nearly 1 percent below the level where it started 1996.
The blue chips, as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, eked out a gain of 8.14 points yesterday, after falling more than 50 points in the first 10 minutes of trading, to close at 5,354.69. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, in contrast, fell 0.22 point, to 626.65.
Both of those indexes have fallen sharply in the last seven weeks and are substantially below their record high levels, set in May. The Dow industrials finished 7.3 percent below their record close of 5,778, set on May 22. Two days later, the S.& P. 500 peaked at 678.51, 7.6 percent above its current level.
But those declines pale next to the huge selloff in the Nasdaq stocks, which daily provide at least one utter slaughter. Yesterday's disaster was the Fritz Companies, a freight-forwarding and logistics outfit whose shares lost more than half their value after the company announced that a previous acquisition had cost more than it expected. Fritz shares fell $15.25, to $12.25.
That made a grab bag of transportation-related companies the worst performing among 70 industrial sectors tracked by Birinyi Associates, losing 43 percent of its value since June 5. The sectors tracked by the research firm included more than 500 Nasdaq companies whose market valuations totaled more than $300 million each and whose share prices exceeded $20.
Not all of the declines were as spectacular. Several other groups have lost more than a quarter of their value over the last seven weeks. A group of pharmaceutical companies, for example, dropped 28 percent of their value. Among the biggest decliners were Vertex Pharmaceuticals, PDT Inc., Dura Pharmaceuticals and Watson Pharmaceuticals.
Health maintenance organizations have also suffered badly, with the group falling 22 percent after some prominent companies reported disappointing earnings for the quarter ended June 30.
"A lot of sectors in health care used to be viewed as something of a safe haven," said Charles Scavone, who co-manages two mutual funds, AIM Aggressive Growth and AIM Constellation, that focus on smaller companies.
Also on the receiving end of some swift kicks from investors are a bevy of apparel and specialty retailers. Several companies in the industry reported disappointing June sales, which proved especially vexing to investors who bought the stocks in the first quarter, expecting that the sector's dismal 1995 sales marked the end of their slump.
Among the biggest decliners in retailing since early June are Nordstrom, a general retailer whose shares have fallen 21 percent; Gymboree, which sells children's apparel and whose shares have dropped 37 percent, and Bed Bath and Beyond, whose shares have fallen 22 percent.
Some of those declines are puzzling, Mr. Mullins said, because not all of the companies missed their earnings targets. "Bed Bath and Beyond hasn't missed a thing, and it still got hit," he said.
Some technology groups do show up among the list of industry groups that performed most poorly, of course. Nine of the top 10 Nasdaq companies in terms of market valuation -- including Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and Oracle -- are technology concerns; only Amgen is not.
Among the biggest decliners were makers of electronic and telecommunications equipment. Leading that group are some of the biggest favorites of many mutual funds that specialize in small-company stocks, including Ascend Communications, down 33.4 percent since June 5, and U. S. Robotics, down 31 percent during the same period.
But not all technology companies have been beaten up in the last two months. Shares of software maker Oracle, for example, gained 7.3 percent during that time, after reporting better-than-expected earnings for the quarter ended May 31.
Most analysts call the current downturn in Nasdaq stocks "a classic correction," similar to declines in 1992 and 1994, when the Nasdaq index fell 10 percent to 20 percent.
"This one feels a little more severe because we have gone a while without having one," said Mary Lisanti, manager of Bankers Trust Investment Small Cap fund. "This may go on another couple of weeks to a month, unless we're entering a bear market. But we don't see that."

HEADLINE: MOMUMENT TO DECAY;
No Shortage of Proposed Solutions, Starting With a Cap on Income Taxes

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There was little fanfare this spring when a coalition of liberal and conservative lawmakers unveiled their plan to save the nation's capital with drastic cuts in Federal taxes for all District of Columbia residents.
But by the time Speaker Newt Gingrich took up the cause this month, promoting it in Congress and on television talk shows, new attention had started focusing on how to solve Washington's complicated financial crisis. 
 "We're looking very seriously at a very dramatic tax change for the city of Washington," Mr. Gingrich said at a forum of Congressional Republicans this week, adding that this measure is "to create an incentive for people to move back into the city."
The cuts, first proposed by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting Congressional delegate and a Democrat, would put a 15 percent ceiling on Federal taxes paid by city residents to entice the middle class to stay put while Washington digs out of its financial ruin.
"This idea of a flat tax is to keep taxpayers in town. It is not to give D.C. residents a bonus or something to feel good about," she said, adding a now-familiar warning. "This is the capital of the United States. Congress cannot walk away."
While economists disagree about the tax, it is one more sign that business executives, city officials, the Clinton Administration, Congress and ordinary citizens realize the nation's capital needs a new economic plan that works and, discussions have begun about a possible change in its form of government.
To cure what ails the District will require huge cuts in the city's budget and work force, new and different ways to generate more revenue, and proof to Wall Street investors and a skeptical Congress that Washington can, in fact, manage its own affairs and not squander Federal financing.
Other than the 15 percent tax cap, which has also been endorsed by Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, economic proposals most often discussed include:
*Raising the annual Federal payment to Washington to replace the taxes it cannot collect on the 43 percent of city land declared tax exempt by Congress. The city is underpaid each year by some $400 million.
*Having Congress pay for items that, in other cities, states pay for, but that Washington must finance itself -- Medicaid, prisons and a multibillion dollar pension obligation to city workers. These cost the District more than $1 billion a year.
*Borrowing up to $900 million from either the United States Treasury or the credit markets to finance the budget deficit.
*Imposing a commuter tax on suburban residents who work in the District and number nearly two-thirds of the city's work force, a higher percentage than in any other city in the country. So far, Congress has blocked every effort by the District to enact a commuter tax, and the city has not devised another way to collect money from its affluent suburban work force.
*Attracting new businesses, and overcoming problems of red tape, bureaucratic bungling and a lack of swift governmental response on zoning and business permits that have caused most large businesses to flee to the suburbs.
Far more delicate are questions about how to alter the form of government: whether there should be more Congressional control, greater self-determination, or retrocession, which would carve out the Federal enclave of the White House, the Mall, Congress and other Federal properties, and return the rest of the city to Maryland.

A New Form of Government?
In this city where the term "re-inventing government" is well known, the debate is between those who want a more efficient government and those who fear a decline in democracy for District residents.
"It would be devastating for this city to move more toward a receivership or a permanent control board," said Constance B. Newman, undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who is on the control board that has been managing the city's finances since April 1995. "With the control board, we may be efficient, but we are not very democratic."
Ms. Norton, the city's Congressional delegate, agreed, "I think that what we are looking at is a different form of government."
Retrocession is the most extreme and least plausible of all options. District citizens are unlikely to voluntarily give up their identity, and Maryland officials have said they do not need the District and its problems. Moreover, city officials wonder why Federal payments could be given to Maryland to take over the District, but not to Washington.
"If the District were given to Maryland, it would be viewed as a race-related issue," Ms. Newman said. "It would be the idea that we can't govern ourselves, so we were sent to Maryland."
One option gaining currency is the city-manager model, considered the best form of a government for mid-size cities like Washington, with its population of 500,000. Charlotte, N.C., San Diego, and Richmond are all run by city managers -- professionally trained, nonpolitical administrators hired by an elected mayor and city council to manage daily operations.
This has the advantage of bringing professional management to a city that has too long found its operations mired in politics -- either Federal or local.
"City-manager governments are models of effective and responsible municipal management," said William A. Hodges, president of NationsBank of Greater Washington. "It provides an environment for fiscal responsibility and for politicians to hide for cover."

Finding Support in Congress
In the meantime, the control board is cutting deeply in the city's bloated payroll to eliminate the deficit and balance the budget by 1999. Yet there is common understanding, even among the District's biggest Congressional critics, that the financial burdens imposed by Congress under home rule are so great that budget cutting alone will not relieve them.
"We've got to have more money," Ms. Newman said. "Even if we made local government more efficient, we still can't improve the quality of life without more money."
Lawmakers have said they would consider a drastic increase in the Federal payment to the District or taking over some services typically provided by states, if they were convinced city officials were doing a better job.
But with Congress concerned about balancing the national budget, the District has to compete for attention with all the other budgetary issues. And those in Congress who live just outside the city are adamantly opposed to a commuter tax.
"The District is a tough sell in general," said Representative James T. Walsh, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Washington's budget. "With Washington, there's always the perception that we're throwing good money after bad, that there has been no discipline."
Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve who headed a 1990 study of the District's problems, said: "Most of the country doesn't care about Washington. And the attitude in Congress is largely one of contempt."
Ms. Norton's 15 percent tax proposal, which would lower Federal taxes from the current maximum rate of 39.6 percent, is appealing to District residents, but has left some economists scratching their heads.
The cap could cost the Federal Government $750 million a year without adding a cent to the city's revenues. With the bulk of the benefit going to taxpayers earning more than $200,000, economists say this would be an enormous tax break to the rich.
Another problem is the city's low credit rating -- it is the only big city whose bonds are rated as "junk" -- it cannot borrow long-term debt in the credit markets in its own name. As a result, the control board has said it plans to borrow up to $900 million over the next six years to finance the deficits, in the same way that the Municipal Assistance Corporation borrowed money to help bail out New York in 1975.
A plan for this long-term borrowing was submitted by the city to Congress in June.

Shoring Up the Economic Base
Even if the control board borrows the money, the city still needs to strengthen its economic base with new jobs. "You've got a cash crisis, driven by a budget crisis, driven by an underlying economic crisis," said Anthony A. Williams, the city's chief financial officer.
Between March 1992 and March 1996, 175,000 new jobs were created in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs, helping the region become the richest in the nation; the District lost 39,500 jobs in the same period.
A business boom has brought high-tech companies like Oracle Systems Corporation and America OnLine Inc. to the Virginia suburbs, and Maryland is home to the Marriott Corporation and the Lockheed Martin Corporation. M.C.I. Communications Corporation remains the only major business headquartered in the District.
But Christopher R. Ludeman, executive vice president at CB Commercial Real Estate Group, who has recently written a study of the city's real estate, said, "It's difficult to do business in the city." He added that the District "has never fashioned a positive economic development program." City officials, he said, "don't do a good job of selling themselves."
Yet, Washington has much to offer. Its economic base, the Federal Government, is not going to move. And even though Government is downsizing, it is still a major employer, along with the businesses that crop up to supply it. "We've got to concentrate on stopping the business outmigration," said Andrew F. Brimmer, chairman of the control board. "Part of it is developing a better attitude towards business and getting rid of a regulatory obstacle course."

HEADLINE: Trying to Fix Capital Where 'Everything Is Broken'

SERIES: MONUMENT TO DECAY -- First of three articles.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES and MICHAEL JANOFSKY; Leslie Wayne also contributed to this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
On any given day here in the capital of the richest nation in the world, nearly a third of the 16 water-pumping firetrucks are kept out of service to save money. Police officers dip into their own pockets to buy tires and put gasoline in squad cars. City clinics periodically stop testing for the AIDS virus because they cannot afford supplies. Local officials are dumping extra chlorine in drinking water to battle elevated levels of bacteria caused by eroding pipes.
The Washington of glittering monuments, world-class museums and graceful, leafy neighborhoods continues to captivate tourists, hordes of them. But in ways big and small, the Washington of cold municipal reality is falling apart. 
 Two decades into Washington's experiment in limited self-rule the city is virtually insolvent. Its bond rating is junk status. Its population, 706,000 just 20 years ago, has fallen to 554,000 -- the lowest since the beginning of the New Deal in the 1930's. While New York and other cities have registered lower crime rates, here crime is on the rise, and arrests are down. City contractors wait months to be paid. Public school employees are facing up to 12 days of furloughs in the coming academic year to help trim the school system's $7.1 million deficit.
And the people elected to run the city, especially Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr., lost the trust of Congress, which has the constitutional power to oversee the national capital. Last year, Congress shifted much of the local power to a board of financial overseers, known locally as the financial control board, appointed by the President.
"Everything is broken," said Anthony A. Williams, the city's new chief financial officer. "This isn't just a car that has run out of gas. There is something fundamentally wrong with the car. The gas pedal doesn't work, and neither do the brakes."
Major efforts are now under way to fix things. The control board is pressing local leaders to cut more spending and reduce the size of city government. Mr. Barry has introduced a "transformation plan" to streamline the government. A White House task force has been formed to help city agencies improve services. These efforts were rewarded this month when Wall Street offered to help the city raise $220 million in short-term notes, the first time in 18 months that investors have been willing to lend money to the city.
In Congress, momentum is gaining to pass legislation to create a flat Federal income tax of 15 percent for District residents, a measure some lawmakers say would reverse the population exodus and encourage economic development.
And as a sign that confidence in the city and its efforts for change might be growing, the House on Monday passed the District's 1997 fiscal year budget by 332 to 68, and the Senate Appropriations Committee passed a similar version on Tuesday.
But as Federal and local officials strain to reverse the tumble into financial and physical decay, national lawmakers are beginning to suggest what was unthinkable a few years ago: that Washington's hard-won right to govern itself should be stripped away. After 100 years of being ruled through Congress, the District accepted a limited form of independence that is now under attack.
"The control board is the city's best hope to retain home rule," Speaker Newt Gingrich said recently. "If the politicians stop that control board from succeeding, I think it puts into doubt the whole issue of home rule."
The issue of home rule has special racial and historical poignance here in Washington, a black-majority city that had long been denied political independence by the white Federal establishment.
And while, in many ways, Washington's problems are similar to those of other large and aging American cities -- increasing poverty, rising crime, middle-class flight, Washington is not just any American city. It is the capital, with all the symbolism of great expectation that such a status implies.
"Washington, D.C., is the political center of the universe as we know it, and people could not believe it was bankrupt," said Representative James T. Walsh, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Washington's budget. "I was doing interviews with German, British, French and Australian TV outlets. They are astounded by it. How could this happen?"
It happened for a complex mix of reasons. But in the end, the prescription for failure was quite simple: In granting Washington home rule, Congress imposed a bad financial and political deal on the city, and local leaders made it considerably worse.
In their zeal to gain even limited independence, city leaders accepted numerous economic and political shackles on the government's ability to function:
*The District's revenue-generating powers are paltry, limited to income, property and business taxes: The only Federal help the District receives to offset its expenses is an annual payment, now $660 million, which even some members of Congress regard as inadequate. And it is barred from taxing the commuters who make up two-thirds of Washington's work force, or the 43 percent of property within its borders that is owned by the Government, diplomatic missions or private nonprofit institutions.
*Its financial burdens are large, and made larger by the city's general decline: It must pay for a variety of social-service programs, including Medicaid, which it splits with the Federal Government. (Most other cities pay nothing for Medicaid.)
*And as the only capital of a major democracy without a vote in the national legislature, Washington has little power to press its case on a national level.
"I think you could bring the smartest person from the Harvard School of Government down here, and he couldn't make this thing work," said Fred Cooke, the city's former chief lawyer.
But Washington has also been failed by its elected leaders, including Mr. Barry, who has been Mayor for 14 of the last 18 years, and Sharon Pratt Kelly, who was Mayor from 1990 to 1994, during which time Mr. Barry served six months in prison on a conviction for drug possession. Both championed a liberal ideology, unchecked by any conservative opposition, in which government provided jobs and services while paying too little attention to the city's budget and physical condition.
Mr. Barry, who describes himself as a child of the civil rights movement, acknowledged in an interview that some of his priorities were misplaced: "My focus was on social services, jobs and education. In retrospect, we should have paid more attention to roads and bridges."
And while that emphasis helped enrich and expand the city's black middle class, the inattention to roads and bridges helped drive them -- and the crucial tax base they represented -- to the suburbs.
But in recent years, the city's problems, and its efforts to address them, have been complicated by the racial and class strains that originated when the city was ruled in a high-handed manner by white-dominated Congressional committees.
That history has often served as a convenient foil for the city's political leadership, particularly Mr. Barry and his supporters, to deflect attention from their own managerial shortcomings, and from corruption in city government: In the 1980's, several of Mr. Barry's close associates went to prison on a variety of charges.
Now, allies of Mr. Barry have criticized the control board, and its chairman, Andrew F. Brimmer, as a vehicle for whites to retake control of the city. They have been especially angered by Mr. Brimmer's threat to dismiss the head of the city's human services agency, a longtime friend of the Mayor, for poor management practices.
"He's doing the white folks' bidding," said Lamont Mitchell, owner of the Imani Cafe in southeast Washington and a close friend of Mr. Barry, referring to Mr. Brimmer, who is black. "They want to get a foothold back in the city," he said. "They lost it through home rule, and they want to get back in charge."
Over the years, that kind of reaction has led whites, and some blacks, to abstain from criticizing the city, even in the face of poor delivery of services.
"There has been a genuine guilt about intervening," said Representative Thomas M. Davis 3d, the freshman Virginia Republican who heads the House subcommittee with general oversight authority for the District. "The difficulty has been every time Congress tried to intervene, people yell home rule or racism."
But as the control board has struggled to halt the city's slide, and as Mr. Barry has challenged its authority, there is a growing sense in some powerful quarters -- and a growing fear in others -- that Washington may need a drastically altered style of government or maybe even a new one.
"The District of Columbia government is a mess," Mr. Gingrich said in a recent television interview. "The fact is, it has to be overhauled."

District Life
From Potholes To Robberies
The problems in Washington never seemed worse than this year, when acts of man and nature combined to deny city residents many of their basic services.
As a stepchild of Congress, the District was virtually shut down along with other Federal agencies during a budget impasse that began last fall and lasted into the spring. With lawmakers unwilling to release money owed the District, the city stopped picking up trash; libraries and health clinics closed, and tourism, the main industry after government, slowed to a trickle.
Then came the blizzard of 1996, exposing the city's inability to perform even simple functions like plowing. While Mr. Barry took to the skies in a helicopter tour of city streets and pronounced most of them passable, residents wondered what city he was inspecting.
Only the Federal shutdown that kept thousands of workers home prevented total chaos along snow-blocked commuter routes. Finally, city officials admitted that the District had too few snow-removal vehicles and salt trucks and that many were inoperable because of insufficient financing to fix them.
The salt, sunshine and warming temperatures that finished clearing the streets only renewed attention on another major problem -- potholes. They were everywhere, growing in size and number, and city officials said it would take months to fill them.
But the disrupting effects of snow and potholes were only annoying examples of a city in free fall. Scarcely a week passes without evidence pointing to deeper, more systemic problems in virtually every city agency. Here are several recent examples:
*Mr. Barry disclosed that the city was paying Medicaid benefits to 20,000 ineligible people. He blamed the oversight on a faulty computer program, which is now fixed, he said, saving the city $15 million a year.
*After a fire at the Department of Treasury, firefighters acknowledged that the closest ladder truck could not respond because it was out of service. They also said that with so few trucks available, other parts of the city were left under covered during the fire.
*Two employees of the city's real estate tax agency were dismissed and four others placed on leave after officials found that they had used improper methods to assess 9,700 residential properties.
*The elevated levels of bacteria recently found in the District's water system violated Federal standards for the fifth time in a year. Carol M. Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the finding reflected "a pattern of deterioration, neglect and uneven operation."
*Recyclable trash, once picked up weekly, is now collected every other week.
Even major political figures are touched by the problems. Attorney General Janet Reno, the country's top law-enforcement officer, lives in a downtown building where Karin Vaughan owned a beauty salon and spa for years. In April, Ms. Vaughan closed the salon after a string of crimes, including an armed robbery of her customers.
"I wake up in the morning, and I want to cry," said Ms. Vaughan, who lost most of her $250,000 investment in the business. "It feels like a relative has died."

Home Rule
'They Didn't Get A Good Deal'
For 100 years before home rule, Washington had been governed by a Mayor and City Council appointed by the President, and before that a three-member Board of Commissioners. Much of Washington's decline has come as a result of the deal made to allow the city to govern itself.
When police officers, firefighters, teachers and judges moved from the Federal payroll to the District's, Congress did not provide money for their retirement fund. The liability then was $1.9 billion. Today, it has ballooned to $5.1 billion, in part because the District has maintained a generous retirement plan that includes two cost-of-living increases each year. Washington's Medicaid costs have also expanded, to $844 million, from $17 million in 1973.
In addition, the city inherited a set of books so poorly maintained that a $279 million deficit was not discovered for three years.
Without a state government to funnel taxes of non-city residents back to Washington, the estimated $18.5 billion earned in the city by suburbanites is lost to the District. And the Congressional ban against a commuter tax costs Washington $1.25 billion annually in lost revenue, city officials say.
"If you move out of New York to Westchester County, you still pay taxes to the state, which kicks back some to the City of New York in the form of state aid," said James O. Gibson, who was Mr. Barry's planning commissioner during the Mayor's first term. "Here, if you move, it's a 100 percent loss to Washington."
As a result, more than half the money in the District budget comes from local taxes. Other cities receive, on average, 75 percent of their budgets from state and Federal governments. In fact, other national capitals -- like those of the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Japan -- are generously subsidized by their governments.
The District's revenue problems are made worse by the fact that 43 percent of taxable land in Washington, most of it prime downtown real estate, is free of property tax because it belongs to the Federal Government, diplomatic missions or other tax-exempt organizations like the American Red Cross, the World Bank and Georgetown University.
Representative Julian C. Dixon, Democrat of California, and the former chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees Washington's budget, said of home rule: "I don't know if they got a bad deal, but they didn't get a good deal."
Former and current city officials generally agree that the city's negotiators took the deal because local residents thirsting for self-rule felt the prevailing winds of the civil-rights movement, which emphasized black political empowerment. After all, District residents only won the right to vote for President in 1964.
"Those of us who were fighting for home rule were so anxious to get some degree of freedom, we didn't examine what it was," Mr. Barry said. "We inherited a mess."
That "mess" has discouraged many would-be politicians from trying to build a career here. Indeed, working for the city is often perceived as a dead end, leading to no meaningful state or Federal office. In the mid-1980's, before he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the late Ronald H. Brown was urged by a group of civic leaders to run for mayor. He turned them down, asking, "Where do you go from there?"

Leadership
Creating Jobs, And Problems
For almost 10 years, the shortcomings of independence were masked by a robust local economy. An office building boom through the early 1980's transformed the downtown skyline and swelled the city treasury with new tax revenue. The city chipped away at its deficit. From 1984 to 1987, the population increased.
The good times paralleled Mr. Barry's early years in office, starting in 1978, and he quickly improved services and controlled finances, winning the support and confidence of the business community. But the boom years hid the underlying flaws of the city's leadership. And ultimately, Mr. Barry's policies made conditions worse.
While new tax revenue flowed in, the Barry administration ignored crumbling roads and bridges, and failed to invest in new computers, telephone systems or training programs for workers. It passed no tax cuts or other measures to attract new businesses.
Instead, the administration spent much of the money hiring more workers, expanding the city's employment rolls to more than 48,700 employees by 1990, from 39,000 in 1982. Those city workers helped create a loyal following for Mr. Barry, who won re-election in 1982 and 1986. They also reduced the city's welfare rolls.
"Marion's view was, 'I can put them on the payroll, pay them and get some tax money from them, or I can put them on welfare and pay them and get nothing from them,' " said a former Barry aide who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. " 'Either way,' he said, 'I'm going to be paying them.' "
But those new middle-class city employees eventually did what thousands of middle-class people have done before: move to the suburbs, in this case, of Maryland and Virginia, taking their tax dollars with them.
In 1988, the District tried to pass a residency requirement for municipal workers, but Congress blocked it. Today, 51 percent of the District government's workers live outside Washington's borders.
Mr. Barry argues that he did not add unnecessarily to the city payroll. He said he had to hire more employees to build up the police department and to run St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a psychiatric institution run by the Federal government that was transferred to the city by Congress in 1985.
"That was a mistake on my part," Mr. Barry said of accepting responsibility for the hospital, which meant adding 3,700 people to the payroll. "We wanted to demonstrate we were able to govern ourselves, able to manage all these big state, county and city functions. We should have said, 'No, thank you.' "
Around the same time, the city expanded programs, offering more social benefits than most municipalities, like full-day kindergarten for 5-year-olds, and half-day nursery school for 4-year-olds. It passed a law guaranteeing every homeless person shelter, and financed a university and law school for residents. By 1995, Washington, with an annual budget of nearly $5 billion, spent more on an annual per capita basis, around $9,500, than any other city in the country.
"The city provided the Cadillac of safety-net systems," said Jack Evans, a veteran member of the city council. "It never saw a model program it didn't fund."
Also in the mid-1980's, the national recession hit Washington, stunting economic growth, and crack cocaine made its first major impact on the city, overwhelming the police department and social agencies. As the exodus of the middle class quickened, Washington by the late 1980's became known as the "Murder Capital" of the United States.
Between 1985 and 1990, the District's population declined by almost 31,000 people, and another 49,000 left by 1995 -- a 12 percent drop in 10 years that included many middle-class taxpayers. Businesses also left.
"We left for economic reasons as well as the degradation of the city," said John Martin, chief financial officer of the Washington Consulting Group, a government contracting firm with 75 employees that left the District last year after 25 years. The company moved just across the city line to the suburb of Bethesda, Md., where Mr. Martin said the firm pays $12 a square foot for office space, compared with $30 a square foot in Washington, and where the office is closer for its employees who also chose to live in the Maryland suburbs rather than the city.
He said the state of Maryland also provided economic incentives, like moving and employee-training costs, benefits Washington was in no position to match.
As the District's economy flagged, evidence emerged that Mr. Barry was beginning his own downward spiral of drug use, alcohol abuse and late-night adventures that ultimately led to his 1990 arrest for smoking crack cocaine. Caught on videotape in a sting operation in a downtown hotel room, his instant response that he was "set up" became a national joke; his conviction and imprisonment became a symbol of corrupt government and an eroding national capital.
But even before his arrest, Mr. Barry's behavior had lost the city critical support on Capitol Hill. As Dwight Cropp, a senior aide to Mr. Barry in the 1980's, said, a common attitude among Federal lawmakers was: "As long as Marion Barry was Mayor of the District of Columbia, the Congress was not going to do anything to assist us."
In November 1990, Mrs. Kelly, a former corporate executive, won election as Mayor with 85 percent of the vote. She vowed to clean out City Hall, not with a broom but with a shovel.

Lost Opportunities
A Bad Situation Gets Even Worse
Before he left office in 1990 after his arrest and conviction, Mr. Barry brought together a group of business, civic, academic and union leaders to study the problems of the city. The $2 million project resulted in an extensive report that warned city leaders to cut spending and increase revenues, or face dire consequences.
While the Kelly administration adopted many of the recommendations, many others were unfulfilled.
"This was a big opportunity missed," said Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who headed the group. "When Sharon Pratt Kelly came in, she had the window of opportunity and the enormous good will of Congress. There was momentum for D.C. to face up to its problems, reduce the city payroll, restructure the government and come up with long-term solutions."
"Once that opportunity was missed," Ms. Rivlin added, "things went from bad to worse."
Mrs. Kelly declined to be interviewed for this article. But Robert Mallett, her former city administrator, said: "I think many who found her a disappointment may have felt better about her had she had stronger political skills. But nobody could say she didn't tackle every major problem faced by the city."
When Mrs. Kelly took office, Washington was $331 million in debt, the legacy of falling revenues in a bad economy. But unlike Mr. Barry, Mrs. Kelly was embraced by Congress and the financial markets. Wall Street firms raised $336 million for the city. Congress increased its annual payment by $200 million a year to $660 million, and provided a one-time $100 million "emergency" payment.
For the first time in years, the city had a clean financial slate.
But Mrs. Kelly squandered this good fortune and did not make the tough cuts in the city's high expenses, say city officials and Federal lawmakers. Her administration only nibbled at reducing the work force, while tax-exempt organizations like Georgetown University rebuffed her efforts to have them pay anything to the city.
"She didn't have a political base, so she didn't feel she could do the hard things," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's nonvoting Congressional delegate.
On paper, the Kelly administration looked efficient. Each year, the city balanced its budget, occasionally even showing a small surplus. But behind these numbers was a harsher reality. Federal lawmakers said the administration used questionable accounting tactics to mask a widening gap between revenue and expenses. Even the money borrowed on Wall Street to pay off past debts was used for current expenses.
Unknown to most, the city had again begun to roll up massive deficits.
Money earmarked for capital projects was spent for operations in violation of a Congressional ban, and losses at D.C. General Hospital were hidden on the books as loans, according to a 1994 General Accounting Office report. In one year, a "fifth quarter" of tax revenue was added to balance the books.
"It wasn't done in the dark of night," said Mr. Mallett, referring to the accounting strategy. He added that the administration's actions were approved by the city council and by Congress. "We told everybody," he said. "We didn't have any money. We didn't have any cash. We couldn't meet the payroll. You had to do something."
He said Mrs. Kelly felt hemmed in by the conflicting expectations of the two major groups that had supported her: middle-class whites pressing for a smaller government, and middle-class blacks, many of whom worked for the city.
Mr. Mallett said that for many white people who did not work for the city and were paying higher fees and property tax assessments, there were not enough layoffs. "They felt betrayed," he said, adding, "To middle-class blacks, it meant that she was out to get me, that she was doing white folks' work. Clearly that wasn't true. She was just trying to save her city."
And she got virtually no support from President Clinton in trying to ease the restrictions on the city's taxing powers, or to have the Federal Government take over some of the city government's burdens. Indeed, a former Kelly aide says Mr. Clinton virtually ignored Washington and Mrs. Kelly after making one well-publicized walk along a black commercial strip shortly after his election.
"President Clinton never even invited Mrs. Kelly over to the White House," said the former Kelly aide, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "Bush at least had her over for a state dinner and had a photo op with her. She didn't have anything like that with President Clinton. My marvelous liberals."
By the end of her term, the city's deficit had ballooned to $335 million, according to a General Accounting Office report.
"She was worse than Barry," said Representative Davis of the oversight subcommittee. "She was in a job over her head. Congress gave the city $1 billion more, and it got no value back."
In 1994, just two years after his release from a six-month prison term, Mr. Barry made one of the most remarkable comebacks in American politics by defeating Mrs. Kelly in the Democratic primary and easily winning in the general election.
Shortly after his inauguration, he announced that the deficit could reach $722 million within a year. Wall Street promptly downgraded the city's bond rating to junk status.
The control board began its work last year by imploring Mr. Barry to cut thousands of the jobs created in the 1980's. Resistant at first, Mr. Barry finally recognized the powers lined against him, especially with Congress ignoring his requests for more money and with Mr. Williams, the new financial officer, accountable only to the control board.
And by last February, Mr. Barry unveiled a plan to eliminate 10,000 city workers, 25 percent of the work force, as part of a four-year plan.
But even now, with major efforts for improvement at work, change is slow. City officials have eliminated a few jobs, and Representative Walsh is insisting that Mr. Barry find more spending cuts in the proposed 1997 budget of $5.1 billion.
"Mr. Barry is a tremendous politician," said Mr. Williams, the city's chief financial officer, who has not always agreed with the Mayor's policies. "But he's a lot like nuclear power. On a good day, he can light the city. On a bad day, he can blow it up."

Chronology: "Steps on a Path Of Steady Decline"
 In May 1974, residents of the District of Columbia approved the Home Rule Act in a referendum. Since then, the city has struggled with the constraints placed on its independence by Congress, while grappling with persistent deficits and mismanagement by elected oficials.
 
JAN. 1975
Walter E. Washington, the first mayor elected under home rule, takes office, along with the new City Council.
 
JAN. 1978
Marion S. Barry Jr. is sworn in as the District's second mayor under home rule.
 
JUNE 1980
An audit by the District's financial consultants turns up a $284 million accumulated debt, much of dating back to before home rule, and a $1.4 billion shortfall for city pension funds.
 
JUNE 1981
The General Accounting Office discloses that three banks, seven credit unions and a church, all authorized to dispense food stamps, failed to distribute $2.1 million taken in during the late 1970's; most are out of business, and the city cannot collect.
 
OCT. 1981
Under pressure from religious groups, the House of Representatives kills a District ordinance to decriminalize all forms of sexual relations, the first time Congress has overturned a City Council measure that did not clearly impinge upon Federal prerogatives.
 
AUG. 1985
A Constitutional amendment, passed in 1978, to give the District full voting representation in Congress dies after less than half of the states needed for ratification approve the amendment by the seven-year decline.
 
JAN. 1987
A breakdown in snow removal virtually paralyzes the city and the Federal Government; Mayor Barry is in California at the Super Bowl.
 
OCT. 1990
Mayor Barry is sentenced to six months in prison, after being convicted of one misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession.
 
NOV. 1990
Sharon Pratt Kelly is elected Mayor; during the campaign, she vows to "clean house with a shovel, not a broom."
 
SEP. 1992
Congress votes to force the District to hold a referendum on the death penalty; the vote marks a further deteriotation in relations between Congress and the District.
 
SEPT. 1994
Mr. Barry is reelected Mayor; the budget surpluses under Mayor Kelly are seen as the product of questionable accounting practices.
 
FEB. 1995
Moody's Investors Service downgrades the District's municipal debt to junk status. Standard & Poor's follows suit tow months later.
 
FEB. 1995
The General Accounting Office reports that the District is insolvent and may run out of money by summer.
 
APRIL 1995
President Clinton signs legislation to create a financial control board for the District.
 
Budget data are included from 1981; data before the city's first audit in 1980 are seen as unreliable.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICAN;
Dole Appeals for Businesswomen's Support

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., July 24

 BODY:
Bob Dole made a big pitch for the women's vote today, highlighting small businesses owned by women and bringing the Republican National Convention's keynote speaker, Representative Susan Molinari of New York, on the campaign trail with him to vouch for his commitment to women's interests.
Women, Mr. Dole said, are starting small businesses at twice the rate of men. And so in two campaign stops in Pennsylvania today, he tried to reassure women that he would be better for small business -- and therefore better for the economy and for them -- than President Clinton had been. 
 Mr. Dole pledged to make various tax and regulatory changes to benefit small business, saying he would announce plans for estate tax relief and a reduction in the capital gains tax as part of the economic program that he will soon unveil.
"I will be on your side, a President who understands what it takes to run a small business," he told about 300 people at the Ace Wire Spring and Form Company, a female-headed factory in McKees Rocks, outside Pittsburgh, that makes oversized paper clips.
"I will stand up for the mom-and-pop store, the new high-tech company and the aspiring woman entrepreneur with a small-business opportunity plan," he said, "and will put government in your corner and not on your back."
Later, at a cookie dough plant in this Philadelphia suburb, he met with Hope Spivak, owner of Hope's Country Fresh Cookies, and said that as President he would hold a White House conference for "women only" to talk about how to create more businesses owned by women. "That's the future of America," he declared. "That's the Dole administration."
Mr. Dole was well received by the audiences at today's events, but he nonetheless arrived in Pennsylvania to bad news. A new poll, conducted by Terry Madonna at Millersville University, found him trailing Mr. Clinton in the state by 24 percentage points. Although he has paid five visits to Pennsylvania since its primary three months ago, he fared worse in this poll than in April, when he trailed the President here by 17 points.
The new poll also showed that even when he was paired with the Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, as his hypothetical running mate, the margin remained the same.
Mr. Dole told his McKees Rocks audience that he would win the election anyway, "because people will understand who Bob Dole is, who I am."
"Who is this man who stands up and tells me he wants to be President of the United States?" the candidate continued. "What's he all about? What's he done? Where is he from, and where will he take us as a country?
"These are important questions that will be answered time and time and time again," Mr. Dole promised, although he did not take this opportunity to answer them.
In Pennsylvania as elsewhere, Mr. Dole is laboring under the disadvantage of a yawning "gender gap," in which female voters overwhelmingly prefer Mr. Clinton.
To try to narrow that gap, the Dole campaign invited Ms. Molinari along for her first public outing with the presumed nominee since he named her last week as the Republican convention's keynote speaker. Mr. Dole decided on the flight from Washington to Pittsburgh this morning that she should speak, and the campaign was pleased with her gusto.
She told the group in McKees Rocks that "there is a gender gap that shows up in poll after poll" and that some candidates deserved one. "But not Bob Dole," she asserted.
Like the cheerleader she once was, Ms. Molinari, a 38-year-old Staten Islander, added: "The majority of small businesses that start up in this nation are being started up by -- who? Ladies?"
"Women," the audience answered.
"Women," Ms. Molinari affirmed. "When you say we are going to have government be a partner with small business, who are you helping? Women. And Americans.
"And that's what Bob Dole's record has been all about. When it comes to small business and it comes to women and it comes to helping this nation, there's no finer gentleman."
In his own speech, first in McKees Rocks and then here in King of Prussia, Mr. Dole said the President had been ruinous to small business. He cited not only Mr. Clinton's veto of 1995 budget-balancing legislation and of a bill that would have curbed product liability suits but also the President's 1993 tax increases.
Literature handed out by local Democrats, on the other hand, said that the Small Business Administration had increased its loans to women by 300 percent during the Clinton Presidency and that a record number of small businesses had been created in each year of the Clinton Administration.

HEADLINE: Communists Defeat Yeltsin Plan to Lure Investment

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 24

 BODY:
In a stinging rebuff to President Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist-dominated Parliament has rejected legislation intended to encourage billions of dollars of foreign investment in the oil and gas industry.
The legislation, which would provide a legal framework for sharing oil production, has been a top priority of Western oil companies eager to develop new fields. It has also been strongly supported by the Yeltsin Government, which is eager to generate badly needed revenue. 
 The Communists' success in blocking the legislation shows that they still have the determination and power to hamper market reforms despite their lopsided defeat by Mr. Yeltsin in the presidential election on July 3.
The Communists are "extremely ideologically charged," said Aleksei Y. Mikhailov, chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Natural Resources, who supported the legislation. "They think that it is best when the state owns everything."
But the failure to pass the law also reflects Mr. Yeltsin's slow start in getting his new policy team in place, as well as what are seen as heavy-handed efforts by Washington to help American oil companies, Russian officials said.
Parliament voted down the legislation late Friday, setting off a round of recriminations, and this week Yeltsin Administration officials and their parliamentary allies vowed to renew the fight.
Along with the decision by the International Monetary Fund to withhold its monthly loan disbursement because of Russia's tax-collection problems, Parliament's action raises fresh questions about the Government's ability to speed reform.
Even before the election, direct foreign investment in Russia was somewhat anemic, a victim of heavy taxes, a labyrinthine bureaucracy and Western fears that the "new Russia" is politically unstable. "China has attracted 25 times more Western investment than Russia," the Government's analytical center reported in March.
Mr. Yeltsin's re-election brought hope that foreign investors would open their wallets. But for many foreign investors, Mr. Yeltsin's re-election is not enough. Major American oil companies, for example, say they will not invest billions in new projects unless production-sharing laws are enacted.
Under such arrangements, Russia would forgo a multitude of taxes. In return, Russia would get a share of the oil produced by the foreign companies, a royalty based on production and taxes on the companies' profits.
American officials say such an arrangement is attractive because it establishes a ceiling on tax costs. "The project could be unsuccessful, but not because you are overtaxed," an American oil executive said.
But the issue has long been politically charged, with Communists and nationalists saying the West is out to exploit Russia's natural resources.
"Oil and gas are very political," said Alexander M. Knaster, the managing director of the CS First Boston Corporation, financial consultants. "You are not dealing just with the economy. You are dealing with family silver."
As the wrangling has continued, major multi-billion-dollar projects have been put on hold.
One is the Timan Pechora project, in which a consortium of Western companies led by Texaco Inc. plans to drill in the Arctic. Other companies involved include Exxon, Amoco and Norsk Hydro, of Norway.
Other major projects that await new legislation include Amoco's development of the Priobskoye field in Siberia and three projects off Sakhalin Island in the Far East, two by Exxon and one a combined project by the Mobil Corporation and Texaco. Two earlier projects off Sakhalin led by international consortiums were specifically approved by previous legislation and are going forward.
The Ministry of Fuel and Energy has estimated that more than $50 billion in long-term investment could be attracted by production-sharing agreements. Western companies say the shorter-term investment would be far less, but would still be counted in the billions.
The production-sharing issue has been brewing for years. Parliament adopted a basic law on production-sharing in December, but American companies say further amendments are needed to strengthen legal protections. Legislation is also needed to modify the tax code and bring other laws into line with the December legislation.
But when this supplementary legislation came before Parliament late Friday, it was rejected by a vote of 150 to 148. Only 5 of the 147 Communist members of Parliament voted for the measure.
The Yeltsin Government also wants Parliament to authorize 250 locations where Western companies would have the right to produce oil under production-sharing agreements.
But this list has yet to be put to a vote, and supporters now say a list of 20 to 30 locations may be all the traffic will bear in the Communist-dominated Parliament.
The Communists' pervasive suspicion of Western investors was but one factor that led to the defeat.
According to Mr. Mikhailov, the natural resources chairman, recent efforts by Vice President Al Gore on behalf of the legislation backfired, prompting accusations by the ultra-nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovksy that the West is pressing Parliament to sell out the motherland.
Mr. Mikhailov said he hopes to revist the issue in several months, by which time he hopes the Yeltsin Government and other supporters will be better organized. He also hopes for support from outlying regions seeking foreign investment, and from Russian oil companies eager to join forces with their wealthier Western counterparts.
But already investors are being cautioned that they may not get everything they want and that the new legislation will take time.
"I expect a resolution in 1997," said Mr. Knaster of First Boston. "The production-sharing law may not be in perfect shape, but I expect we will get to the point where foreign investment starts to flow. It will be a combination of increased courage on the part of the Western companies and increased tolerance by the Russians."

HEADLINE: A Surly New York As Olympic Host?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While "Olympic Fever in New York" (editorial, July 21) fuels New York City's economic imagination, consider the reality. 
 You touch on the problem of transportation, yet New York City can't comprehend a proposal to connect Kennedy International Airport with midtown Manhattan other than its projected $3 billion cost.
Three historical events exemplify what New York can muster: the World's Fairs of 1939 and 1964 and the Bicentennial celebration that included Operation Sail in 1976.
However, those venues were more centralized and monitorable than would be the case in a New York Olympiad. While terrorism as we know it today was virtually nonexistent during the World's Fairs, Op-Sail officials were concerned about it, particularly with all the dignitaries in attendance.
The New York City Partnership, which is raising money for a feasibility study of a New York Olympics, should examine the finances of both fairs and our economy at those times. During Op-Sail, the city wasn't sure it could pay for sanitation services. Yet in the face of bankruptcy, the bicentennial celebration did provide New York an economic boost.
If the city considers playing host to the Olympics, a good dress rehearsal might be another World's Fair in the year 2000. I have proposed such a plan to both Albany and City Hall.
Our citizenry has been so divided and disgruntled that it is conceivable that some New Yorkers might not welcome the Games, taking a not-in-my-backyard attitude.
Simply, these are inhumane times. New York lacks the gentility required to play host to the Olympic Games. We are hostile, not hospitable.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
Westchester Development Is On Again

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
At Rosecliff, a development of single-family houses overlooking the Hudson River in the Westchester County community of Briarcliff Manor, construction has been stop and go since it began in the building boom of the mid-1980's.
Eleven years and three owners later, the project, which will eventually include 116 single-family homes, is two-thirds complete. And now the project is to begin its latest chapter. Earlier this month, Toll Brothers Inc., among the region's larger developers, bought one model home and 36 building lots for $4.6 million at the 152-acre site. 
 The company, based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., expects to restart construction at the project by this fall and complete it in three years, said Robert Parahus, a vice president at Toll. The seller was Rosecliff Equities, which bought the unfinished houses in 1995 from the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that is now disbanded. Resolution Trust took over the undeveloped property when it seized the failed bank that was the financial partner of the first developer, who built and sold most of the 79 homes.
The development, set on a cliff, was once the estate of Edward Walker Harden, who went from being the financial editor of The Chicago Tribune to a millionaire investment banker. It is off Sleepy Hollow Road in the village, which lies in Ossining and Mount Pleasant, 15 minutes from White Plains.
Toll's plan is to build the remaining homes and, contingent upon receiving approvals, modify them to update their interiors. Changes include expanding the kitchens and master bedrooms and baths and making basements, which are not in all the earlier homes, a standard feature. The size and exteriors of the 2,200-to-3,000-square-foot homes, designed in contemporary styles, would not change appreciably.
They, like the existing homes, clustered in groups on the eastern portion of the site, will also have three or four bedrooms (some earlier ones had two bedrooms) and two-car garages. The project is designed as a fee-simple homeowners association, meaning that buyers own the land under and around their homes -- one-eighth- to one-half-acre lots -- but other areas are owned in common and managed by the association. They can also cast off such chores as mowing the lawn and shoveling snow. Seventy acres on the site's western portion have been left undeveloped.
Rosecliff has a clubhouse in the 18,000-square-foot mansion and a pool and two tennis courts. A third tennis court and a paddle tennis court will be added if homeowners want them, Mr. Parahus said, adding that a meeting to discuss such issues is to be set up soon.
The 37 homes are expected to start at $460,000 to $500,000, with some as high as $570,000. The monthly maintenance fee is $475.
Mr. Parahus said Toll saw Rosecliff as "another opportunity in another desirable area" of the county. "The buyers there fit our buyer profile," he added.
The project also underscores Toll's expansion into New York State in general and Westchester County in particular. In the last three years it has started or restarted nine projects, eight of them, with 409 residences, in the county.
Seeing the project move forward is welcomed by homeowners. Mal Nechis, an eight-year resident and vice president of the homeowners association said, "We are hopeful that with an organization like Toll, with a good reputation and a good track record, this is the final chapter, the remaining homes will be built and sold and our values in general will improve." Mr. Nechis said there were still concerns "until we hear what they will do, which will become clear over the next several weeks."
It also pleases Briarcliff Manor, where development activity has rebounded. Several projects that gathered dust during the sluggish economy and others that were started but delayed are moving ahead or to completion. Rosecliff, however, has the longest development history.
Everyone who bought the site has followed the approved plan, which reflects the village's land-use policies for "planned rather than haphazard development," said Lynn M. McCrum, the village manager. If Toll stays with simple changes "it probably will not be a big deal," he added
Rosecliff is being revived at a time when the market in Westchester County is improving. As of the second quarter, 1,879 existing homes of all types were sold, up 23 percent from the same time last year. The median sales price also increased to $245,000, from $236,500 in 1995. For single-family homes the price rose to $292,000 from $283,000, the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service said.
Mr. Parahus said sales at Rosecliff would start in October.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Surges and Dollar Falls As Germany Fails to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The mark surged and the dollar fell yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised currency traders by leaving German interest rates unchanged.
Many traders had been expecting a cut, and the decision by the central bank raised concern that German rates would not move any lower. 
 "We probably have seen the bottom for German interest rates," said Robert Fullem, a currency salesman at National Westminster Bank. With the German economy showing signs of rebounding from a prolonged slowdown, "I would be surprised if they cut the repo rate any further," he said.
The Bundesbank left the discount rate at 2.50 percent and the Lombard rate at 4.50 percent. It kept its chief money market rate, the securities repurchase rate, at 3.30 percent until its next meeting in four weeks.
Lower rates often hurt the mark by making deposits denominated in it less attractive.
"The Bundesbank certainly had an impact," said James Kemp, managing director of foreign exchange at Citibank. "They have surprised the market, as they tend to do."
The dollar dropped as low as 1.4703 marks, its lowest since July 16, when it reached 1.4692 marks. In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at at 1.4775 marks, down from 1.4890 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also traded at 108.31 Japanese yen, down from 108.40 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5575 from $1.5525.
The dollar held up better against the yen amid expectations the Bank of Japan would not soon raise rates.
The Bundesbank last cut the repo rate, a key money market rate, in February, to 3.3 percent. Yesterday's inaction will leave German rates unchanged for at least four weeks, as the Bundesbank council takes a summer break.
The central bank's decision disappointed traders who expected interest-rate differentials to widen in favor of the dollar, with forecasts for a German rate cut and a rate increase in the United States. One- month Eurodollar deposits yield 5.4375 percent, compared with 3.3125 percent for one-month Euromark deposits.
"Everyone felt the Germans would lower rates, and we'd raise them," said James McGroarty, chief currency manager at Potomac Babson Inc., a money manager. "The fact that hasn't happened has led the dollar to fall."

Secrets of the K.G.B.: A Very Discreet Disrobing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 25

 BODY:
When the secret police came for Osip Mandelstam in 1938, the one book that this century's greatest Russian poet managed to take with him on his lonely road to Siberian exile and death was Dante's "Inferno."
With the Soviet secret police, Mandelstam knew where he was headed. Who wouldn't? Few organizations in modern history have inspired as much fear, caused more pain or managed to remain shrouded more completely in mystery. Until now. 
 This month, in an attempt to be modern, sophisticated, reasonable and -- above all, it seems -- hip, the K.G.B.'s successor agency, the Federal Security Service, will release six choice hours of its history on CD-ROM, making its long convoluted role as enforcer of evil for Soviet dictators available to anyone with the ability to click on an icon.
"We released this on CD-ROM because that is a modern way to communicate with people," said General Yuri G. Kobaladze, the glib, eloquent spokesman for the security service. "We want to be modern. Even in this sphere we still want to be better than everyone else. Now let the British make a CD-ROM about their intelligence service, and then let the Americans do it. But we will always be first."
They will indeed, although even the slick new agency seems to realize that CD-ROM is not the forum for major new revelations. Partly, that is because the agency's officials are so ambivalent about their role in the new Russia. It is also because most people -- within and without the agency -- would like to make much of the agency's (and Russia's) recent past disappear.
Consequently there are none; the disk, with 60 interviews, is essentially a historian's curiosity, filled with interesting narrative about the importance of the Russian attempt to develop the atomic bomb, for example, as well as evidence of Khrushchev's vacillation during the Cuban missile crisis. But for viewers desperate to divine new meaning from Moscow, the earth is unlikely to move.
That hardly means this CD-ROM is a gimmick, though. Far from it. Five years ago, when people like General Kobaladze starting discussing this project, many in the agency were outraged.
This little disk is a clear landmark on the frequently erratic road to the new, totally post-Soviet Russia, even without revealing the final truth (or any truth) on the wartime activities of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, Americans who were executed for spying for the Soviet Union, or the full story (or any story) about how the C.I.A. official Aldrich Ames turned into Russia's most damaging and valuable agent in the United States.
Only after much agony within the agency, and much debate in Russian society -- where the thought of the agency or the mention of its headquarters building, the Lubyanka, still makes many people actually tremble -- did the security agency decide that to polish its tarnished image it would have to come at least partly clean. Each fact in the production has been cleared by a dubious panel of experts. Nobody can even guess what was rejected.
"This has not been easy for anyone," said General Kobaladze during a recent preview display of the CD-ROM. He served as a London correspondent for a Soviet newspaper in the early 1980's, when most such positions were assumed in the West to be filled by spies.
"This is after all a secret organization and it's hard to convince people that their lives should be revealed this way," he said. "To say here, 'Let's talk about it, let's show people what we do,' is not easy for any intelligence service. It has been particularly hard for us."
The choices were difficult, in part because, the intelligence community is not unanimously excited about President Boris N. Yeltsin and his support of economic and social reforms.
Was the end of the Soviet Union "tragic," as one clip on the CD suggests, or was it simply the natural end of an evil empire?
"We cannot concern ourselves with how to present history, that is not our task," General Kobaladze said. "But I notice that the whole of Russia is struggling with this question. So why can't we in the intelligence services? Part of why we wanted to make this product is to show that we are not so different from the society we serve."
This CD-ROM will be available to anyone with $60, and it comes in an English and a Russian version.
It opens magically with the viewer sitting in a (virtual) black car as it swings through the gates of Yasenevo, the secret base of covert activities just outside Moscow that is to the K.G.B. what Langley, Va., is to the C.I.A. As the music swells (Tchaikovsky, of course) the black sedan swings past buildings that until recently could have been conjured only in the imaginings of John Le Carre.
The faces of Russian spies flash across the screen as the music plays. (Not famous spies of course; the only famous Russian spies are the ones that got away. They don't seem to make much of an appearance in this production.) There are a series of categories the user can click on: chronology (birth of the Soviet state, the "unpleasant" Stalin period, the hot war, the cold war, and perestroika); personality, geography (Cuba, Afghanistan, etc.). Each section is filled with film clips, sound bites, archival material and plenty of good old-fashioned text.
The people who produced this history are not suggesting it will strip the mystique from the spy agency. They are, in fact, hoping it does the opposite.
"In your country the F.B.I. and C.I.A. openly recruit for employees at the best universities," General Kobaladze said. "I want us to be able to do that, too. I want young Russians to be proud to serve, and to consider this agency worthy of service."

A Certain Treason

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Day after day now America's allies deliver warnings to its people and government. These democracies, which the U.S. counts as its best friends, warn they will take reprisals against America if it tries to reduce their investments in three dictatorships America counts among its worst enemies -- Iran, Libya, Cuba. Heed our threats, say our friends.
Americans should. These threats are symptoms of the sickness of moral treason in the West -- the delivery of the economic fruits of freedom to help destroy the tree of freedom. 
 American governments, including the present, and most American capitalists have also fallen ill and spread the sickness. But the threats of our allies when Congress dares propose even small medicine should be warning to look into ourselves, see the shame and danger the illness has brought us and try to shake it.
How we laughed in the West when Communist leaders said give capitalists enough rope and they will hang themselves. We have been snickering ever since Communism put its own rope, made of corruption and oppression, around its neck and swung to its death.
The prediction is turning out to be not terribly funny. Western capitalists have not managed to kill capitalism. But year after year they are accessories to the economic strengthening -- essential to the military strengthening -- of dictatorships that would destroy the very system of democratic capitalism under which these Westerners made their profits.
Meantime the dictators occupy themselves by taking the lives of their own citizens through domestic terror and through international terror and war, the lives of citizens of free countries.
British citizens died when Pan Am 103 hit the ground in Scotland, destroyed by Libyan terrorists -- likely with the help of Syrian and Iranian comrades. Frenchmen died in the gulf war that Western investments allowed Saddam Hussein to start. The missile power that Beijing informed us could hit Los Angeles is sustained by American investment in industries run by the Chinese Army. All this -- plus the murder of literally millions of Iraqis, Kurds, Tibetans, Chinese, Iranians and Cubans. Do they count?
But now, without a dissenting vote, Congress has passed legislation to penalize foreign companies that invest more than $40 million in Iranian and Libyan energy development -- essential to those two countries on the U.S. terrorist list.
American companies are already barred from those investments. Foreign companies that ignore the restrictions would not be permitted to export to the U.S. or get American Government loans or high-tech licenses.
Credit for initiating the bill goes to Senator Alfonse D'Amato. Another New York Republican, Benjamin Gilman, led the campaign in the House.
The bill includes a waiver the President can use in the national interest as he sees it. Mr. Clinton has used similar waivers to destroy human rights action against China and delay or kill action against companies that deal in Cuban property expropriated by Fidel Castro from Americans or Cubans who became Americans. But if he uses the waiver on Iran and Libya, Congress will probably pass a no-waiver bill over his head.
Americans opposing the D'Amato bill and the Helms-Burton bill on nationalized U.S. property in Cuba say they would amount to an illegal secondary boycott like the Arab boycott against Israel.
The fact is that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade does not bar all secondary boycotts. GATT accepted Egypt after it began the world boycott of Israel. Also: American courts have upheld similar sanctions against Communist countries at least four times from Harry Truman's time to Ronald Reagan's.
Enough law book. I guess I do not talk the talk or think the thoughts of those who cannot tell the difference between dictatorships trying to boycott a democracy out of existence -- as in the boycott of Israel -- and the attempt of a democracy to slow the empowerment of dictatorships by capitalists profiting in and by freedom's grace. The difference can be found in law books but more clearly in minds and hearts, or some of them.
The allies have a choice -- trade with America or our mutual enemies. America has one too -- refuse to strengthen tyrannies or continue moral treason against ourselves.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Fell More Than Forecast in June

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods declined in June, weighed down by weaker demand for aircraft, cars and business equipment, the Commerce Department reported today.
New orders for durable goods fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted $169.07 billion -- slightly weaker than the drop of six-tenths of 1 percent Wall Street economists had anticipated. 
 The June decline, the fourth this year, followed a 4.2 percent jump in May that reflected a surge in commercial aircraft demand, the department said. The only other increase in orders this year was a 1.5 percent gain in March.
"After the strong report in May, some kind of a pullback was to be expected," David Blitzer, chief economist at the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said. "There's nothing in this that looks alarming, and there's nothing that would tell me the economy's not real strong."
Further evidence of economic strength came in a report by the Labor Department that applications for first-time unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in six months. In another indicator of economic activity, though, a trade group reported that home resales had declined in June.
Excluding transportation, orders for durables fell in June by six-tenths of 1 percent after a May gain of 1.1 percent gain. Orders for durable goods indicate future prospects of manufacturers, which weighs heavily on the overall economy.
"These are very volatile numbers," Darwin Beck, money market economist at CS First Boston, said. "They were weaker than anticipated, but if you average them over the last two months, they probably continue to show an economy growing at a modest pace."
Orders for transportation equipment, which includes cars, planes, trains and ships, fell 1.3 percent after soaring by 14.9 percent in May, the department said.
Orders for military goods, which experience wide monthly swings, surged 31.6 percent last month after a 5.8 percent gain in May. If the military segment is excluded, overall orders in June fell by 2 percent after rising 4.2 percent in May.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods, an indication of business investment in new equipment, fell 5.5 percent last month after rising 11.1 percent in May.
Shipments of durable goods, an indication of current demand, fell 1 percent, to $165.7 billion, after a 1.7 percent gain in May. Unfilled orders rose in June for the ninth time in 10 months, gaining seven-tenths of 1 percent, to a backlog valued at $475.89 billion, after gaining six-tenths of 1 percent in May.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said that jobless claims tumbled to 322,000 in the week ended last Saturday from 367,000 in the previous week, partly because of auto industry retooling. The figure was the lowest since the week ended Jan. 13, when blizzard conditions paralyzed much of the East Coast.
Last week's claims were far less than the Wall Street forecasts of 354,000 new applications. The decline also brought the four-week moving average of claims to 352,500, down from a four-week average in the prior week of 360,500.
And the National Association of Realtors said that home resales retreated in June from a record level in May as rising mortgage rates began to affect the market.
Home resales fell 2.3 percent from May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.18 million units, the association said, lower than Wall Street estimates of 4.20 million units.
The group revised its May figure upward to 4.28 million units -- the highest on record -- from the previous estimate of 4.26 million units.
The association said June sales were up 10 percent from a year earlier, when the resale rate was 3.8 million units.

HEADLINE: Dole Considers Tax-Cut Plan Of as Much as $600 Billion

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The tax-cut proposals being considered by Bob Dole's Presidential campaign range as high as $600 billion over six years, but Mr. Dole has not made any decision on the size of the reductions or how to pay for them, campaign aides said today.
Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, called again for the size and powers of the Internal Revenue Service to be reined in, saying, "I think we can downsize the I.R.S." 
 He offered no specifics, although his aides are considering a variety of proposals including shifting I.R.S. personnel from auditing to assisting taxpayers in preparing returns.
Mr. Dole has said he plans to make a tax cut the centerpiece of his economic platform. But despite increasing pressure from fellow Republicans to present his plan, Mr. Dole, who has long put deficit reduction ahead of tax cuts, has continued to study options that include an across-the-board reduction in tax rates of 10 or 15 percent, repeal of tax increases enacted by Congress in 1990 and 1993, making Social Security taxes deductible, a reduction in the capital gains tax and incentives for savings and investment.
In a memorandum sent today to Republican political leaders, Mr. Dole's two top policy advisers, Donald Rumsfeld and Vin Weber, and his campaign manager, Scott Reed, wrote that while Mr. Dole "has not reached a final decision on all the details of his growth plan, we can report that it will be a bold, sweeping program to cut taxes, simplify our tax system, address the economic insecurity of working Americans and free our economy to grow at its full potential."
An across-the-board reduction in tax rates of 15 percent could cost $100 billion a year in revenue and would likely be phased in over six years. Advisers to Mr. Dole said some of the cost would be offset by the additional economic growth a tax cut would stimulate. Neither Mr. Dole nor his advisers have specified how the rest of the cost would be offset in spending cuts or new sources of revenue.
The $600 billion tax cut is "under serious consideration," Nelson Warfield, Mr. Dole's spokesman, told reporters traveling with the candidate. "There are a variety of different options, with different price tags associated with them, and that is one of them."
The Washington Post today reported that one economic analysis circulating within the Dole campaign stated that a $600 billion tax cut could be largely offset by the economic growth that the tax cut would bring. The analysis asserted that as much of 40 percent of the revenue lost through a tax cut of that magnitude could be recaptured through the effects of higher growth.
Responding to the newspaper's report, Mr. Dole said "It's not my announcement and it's not my plan."

HEADLINE: INTERNTIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexico Says It Will Repay $7 Billion To the U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The Mexican Government helped the Clinton Administration neutralize a potentially difficult election-year problem today, announcing that early next month it would pay back $7 billion to the United States.
The early payment will leave only $3.5 billion in outstanding loans from the bailout of Mexico last year, or slightly more than a quarter of the $12.5 billion that the Clinton Administration extended after Mexico came to the brink of national bankruptcy in early 1995. The repayments make it possible for President Clinton to contend that his action, which encountered considerable political resistance, helped prevent a global meltdown of the world's most promising emerging markets -- while creating a profit for the United States Treasury of more than $500 million, because of high interest rates charged to the Mexican Government. 
 Mexican officials said their repayment was motivated by simple economics, not politics. Now that the country has restored its credibility on international markets, it has been able to refinance its borrowings at a lower interest rate -- around 7.6 percent, much lower than the 10 percent the United States was charging -- much the way homeowners refinance mortgages to take advantage of lower rates.
But the political advantages to Mr. Clinton are clear. The repayment makes it difficult for Ross Perot, who is likely to receive the third-party endorsement of his Reform Party, to contend that the Administration spent billions in taxpayer money to prevent a disaster south of the border after the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he railed against in the 1992 campaign, went into effect. And Mr. Clinton's aides are also betting they will succeed at silencing Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the New York Republican who is a major supporter of Bob Dole's candidacy, who argued last year that the loans would never be repaid.
"I would not have thought this possible when we entered this agreement in February, 1995," said Robert E. Rubin, who grappled with the Mexican financial crisis in the first weeks after he was appointed Treasury Secretary in December 1994. Meeting with a group of reporters today in his office, he admitted to periodic doubts himself about whether the bailout -- which he referred to in a far more neutral phrase, "the Mexican support package" -- would succeed in pulling Mexico out of the financial depths.
"I don't wake up in the middle of the night much," he said. "But did I worry about this a lot? Yes, you bet."
Six weeks ago Mexico announced that it would repay $4.7 billion of its outstanding loans, "privatizing" the debt by issuing longer-term bonds to private investors who are now once again willing to lend money to the Government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
To the surprise of American officials, the Mexican refinancing plan was oversubscribed, prompting the Mexican Government to double the amount of debt it had planned to refinance, and to pay back $1 billion to the International Monetary Fund. Several of the fund's major backers, including Japan, had complained that the United States was being paid back first.
Today Mexico's Finance Minister, Guillermo Ortiz, said that the refinancing would save Mexico about $125 million a year -- a politically important point in Mexico City, where the austerity drive after the collapse of the peso touched off mass unemployment and a huge shrinkage of the economy last year.
Mr. Ortiz rejected suggestions that the timing of the early repayment and its size were linked to the Clinton Administration's desire to bury the Mexican bailout as a potential campaign issue.
"No, no, no, it's not that at all," Mr. Ortiz said. "This is obviously a very convenient operation for Mexico."
Mexican officials are also relieved in political terms to be lightening their debt load with Washington. Traditionally Mexico has guarded its sovereignty jealously against political intrusions by its northern neighbor. Many in the Government were mortified that they had to turn to the United States to pull them back from the brink of financial collapse after a mishandled 1994 peso devaluation and that they were forced to pledge Mexican oil revenues as collateral.
"We'd much rather owe to the markets than the U.S. Government," one Mexican official said today.
In the refinancing, in recent weeks Mexico has raised $6 billion by offering a five-year floating-rate bank note in a syndication underwritten by J. P. Morgan and the Swiss Bank Corporation. Because of the intense demand for the note, Mexico was able to lower the initial floating rate it will pay. It will offer a rate that is 200 basis points, or two percentage points, over the three-month London interbank offered rate, which big banks charge each other for international loans.
The offering attracted more than 200 banks and institutional investors from Europe, Asia and the United States. The bidding period closed today. Mexico will pay the United States in early August.
"We are tapping a large group of institutional investors who were not previously buyers of Mexican paper," Mr. Ortiz said.
The return of investor confidence in Mexico is the flip side of the steep price Mexicans have paid for restoring the country to fiscal credibility. Hemmed in by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which prevented Mexico from cutting off imports, Mr. Zedillo agreed to a stringent fiscal and monetary policy whose terms were in some cases dictated in Washington. But after weathering a huge shrinkage in the country's output, Mexico is growing again, by an average of 2 percent in each of the last three quarters. Unemployment is beginning to fall, and private consumption is rising again.
American officials say that exports to Mexico are up 11 percent compared with the beginning months of 1994 -- before the crisis hit. That statistic will likely be cited by Mr. Clinton to answer Mr. Perot's charge four years ago that trade accord would lead to a "giant sucking sound" as American jobs head south. While some jobs certainly did go to Mexico, the crisis there actually discouraged foreign investment in the country, slowing the movement of factories out of the United States.

HEADLINE: Make the New Technology Fit the Worker

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Technology's Edict: Adapt or Lose Out" (Business Day, July 25) rightly points out that workers need to keep up with technological change. But it's not just workers who need to adjust. Machines need to adapt to workers, too. 
 User-friendly technology (technology as a tool to enhance worker skills) is becoming increasingly important as smart companies shift away from the traditional mass-production focus on efficient production at high volume to the new game of increasing worker participation and skill enhancement in what has come to be called high-performance work systems.
Such a shift will require a re-orientation of technology policy. To bolster worker-centered technology development, the White House should create a multidisciplinary initiative to provide coordination across Federal research and development programs, injecting worker-friendly design criteria into Government technology programs from the Defense Department to the national laboratory system.
Some in Washington are talking about a new economic growth plan based on cutting taxes.
Real economic growth will come from a plan that gives workers the skills they need to master the new technologies and the tools and technologies they need to use those skills effectively.
Done right, the dynamic duo of smart workers and smart machines harnessed together in high performance work systems can go a long away toward insuring future economic prosperity.

HEADLINE: Bob Dole, on the Road

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

DATELINE: McKEES ROCKS, Pa.

 BODY:
Bob Dole has found his campaign slogan, and if punctuation is power, this one is a winner.
"The slogan says it all," Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania told an audience at a paper-clip factory. "Bob Dole. A Better Man. For a Better America." A banner behind the podium made it clear that the slogan did indeed have three periods. No one in the campaign knew where they all came from. "Many, many people were involved in creating it," said Mr. Dole's press spokesman. One aide thought it might be a deference to the candidate's staccato speech patterns, but another argued that in Dolese, the slogan would really have read "Bob Dole -- Better Man -- 'merica." 
 The slogan has come a lot easier than the long-awaited tax plan, which may not be released until sometime near the Republican Convention. But that has not stopped Mr. Dole from promising tax cuts. "I'll be announcing my economic package one of these days," he said later in the day. "And when I do, you're going to see a dramatic reduction in [the capital gains] tax.
"Not for the rich!" he added hastily. "But for the people in this audience!"
For an instant, at least, Mr. Dole has solved one of his great vision problems. He has been trying to come up with a tax-cut plan that cannot be attacked as a sop to fat cats, but that still includes longtime Republican betes noires like capital gains and estate taxes. Faced with a dilemma like this in the Senate, he would have split the difference. But a Presidential campaign calls for something starker and sweeter. Something like "a capital gains tax cut only for those of you in this room."
And what about government regulations? "We don't need them!" he cries at a cookie factory near Philadelphia. Earlier in the day at the paper-clip company, Mr. Dole had pretty much left it at that. But the sight of all the raw dough seems to have reminded him that some regulation might be good after all.
"We're gonna keep the health and safety," he amends, standing near flour and sugar sacks. "But a lot of the others are make-work! Make-work!"
Mr. Dole is never going to be a great campaigner, but he seems most uncomfortable when he is trying to push what he knows are wild oversimplifications. If Ronald Reagan had campaigned at that cookie factory, he would have seasoned his talk liberally with anecdotes about struggling families whose road was made smooth by a Republican-sponsored capital gains cut. The stories were sometimes fictional, but Mr. Reagan believed them when he told them, and the audience basked in his sincerity.
Mr. Dole's world view, however, is full of shades of gray. He is happiest making small talk with the audience, telling jokes ("My wife is so smart, Eleanor Roosevelt tried to contact her") and tossing darts at the opposition. When he gets to the red-meat applause lines, he tends to sound either obscure ("I will reform the independent contractor and employee classification rule!") or scary. "Those who commit violent crimes better hope I lose the election!" he said suddenly. "We're gonna stamp it out! We're gonna lock them up!"
He sometimes sounds like a man in an argument with himself, and for good reason. Dole the candidate wants big tax cuts, but the retired legislator still believes they will produce big deficits. There will be no tax plan until one of them wins the fight. GAIL COLLINS

HEADLINE: ON BASKETBALL;
Russians Just Might Sneak Up on the U.S

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
THERE is little or no doubt which is the most gifted and talented of the women's basketball teams here at the Centennial Olympics, but there will be no equivocation in the following assessment that doubles as a warning to the corporately ballyhooed American protagonists: They do not -- repeat Do Not! -- want to be knee deep in a 1-point game with the ball in the hands of Irina Sumnikova.
As a teen-ager in Minsk, Sumnikova wished to be a gymnast, a dancer or musician. She has wound up as the composite artist, the 31-year-old point guard for the Russian Federation, maestro for a team that has absolutely no right to play as harmoniously as it does. 
 "This is the traditional Russian style," Sumnikova said through an interpreter after the Russians passed and screened and back-doored their way to a 75-70 victory over Italy in the game before the United States' 107-47 drubbing of Zaire yesterday at the Georgia Dome. "There are not a lot of strong individuals but we are strong as a team," Sumnikova added.
How this is possible is indeed a testament to Russia's Princetonian precision, considering this team, with only four returning players from its Barcelona gold-medal winners in 1992, has a new coach and has been together only three months. By comparison, the Americans, touring since last fall in their determined rush for home-soil gold, have the working tenure of the 1960's Boston Celtics.
Someone out there in the shadow of the Kremlin can obviously coach.
Most would ascribe this share-the-ball doctrine to the venerable gent who slipped into a headset yesterday for the Russian telecast, and the man in the headset, Aleksandr Gomelsky, would undoubtedly agree.
"My boys," he still calls the men's team, though he retired from the old Soviet system after winning the gold in 1988 at Seoul. And so as not to allow the women to feel neglected by the father of Russian basketball, he refers to them as -- what else? -- "my girls."
Here in Atlanta, Gomelsky has no calls to make on Russian men, as they failed to qualify for the Olympics at the European championships last summer in Greece. Gomelsky was so distressed that there would be no defense here of the silver medal won at the 1994 world championships and of the proud double-gold Russian heritage itself that he parked himself in the middle of Sergei Belov's losing news conference last summer and demanded to know what his coaching successor was going to do about "this tragedy."
Belov, a former star for Gomelsky, shrugged yesterday and said the new world corporate order has caught the Russians short. "Everything is unstable, politically and economically in Russia," said Belov, who doubles as federation president. A new professional league does not pay enough to keep the best Russian players home, which makes national team commitments more difficult to keep.
The old Soviet days of state-sponsored sports custody are gone, as are the fresh troops supplied by the basketball savvy Baltics, Ukraine and other former republics. A handful of central players from the women's team that won the Barcelona gold under the Unified Team banner have dispersed, leaving Sumnikova as the matriarchal distributor of the ball, of minute-by-minute counsel to less-experienced players.
If need be, they get a kiss on the cheek from their only teammate 30 or older. "It's my responsibility to coordinate the play," she said.
Her blond braid flapping stiffly as she cut a geometric swathe through Italy's defense, Sumnikova went the distance, 40 minutes strong, controlling a game in which she took two shots. Made both. She had nine assists and reminded those of us who witnessed the Unified Team's semifinal dismissal of the United States in Barcelona how the west (of Europe) was won.
One, by not turning the ball over against the deeper and more athletic American defensive pressure. Two, with the kind of superior ball movement and passing the Americans haven't grown up with. Three, by crowding the interior and making the perimeter-suspect Americans convert from outside.
Four years later, the United States is back with more collective purpose and better players.
Sumnikova, who is married and plays professionally in Hungary, has returned with a broken left wrist.
"One of the bones," she said.
Gomelsky's rap on the Russian women concerned their "mentality," or their ability to grind out the strenuous victory. He was dismayed when his brother, Yevgeny, who coached the Unified Team to gold in 1992, was replaced by Vadim Kapranov, and when they lost to Brazil earlier this week. But they did hand Italy its first defeat and several weeks ago, in an exhibition game, lost to the United States by only 1 point. Most of all, the yearlong American hype has created a Dream Team effect, inappropriate in a game played below the rim.
In other words, should they meet in the medal round, all the pressure will be on the United States before 30,000 plus. "So why not?" Sumnikova said when asked if the Russians could win. "Why not?"

HEADLINE: Lambs Among the Bulls and Bears

BYLINE: By Ron Chernow; Ron Chernow, the author of "The House of Morgan" and "The Warburgs," is currently writing a biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.

 BODY:
As the stock market retreats from its Himalayan heights of early June, investors have started to suspect, with stomach-churning queasiness, that it's not the cozy, inviting place depicted by their brokers. This sudden cooling of middle-class ardor may well slow the small investor's striking evolution from the pariah of the stock market to its motive force, a trend that gathered strength with the mutual fund boom.
A retrospective glance reflects the shift. In the late 19th century, market panics came regularly, at roughly 10-year intervals, shaking out all but hardened speculators. Leery of common stock, magnates like John D. Rockefeller Sr. packed their portfolios with gilt-edged railroad bonds. In those halcyon days, selling a piece of hypothetical future earnings (stocks) rather than guaranteed interest payments (bonds) was regarded as falling just shy of snake-oil salesmanship. The creation of United States Steel and other trusts electrified the public, yet J. Pierpont Morgan couldn't, in good conscience, recommend common stock to small investors. 
 Nevertheless, some Wall Street graybeards of the 1900's were scandalized that the House of Morgan lent its august imprimatur to stock flotations. Individual investors saw Wall Street as the raffish haunt of swindlers and slick city operators, and they either shied away from the market altogether or were the gullible rubes whose late arrival signaled that a rally had crested.
Stocks began to shed their stigma with the Liberty Bond drives of World War I, which broadened the investing public. In the 1920's, Wall Street made its first audacious bid to entice small investors, with banks setting up securities affiliates that promoted stocks with the subtlety of carnival barkers and blurred the distinction between saving and speculating.
Tempted by easy margin requirements and the moonshine rhetoric of unending prosperity, people dabbled in mutual funds called investment trusts, which invested in other trusts, in an endless chain of speculation. For all the razzmatazz, only about 1.5 million Americans played the market. When the 1929 crash predictably arrived, most people applauded it as condign punishment for those urban sophisticates seduced by the speculative mania.
Scarred by the experience, many middle-class investors, like chastened sinners, swore off stocks for a generation, and it took the Dow Jones average more than 20 years to straggle back to its pre-crash highs. In those moribund years, securities regulators banned the more blatant forms of collusion that had been prevalent in the 1920's, making the world safe for the shareholder democracy of the postwar era. By imposing stiff new reporting requirements on companies, New Deal regulators gave a fresh transparency to the stock market and equalized the chances for small investors who had been severely penalized by the insider training of the Jazz Age.
In the early 1950's, the New York Stock Exchange, to woo back investors scared away by the Depression, tried to advance the cause of "people's capitalism" through share ownership, but the investing population reached only about six million. It was the go-go years of the 1960's -- a faddish market awash in crazy conglomerate mergers and the supposed infallibility of growth stocks -- that lured 20 million investors into the market, blotting out cautionary memories of 1929.
The festivities ended abruptly in the early 1970's when the Arab oil embargo and accelerating inflation shattered a still tentative trust in paper assets. Gold, real estate, stamps, Impressionist paintings -- anything hard and tangible to the touch -- became investments of choice.
In August 1982, when the Federal Reserve Board declared victory over inflation and began to ease its Draconian monetary policy, the great middle-class romance with stocks commenced. People felt that in the 1970's they had been pauperized by thrift, with inflation diluting the value of their bank accounts. The ensuing drain of assets from banks persists: the more than $3 trillion now in mutual funds is fast approaching the $4.2 trillion of assets in the American commercial banking system. The bullish surge was further spurred when property values sagged in the late 1980's, refuting the comforting fallacy that real estate was somehow immune to economic laws.
The 1987 crash -- which, under ordinary circumstances, might have dampened faith in common stocks -- became instead a fountain of fresh illusions. Far from being a genuine crash (which are typically followed by bear markets), it was actually a gigantic market correction bearing a misleading message: that crashes are simply short-lived, vaguely unsettling affairs, no more than spectacular bouts of profit-taking forming the prelude to prolonged rebounds.
Buoyed by this belief in the market's eternal resiliency, investors flocked to Wall Street in astounding numbers. Some 51 million Americans now own common stock, either directly or through retirement plans. Wall Street has become wholesome and respectable, suburbanized and gentrified. This vogue has produced the most vibrant capital markets in history, giving American entrepreneurs an edge in world markets.
The public's faith in stocks hasn't been entirely misplaced. Slow but steady growth, subdued inflation, a cornucopia of dazzling new technologies, a widening of world markets with the demise of Communism, a spurt in world trade through lower protectionist barriers -- these are all fantastically bullish developments, the more so in combination.
Yet the present moment may be a fruitful one to contemplate some unforeseen consequences of years of unmitigated hoopla. Until this summer, the stock market had roared ahead for six years without the usual 10 percent correction. While Wall Street fretted that novice investors would dump their mutual funds in a fatally cascading wave of redemptions, the problem has probably been more nearly the reverse -- at least until recently.
Too well-schooled in the gospel of buy and hold, our prematurely wise new investors seemed all but immune to bad news. Never having experienced that ultimate rite of passage, a grim bear market, they evinced a pseudo-sophistication, a virginal innocence. While their long-term outlook is greatly preferable to the alternative, it may have had a perverse systemic effect.
With the market robbed of its customary ebb and flow, dangerous speculative bubbles may have developed. Because the steady cash infusions from 401(k) and other retirement plans feed money automatically into stocks, regardless of adverse developments, they can pump up stocks by liquidity alone.
It may also be an auspicious time to reconsider the market's new status as a sort of souped-up national nest egg. Where retirement funds were once sacrosanct, confined to certifiably dull stuff like investment-grade bonds, they now flow into everything from junk bonds to emerging market funds. The advent of defined contribution plans has shifted the investment burden from professional portfolio managers to often callow individual investors -- with as yet incalculable results.
While it's undoubtedly true that stocks outperform other investments in the long run, what if the baby boom generation reaches retirement amid a sustained bear market? And what will happen to those who retire in the short or intermediate term, before they reap their blessed long-term reward?
Whether the stock market smartly bounces back or resumes its slide, its gyrations are a salutary reminder that it does not proceed in a smooth, linear fashion. It is a volatile world, forever oscillating between extremes of euphoria and disenchantment. A whiff of sin, a potent stench of brimstone, has suddenly revisited the canyons of Wall Street. If we are smart, we will be the wiser for it.

HEADLINE: Top Restaurateur Will Buy Stock Back From Japanese

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
The management of Restaurant Associates Corporation, which has blazed a trail in the American restaurant industry and has managed some of Manhattan's most popular restaurants, signed an agreement yesterday to buy back all its stock from its Japanese owner of six years.
The high-profile 1990 purchase of Restaurant Associates by Kyotaru Company drew wide attention as the first major investment by a Japanese company in the American restaurant industry during a frenzied era of trans-Pacific deals. 
 The buyback reflects a continuing about-face by the Japanese on the American business landscape, as their companies have been divesting themselves of major United States investments that have included MCA and Rockefeller Center.
The company is known in New York City for running the popular Sea Grill at Rockefeller Center and Cafe Centro in the Metlife building. But it made its mark first by launching such restaurants as the Four Seasons and the Brasserie.
Because of the deal, average diners are likely to encounter more of the company's themed restaurants in the future, as Restaurant Associates uses its new financial resources to expand rapidly. The agreement has unusual significance in the restaurant world, analysts said, because of the prominence of the company's restaurants and chefs and its roster of blue-chip food-service clients ranging from AT&T to the Harvard Business School.
"Restaurant Associates has always been extremely skillful in establishing their presence and doing things with flair and great design sense," said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting firm in Manhattan that bears his name.
Restaurant Associates, an operating and consulting group, employs 9,000 people and has created restaurants such as La Fonda del Sol, Trattoria and the Forum of the Twelve Caesars in Manhattan. A former executive, Joseph Baum, created the original Windows on the World and refurbished the Rainbow Room.
Restaurant Associates has also rebuilt such national chains as its Acapulco and Charlie Brown's groups. The company owns more than 130 restaurants with 25,000 seats, primarily on the East and West Coasts.
Restaurant Associates also owns 25 Charlie Brown's steakhouses in New Jersey and New York, the 45-unit Acapulco Mexican-restaurant chain in California, and smaller chains in the New York area. The company also provides cafeteria and catering services for such clients as Bertelsmann, Sony Music Entertainment, Morgan Stanley, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, Lincoln Center, the United Nations Delegates' Dining Room in New York, the Music Center of Los Angeles County and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
The terms of the Restaurant Associates agreement were not disclosed, but Kyotaru appeared to have taken a loss. Industry executives valued the all-cash buyback of 100 percent of the company at nearly $100 million in a deal that will close in 30 to 45 days. In 1990, trade publications reported that the Japanese company paid $120 million, including the $80 million worth of debt it assumed.
"Finally we are in control of our own destiny," said Nick Valenti, who will remain the company's president and chief executive. The deal was the result of "a yearlong project to persuade the Japanese to sell the company," he said. Kyotaru executives in the United States and Japan did not return telephone calls.
Mr. Valenti has two investment-banking partners in the deal, Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill & Company and Furman Selz Investments, and the company will continue to be privately held. Last year revenues of Restaurant Associates, which were not publicly disclosed, were $270 million and its sales grew 11.3 percent, according to Nation's Restaurant News, an industry publication.
In 1988, the senior managers of Restaurant Associates arranged a leveraged buyout, purchasing 54 percent of its stock for $150 million. But the company was crushed by the resulting debt, and the purchase by Kyotaru was expected to infuse cash that would fuel expansion.
Virtually all of the original debt, estimated to be $80 million in 1990, has been assumed by Kyotaru, although Restaurant Associates still has a small debt, according to people with knowledge of the deal.
Yesterday restaurant-industry executives said that the trans-Pacific partnership had never really worked. For the Japanese, who had not been prepared for the American restaurant downturn in the early 1990's, the investment provided minimal opportunities for the distant parent company to intervene in a way that could improve profitability in the volatile and highly competitive American restaurant market.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Bond Rating Firm Faults New York Budget

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 25

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service, one of the Wall Street firms that rates New York State's bonds, sharply criticized the new state budget today, saying it failed to solve the problem of recurring deficits and virtually insures long and bitter budget fights in the coming years.
The report probably does not mean that Moody's will downgrade the state's bond rating, which is already the second lowest, after Louisiana, among the 40 states the firm reviews. But it almost certainly means that Moody's will not upgrade New York's rating soon. 
 "This pattern of late budgets have not resulted in better budgets," said Robert Kurtter, a vice president of Moody's. "Other states have gotten budgets done on time and have built up surpluses and eliminated deficits. New York has still not addressed these things."
He was referring to the fact that the state's budget was enacted 104 days late this year, he said.
The state's bond rating is important because it determines how much interest the state pays on the billions of dollars in debt it sells each year. A lower bond rating forces the state to pay higher interest rates, which reduces the amount of money the state has to use for other purposes, like education or health care.
"If all the state's outstanding debt were upgraded a notch, the state would save tens of millions of dollars of each year," said Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
The Moody's report said that the new budget was too dependent on "one-shot" revenues, so called because they will not recur next year and therefore cannot be counted on to help close the state's accumulated deficit.
This year's budget uses $1.3 billion in one-shots, including $481 million from a fund set aside for doctor's medical malpractice insurance and $150 million from an amnesty on delinquent taxpayers.
The report also criticized the state for doing almost nothing to reduce its accumulated deficit, which is currently near a historic high of about $7.5 billion. The accumulated deficit is not a shortfall in the current year's budget, but represents the gap over many years between what the state has taken in through revenues and what it has spent.
Mr. Kurtter said that the state should have taken advantage of the currently strong economy to close that accumulated deficit and prepare the state for an eventual economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Ousted Head Of Police Admits Fraud

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 25

 BODY:
Only five weeks after being ousted as Newark's Police Director, William R. Celester pleaded guilty today to three charges of fraud as part of the Federal Government's crackdown on government corruption in New Jersey's largest city.
Mr. Celester's lawyer, Anthony J. Pope, said his client had agreed in a plea deal with the Federal authorities to withdraw the not-guilty plea he entered after his indictment on June 20 and to admit wrongdoing to spare his family the travail of a trial. 
 "He's sorry for everything that's happened," Mr. Pope said.
"He pleaded guilty to what he thinks he was responsible for. Whatever he did wrong, he admitted to. He didn't want to put anyone through a trial, especially his family."
Under the plea bargain submitted to Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. of Federal District Court, the United States Attorney for New Jersey, Faith S. Hochberg, agreed to drop 34 of the indictment's 37 fraud and embezzlement charges in exchange for Mr. Celester's admitting guilt to three counts.
Each dealt with three broad fraud charges: diverting about $29,500 from a "police director's" fund devoted to financing undercover narcotics investigations; keeping nearly $27,000 donated illicitly by police subordinates at a party marking his second anniversary as director, and filing a false 1993 income tax return that failed to list as income $7,750 taken from the narcotics-investigations fund and about $19,600 kept from the anniversary party.
Some of the counts Ms. Hochberg dismissed concerned Mr. Celester's falsifying a mortgage application for a house he and his wife bought in Newark in 1993.
The indictment said Mr. Celester had stated that a relative had given him a $37,000 down payment as a gift when, in fact, the money came from a source that has never been disclosed.
The written terms of the plea agreement submitted to Judge Brown made no reference to the house. Presumably, Mr. Celester and his wife will be allowed to keep it. Ms. Hochberg seemed exuberant about the plea bargain after leaving Judge Brown's courtroom. "It's a 100 percent win for the United States Government and the people of Newark," she said.
As Newark's crime rate grew, she said, "Mr. Celester took that money and put it in his pocket for his own purposes."
Mr. Celester said little outside the court and declined to discuss his plea. "I did the best job that I could," he said. "I think I left the city a lot better."
Ms. Hochberg and Mr. Pope said the agreement did not require any cooperation by Mr. Celester in the Government's continuing investigations into corruption in Newark. "There is no offer of information," Mr. Pope said. "He knows nothing about anyone, as far as I know. He has no further information."
Mr. Celester, who is 53, became Newark's Police Director in mid-1991 after serving in Boston as a deputy police superintendent and a commander in some of Boston's toughest neighborhoods. Newark officials had hoped his tenure would bring fresh crime-fighting ideas and vigorous leadership to a troubled department. But the indictment contended that he had started improperly diverting money from the narcotics-investigation funds a month after he arrived in Newark.
The money went for gifts and flowers for Mr. Celester's wife and a woman friend, trips to Bermuda and Mexico, Christmas gifts for his staff and political contributions to Mayor Sharpe James and unnamed Newark council members, the indictment said. As part of the fraud, he told Newark's business administrator that he had spent $170 at a luncheon and dinner with F.B.I. agents in late June 1994 when in fact the money was a political contribution.
Last November, after Federal agents raided Mr. Celester's home, Mayor James put him on an administrative leave. He was removed from the $95,000-a-year post in June, after his indictment, and is now unemployed, Mr. Pope said.
After Mr. Celester was ousted, critics of the 1,290-member department said he had left it demoralized and in some disarray, with crime increasing and citizens complaining about poor police response.
Mr. Celester is perhaps Newark's most prominent public figure toppled by scandal. Two former city councilmen, Gary S. Harris and Ralph T. Grant, are currently serving 33-month jail terms for taking payoffs from a towing company seeking a city contract. In addition, a top aide of Mayor James, Jackie R. Mattison, was indicted in January on charges of taking bribes from an insurance broker. For months, Ms. Hochberg's staff has been investigating whether money was diverted from a charity set up by Mayor James.
Mr. Celester faces a maximum prison term of 13 years at sentencing, which Judge Brown set for Oct. 7. Ms. Hochberg said her office would seek a lighter term than Federal guidelines provide. But she said that reduction would be a basic one, applied to all defendants who accept responsibility for a crime and spare the Government the costs of a trial.
Under the agreement, he must also repay almost $30,000 and refile four years of tax returns.

HEADLINE: Keep the Ban on Latin Weapons

 BODY:
American arms producers, backed by the Pentagon, are lobbying hard to get President Clinton to lift a 20-year-old ban on the export of advanced conventional weapons to Latin America. The defense industry, faced with shrinking military budgets around the world, is eager to open up new markets for its wares. The Pentagon, for its part, likes to keep weapons production lines busy, an activity it refers to as sustaining the defense industrial base. But allowing these arms sales, which the State Department opposes, runs counter to America's best interests.
Opening Latin markets to expensive, high-performance weapons like the F-16 fighter could lessen regional security by spurring local arms races. It could weaken economic development and democracy by diverting scarce resources from civilian needs. It would also run counter to America's declared policy of working to restrain the arms trade worldwide. 
 Defense Secretary William Perry cites the return to civilian government in most of Latin America as a strong argument for lifting the ban. The Carter Administration first imposed the restrictions to discourage destabilizing arms buildups by the military regimes then in power.
Yet some Latin American governments would be more comfortable keeping the ban in place. Argentina, which has cut military spending nearly in half since civilian rule returned in 1983, says it cannot afford F-16's and that introducing them to the region would jeopardize stability. Brazil says it cannot afford the planes either, but analysts there predict that the Government would buy them if they became available. The most visible support for lifting the ban comes from Chile, where the military is still not under full civilian control.
United States weapons exporters argue that lifting the ban would merely shift business from European to American companies. But America already dominates the Latin arms trade. Rather than heat up the competition, Washington should be encouraging other exporting nations to agree to comparable restraints.
Mr. Clinton ought to heed the report by a special Presidential Advisory Board on Arms Proliferation Policy submitted to him late last month. The board concluded that national security and foreign policy concerns should take priority over economic arguments in deciding issues of arms export policy. While the report recognizes the need to maintain sufficient defense production capacity to meet American military needs, it argues strongly that arms exports should not be used for that purpose and recommends converting unneeded weapons plants to civilian purposes.
Those recommendations mark a clear improvement over the arms sales guidelines the Administration announced early last year, which failed to make clear distinctions between economic and foreign policy goals.
The ban on exporting advanced weapons to Latin America has worked well and contributed to the growth of civilian democracy in the region. It would be foolish to jeopardize that success by shifting course now.

HEADLINE: A Surly New York As Olympic Host?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your July 21 editorial on the possibility of having the Olympics in New York City in 2008 seems balanced. But you overlook the most difficult problems that would accompany our playing host to the Games. 
 Some business people would profit greatly; some construction workers would have temporary work, and minimum-wage workers would be glad to have even these jobs. But we would all endure more air pollution and more strain on our stressed waste-disposal system and water supply.
It is unfortunate that our economy does not factor in the cost on our infrastructure when considering various enterprises. The Olympic Games, over all, might be disastrous for our city.

HEADLINE: MONUMBENT TO DECAY;
Toll Is Even Greater In Forgotten Anacostia

BYLINE: By DON TERRY with KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Markeisha Richardson is a tall, athletic 13-year-old who lives in Valley Green, a public-housing development built in 1961. By the 1980's, it had come to be known as Death Valley, for all the killings in and around its 312 apartments.
Now the development is called Ghost Town, because most of the gunmen are either dead or locked up and because only eight families remain. They huddle together in a pair of two-story buildings, surrounded by dozens of boarded-up buildings as silent as tombstones in a graveyard. 
 "The boys at school say I live in the haunted house projects," Markeisha said. "But I don't care. At least I got a roof over my head. A lot of people don't even have that."
Markeisha lives in the other Washington, the neglected city east of the Anacostia River. The Anacostia has long been the Berlin wall of the capital. Its polluted waters divide the Washington of power and postcards from a city of poverty and broken promises.
West of the Anacostia are the polished monuments to America's might: the White House, the Capitol, the Gap.
On the other side are tarnished testimonials to America's failures: street corners crowded with jobless men; inadequately staffed health clinics; abandoned public housing, and thriving open-air drug markets.
Nowhere is the decline more visible than here, where the police are always busy, the body count from homicides is high and the city's highest rates of infant mortality and poverty eat away at people's spirits. While many problems in the District of Columbia can be found in any big city, they seem more embarrassing here because they are in the nation's capital.
"This is the same city where the President of the United States lives," said Mike Johnson, a community advocate from Ward 8, the city's poorest section, "and we're living in a war zone. How is he going to go overseas and tell other people how to live in peace, and he allows this to go on a few miles from the White House?"
The black middle class has long had a foothold east of the river, where Frederick Douglass, the fiery abolitionist known as the Sage of Anacostia, once lived. But in recent years much of the black middle class here and across the city has fled the District because of its stubborn poverty and deteriorating schools.
To counter this decline, successive Federal administrations have vowed to find new solutions to fight the urban plight.
Jack F. Kemp formed his grand vision for public housing while serving as Secretary for Housing and Urban Development under President George Bush. Speaker Newt Gingrich has talked about using Washington as a laboratory for Republican solutions to welfare, unemployment and crime. Most recently, the First Lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, sat in the White House penning her best seller on community responsibility for raising children. But so far, all the vaunted plans have produced is talk.
And as the financial crisis continues here, lawmakers on Capitol Hill are calling for more cuts in the city's budget. The citizens east of the river, families like Markeisha's, will surely feel the cuts the most.
Her school, in Ward 8, does not have enough books, much less computers. The police in the ward have to fight the highest crime rates in the city with the worst shortages of equipment, and the fear of violence is never far away.
"We had two people shot in my building once," she said. "And the other day, some boys jumped out of a car and started shooting. They looked younger than me. I just don't know why life is so crazy sometimes."
Hope might be battered in Markeisha's Washington, but it is not dead.
A few years ago, Valley Green tenants and the members of a church from Northwest Washington, the wealthy part of the city, turned one of the vacant apartments into a place of prayer and study.
They call the apartment the Jesus House.
In the living room, Bible study for children is held on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. In a back bedroom, six computers have been set up, and tutors from the church, Christ Our Shepard, come every Thursday.
Not long ago, Bible study was canceled because someone was shot to death on nearby Second Street, where some of the children live, and the gunman threatened to shoot anyone else he saw.
Katie French, Markeisha's tutor, is a 23-year-old technical writer who lives in Northwest. Recently Ms. French drove from Valley Green to Second Street to pick up children for the classes. As she drove, she passed a pile of debris along a curb.
"The city would never let this happen in Northwest," she said, pointing to the trash. "Never. Ever."
The next week, the trash was still there.
 
The Politics
Independence Is Threadbare
In the early 1970's, home rule held the promise of a better life for all Washingtonians, whether they lived in Ward 3, the city's richest, or Ward 8. But for black Washingtonians, 65 percent of the city's population, home rule had a meaning beyond the nuts and bolts of who would govern: It was a declaration of independence from the white Federal lawmakers who had been in charge.
In 1975, the funk-rock group Parliament captured the moment in their song "Chocolate City," celebrating Washington's new home rule as black America's "piece of the rock" surrounded by "vanilla suburbs."
"Hey, we didn't get our 40 acres and a mule, but we did get you, Chocolate City," the song goes. "You don't need the bullet when you've got the ballot."
Shortly after Marion S. Barry Jr. was sworn in as Mayor in 1978, the city was booming, especially downtown. Across the Anacostia, however, many people complained that the good times were passing them by.
By the mid-1980's, the national recession arrived, along with crack cocaine. And by the time Mr. Barry was arrested for drug possession in 1990, the District was well on its way to a financial crisis, brought on in part by the limits imposed by home rule and in part by the poor management of the city's leaders.
Nonetheless, the promise of home rule was still strong, even in the poor, black sections east of the Anacostia -- Wards 6 and 7 as well as 8. And these wards supported Mr. Barry in his 1994 political comeback after he served six months in prison.
Mr. Barry's claim of redemption resonated in a place where many people know from bitter man-in-the-mirror experience that hard times and personal demons can bend even the strongest back. Returning him to the mayor's office was as much a nose-thumbing at white Washington power brokers as it was a gesture of belief that Mr. Barry would improve their lot.
Mostly ignored by the rest of the city except in television reports of the drive-by shooting, the abandoned baby, the found body, voters east of the Anacostia went to the polls with a vengeance. Their numbers canceled out the anti-Barry vote of affluent, white areas like Ward 3, which had once avidly supported him.
But the city's fiscal trauma has left Mr. Barry powerless to deliver the jobs and perquisites of his three earlier administrations when he larded the bureaucracy with jobs for his supporters.
Instead, shake-ups, dismissals and furloughs have been the order of the day as the city struggles under the eye of a financial control board, appointed by President Clinton last year to manage the District's budget.
"There's a lack of spirit in the people like I've never seen before," said Rahim Jenkins, the leader of a black men's anti-crime and civic group. "It's almost like God doesn't live in D.C. anymore."
Not even Mr. Barry's presence as a resident has brought any succor to Ward 8 -- except, people say, for the residents of his block. The round-the-clock police detail that guards Mr. Barry must make that block one of the safest in the city, they say.
But even Ward 8's love affair with the Mayor may be waning. When asked about the impact of the city's fiscal crisis on their lives, people east of the river said they were used to being powerless in a city of power.
"He's a politician, right?" Jacqueline Massey, a neighborhood advocate and president of the Valley Green tenants group, said of Mr. Barry. "He came through here years ago and promised to help us, and the next thing we know he's in jail. But he's no different than any other politician. They all make promises on Monday and break them on Tuesday."

The Section
Expanse of Woe At Capitol's Elbow
The rolling hills east of the Anacostia offer some of the best views of Washington, especially at night when the Capitol is lighted up like an unobtainable magic kingdom. But this area is the Washington left off the tourist maps -- where statistics read like those in a developing country; where bad things can happen at any time, and where people start at an early age to talk more about surviving life than enjoying it. The city's spiraling financial decline has only made things worse.
East of the river are 7,000 welfare cases. To the west, in Ward 3, there are 30.
In Ward 8, 26 percent of the households live at the Federal poverty level, compared with 15 percent in the city over all and 6 percent in Ward 3, according to 1992 local statistics. There is only one public library branch and a smaller public community library in Ward 8. But in Ward 3, the home of four universities with their libraries, the city has three public library branches, plus a larger regional library.
Although almost half the births in the city take place east of the river, there are only a few pediatricians there willing to accept Medicaid patients.
There are about 13,000 licensed doctors in Washington, but only a few have private practices in its neediest neighborhoods, said Dr. Mohammad N. Akhter of the city's Department of Human Services.
"In one way, Washington is the capital of the free world," Dr. Akhter said. "But in another way, it is an example of a third world country. Cuba has a better infant mortality rate than Washington."
Historically, said Patricia Hawkins, associate director of the Whitman-Walker AIDS clinic, the neighborhoods east of the Anacostia have never received their fair share of services.
"You'd think, where you have this concentration of problems, you'd have a concentration of services," Dr. Hawkins said. "It has not worked out that way."
Indeed, east of the river is a hard place to feel good about the American Dream. There are only a couple of restaurants where a family can go to sit down and have a meal. In Ward 8, even the McDonald's is closed and boarded up. There is no children's clothing store. There is no movie theater, health club or auto repair shop. And some of the mom-and-pop delis have recently been shut down for selling drugs along with the subs.
But there are plenty of liquor stores.
 
The Crisis
Today's Problems Look the Same
While voters in Ward 3 grumble about potholes, canceled recycling days or fewer garbage collections, in Ward 8 the cutbacks and shortages can be life-threatening.
Inspector Winston Robinson, the commander of the seventh police district, which is responsible for the neighborhood where Markeisha lives, sees the impact of the city's budget crisis in an increase in crime that is matched by a shortage of patrol cars and typewriter ribbon.
A year ago, crime was down in his district, Mr. Robinson said, "but so far this year, we've had an increase."
There have been more than 30 homicides in the seventh district this year; there have been none in Ward 3.
Repairs and replacements to the city's battered fleet of police cars have meant fewer patrols on the street. For the first six months of this year, Mr. Robinson said his district usually had only eight police cars on the streets on any given night, when it is supposed to have 21.
"We couldn't get parts -- tires, batteries, none of the essentials," he said. "You can't provide quality police service if you don't have mobility."
Mr. Robinson said that the district currently had about 16 cars on the street, and that now that Congress had promised to pump millions of dollars into the department even while cutting other areas of the District's government, he expected to get more cars out on patrol.
"But our biggest burden now is restoring the public's trust," he said. "People were feeling pretty good about us last year. The budget problems kind of whacked everything out of order."
On a recent rainy Saturday night, two 20-something police officers, who were afraid to have their names used in the newspaper, patrolled the streets and said they were lucky to have a police car that ran.
They said that there was only one typewriter -- a manual -- at the station, and that it often had no ribbon. "If you want to type your reports," one said, "you have to bring your own."
In two hours, their police radio crackled at least five times with reports of shots fired. The officers said no day passed without a Code 1 call, a top-priority case.
They said their colleagues in the second district patrolling Ward 3 told them that a week could pass without a Code 1.
When people in Ward 8 are asked what impact the city's fiscal problems is having on their shops, schools and hopes for their children, most answer with a weary been-through-it-all-before shrug.
"Sweetheart," said Mrs. Massey, the advocate for public-housing residents in Ward 8, "over here, living through crises is an everyday way of life, and it's been that way for a long, long time. The only reason people are paying any attention now is because the pain we always feel has spread to other parts of town."
At Heart Junior High School, where Markeisha is in the seventh grade, her guidance counselor is Barbara Faison, who also coaches the tennis team. Ms. Faison has to share a computer and a typewriter with three other counselors, each of whom has about 250 students.
There is barely enough money for basic educational supplies, but everyone, Ms. Faison says, knows more budget cuts are coming.
"A cut here feels much deeper than a cut in Ward 3," she said. "There, the cuts might feel like a nick. Over here it feels like someone just cut off your hand."
Markeisha and her friends in Valley Green are wise beyond their years. They have to be to survive. But they are also just ordinary children. And like the grown-ups in their world, they learn early on how to make do with less.
James McCrae, 13, uses the boarded-up buildings in the development to practice his tennis game. Recently, he worked on his backhand, slamming the ball against a wall and a faded "No Trespassing" sign. Sometimes the ball went high and wide and hit a boarded-up window, sending a hollow echo floating over the Valley.
"Ain't nothing to be scared of around here now," James said, wiping his round face. "Ain't nothing left."
Then Markeisha flew by on her green 10-speed as the younger children chased her down the potholed street, calling her name and begging for a turn on the bicycle.
When she slowed down long enough to reveal some of her dreams, Markeisha said she wanted to be a doctor or a hair stylist like her mother. That is, she added, "if something bad doesn't happen to me."
Because of violence in the neighborhood, tutoring sessions and Bible study at the Jesus House had to be canceled at least twice this year. One night, as the tutors pulled onto Second Street to pick up children, several police officers, their guns drawn, were running around after conducting a raid on a drug house.
One of the younger children who did not usually attend the tutoring sessions ran up to the car of Ms. French, the tutor, crying and begging to go along because he was afraid to stay on the block.
"We couldn't bring him," Ms. French said. "We didn't have enough tutors or cars."
Ms. French said that although there were some scary moments for the tutors, they were determined to keep coming. "People live here every day," she said. "Why should we be safer than them?"
That same night, Markeisha told Ms. French that she hoped the tutors would always be there because they were fun to be with and because they took the children on trips out of the city.
"I'm ready to move," Markeisha said, "even though violence is everywhere."
"It's not everywhere," Ms. French said.
"Yes, it is," Markeisha insisted.
"No," Ms. French said, "there are some neighborhoods where you feel safe."
"That's where I want to live," Markeisha said.
 
The Spirit
Fight for Survival Brings New Hope
Most of the monuments east of the Anacostia are flesh and blood, ordinary people trying to grow flowers in a desert. They are people like Willis Thomas, a tennis coach with the Arthur Ashe Foundation, and Hannah M. Hawkins, founder of a social service program, Children of Mine.
The Ashe foundation provides tennis lessons and tutoring to inner-city children.
"If these kids weren't out here playing tennis, they'd probably be running the streets," said Mr. Thomas, who has coached professional players like Zina Garrison-Jackson and Katrina Adams. "Over in Ward 3, people are trying to make the social registry. Over here, they're just trying to survive."
Mrs. Hawkins founded Children of Mine about 11 years ago. It offers after-school meals, tutoring and family counseling. There are days when Mrs. Hawkins, who is 56, is alone with 80 children because she has no money to pay a staff. Everything the program uses, from chairs to toys, is donated. She is not paid.
"We're in worse shape over here than we've ever been," she said. "But through the grace of God, we attempt to do it."
Every other Sunday, the Players Lounge, a restaurant and bar on Martin Luther King Avenue, is turned into a gospel show place. The bottles of gin and whisky are removed from the shelves, and the beer advertisements and cigarette machines are covered with sheets.
"In a matter of minutes," said Philip Pannell, an advocate for the neighborhood, "the Players Lounge becomes the Prayers Lounge. Over here, you learn how to stretch everything you can, including faith and hope."
Arrington Dixon, a businessman and former member of the City Council, returned several years ago to Ward 8, where he had grown up. He is now chairman of a neighborhood civic association. He also runs a telecommunications company from his basement, just down the block from the drug dealers on Martin Luther King Avenue.
Mr. Dixon knows one dealer from their being Boy Scouts together.
"We have a lot of work to do to turn this around," Mr. Dixon said. "To get fair treatment, you have to make noise. The city is doing less here because the political strength is not here. Other parts of the city have more resources and time to make demands. We have people working two jobs just to reach the poverty level. We have to get an infusion of more middle-class people. And we have to organize."

HEADLINE: Washington's Troubles Hit Island of Affluence

SERIES: MONUMENT TO DECAY -- Second of three articles.

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The crucial votes had barely been counted in Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr.'s resurrection from jailhouse to City Hall two years ago when he offered some hard-eyed advice to those who had voted against him as the personification of this city's breakdown.
"To those white people who have whatever hang-ups they have, get over it," Mr. Barry boldly instructed. "Get over it: I'm the best person for Washington. I know best how to protect their investments, their homes, their businesses." 
 As the city government has since spiraled further downward, Mr. Barry's message has been taken to heart with a vengeance in the District of Columbia's splendid northwestern enclave of affluence, power and white isolation, Ward 3.
"There's been a sea change here among residents," said Jeffrey Itell, the former publisher of The Northwest Side Story, a weekly newspaper, reflecting on the ward's status as one of the nation's handsomest and most influential urban stretches, yet one with its civic grievances. "Even though they remain liberal up here, it's the equivalent of liberals who've been mugged -- who feel mugged by their own government, one they've concluded is totally corrupt and ineffective."
If anything, Mr. Barry's return to power has sealed the separation enforced by the thick barrier of parkland that long has kept the black majority of the city a world apart from the northwest ward. The ward remains a sanctuary of middle- and upper-income privilege, of solid public schools and of higher-priced housing enjoyed by some of the most established powers of American government, commerce and culture, and of world diplomacy as well.
Once avid, even idealistic in their support of home rule and of the first election of Mr. Barry in 1978, the jaded white voters of the Northwest are now vocal in their complaints of abandonment by City Hall. Many say they fear that the fiscal crisis and waves of budget cuts threaten the ward's enviable schools and chill the housing market.
Northwest residents have become so disillusioned with home rule that ward politicians intent on seeming creative are openly asking whether it is time to debate alternatives. Some even support having the District rejoin neighboring Maryland. As a city of that state, Washington would have broader powers than it does today under its restricted independence.
"How exciting it was when home rule came along," recalled Anne Mohnkern Renshaw, a longtime civic volunteer and the elected chairwoman of an advisory commission in the District's Chevy Chase neighborhood, which borders a suburban Maryland counterpart. "I thought: what a great chance for the city, not only as the national capital but as a pilot project for urban areas. Unfortunately, this did not come about. Residents are utterly frustrated with bad government. We'll soon be on our knees."
Older residents recall the period before home rule when President Richard M. Nixon enlarged and modernized the police force. "I was proud to be a homicide detective in those days," said Ronald L. Robertson, chairman of the city's Fraternal Order of Police. "Now, you hear absolutely nothing from Clinton about the city."
 
The Ward
 
Plowing Streets And Other Steps
Despair is hardly as visible a commodity in the Northwest, where Ward 3 is 88 percent white, as it is across town in Ward 8, which is 91 percent black. Three of five adults in Ward 3 have college degrees, while fewer than 1 in 10 in Ward 8 has. The Northwest is distinguished by upper-income shopping strips, glistening food marts and spacious supermarkets. These feed off median incomes 60 percent higher than the city's average, and more than twice the $21,312 median in Ward 8, which has but one full-size supermarket of its own for close to the same number of people.
For all this material edge, people in Ward 3 complain increasingly that home rule, which local voters hailed over 20 years ago, has come to mean a patronage-bloated, ineffective city payroll offering phantom services. More and more residents are so furious at the treadmills of bureaucratic delay that to cite but one routine example, they now simply violate the law: They are building additions onto their homes without permits, rather than wait for action by the city's notorious department that handles the paperwork, said Stephen A. Koczak, a veteran civic leader.
"What we have now is anarchy," said Mr. Koczak, president of the Cleveland Park neighborhood Citizens Association, noting how this sort of building violation conflicted with the civic instincts of the area. "Gradually people come to feel they have to take care of themselves and not worry about the other guy."
Mundane crises abound in the ward: A typewriter shortage at one precinct led to court challenges of handwritten arrest reports as illegible. A bent extension ladder on a Cleveland Park firetruck made third-floor rescues problematical, just as reduced hose crews cut a pumper's effectiveness in half. Well beyond having to plow many snowy streets themselves, residents have invented ways to pay for equipment the city can no longer afford, including bulletproof vests, pencils, office computers, shower heads in firehouses and even a radar gun. Some taxpayers maintain the trees along public walks, pay for private trash hauling or pay teacher aides after the city stops. Sixteen-year-old David Jeffs is given credit for going out this spring to fill in a deepening pothole on MacArthur Boulevard.
New Yorkers and other hardened urbanites might be more amused than empathetic about the problems and the complaints from this well-endowed ward. But residents show a keen sense of the ludicrous, and sarcasm still overflows because the District government was unable to plow the streets last winter, yet blitzed the citizenry with parking tickets for snowbound cars -- and even with tickets for unraked leaves during one brief thaw before the next storm.
"Grit in the sore," Ms. Renshaw said, noting there were but four repair crews for the city's endlessly pocked streets even as dozens of new ticket writers had been hired to claw fresh revenue into the District's cash-starved coffers.
Scott H. Strauss, a member of another of the ward's advisory neighborhood commission, said he was frustrated at trying to help his constituents sway City Hall policy.
"My role is sort of like Nero's: standing around and fiddling while the city burns down in despair," Mr. Strauss said.
 
The District
One Capital, Two Cities
The splendor of the Northwest makes Washington a graphic tale of two cities. Proud ward residents, endlessly active in civic matters, enjoy the most expensive housing in Washington, with 97 percent of the single-family dwellings assessed at more than $200,000, and only 1 percent of the ward's houses being subsidized. In Ward 8, east of the Anacostia River, 23 percent of housing is publicly subsidized.
The Northwest's contrast with the city's most troubled areas could not be more evident than in its minuscule homicide rate, with the ward recording about one killing a year -- in a city where the yearly homicide body count goes beyond 400, earning it the title of the drug era's Murder Capital of the World.
In Ward 3, property crimes are carefully tallied each week over police telephone lines, with regular references to young black perpetrators. Listening can feed the anecdotal conclusion of burghers that "outsiders," not fellow city dwellers, prey on the ward, even as it remains one of the safer upscale urban sanctuaries in the nation.
"If somebody tried to start an open-air drug market in Ward 3, it couldn't happen," said Kathy Smith, a block-watch organizer who is the editor of the Street Smart newsletter. Ms. Smith knows the contrast between the powerful professionals who live in the ward and their crime-ravaged neighbors across town. "Instantly, people here would be up in arms," she said, "and the police would have to respond to hundreds of calls."
Ms. Smith said she sensed that volunteerism was growing stronger in the face of the dwindling services, mismanagement and budget shortfalls that bedevil the city.
"We're not about to dumb ourselves down and make things work inefficiently here just to make somebody else happy," she vowed.
Northwesterners pay a large share of city taxes, and as they receive less service in return, more families are debating the chronic question of affluent urban Americans: whether to move to the nearby suburbs or put their children in one of the dozens of private schools that serve the ward's sizable constituency of government and diplomatic professionals, lawyers, lobbyists and workers in the city's huge news and public-relations industries.
Like other ward residents, Mr. Strauss, of the advisory commission, said he found the Mayor bizarrely self-absorbed in personal retreat and political posturing while the city reeled in crisis. And like others, Mr. Strauss, a Washington lawyer, countered his exasperation with volunteerism.
"The schools have people scared again," said Mr. Strauss, a former New Yorker who views a move to the suburbs as a personal defeat. He has committed his three children to the public schools of North Cleveland Park, but sees mounting anxiety in the ward as budget and personnel cuts add to the pressure on its highly rated schools. They have long waiting lists of applicants eager to join those already commuting from poorer wards.
"But you got a dilemma," Mr. Strauss said, "because home values are dropping, and how much of a hit are you willing to take to get out?"
Schools will have larger classes this fall, closer to the suburban model, because of budget cuts. But a proposed reduction of 240 teachers will affect Ward 3 less than other areas of the city because its schools are already at capacity or beyond and would not be forced to take the cut. At the same time, there is no capital construction budget to speak of, and parents are increasingly being drawn into volunteer efforts to replace boilers and roofs.
Last spring, a noticeable number of parents in Ward 3, worried that the schools might suffer grievously at the hands of the financial control board, appointed last year by President Clinton, put up signs on their lawns: "Control Board, if schools are not your priority, this house is For Sale!"
 
The Issues
Trying to Bring People Together
Beyond anxiety, some residents say common dilemmas are providing an unusual bonding agent for the Northwest enclave and the rest of the city, and might even prove that neighborhood distinctions of race and income can be exaggerated in this class-partitioned capital.
"The basic issues facing people all over the city are crime, schools, financial problems and delivery of services in a timely fashion, without surliness," said Roxane Sismanidis, president of the Woodley Park neighborhood Community Association, who finds estimates of the Ward 3's privileged perch highly overblown.
"I don't think there are black, white or Hispanic views on potholes," Ms. Sismanidis added, speaking as a parent advocate at the Oyster public school, a respected bilingual institution that, as a magnet school, is more integrated than schools in the poorest black wards. "Schools are falling apart all over the city, and it's disgusting all over the city."
The ward is the sort of civics-steeped place where Councilwoman Kathy Patterson, a former newspaper reporter who covered Congress, first became involved in municipal problems when her children entered school.
"My two kids' teachers are two of the most important people in my life," said Ms. Patterson, who was soon organizing parent protest rallies outside City Hall and, ultimately, winning a Council seat.
"Mentally and emotionally, we're very much a part of the city," she said, in denying accusations that the Northwest is a classic case of affluent withdrawal. "My people's economic situation is such that they could live where they please. They live in Washington because they want to. Theirs is a huge commitment."
Even so, the Councilwoman is one of the ranking ward Democrats enthusiastic about looking into merging the city into Maryland, leaving only the city's core Federal buildings as the District. She emphasizes that, unlike past Ward-3-only separatist movements, which were denounced as racist, this one would leave the city with a majority of blacks, but give it the greater power that would come from being part of the bordering state.
Merger with Maryland is being pursued by the Committee for the Capital City, a small private group led by Lawrence H. Mirel. A white lawyer who was general counsel to the City Council 15 years ago, Mr. Mirel lives with his wife, a city schoolteacher, in a predominantly black, affluent part of neighboring Ward 4.
"The black-majority government works fine," Mr. Mirel said. "It just has too much to do and too little resources."
Joining Maryland would retain the city's racial definition and, he said, allow for fairer representation in Congress and more resources to meet Washington's current state-scale responsibilities.
This and other proposals are mere talking points, far from adoption in a city that in the meantime must fight the fiscal crisis with individual enterprise. Melissa M. Kunstadter, a Ward 3 resident, is president of the Federation of Friends of the District of Columbia Public Library. Her group, black and white, rich and poor, has fought citywide to keep all 27 library branches open, although now only one night a week, with a four-day schedule for the summer.
"I wish D.C. could get over this racial nonsense," said Ms. Kunstadter, who has a richer sense of cross-ward relations than many other Ward 3 residents. In contrast to her experience, she finds the city administration's routine emphasis on black pride overshadowing the possibilities of the current crisis.
"There is quite a bit of elbow room to bring people together in this city," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Has Broad-Based Gain, Aided by Rise in U.S. Stocks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday as stocks rallied in the United States for a second day, easing concern that global investors will flee American assets and shed their dollar holdings.
In other trading, the German mark gained against other European currencies following the Bundesbank's decision on Thursday to hold interest rates steady, upsetting expectations of a rate cut. 
 Declines in the United States stock market had helped drag the dollar down more than 2 percent against the mark and yen last week. But stocks have recovered somewhat in the last two days.
"The market had positioned itself to sell dollars in anticipation of further stock market weakness," said Philip Vasan, head of global foreign exchange at CS First Boston. With stocks rebounding, "we're seeing those positions squeezed out of the market," Mr. Vasan said.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4822 marks from 1.4775 marks on Thursday. The dollar also traded at 108.37 Japanese yen, up from 108.31 yen. The British pound fell to $1.5545 from $1.5575.
On Thursday, the mark surged after the Bundesbank held interest rates steady at its council meeting. Many analysts had expected a rate reduction, which would have made mark deposits less attractive.
"They absolutely have to cut the repo rate," said Fuad Khadder, executive director of foreign exchange for American Express Bank. "If they don't cut it, they're headed for a real economic slowdown."
The Bundesbank has frozen the repo rate, which it charges German financial institutions for temporary loans in exchange for government securities, at 3.3 percent since February. It last cut rates April 18, when it lowered the discount rate to a record-tying low of 2.5 percent.
It is possible that the Bundesbank "may be at the end of its easing cycle," said Scott Gallopo, chief currency trader at Chase Manhattan Bank. "It's reluctant to cut rates."
Still, the Bundesbank has a reputation for surprising financial markets, and a rate reduction cannot be ruled out when the central bank's council returns from a summer break on Aug. 22, traders said.
"The Bundesbank tends not to conform to the consensus view," Mr. Vasan of CS First Boston said. "Anything is possible."

HEADLINE: Move High-Speed Train Idea Away From Coast

 BODY:
To the Editor:
John Henry (letter, July 19) is off the mark in criticizing boat and marina owners' objections to Amtrak's plans to add more and faster trains between New York and Boston and require drawbridges in Connecticut to close for longer periods of time.
Marina owners and boaters are tax-paying citizens and significantly add to the local economy. 
 To suggest that boats are the playthings of the rich and nearly rich is incorrect. The rich and nearly rich are the people who can afford the price of a Federal taxpayer-subsidized Amtrak ticket from Washington or New York to Boston. Few if any of these passengers are Connecticut residents.
Besides, the nearly 100-year-old New Haven railroad bridges are probably in danger of falling down from rust because of years of deferred maintenance.
If Amtrak wants a high-speed rail corridor from New York to Boston, it needs to obtain a right-of-way that is away from the coastline and as straight as possible to permit operating speeds above 150 miles per hour. The cost of such an undertaking would reach into the billions of dollars.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
For the first half of this year, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Milwaukee, Rembert G. Weakland, had been out of sight and out of the news, taking a sabbatical to finish a doctoral dissertation on ancient church music at Columbia University.
Then on the Fourth of July, the 69-year-old prelate tossed a firecracker into the welfare debate. In an op-ed article in The Washington Post, the Archibishop urged President Clinton to refuse the scores of Federal waivers necessary for Wisconsin's sweeping reform of its welfare system. 
 Although Mr. Clinton said in May that he would approve Wisconsin's plan, the issue is now bound up with whether he will sign Congressional legislation that, like Wisconsin's plan, would end guaranteed welfare payments to the poor.
Archbishop Weakland wrote that the plan, Wisconsin Works, or W-2, which requires almost all welfare recipients to take jobs, some for subsidized wages, was "not morally justifiable."
In Wisconsin, where Archbishop Weakland's statement was quickly reported and reprinted, it set off a whole string of firecrackers. The noise drew attention not only to the issues of welfare and the place of religion in politics but also to the personality of one of the governors most frequently mentioned as Bob Dole's possible running mate.
"The Bishop should come back to Wisconsin and read his Bible instead of playing piano in New York," snapped Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin. The Governor's chief spokesman, Kevin W. Keane, portrayed the churchman as an impractical meddler, an image favored by conservatives and liberals alike when they do not like a religious leader's message.
Local cartoonists had a great time with images of Archbishop Weakland at his piano and Governor Thompson in a pulpit.
What particularly angered the Governor was his impression that Archbishop Weakland had called the state's plan harmful to children.
In fact, the Archbishop's major objection was subtler, and more basic.
"It is patently unjust," he wrote, to remove the basic guarantee of a "safety net" -- a minimal level of assistance for food, clothing and shelter -- for the poor and especially for poor children.
Indeed, although the plan would at least initially increase outlays for child care and job-related benefits -- unlike the welfare bills passed by the House and Senate -- it explicitly states that ultimately no one is guaranteed job help or any other government aid, regardless of meeting all the eligibility requirements.
Is this not exactly the kind of question of basic moral principle that religious leaders should address?
Perhaps the point could be illustrated by a hypothetical example: removing of warning signs and safety railings, or randomly installing nonworking air bags, in an effort to reduce the carnage on the highways since the resulting threat to life and limb would increase personal responsibility and make people drive more safely?
Would the suffering and death of reckless drivers who served as object lessons to others be justified? Would it make any difference if the victims included passengers or innocent people in other cars? Would it make a difference if the gain in accidents prevented and lives saved were a virtual certainty or simply a plausible but untested theory?
The example may be bizarre. But it dramatizes the questions of principle that Archbishop Weakland was posing about the removal of a guaranteed welfare safety net: Should society compel adults to change their behavior even if doing so means increasing the risk to their children?
Addressing such questions cannot stop with thought-provoking examples or with cost-benefit analysis abstracted from real-world circumstances and history.
Even questions of principle demand an immersion in the details of the problem -- Archbishop Weakland spent years leading the committee that drafted the Catholic bishops' pastoral letter on the American economy -- and demand the wisdom and intuition born from experience more than from theory.
But such questions also demand the accumulated thinking about moral conflicts that religious and philosophical traditions build up over time and express sometimes in explicit codes or commandments, sometimes in parables and proverbs or, in the Catholic case, in papal encyclicals, episcopal letters and moral theology.
In Wisconsin, the opening fireworks gave way to a moderately useful debate. Governor Thompson issued two much more reasoned replies to Archbishop Weakland. Besides defending his administration's concern for children and restating his criticism of the notion that welfare can be overhauled without new expenditures, he seemed to speak directly to the question of entitlements or a guaranteed safety net:
"Society can't expect people to work but then provide them with a guaranteed check if they don't," the Governor said. "You can't have it both ways and still expect to help children."
Yet Mr. Thompson hedged this apparently clear-cut principle with repeated assurances that "while eliminating the entitlement, we are clearly making a firm commitment to caring for the children" and that "no child will be allowed to go hungry or without shelter."
So is there a guaranteed safety net or not? Or is that deliberately to be kept ambiguous, with the government assuring worriers like Archbishop Weakland, "Trust me"?
These are issues that remain as unresolved, and as urgently in need of examination, at the national level as at Wisconsin's.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE DEMOCRATS;
President's Theme: Layoffs Fall and Wages Rise

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
As Republicans ready an attack on President Clinton's economic record, Democrats are working to offset widespread anxiety among workers over layoffs and stagnant wages by arguing that the worst days of the downsizing era are over.
In interviews over the last week, the President's top economic advisers and Democratic leaders of Congress made clear that they were preparing to make a case in the election campaign that fewer and fewer people were losing their jobs and that wages were beginning to rise. 
 Over all, Democrats argue that four years of economic recovery have given Mr. Clinton a strong record to run on. But they are concerned that anxiety over job security and frustration over wages that barely seem to rise could be uppermost in voters' minds. Their response is the Administration's first public articulation of a campaign theme that the President's advisers have been hinting at for weeks.
The essence of the emerging argument -- endorsed by the President, his advisers say -- is this: Anxiety over job security is undeniable. Don't tell voters they have no grounds for concern. Instead, point out that the economic recovery (credit Administration policies for same) has created so many jobs and so much demand for workers, that layoffs have declined over the last two years and, for the first time in more than a decade, wages are beginning to rise by more than the inflation rate.
"The numbers suggest that the worst is over," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, director of Mr. Clinton's National Economic Council, referring to the wage stagnation that began in the 1970's and the tens of millions of layoffs that have characterized corporate downsizing.
Similar messages come from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. For the first time in years, Mr. Rubin says, wages are going up for the bottom 40 percent of American wage earners as well as the upper 60 percent.
"When you have a sustained period of unemployment under 6 percent, as we have had," he said, "that shows up and down the income scale."
And Mr. Stiglitz, filling out the new theme, declared: "We will continue to emphasize that we are concerned about dislocated workers. But one of the benefits of strong economic growth is that the incidence of layoffs is lower and, with wages rising, those who are laid off have a better opportunity to get new jobs that pay well. That is what is happening now."
In support of such claims, Administration officials cite a half-dozen statistics that show improvement. No one denies that strong economic growth in recent quarters has pushed unemployment down, given a lift to wages and perhaps made job hunting less of a trauma for those laid off. But many economists wonder whether the improvement marks a turning point, as the Administration now asserts, or only a blip upward that will disappear in the inevitable next recession, which some forecasters expect by next year.
The Administration, for example, notes that the average hourly earnings of 80 million workers below managerial rank have been rising since 1993 at a faster pace than inflation, something that over the last 23 years has only happened for brief periods in the late 1970's and mid-1980's.
The Administration cites similarly inconclusive data on job loss through layoffs. The most authoritative count is done by the Labor Department in a biennial survey. The one covering 1994 and 1995 -- the turnaround years, in the Administration's view -- was done in January, but the results will not be tabulated until September, at the earliest.
In the interim, the Administration has cited "proxy" statistics -- particularly the number of unemployed Americans who recently lost their jobs. That number has been trending downward and Mr. Stiglitz, in a recent white paper, took this as a strong indication "that the job loss rate has declined since 1993."
Some labor economists question that assertion, noting that Mr. Stiglitz's proxy leaves out those laid off workers not counted among the unemployed because they have ceased to look for work.
Whatever the accuracy of the Administration's new campaign theme, it has so far drawn little challenge within Mr. Clinton's own party. Two Democratic Congressional leaders, Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, and David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, have been outspoken about the need to improve wages and reduce layoffs. Now they have muted such talk and signed onto the new campaign theme, although with caveats.
"We are moving in the right direction," Mr. Gephardt said, offering a view similar to Mr. Obey's. "But I don't know I would say we have turned the corner."
Even the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is not challenging the Administration's job theme, "although we don't quite believe it," said Steve Rosenthal, the federation's political director.
"We are not convinced that America has turned the corner," Mr. Rosenthal said, "but on the other hand, we feel strongly that the President needs to be re-elected."
What criticism there is has come, not surprisingly, from the Republicans, although not from Bob Dole, the likely Presidential candidate. John Taylor, a Stanford University economist and a Dole adviser, says the Administration is simply wrong in its interpretation of the wage data.
"The numbers go up and down, but the trend continues," Mr. Taylor said. "Wage stagnation is the right word."
During the primary campaign, Mr. Dole had stayed largely silent on the wage and job security issues, while Pat Buchanan hammered away on these themes. Now he will recognize them once he has developed policies to deal with these problems, says Nelson Warfield, the Dole campaign's press secretary.
"I think that Bill Clinton has fallen into the flabby politics of self-satisfaction on wages and jobs," Mr. Warfield said.
By all accounts, the Dole solution, like the Clinton one, is an economic policy intended to stimulate more economic growth, thus sustaining the sort of demand for workers that raises wages and makes companies more reluctant to lay them off.
Most economists argue that a far more vigorous expansion than the present one is needed to raise wages significantly and minimize layoffs. But the economy, they say, may not be capable today of such strong growth, a caveat that does not show up in either the Republican or Democratic campaign commentary.
The Dole solution for greater growth is likely to be a proposal for a major tax cut, his advisers say, that would encourage investment in the new machinery and equipment that would make the growth possible without rising inflation. The Clinton Administration, however, says its mix of policies has already put the nation on this very growth path, particularly a reduction in the budget deficit that in effect frees up national savings for investment.
"If you think about what you can accomplish by economic policy at the Federal level to solve the job and wage problem," Ms. Tyson, the director of the National Economic Council, said, "what you do is put down a foundation for improved growth, and the most important element in that foundation is a significant improvement in the deficit."

HEADLINE: Protecting Pirates, Not Software

BYLINE: By Gary Hufbauer; Gary Hufbauer is a fellow at the Institute for International Economics.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With gusto and fanfare, the Clinton Administration has been chasing down software pirates in China, Thailand and Mexico, and with good reason. High-tech products, especially software, are our fastest-growing exports.
The software industry employs 500,000 people. When knockoff copies of American software are manufactured abroad without royalty payments, the industry loses money that could be used to create new technology and jobs. 
 The time has now come for Clinton trade warriors, who have had some success abroad, to aim their firepower at a closer target: the Treasury Department. By upholding a shortsighted temporary regulation that was issued in 1987 and never made final and that denies a tax benefit to the software industry, the Treasury is injuring our software exports just as surely as any pirate factory in Guangdong Province does.
In 1971, Congress permitted companies to exclude from corporate taxes about 15 percent of profits from exports of "films, tapes, records or similar reproductions, for commercial or home use." Software was not listed because it barely existed at the time.
The reason for the tax advantage is that it often makes sense to export a master film or recording -- whether "Forrest Gump" or Windows 95 -- for the production and sale of copies abroad. First, this cuts down on shipment and inventory problems and avoids high tariffs. Second, it makes possible local modifications: in some markets, for example, Madonna's erotic phrasing gives offense.
The third reason for the exception, only vaguely appreciated in 1971, is that by licensing local companies toturn out products for distribution in countries like China, Thailand and Mexico, powerful local interests can be recruited against counterfeiters.
Indeed, a central strategy of President Clinton's trade policy is to convert Chinese and Thai counterfeiters, with all their high-quality reproduction equipment and distribution talents, into licensees of American film, audio and software companies.
In 1987, the Treasury, thinking that master software disks did not fall into the "films, tapes, records or similar reproductions" category, issued a temporary regulation that denied tax advantages for those who export them. In 1993, soon after Bill Clinton took office, the Internal Revenue Service reaffirmed this interpretation. Master films from Disney and master CD's featuring Michael Jackson can be exported with a tax benefit, but not master disks from Microsoft.
Hardware manufacturers abroad often install imported software in their equipment; sometimes, entrepreneurs combine the imports with local software. No one wants to purchase tens of thousands of diskettes; they want to license a master diskette.
The Treasury can give software disks the same favorable tax treatment as master film and audio recordings by routinely revising the regulation. It doesn't want responsibility for losing the revenue, and thus insists that it is Congress's job to rewrite the 1971 statute. But Congress would be no more eager than the Treasury Department to approve a measure that would cost the Government money -- an estimated $200 million over five years.
The Treasury and Congress have not estimated what offsetting revenues might result from increased software sales abroad. It is highly likely that such sales would generate tax revenues that would more than offset the imagined loss.

President Ousts Finance Chief In Argentina

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 26

 BODY:
The Finance Minister, Domingo Cavallo, the architect of a program that brought economic stability to Argentina, was dismissed this afternoon after a heated argument with President Carlos Saul Menem over the pace of those policies.
While the dismissal raised questions about whether the Government would continue in Mr. Cavallo's direction, Mr. Menem said tonight that there would be no major shift in policy. 
 "I didn't fire him; I asked him to resign," Mr. Menem said. "Cavallo completed a very successful stage in Argentina's reforms, and I am grateful, but now we need changes." The President said the most significant change would involve a stepped-up tax collection, which the Government needed to balance its books and meet its debt payments.
Roque Fernandez, 47, the director of the central bank, was named to succeed Mr. Cavallo.
Argentine stocks and bonds tumbled late today on reports of Mr. Cavallo's departure. Traders and investors were concerned that the Government would abandon the Cavallo policies, which have been credited with bringing growth and stability to a country once plagued by hyperinflation, corruption and inefficiencies.
There had been talk for more than a year that Mr. Cavallo would be leaving the Government, and he often sparred publicly with the President, threatening to quit whenever his policies were opposed.
Political rivals and labor groups had long called for Mr. Cavallo's ouster, saying his policies had led to record unemployment and increased poverty.
But Mr. Cavallo, 50, a Harvard-trained economist, was highly respected by investors and bankers. His many threats to resign often sent Argentina's financial markets tumbling, as investors feared a currency crisis similar to the one that shattered Mexico's economy last year.
President Menem said at a news conference tonight that Argentina would not devalue its currency, as many investors and economists had speculated. He said the country would maintain its exchange-rate policy, which fixes the peso by law at a 1-to-1 ratio to the United States dollar and prohibits the printing of local currency unless it is backed by new capital. The exchange-rate policy is the cornerstone of the country's economic stability.
Mr. Menem said that before offering the Finance Minister's post to Mr. Fernandez, he had offered it to two other noted economists, Miguel Angel Broda and Roberto Alemann, both of whom declined. Mr. Fernandez said at the news conference that it was too early to comment on his plans but that tax collection would be his top priority.
Many investors, however, questioned whether Mr. Fernandez could maintain Mr. Cavallo's pace of change. The Merval index of the 28 most-traded stocks on the Buenos Aires stock exchange tumbled 21.57 points today, or 4.1 percent, to 504.86. In New York, Argentina's benchmark Brady bonds initially plunged 4.4 percent before a partial rebound.
The major challenge facing Mr. Fernandez will be convincing investors that Argentina is not another Mexico and that the economic changes begun by Mr. Cavallo will not be reversed.
"It's clear that Fernandez is a proponent of radical reform to Argentina's economy and from a technical perspective that's very pleasing," said Laurence Goodman, an economist specializing in Latin America for Salomon Brothers. "But the question remains whether he has the ability to push measures through Congress or thwart attempts to dilute reforms for social benefits."
Argentina's exchange-rate plan was introduced by Mr. Cavallo in 1991 with other economic changes, opening the economy to international competition and investment. Since the shift in policy, the inflation rate has fallen to less than 5 percent from more than 5,000 percent in 1989.
Along with the decline in inflation, Argentina has experienced industrial growth that has been among the highest in the world at 6 to 9 percent a year, fueled by a rise in investment and productivity. But the Mexican financial crisis led to a loss of foreign investment and plunged Argentina into a deep recession that wiped out its growth last year.
Today, the country is struggling to overcome the recession, and it badly needs foreign investment and tax collection to finance growth and meet its debt payments.
The budget deficit for the first half of 1996, at $2.51 billion, was $1.03 billion higher than the target set by the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Cavallo had announced several belt-tightening measures to balance accounts during the second half of the year, including taxing meal vouchers that companies give to employees and reducing social benefits.
The measures were unpopular with labor unions and opposition parties, which held a huge demonstration today to denounce the Government's economic polices and the current 17 percent unemployment rate.
Some members of Congress, which is controlled by Mr. Menem's Peronist Party, had said they would oppose Mr. Cavallo's cutbacks and the minister had threatened to quit in a meeting Wednesday with Mr. Menem.
According to Government officials present at the meeting, Mr. Menem, who had been reluctant to dismiss Mr. Cavallo in the past for fear that his departure would cause havoc in the financial markets, replied: "I'm tired of your threats. If you wish to quit, then quit."

HEADLINE: Picking Up the Tab For Fields of Dreams;
Taxpayers Build Stadiums; Owners Cash in

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In Baltimore, the Ravens, formerly the Cleveland Browns, are coming to a $200 million football stadium to be built on their behalf. Nashville has lured the Oilers from Houston with the promise of a sparkling new $389 million stadium. In New York, there is talk of a new ballpark for the Yankees, while discussion continues about replacing venerable Tiger Stadium in Detroit and Fenway Park in Boston, both now celebrating their 84th anniversaries.
But even as multimillion-dollar sports palaces are being proposed for assorted Bears, Bengals, Hawks, Vikings and other professional teams, a lot of people in Washington would like to clamp down on lucrative public subsidies that they contend do much more to help already-wealthy professional sports team owners than the communities that support the teams. 
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has fired the opening shot by introducing legislation to end the use of tax-free dollars to build sports stadiums. But, retreating under a hail of lobbying fire, Mr. Moynihan admits his measure has no chance of being enacted this year. Still, that has not stopped him from vigorously arguing that Federal tax dollars would be better devoted to public needs like higher education than subsidizing the current stadium building boom.
"Building new professional sports facilities is fine by me," Mr. Moynihan said. "Let the new stadiums be built. But, please, do not ask the American taxpayer to pay for them."
With an estimated $6 billion of new sports stadiums and arenas on the drawing boards, the mere introduction of a bill that would prevent local governments from tapping the tax-exempt municipal bond market for such projects is sending shock waves through the world of sports finance. "The Moynihan bill has had an immediate, horrendous impact," said Howard Richard, a lawyer at Katten Muchin & Zavis in Chicago. "There's intense lobbying. No one believes this bill will pass, but it is wreaking havoc with the market."
The controversy over stadium financing dates back to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which was thought to have eliminated the public subsidies by forcing team owners to finance stadiums with taxable, rather than tax-free, dollars.
That effort, however, backfired. With team owners precluded from tapping the public bond markets and reluctant to use more costly taxable debt, sports-starved cities stepped in to build and own the stadiums themselves, using municipal bonds.
And since the 1986 tax act prevents stadium revenues from being used to pay off any tax-free, stadium-related debt, a bizarre situation has developed. The municipality is often forced to pay with its own dollars for all of the borrowings, but the team owner virtually alone gets the revenues from the stadium. Under the tax code, only a small portion of the stadium revenues and lease payments -- less than 10 percent -- can be drawn on by municipalities to repay tax-free stadium debt.
Some of the newest, and most stylish, stadiums rely exclusively on public debt: Camden Yards and Ravens Stadium in Baltimore and the new Comiskey Park in Chicago are just a few of many. To pay off this debt, local governments have had to raise taxes, tap lottery proceeds or use other public revenues. Other stadiums, like the indoor America West Arena in Phoenix, were built as public-private partnerships, with some construction costs footed by the team owner; it all depends on the bargain struck. In all, $3.9 billion in public debt for stadiums has been issued since 1990.
Team owners, to bring their franchise to town or to be persuaded to stay put, are demanding not just new and bigger stadiums, but more ways to make money from them: luxury skyboxes that rent for $50,000 to $200,000 a year; "personal seat licenses," which are options bought by ticket holders to insure season tickets in perpetuity; new tiers of "club seats" that cost more than regular seats. And then there are "pouring rights," which are paid by beverage companies to peddle their beers and soda; more "totem" space to sell advertising, and bigger car-parking concessions.
"We thought we shut down public financing to private sports stadiums in 1986," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota who is a supporter of the Moynihan measure. "Now a decade later, we see that the only remaining healthy public housing is in sports stadiums for wealthy team owners. We thought we closed a loophole and they found a way through it."
Brian McGough, who specializes in stadium financing for J. P. Morgan & Company, explained the unintended consequences of the legislation: "Congress forced public officials back into the arms of team owners. It was a sea change difference."
The effect of these changes has been to give team owners more financial leverage in bargaining with local governments. And experts say the new-found riches from stadium deals, television contracts and other sources have been an important factor in the escalating salaries in professional sports. When some team owners have more cash in hand, they bid up everyone's prices for top players -- witness the $98 million, seven-year contract for the basketball player Juwan Howard to join the Miami Heat or the $121 million, seven-year contract for Shaquille O'Neal to move to the Los Angeles Lakers.
"A lot of these financial benefits flow to the talent because talent is key, especially in basketball," said Mr. Richard, the Chicago lawyer. "Look at the Chicago Bulls. You are seeing a $25 million raise for Micheal Jordan and millions for others. They say that this is creating the necessity for a new stadium because they need the skybox revenues to pay for the players. When you see all these salaries and the new stadiums, what is the cause and what is the effect?"
More troubling to critics is the evidence that the money spent on sports stadiums provides few economic benefits to the surrounding community. Indeed, several studies indicate that communities could benefit more if these investments, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year, were spent on other forms of economic development.
"The economic research on whether these stadiums provide benefits for state and local taxpayers suggest that they do not," said Dennis Zimmerman, author of a Congressional Research Service report on stadium financing. "There are a lot more productive things that state and local governments could have done with this money."
Mr. Zimmerman, using data the State of Maryland offered in making the case for building the Ravens' new stadium, found that more jobs could be created by investing the same $177 million in the state's "Sunny Day" economic development fund. He also concluded that in many cases the money local governments saved by issuing tax-free municipal bonds to build these stadiums ended up costing Federal taxpayers more than the local benefit.
"It would be cheaper for the Federal Government to just give a subsidy for these stadiums," Mr. Zimmerman said.
Robert Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College, is one of the strongest critics of the present system. "The distribution of income and benefits is skewed: The owners and the players get the lion's share," Mr. Baade said. "If I've raised taxes to finance a stadium, I can't argue that every dollar of that stadium is a boon to the economy."
Opponents of Mr. Moynihan's measure argue that eliminating tax-free dollars for sports stadiums would take decision-making away from local officials and increase the costs to municipalities by forcing them to borrow in the taxable markets. Indeed, the only way some of these stadiums can be built, they say, is with lower-cost public debt. Football stadiums, in particular, could become endangered, since they often cost as much as $200 million, yet may be used for only eight to 10 games a year, making it hard to generate enough revenues to repay the debts.
"A stadium is not conceptually different from a lot of other public projects," said Micah Green, the Washington lobbyist for the Public Securities Association, a trade group representing the municipal bond industry. "If cities and states decide to raise taxes to pay for these stadiums, then that's O.K. That makes it a governmental bond. The local decision of the electorate is the best test."
(Sometimes, however, local sentiment has to be swayed. The Ravens Stadium proposal passed by only two votes amid controversy in the Maryland Senate. Cincinnati voters approved two new stadiums to replace Riverfront Stadium only after a hard-fought campaign by downtown boosters. In Nashville, opponents forced the city's first-ever bond referendum before the new Oilers stadium won approval.)
Six local government organizations, including the United States Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, sent a letter to Mr. Moynihan arguing against his proposal. "It is simply not good public policy to constrain local flexibility in deciding what projects to undertake on a tax-exempt basis," the letter said.
Cathy Spain, the Washington lobbyist for the Government Finance Officers Association, said her group opposes the strict restrictions that preclude the use of stadium-related revenues from repaying municipal debt. Ms. Spain said the association's warnings to Congress about the problem went unheeded when the tax act was changed in 1986. Now, she said, her group would like to allow, say, 25 percent of stadium revenues to be diverted to municipalities instead of team owners.
Stadium financing experts say that regardless of the economics, the lure of professional sports is so strong that politicians and communities will still seek to attract and keep the limited number of sports teams available.
And what about cities that just say no? They may be better off in purely economic terms, but still left with an empty feeling.
"St. Louis lost the football Cardinals to Phoenix because they refused to build a new stadium," said James Gray, assistant director at the National Sports Law Institute in Milwaukee. "Now they are paying triple to lure the Rams from Los Angeles. Being part of a major league is something unique in our society. Lots of people believe it's a worthwhile investment and will do anything to keep a team there."

HEADLINE: ATLANTA DAY 8 -- JOURNAL;
Yachting Crowds Create Barely a Ripple

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga.

 BODY:
Olympics or no Olympics, midday feels as quiet as midnight here in the garden of good and evil.
"It's not slow; it's dead," said Shirley Hildreth, as she stood alone earlier this week in her gift shop, Mom's Country Crafts and Gifts, in the middle of Savannah's waterfront tourist district down the street from the hotel housing participants in the largest yachting regatta in Olympic history. "No one's here. This is supposed to be our busy season and it feels like January." 
 This eccentric, moss-draped coastal city immortalized in John Berendt's cheery tale of drag queens, voodoo and murder, "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil," usually has as much in common with Atlanta as a bullfrog does with a cantaloupe. But the South's No. 2 Olympic site is suffering from its own version of the Olympic curse as grand expectations meet modest reality.
At the big show 250 miles northwest in Atlanta, the problems are managing transportation and spreading around the business of the hundreds of thousands of visitors jamming downtown every day.
The problem here is attendance nowhere close to what organizers had hoped for. Organizers had estimated that 100,000 people would flock to this city of 150,000 people for festivities that began with Savannah's own opening ceremony July 20 and continues with racing through Aug 2.
But tickets are readily available for all the Olympic events and the normal tourist business, which had been booming because of Mr. Berendt's book, has been scared away by the prospect of jammed hotels, inflated prices and clogged streets.
In fact, rooms are readily available and you could drag race around Savannah's elegant green squares for all the traffic on the street. And the 457 Olympic athletes and their entourages, weary from days that begin and end with hour or hour-and-a-half commutes from the Olympic Village to the sailing venues, are mostly staying put rather than shopping or going out to eat.
"We had Olympian expectations that have come down to earth," said Jack Leigh as he sat alone in his Southern Images Gallery. "People are talking about business being down 70 percent. We're just sitting here twiddling our thumbs."
Savannah's Olympic experience has been a little ragged from the start. Originally, Savannah was supposed to host both yachting and beach volleyball, but the volleyball was moved near Atlanta, taking away the most accessible spectator sport.
Hurricane Bertha forced frantic organizers to dismantle much of the marina built to handle the Games, a torrential downpour drenched athletes and guests at the opening ceremonies, and rain and bad weather plagued this week's sailing.
And the venue is getting mixed reviews from yachters, never known as an easy group to please. Tuesday's sailing conditions were described as excellent and the $10.8 million, E-shaped marina, big enough to handle 3,000 people, is getting rave reviews.
But everyone is grumbling about the long, tiring trip to the sailing in Wassaw Sound, 20 miles southeast of Savannah, and some of the athletes and teams say the expertise to run the sailing on a top-notch level is lacking.
"I must be a little rude," said Peer Bent Neilsen, team leader for the Danish team, "but it feels like the difference between putting on the event because you like sailing and putting on the event because you like money. We're getting no information while the races are going on. To get information, I'm picking up my cellular phone and calling friends in Denmark who are watching on television or listening on radio."
To be sure, there is a lot to be said for the low-key pageant here. Viewing conditions for spectators are spectacular. You get can reservations at any restaurant in town, and plenty of people would take Savannah's moldy architectural treasures, relaxed pace and weird characters over the corporate extravaganza in Atlanta any day.
"It's been incredible watching the racing from the middle of the sea," said Christian Kasper, a student from Switzerland who was here with Jochen Hurlebaus, a student from Germany. "People are great and this is so much better than Atlanta where everything is so commercial. Buy this, buy this, it's as if everyone's forgotten what the Olympics are about there."
Not every business is hurting and some optimists here say the big tourism rush may still come after the Games end in Atlanta and visitors have time to explore. Others say that though business may be disappointing, the Olympics will still be good for Savannah.
"The Olympic Arts Festival was a real high moment for everyone involved," Leigh said. "And long term, in terms of the international exposure, this will be good for Savannah. But as for any kind of economic boom, that's not happening.'
As a result, more than a few people here are wondering if the big cheeses in Atlanta sold them a bill of goods.
"You have to remember," said Alan Chiboucas, as he took in the empty scene on River Street, "the people who talked about 100,000 visitors in Savannah are the same ones who said the summer temperature in Atlanta was 76 degrees."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Most Prices Off as Data Are Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of most Treasury securities sagged yesterday heading into the weekend, as the bond market braced for a barrage of economic data next week that will set the tone of the market for weeks ahead, and perhaps even lead the Federal Reserve to alter its monetary policy.
The market has already begun pricing in the risk factor for potentially damaging news, and as a result bond prices could be discounted further, sending interest rates higher. 
 At the close of the New York cash market yesterday, the only maturity not lower was the 30-year bond, which was unchanged at a price of 8716/32 for a yield of 7.01 percent. Thin volume exaggerated price moves, with many investors having elected to lie low until next week.
Some of the key reports next week include the second-quarter Employment Cost Index, consumer confidence, new-home sales, the Chicago purchasing managers survey, the National Association of Purchasing Management survey, gross domestic product, motor vehicle sales and the employment report on Friday.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said: "Given next week's high-profile economic calendar, the market has the potential of experiencing the explosive effects of Independence Day all over again. Since Mr. Greenspan outlined his strategic blueprints for policy making during Congressional testimony, many traders will be testing whether they can take him at his word."
"Therefore," Mr. Chan continued, "if the Employment Cost Index, the N.A.P.M. and the overall employment report come in with a touch of firmness, Mr. Greenspan will be forced to pull the trigger, primarily because a failure to act by the Aug. 20 Federal Open Market Committee meeting could cause serious damage to Fed credibility."
The Employment Cost Index measures the cost of employing people, including pension and health benefits. Discussing it, Mr. Chan said, "So far, we already have some ugly preliminary evidence on wage pressures, as evidenced by last month's surge in average hourly earnings." That means inflationary pressures can be avoided only if the growth in benefits continues to remain in low or negative territory.
David Ader, managing analyst at Technical Data, Boston, said, "The Employment Cost Index should prove to be next week's most critical market event, with the Fed looking to get further indications of strength or weakness of the economy."
He said the consensus was for a gain of nine-tenths of a percent. "If the data are stronger, it could easily lead to a test of this year's low," he said. "If it is neutral, bordering on friendly, do not expect a break-out rally. With other scheduled releases, it is up to the subsequent data to take the market one way or another."
Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, San Francisco, said the September bond futures contract would head into next week in roughly the same shape it had been in ahead of the last few employment reports. She said that on May 1, just before the reports on advance first-quarter gross domestic product and April employment, the September bond was trading at a price of 10819/32 . On June 6, the contract was at 10826/32 before tumbling on the strong employment report, and it steadily rallied to 1098/32 on July 3 before the June employment report. Yesterday the September futures contract settled at a price of 10818/32 .
"Fundamentals and charts both suggest that the next move will be a big one," Ms. Rupert said, "taking us out of the trade range of 106 to 110 seen in the September bond over the past few months."

No Echo of Past Rancor as Bush Welcomes Dole

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., July 26

 BODY:
Today's trip to this coastal resort, the summer home of George Herbert Walker Bush, must have been a long one for Bob Dole.
Mr. Dole grew up poor in Kansas, and during at least one phase of his career he deeply resented Mr. Bush, to the manor born. 
 Campaigning in 1988 against Mr. Bush for the Republican Presidential nomination, Mr. Dole said: "I didn't start at the top and stay at the top. I started at the bottom."
Mr. Bush had equally harsh words then for Mr. Dole, who resigned from the Senate last month after 35 years in Congress. "I'm not sure being in Congress all your life is a part of the answer," Mr. Bush said during that campaign. "I think it may be part of the problem."
Now the 73-year-old former Senator and the 72-year-old former President seem to have settled into the truce that they declared after the 1988 primaries.
Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Dole today to Walker's Point, the Bush homestead on prime Atlantic real estate here. The purpose was to hail each other for the Americans With Disabilities Act, barring discrimination against the disabled, which President Bush signed into law six years ago today. But equally useful politically were the tableaux for the cameras: Mr. Bush and Mr. Dole with their wives and with Mr. Bush's son George W. Bush, the popular Governor of Texas, and his wife, Laura.
"Barbara and I and all the Bushes," the former President said, "are in unanimous, enthusiastic agreement that America needs Bob Dole's character, his courage, his decency and his common sense in the White House."
Mr. Bush demurred when asked what advice he might give Mr. Dole on campaigning against Bill Clinton. Instead, he praised his onetime rival, saying, "He was at my side when the going was tough, he was there when the going got pretty darn good in 1988. He was there at my side, never jumped away, never tried to protect his own flank by jumping away from me as the President seeking re-election."
Mr. Dole, asked what he had learned from Mr. Bush, also demurred. "My view," the candidate said, "is that we had a good lunch. Great blueberry pie."
Renewed Defense
Mr. Bush, tanned and looking relaxed today, is nonetheless apparently still a bit miffed at the outcome of the 1992 election, and he could not resist asserting that whatever anyone's impression at the time, he had not been "out of touch" at all. He said:
"I would like to point out -- I know this will sound a little defensive -- but as I hear President Clinton talk about the great economy they've done, I would like to point out to some of you in this press corps, in case you missed it in 1992, we handed him an economy that was growing at 5.7 percent in the last quarter and the one that grew at 3.6 percent in the third quarter, and it grew in excess of three-point-something for the whole year. That was not recession. That was not out of touch."
'Oh, Come On'
With all the talk about drugs lately, it seemed inevitable that someone would pose the question to Representative Susan Molinari, the 38-year-old Staten Island Republican whom Mr. Dole has chosen as keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention.
Ms. Molinari said in a statement today that she had "experimented" with marijuana in college -- she graduated from the State University of New York at Albany in 1980 -- and now deeply regretted it.
Mr. Dole has been hammering the Clinton Administration lately because certain staff members were hired despite use of hard drugs within the prior five years. But today he shrugged off a question about Ms. Molinari.
"Oh, come on," he said.
"I'm talking about recent drug use," the candidate added, "hard drugs, cocaine, crack and other things."
Greet the Press
When Mr. Dole's plane lands at an airport, he usually emerges from the front while the traveling press climbs down the back staircase. Here there were no stairs to be wheeled to the front of the plane, and so Mr. Dole had to alight at the back with the press. Waiting in the rain to greet everyone was Mr. Bush, who cheerfully shook hands with reporters, many of whom had encamped here during Mr. Bush's vacations as President.
"Welcome back to Kennebunkport," he said, a natural host. "And welcome to those who haven't been here before."
At a joint news conference with Mr. Dole, Mr. Bush enjoyed playful banter with reporters. That did not go unnoticed by Mr. Dole, who has lately had an icier relationship with the traveling scribes.
"I know the President sees many of his friends in the press," Mr. Dole noted. "I'm still looking for one."

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE REPUBLICANS;
Dole Appears Moving Toward Tax-Cut Stand

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
During his days as the Senate's deficit-fighter-in-chief, Bob Dole liked to joke about a bus carrying a group of supply-siders that plunged off a cliff. The bad news, he said, was that three of the seats were empty.
They're not telling that joke around Dole campaign headquarters. As he completes work on the economic platform for his Presidential campaign, Mr. Dole has surrounded himself with plenty of people who say that cutting taxes is the best way to stimulate more growth, and the platform could end up embracing the kinds of sweeping tax cuts he once disdained. 
 Just how Mr. Dole will choose among the variety of options being touted by his aides is an open question, Republican strategists inside and outside the campaign said. Mr. Dole said this week that he had not decided among a variety of tax-cut proposals, and several of his advisers said they had long since learned not to push Mr. Dole or predict his decisions.
Mr. Dole's economic policy formulation is being overseen by Donald Rumsfeld, whose support for tax cuts goes back to his days as President Gerald Ford's chief of staff, and the campaign is staffed with may other ardent supply-siders.
Still, Mr. Dole continues to be cautioned not to risk his credibility as a deficit cutter from some colleagues who were at his side when he put austerity ahead of tax cuts during the 1980's, including Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and Sheila Burke, who was his chief of staff in the Senate, Republican strategists with ties to the campaign said.
"He wants to be totally comfortable" with the platform that is unveiled, said Steve Forbes, whose unsuccessful bid for the Republican Presidential nomination was built around a single-rate flat tax and who in recent weeks has become an influential voice in Mr. Dole's campaign. "If he's seen faltering on this, it's over. That's why he's being cautious."
But to a degree that many Republican strategists said amazed them, Mr. Dole appears to have already undergone a conversion, on both intellectual and political levels, to the need for tax-cutting, "pro-growth" policies that he once held in such disdain.
As a result, they said, the debate in the Dole camp is relatively narrow: whether to build the economic plan around an across-the-board tax reduction, which is seen as the more cautious choice, or to fashion a more radical package including rollbacks of 1993 and 1990 tax increases, reducing the capital gains tax and making Social Security taxes deductible.
Mr. Dole in recent weeks has asked for detailed advice from Mr. Forbes. Through his aides, he has reached out to Jack F. Kemp, the leading advocate of tax-based economic policies, who has long had a touchy relationship with Mr. Dole.
Mr. Dole has also been influenced by Vin Weber, a former Congressman from Minnesota who is also a leading policy adviser, and conservative economists including John Taylor of Stanford University and Gary S. Becker of the University of Chicago.
"I do think there has been an intellectual conversion or awakening, especially since the policies have been separated from the personalities" advocating them, like Mr. Kemp, said one Republican strategist who has been involved in the tax debate.
"And then on the political side, he knows he has to do something," the strategist said. "If the fight is not on taxes in September and in November, we're gone, no question."
At this point, much of the debate in the Dole camp is over the economic assumptions to be used in a plan that will call for large tax cuts while still promising to balance the budget by 2002.
In particular, there is discussion about how much economic growth the tax cuts would stimulate, and about how much additional tax revenue that growth would generate.
There is also a debate over how quickly Mr. Dole needs to come to a decision and unveil the plan, which aides said would be the centerpiece of his campaign. Mr. Dole's campaign is nearly out of money, and advisers fear that the candidate will not be able to respond to the barrage of advertising that the Clinton campaign has promised to unleash on the Dole economic plan.
Some advisers are arguing that Mr. Dole should hold off announcing the plan until the Republican National Convention in mid-August, when Mr. Dole will become his party's nominee and will be able to replenish his campaign finances.
"There's no question that when the plan goes out, there will be a very significant effort at selling it because it's not only very important for the nominee, but for the party itself," said one top campaign aide, noting that members of Congress were eager to run on a tax-cutting platform and to hold President Clinton's feet to the political fire for pushing through a tax increase in 1993.
Economic proposals in political campaigns often are built on optimistic assumptions, and this one appears to be no exception.
Advisers to Mr. Dole said the plan would assume that the large tax cuts, however they are structured, would provide the economy with a big boost, raising the growth rate from its current level of 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year to 3 percent or more over the six- or seven-year period that the plan would cover.
Many economists questioned whether the economy would indeed get such a big boost from a tax cut over such a long period. They said that unless the tax cuts led to fundamental improvements in the economy's productivity, such high rates of growth would fuel inflation and lead to higher interest rates.
Mr. Dole's advisers argue that the tax cuts would lead to increased savings and business investment, making their growth projections credible.
And by the Clinton Administration's own projections, they said, a one-percentage-point increase in growth would generate $60 billion in additional tax revenues on average over the next seven years, enough to offset nearly two-thirds of the annual cost of a 15 percent across-the-board reduction in personal income tax rates, one of the leading options being studied by Mr. Dole.
The Dole campaign has been working with a variety of models of the extent to which growth would generate additional revenues to offset lower tax rates. At the high end of their spectrum is a model assuming that 40 percent of the lost revenue would be recouped through additional growth and changes in economic behavior.
But that is a low level by the standards of the supply-side orthodoxy of the early 1980's, which held that tax cuts could nearly pay for themselves, but in the middle of the range of what most current research suggests.
The economic assumptions are crucial to the Dole plan, because the campaign wants to minimize the spending cuts that would be needed to pay for a tax cut. Mr. Dole's aides said that they want to avoid at all costs having to defend cuts in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, issues that the White House used to great advantage against the Republicans during the battle over balancing the budget.
"So many political leaders can't seem to grasp that you can have a very dynamic, positive program without throwing widows and orphans out in the snow," said Mr. Forbes, representing the view that growth will make up for a large part of the forgone tax revenue.

HEADLINE: Developer Carves a Niche In Small Boutique Hotels

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

 BODY:
In a trend toward smaller, less expensive hotels in New York City, a development firm that has carved out a niche in that category said yesterday that it planned to convert a gracious brick office building on East 44th Street east of Grand Central Terminal into a 162-room hotel.
The building was designed as an apartment house early in the century by Emery Roth & Sons, a renowned architectural firm. Renovation is to begin in January, and the hotel, to be called the Hotel Grand Central, will have a railroad theme. Its developer, Gotham Hospitality Group, has already bought 14 murals from the 1920's depicting trains and rail workers. 
 With 24.5 million visitors expected in New York City this year, the most since the 1980's, tourism is booming. Many, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, can ill afford the room rates of the city's major hotels, but they still want something fancier than a bouncy mattress and a metal chair.
"There is a boomlet in the moderately priced boutique category," said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the bureau, "and that would be hotels with 200 rooms or less for $200 or less. When you're looking at an increase of a million visitors from 1993 to 1996, you're going to have many more people who need accommodations in that category. There was a demand."
The Gotham Hospitality Group, which has developed five other hotels in the last eight years with room rates averaging $140 to $170 a night, exemplifies the new approach, Ms. Moss said. "Today," she added, "the smart hotel people have found ways to get really nice design pieces inexpensively. Gotham has found a really good niche, and it's added enormously to New York City's mix."
The president of the Gotham group, Bernard Goldberg, a 63-year-old real estate lawyer, said yesterday that he had signed a contract on Thursday to buy the nine-story building and expected to close on the deal in January. He would not say what he was paying for the building. The current owner, a small partnership named for its address, 141 East 44th Street, has recently stopped renewing leases, Mr. Goldberg said, so half the offices are vacant.
There are six stores on the ground floor, including a shoe-repair business and a bagel shop. They will close as their leases expire, Mr. Goldberg said, and the space will be added to the lobby.
All of the other hotels in Gotham's small empire, from the 92-room Hotel Wales on Madison Avenue near 92d Street to the 129-room Mansfield Hotel at 14 West 44th Street, had been low-budget hotels, most "rundown and seedy," Mr. Goldberg said, but with "good bones."
One, the Roger Williams, at 31st Street and Madison Avenue, is being renovated and is scheduled to open in a year. With 211 rooms, it will be the firm's largest.
Joseph E. Spinnato, president of the Hotel Association of New York City, said that in the early 1990's there had been a spate of hotel development planned before the economic downturn.
That was followed by a quiet period, marked mostly by more intimate hotels. "Other than these very small hotels that have come on line," he said, "there have been no major projects."
As tourism has increased, so has the city's hotel occupancy rate, which is expected to reach 79 percent this year, the highest since 1990. Mr. Goldberg said the current occupancy rates of Gotham's hotels ranged from 84 percent to 96 percent.
The location of the Hotel Grand Central was a major attraction for Gotham. "In Europe," Mr. Goldberg said, "railroad terminals were always beautiful and romantic places. Paris and London both have these little boutique hotels right near the railroad stations. We think the project will complement the restoration of Grand Central."

Stocks Climb as Earnings Buoy Investor Confidence
Stocks advanced as positive corporate earnings reports restored investor confidence. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 points, to 5,473.06, a day after rallying 67.32 points. That brought its gain for the week to eight-tenths of 1 percent, despite sharp slides on Monday and Tuesday. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.05 points, to 1,079.44, and the S.& P. 500 climbed 4.73 points, to 635.90.
Among the earnings surprises were: Gateway 2000, the computer maker; T. Rowe Price Associates, the mutual fund manager, and Whole Foods Market, a grocer. [Page 43.]
 
Prices of most Treasury securities sagged, as the bond market braced for a barrage of economic data next week, but the long bond held steady with a yield of 7.01 percent. [42.]
 
Agents Breach Airport Security
The Department of Transportation's inspector general reported two weeks before the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800 that undercover Government agents, carrying fake bombs, had walked into secure areas at four of the nation's largest airports. Officials decided not to release the report for fear of encouraging terrorists. [1.]
 
Kellogg's Earnings Slide 42.5%
Kellogg, the cereal industry leader, reported a 42.5 percent slide in second-quarter profits, citing stiff competition and industry price cuts. The company predicted the year's earnings would match last year's, but analysts were skeptical. [41.]
 
Aetna Moves Into the Black
Aetna reported earnings of $288 million for the second quarter in contrast to a loss of $297 million in the corresponding period last year. The turnaround was driven mostly by the sale of Aetna's property-casualty operations to the Travelers Group. [41.]
 
German Media Rivals in Accord
In Germany, two rival media giants, Bertelsmann A.G. and the Kirch Group, said that they would develop a common decoder standard for digital television, ending a long battle over which technology would dominate. But competition will continue in the programming and customer service arenas of the two companies' digital-TV efforts. [40.]
 
U.S. and Japan Differ in Talks
The United States and Japan remain "pretty far" apart in talks on increasing access to Japan's $470 billion insurance market less than a week ahead of a deadline, the deputy United States trade representative, Ira S. Shapiro, said. He and Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the Japanese Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, are meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia. [41.]
 
Milken's Probation Extended
Michael R. Milken's probation was extended by United States District Judge Kimba M. Wood for a third time, until Oct. 25, because of an S.E.C. investigation into whether Mr. Milken's recent business dealings have violated the terms of his punishment. Mr. Milken, the former junk bond king who has been barred from the securities business, has advised both Ted Turner and Rupert Murdoch in recent deals. His lawyer contends those activities are entirely proper. [40.]
 
Ford to Sell $3.5 Billion in Leases
Ford Motor said that it would sell $1.8 billion in leases to BankAmerica Corporation, and an additional $1.7 billion to a partnership formed by Ford and BankAmerica. The $3.5 billion in leases -- for planes, rail cars, ships and other industrial equipment and operations -- cover all the transportation and industrial financing assets of Ford's USL Capital unit. [41.]
 
British Economic Growth Slow
Britain's economy grew four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, less than economists were expecting, as the "mad cow disease" scare cut farm production. [40.]

HEADLINE: David Valinsky, 81, Statistician on Rights Cases

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Dr. David Valinsky, a statistician who applied his skills to civil rights issues ranging from voting rights to police hiring, died on July 19 at the Westchester County Medical Center. He was 81 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
He had suffered a long illness, said a spokesman for Baruch College, where he was Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Statistics. 
 Dr. Valinksy was the principal architect of graduate programs in statistics and computer information systems at the City University of New York. He introduced more than 50 undergraduate and graduate courses in statistics, operations theory and decision theory during his 45 years as a teacher and administrator. As a statistician, he was frequently called on for expert testimony and advice on equal voting rights.
In 1972, a Federal court in Montgomery, Ala., ordered a drastic reapportionment of electoral districts for the State Legislature in a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of a group of disfranchised black Alabamans. After the Legislature failed to come up with a plan acceptable to the court, the A.C.L.U. brought in Dr. Valinsky, who did.
He also drew up electoral reapportionment plans for Mississippi in the 1970's and testified in cases involving jury selection and discrimination in police hiring and promotion.
He was a fellow of Britain's Royal Statistical Society as well as a consultant for the New York Mayor's office, the Justice Department and the Civil Aeronautics Board.
In New York, he advised on such matters as the optimal number of firefighting units and where to base them, and the most efficient deployment of blood banks, microscopy laboratories and operating-room schedules in city hospitals.
David Valinsky was born in Atlantic City and graduated from Temple University in science of education, specializing in sociology and economics. He received a master's degree in statistics from City College in 1943 and a Ph.D., also in statistics, from Columbia University in 1962.
He started his teaching career at Baruch in 1940. He was chairman of the department of statistics and computer information systems from 1970 to 1983 and developed the City University of New York's doctoral program in quantitative analysis, Baruch's M.B.A. program in operations research and many undergraduate specializations in statistics and computer operations. After retiring in 1985, he worked as a consultant and an expert witness in age discrimination cases brought against employers.
Dr. Valinsky is survived by his wife of 58 years, Helen Abrams Valinsky; a son, Eric, of Manhattan; a sister, Ruth Gove, of Philadelphia, and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Black, Successful and Safe And Gone From Capital

SERIES: MONUMENT TO DECAY -- Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES and KAREN DE WITT 

DATELINE: FORT WASHINGTON, Md., July 26

 BODY:
Richard Jones moved here to the suburbs in 1979 to shield his children from the drugs and street crime that were rampant in his southeast Washington neighborhood. Yet 17 years later and now retired as an air traffic controller, Mr. Jones still does volunteer work with poor children in his old neighborhood, and every now and then he yearns to move back into the city.
"I would like to go back," he said, seated at the dining room table of his tidy four-bedroom home. "I think that it's people like me who have to go back. At some point, we need middle-class black people to go back and reclaim the city." 
 Across the table, his wife, Linda, emphatically shook her head no.
Two decades after the District of Columbia and its black majority won the long-coveted right of limited self-government, significant numbers of the city's black middle class have fled to the suburbs in disillusionment and transplanted ambition, an exodus that is both primary effect and cause of the District's continuing decline.
According to census data, nearly 50,000 blacks moved out of Washington in the 1980's, a net decline of about 11 percent in the city's black population. In the same period, the city's white population increased by nearly 8,000. The District is thus one of the few American cities that have become whiter while growing poorer.
This exodus of Washington's black residents to here in Prince George's County, which borders the District on the east, has transformed a formerly white-majority county with a bitter history of racial segregation into a new emblem of rising black prosperity and political power.
The search for a cure for the nation's capital is now focusing on the middle class -- on keeping those who have stayed, even luring back some who have left. But as they look back at their old and troubled hometown -- now with a population estimated at 554,000, about 65 percent black and about 32 percent white -- some of the people here find themselves torn between the powerful political, economic and emotional pull of the District and a determination to preserve and nurture the lives and the communities they have created here. People like Mr. Jones, who is in his early 50's, may talk about returning, but they are hard to find.
Among them is Sandy Davis, a research librarian for The Washington Post, who five years ago moved from Washington to Mount Rainier, just across the District line.
"I wouldn't come back into the city because of all the problems that have cropped up since I left, basically the poor city services," Ms. Davis said. "I love Mount Rainier. It's like a little town with a mayor you can call up and who will come over on his bike."

 The Reaction
 
Anger at Congress, A Sense of Disquiet
A number of the blacks who have left Washington for the suburbs react to the District's fiscal woes with a mixture of anger at Congress for allowing the city to slide into bankruptcy, and sadness at what they see as waste and mismanagement by local officials. Some feel uneasy that their departure contributed to the decline of the place affectionately known as the Chocolate City because of its long and well-cultivated history of black ownership, black institutions and black achievement.
"Everybody out here understands that there but for the grace of God go I," said Lucenia Dunn, 53, who in 1989 moved from Washington to the Woodmore development, a predominantly black, gated community in the county, with private security, town houses, sprawling estates and a golf course.
"We were first proud of the Chocolate City," Ms. Dunn said, "and it's hard to unloosen that level of loyalty to the concept of having a successful African-American-owned and -operated and -run city. It grieves us that it's in trouble."
In those days of hope and pride, at the dawning of limited home rule, Washington was the unofficial capital of the nation's black middle class. Its flight did more than erode an already slipping tax base; it gradually robbed the District of a stability rare in inner-city America.
"What has most affected this city is what happened to its black middle class," said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting delegate to Congress.
Ms. Norton has sponsored legislation to lure back the middle class, or at least keeping what is left, through sharply lower Federal income taxes for District residents and other tax breaks. That legislation has recently drawn the support of Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Congressional Republican leaders.
For those who have relocated, the reasons differ little from ones voiced by people of all races, in all regions of the country, who took part in the great migration to the suburbs after World War II: a hope for more living space, a desire for better schools or simply a yearning for a bigger and less-expensive home.
"I was looking for safety, new brick construction and a price tag under $200,000," said Janet Lane, a native Washingtonian who moved to the Woodmore development two years ago.
But there are those who say the black flight from Washington signifies something more: a vote of no-confidence on the District's experiment in self-government.
"We had a larger black middle class than many cities," said James O. Gibson, a former city planning commissioner, "and for a long time it didn't move.
"Initially, it didn't move because of segregation in the suburbs. But even after desegregation, there was an identification with this black government and a desire to see this experiment work. It was when that vision defaulted that the exodus stepped up."

 The County
 
High Achievement And High Hopes
The migration to Prince George's County is something of a homecoming for African-Americans. In 1860, they made up about 60 percent of the county's population, 9 out of 10 of them slaves. But from the 1920's through the 1950's, blacks left in droves for jobs in the cities.
Then from 1980 to 1990, the black population of Prince George's County, which comprises 487 square miles in Maryland, grew by 155,000, an increase of almost 63 percent. A 1994 survey by The Washington Post indicated that 60 percent of the county's black residents once lived in Washington. In contrast, only 20 percent of the county's white residents had come from the District.
The influx of blacks, along with the migration of the county's whites, has made Prince George's the nation's first black-majority suburban county: African-Americans make up 52.2 percent of its population. And as the county's racial complexion changed, the income and educational attainment of its population rose.
From 1990 to 1995, household income in the county grew faster than it did in surrounding jurisdictions, including Montgomery County, Md., northwest of the District and long considered one of the area's most affluent. A study by Prince George's County in February of this year indicated that the proportion of Prince George's households with incomes of $50,000 to $100,000 range is comparable to wealthy counties like Montgomery and Fairfax County, Va., west of Washington.
Last year, nearly 46 percent of Prince George's black high school seniors said they planned to attend a four-year college, a higher proportion than the 41.6 percent of the whites in the county who said they would.
Wayne K. Curry, the first black elected County Executive of Prince George's, offered this observation in his victory speech two years ago: "Normally, the mere arrival of an African-American majority is like a fire alarm going off, saying, 'Don't use the elevator. Use the staircase and get out!' " "Well, that's not what we are."
Meanwhile, as the black middle class arrived in the county, so did a number of black institutions. Last year the Industrial Bank, Washington's largest black-owned bank, moved its headquarters to Prince George's from the District, after 60 years there. One black church is building a 10,000-seat sanctuary in Temple Hill, just across the Maryland line, while two others are building 5,000-seat houses of worship elsewhere in the county.
In 1983 the Ebenezer A.M.E. Zion Church sold its valuable piece of land in the Georgetown section and moved to Fort Washington, in southwestern Prince George's. At the time, the church had 50 parishioners. Today it has 8,000 to 9,000.
The county does have its share of shortcomings. Some sections bordering the District have the city's problems of poverty, crime and low educational achievement. The county over all lacks quality, high-end shopping outlets and has fewer sit-down restaurants than in any of the other suburban counties adjacent to Washington. And its school system, which is 70 percent black, is the third-worst performer in Maryland, out of 24 counties, on standardized tests.
Nonetheless, Prince George's is fast becoming the capital of transplanted dreams. For years, especially since limited home rule, the black middle class in Washington focused on building the city into a magnet for ambitious African-Americans and making it a model of black achievement. So as the District has stumbled, the task of creating the black Xanadu has, for some, been passed to Prince George's, named for Prince George of Denmark, the consort of Queen Anne of England, on April 23, 1696.
"I really see the county as the next phase of the civil-rights movement," said the Rev. Grainger Browning Jr., the pastor of Ebenezer A.M.E. "Many persons in the county have been the beneficiaries of the 60's. We now have some economic ability to make changes, so we can own businesses and be in corporate, academic and political leadership, and really have the opportunity to become a model of black-white relations and black political empowerment."

The Conflicts
 
Problems of the Poor, Middle-Class Fears
Even as people in Prince George's seek a better life, they often seem concerned about not becoming too much of a haven for Washington's poor. In his campaign for county executive, Mr. Curry said developers were building too many high-density, low-income housing units in the county. And last year, after he assumed office, Mr. Curry threatened to deny water and sewer connections to several developments unless the builders made the houses larger and more expensive.
Mr. Curry has also asked a Federal judge to rescind a Federal court-ordered busing plan. The 1973 order, coming in the wake of desegregation, required the then predominantly white county to amend school boundaries to eliminate all black-majority schools and to insure that no school had a black population of less than 10 percent. Today African-Americans make up 55 percent of the school population.
"You have African-American kids being bused from one African-American community to another African-American community," said Reggie Parks, press secretary to Mr. Curry. "The commissioner and other elected officials feel that the busing order has outlived its usefulness."
Most on the 10-member Prince George's County school board are sympathetic. But both residents and board members recognize that some of the desire to keep poor black children from the areas bordering the District out of middle-class areas is behind the effort to get the busing order rescinded. Class, not race, is at stake, they say.
"That's a real issue and one that the board has to grapple with," said Marcy C. Canavan, the chairwoman of the Prince George's County school board. Mrs. Canavan, who is white, represents Tantallon and Accokeek, overwhelmingly black and middle- to upper-class neighborhoods in the southwestern part of the county.
"People have moved here away from crime to good schools, and it's very clear that some don't want ghetto kids in their school buildings," Mrs. Canavan said. "But it's the school board's job to represent all kids, and we know it's not good to have large concentration of poor kids in a single building. It's a dicey situation."
Alvin Thornton, a school board member and the chairman of the political science department at Howard University, said he favored having the busing order revoked. But Dr. Thornton sees broader ramifications to the issue both for blacks in the county and for upper-class blacks in general.
"What does black politics mean in this day and age?" he asked. "I don't think it means only carving out a piece of the pie for the black middle class. I don't think it means letting cities deteriorate so you have cores of decay ringed by rings of affluence."
Pointing out that nearly half of the children in county public elementary schools take part in the free-lunch program, Dr. Thornton added:
"If you live in a county where 40 percent of your kids are poor, where the achievement gap between lower- and upper-income children is so huge and persistent, instructional talent and resources so maldistributed, we ought to be able to agree that that is a problem. But some middle-class black people have the same prejudices as their older white counterparts."

 The Good Life
 
Isolated Self-Interest And Little Sympathy
The signs of contented suburban life can be found in areas like Fort Washington, a community of tidy single-family homes with neatly manicured lawns set along the shores of the Potomac River.
On a recent crisp sunny day in Fort Washington, the parents of the Raiders, a predominantly black soccer team, watched their 13- and 14-year-old sons scamper across a green field, cheering and harrying the referees.
"Oh, he pushed! He pushed, ref!" yelled Francis Taylor, an Air Force colonel whose son, Jason, plays left wing. "Hand ball! Hand ball! Come on ref, make the call!"
The boys ran up and down the field while parents lounged in folding chairs on the sidelines, taking in the game and talking about what was going on at local schools and about the girl scouts. Nearby, younger children cavorted in the playground of a school.
The community is racially integrated. And the median household income for blacks in sections like Tantallon, which is home to Mr. Jones, the retired air traffic controller, and Colonel Taylor and his wife, Constance, is more than $68,500, according to the 1990 census, far above the national median for all races. Houses in the area sell for $250,000 to $350,000, with those on the waterfront costing more than $400,000.
The Taylors began their married life in Prince George's County in 1983, living in a town house in Temple Hills. In 1984, when Mrs. Taylor was pregnant with the couple's third child, they bought their five-bedroom, Colonial-style house in Tantallon.
"I didn't feel I needed to be patriotic toward Washington," said Mrs. Taylor, who recently left the Air Force as a major to work for the Pentagon as a civilian employee. "I felt I needed to look out for what my family needed to prosper and grow."
Mrs. Taylor added that as the District plunged into its fiscal crisis, her feeling had only been become stronger. And Colonel Taylor, who works in the Air Force Inspector General's office, attributed the District's problems to an unwillingness by anyone -- politician or electorate -- to set high enough standards.
"I really do blame this on the city leadership," Colonel Taylor said. "I think we have created a situation where there is no accountability any more. In the military, you can always tell which units are going to fall apart. It's where the leadership fails to demand high standards of conduct and professionalism."

HEADLINE: Mayor Opposes Some Revisions In Welfare Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says that a welfare bill speeding through Congress would impose immense new costs on New York City by cutting Federal aid for poor children, disabled people and legal immigrants.
In a letter this week to Congressional leaders, Mr. Giuliani said he supported the basic concept of the bill, which would eliminate the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children and give states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lump sums of Federal money. 
 But he criticized almost every one of the bill's major provisions, saying they would simply "shift costs to local governments."
Mr. Giuliani, who has often found himself at odds with the national Republican Party and Republicans in Congress, said the bill could impose nearly $900 million a year in additional costs on New York City: $290 million for legal immigrants; $380 million to provide child care for welfare recipients, $100 million for work programs and $100 million to aid people cut from the Federal rolls because of a five-year limit on welfare payments to any family. (The city budget is $33 billion a year.)
In his letter, Mr. Giuliani said the welfare bill was "of enormous importance" to New York, the nation's largest city, because one million New York City residents receive public assistance. About 850,000 of them get benefits through Aid to Families With Dependent Children, which the legislation would abolish.
The bill's restrictions on aid to legal immigrants, which account for one-third of its savings, would have "a particularly serious impact in New York City, where 30 percent of the population is foreign-born," Mr. Giuliani wrote. His press secretary, Colleen A. Roche, said tonight that the Mayor was "just as concerned about the bill's effects on children."
Asked why the Mayor had not pressed Congress earlier, as versions of the bill were being considered by both houses, Richard J. Schwartz, senior adviser to the Mayor, said "the bill has reached a point where it's really quite serious."
The letter is unlikely to sway Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and previously passed two similar measures, only to see them vetoed by President Clinton. But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, cited the letter as evidence that the bill would be "ruinous to New York City."
The new welfare bill has been passed in slightly different forms by both houses of Congress. Republican leaders of the two chambers say they will complete work on it next week, before starting a monthlong recess. President Clinton has sent conflicting signals about whether he will sign or veto the bill.
Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, has often staked out a course independent of his party, often infuriating Republican leaders. In 1994, the Mayor helped President Clinton sell his crime bill, and he later abandoned his party to support the re-election of Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, as Governor. More recently, he criticized Bob Dole for supporting Republican legislation that would restrict aid to immigrants. At the same time, the White House has begun openly courting the Mayor's endorsement of President Clinton's re-election.
Mr. Giuliani is expected to run for re-election next year, and such positions are likely to help him appeal to the city's Democratic voters, who outnumber Republicans more than 4 to 1.
But Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a strong supporter of the welfare bill, said he did not see Mr. Giuliani's intervention in the debate as a political maneuver.
"It's a legitimate expression of concern," Mr. D'Amato said in an interview tonight. "The Mayor is concerned about the economic impact on New York City. I don't believe it's some attempt on his part to bash Republicans. I don't attribute it to any anti-Republican sentiment. If he thinks there will be an adverse impact in some areas, he has a right and an obligation to express his concerns."
New York City could not easily absorb the new costs cited by Mr. Giuliani. A report from the New York State Financial Control Board in March said that "the city's finances continue to deteriorate" despite the city's efforts to close the gap between spending and revenues. Under the city's financial plan for the next four years, the board said, spending is projected to grow about 2 percent a year, but revenues slightly less than 1 percent a year.
The Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington, estimated today that the welfare bill would push 2.6 million people, including 1.1 million children, into poverty.
The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, brushed aside the estimate. "I don't put any credence in that at all," he said. "The best way to help children in poverty is for their parents to have a job." The welfare bill would require most adults to work within two years of receiving welfare.
The Federal welfare bill would impose a virtual ban on food stamps and other Federal benefits for most noncitizens. In his letter, Mr. Giuliani said these restrictions were "unfair to legal permanent residents, who would be denied many benefits which they help to finance through taxes."
In addition, he said, "the city opposes provisions in the House and Senate bills that would limit benefits to deserving disabled children by tightening eligibility requirements."
The Mayor also opposed most of the changes intended to cut the growth of food stamp spending. He said these changes would penalize places like New York, with a high cost of living and high shelter costs.
Mr. Giuliani also criticized a section of the welfare bill that would prevent states from using Federal money to provide vouchers to families who are denied cash benefits because of the five-year limit. President Clinton supports such vouchers as a way to help families buy diapers, clothing, medicine and other items for children.
Senator Lott said today that there was no prospect of such vouchers because the House and the Senate had rejected them. "The voucher plan is a way to get around ending welfare after five years," he said. "It's an escape hatch. And it's just not going to happen."
Mr. Giuliani's letter was sent to members of New York's Congressional delegation and to House and Senate negotiators who are writing the final version of the welfare bill.

HEADLINE: Wooing The Women

BYLINE: By Gail Collins; Gail Collins is a member of the editorial board of The New York Times.

 BODY:
In the small world of political pollsters, the word is out that Linda DiVall is sick, sick, sick of talking about the gender gap. "I may have said that," admitted DiVall, a prominent polling expert and now a senior adviser to the Dole campaign. She's giving a slightly cranky phone interview -- it is, she claims, the first of 26 calls she's supposed to return from reporters who've called to ask why women seem to be abandoning the Republican Party in droves. "As I already told you," she says, sighing in the manner of a teacher who has drilled the same lesson over and over to stubbornly dimwitted pupils, "yes, there is a gender gap. Yes, it is significant. But it can be closed."
The gap is suddenly hot, very hot. It has already been around for nearly a generation, a 5 to 9 percentage point difference between the sexes in the candidates they support for President and a smaller gap in Congressional races. Early in the Clinton-Dole campaign, however, the gap turned epic -- 20 percent or more in some surveys. The Democrats are dying to talk about it. "My favorite subject," says Ann Lewis, a deputy manager of the Clinton re-election campaign. The Dole camp simply directs all questions to DiVall. 
 A century ago, suffrage leaders predicted that when women got the right to vote, they'd vote as a bloc for clean government, peace, temperance and progressive programs to protect children and families from the worst ravages of the Industrial Revolution. "That was the hope and expectation," says Lynn Sherr, a biographer of Susan B. Anthony and an ABC correspondent. Anthony told an interviewer in 1871 that when enfranchised, women "propose to do away with vice and immorality, to prevent the social evil" -- prostitution -- "by giving women remunerative employment, to forbid the sale of spiritous liquors and tobacco, and to teach men a higher and nobler life than the one they now follow."
Politicians, fearing for their lives as suffrage approached, passed a slew of laws on consumer protection, child labor and prenatal care in the early 1920's. But then nothing much happened. Women seemed to vote the same way men did, except in fewer numbers. Interest in women as a voting class vanished, and the prenatal-care program ran out of money.
When I was studying at the University of Massachusetts in 1969, women's political behavior took up a grand total of two paragraphs in our American politics textbook. The author, John H. Fenton, believed that women tended to cluster to the far left and far right, because they had little experience with the real world. "If a man becomes interested in extreme politics, his views are likely to be challenged by both his associates at work and his neighborhood friends," the book said. "Typically, women have a less variegated history of friendship and associations, and when they acquire extreme political views they are less likely to have them challenged by their friends or their experience." Fenton died recently, and I never had a chance to find out how he explained the Michigan Militia.
Studying women's voting behavior was difficult back then. Most researchers were poring over election data, trying to figure out where the Hungarians and Germans and WASP's and Jews lived and to chart the ebbs and flows of their precincts. Women had no special neighborhoods. They were all mixed in with men, difficult to quantify. It was easiest to assume that women voted the same way their husbands did.
Gallup polls did show differences between the sexes in voting in the post-World War II years, but they did not reveal a major difference in the way men and women regarded the political world. Women liked Ike better than male voters, and contrary to all the legends about John Kennedy's sexual charisma, they split, 51-49, for Nixon in 1960, while men voted for Kennedy, 52-48. Women were slightly more favorable to Hubert Humphrey than men in 1968 only because more men voted for the third-party candidate, George Wallace. Four years later, in Nixon's landslide over George McGovern, there was virtually no sex difference in the vote. But if only women had been voting in 1976, Jimmy Carter would have never beaten Gerald Ford.
Flash forward to 1979. The Republican pollster Richard B. Wirthlin, working on the Reagan campaign, peered into a stew of data and discerned an amazing new element floating just beneath the surface: women were pulling away from Ronald Reagan and toward the Democrats, while men were being drawn deeper into the orbit of the Republican Party. "It was one of those things that once you see it, you can't take your eyes off it," says Wirthlin reverently, in the tones of a scientist who has just discovered a new variation of the Ebola virus.
The gender gap had arrived. It was not exactly the mass movement the suffragists promised, but in the hypersensitive world of modern politics, a gap is almost as good as a bloc. Women were going off on their own, requiring special treatment. By 1984, Reagan was running ads on daytime television trying to convince housewives that he had really done something about inflation.
The cause of the gap seems to be remarkably basic. Both Republican and Democratic pollsters agree that women, as a group, believe in an activist government -- particularly the social safety net -- more than men do. "Women are more likely to believe government can work to help solve problems," says DiVall. "It's much more deep-seated than any one partisan election."
None of this, of course, refers to all women all the time. So pollsters slice and dice the statistics to compare the sexes in narrower categories: white independents, married senior citizens, parents of small children. When Wirthlin was helping the Reagan team prepare for the 1984 re-election campaign, he broke women down into 32 different groups and subgroups and gave them female names. "Some of these groups were more strongly Republican than males," he recalls. "Others were 90-10 against the Republicans." Reagan was strongest with Alice (younger, married, working) and weakest with Helen (younger, not married, not working). Middle-aged, nonworking women -- Frances (unmarried) and Evelyn (married) -- were a key target, even though Frances seemed to be a big Mondale backer. "They were very concerned about economic policy and very doubtful that Reagan's programs were working," Wirthlin says. "So we targeted ads and some direct mail to older women." The gap was never completely erased, but women did wind up supporting Reagan over Walter Mondale, 56-44. Men chose Reagan, 62-37.
Unmarried women are more likely to vote Democratic than their married sisters. "The new gap is the marriage gap," says Wirthlin. "Being married overrides male or female." Black voters of both sexes are so overwhelmingly Democratic that pollsters often restrict themselves to comparing different segments of white voters. But beyond that, the analysis of how the pieces of the female voting population shake down are often wildly at variance. Susan J. Carroll of the Center for the American Woman and Politics, at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, did an interesting analysis, beginning with the 1980 election, in which she concluded that women tended to vote more like men if they felt dependent because they did not work or had low-paying jobs. Women with "psychological autonomy," who were unmarried or had high-paying jobs, tended to be much more anti-Reagan than men in comparable positions, she said.
But one of Carroll's conclusions, that women who made good salaries were a big part of the gap, runs counter to Republican polling dogma that holds that those very people are a Republican oasis amid the parched desert of female votes. "The classic prototype of a feminist -- younger, college-educated, working -- was generally more, not less supportive of Reagan," claims Wirthlin.
Linda DiVall, after some protests ("I'm not going to tell you our strategy!"), says the Dole campaign believes women making more than $30,000 a year are promising Republican targets. Meanwhile Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, says the gap between young, college-educated men and women is so vast that she is beginning to worry about who these people are going to marry.
All sorts of things can affect the conclusions a set of polls produce -- the way the results are sliced (when you're looking for a sample of relatively successful, sophisticated female voters, do you pick college graduates, or those making more than $30,000 a year?), the size of the sample and the way the questions are worded. Until just before an election, voters are extremely susceptible to the news of the moment. The excitement of a convention sends a nominee's numbers shooting up for a week or so, even if his long-term popularity is slightly lower than that of head lice.
A fascinating thing about the gender gap is the number of theories it has spawned about who is gapping and why. Among the more interesting:
 
Women Didn't Go Anywhere -- It's the Men Who Took a Hike
 If women are voting for candidates who will protect Medicare, Social Security, aid to education and a safety net for the poor, they're only behaving as both sexes did before the Reagan revolution. Barbara Ehrenreich, the essayist, argued in Newsweek that because of late marriage, single motherhood and the invention of 24-hour sports channels, "men are living in a state of radical disconnection from the women-and-children part of the human race," which still has to worry about caring for elderly parents and finding affordable day care and decent schools.
This theory is popular with people who resent the idea that men should always be regarded as the norm. Nancy Cott, a professor of American Studies at Yale University, complains that when newly enfranchised women started voting like their husbands, no one considered the possibility that "the husbands were voting the way their wives wanted all along."
 
Gender Pride
 Women may have deserted the Republican Party, this theory goes, because it does not seem hospitable to women. "American women need to see other faces of the party to show that there's more diversity," says DiVall. This theory is popular among Republicans (particularly the women), partly because the cure is so simple: nominate more Republican women for races they can win and appoint more Republican women to high-profile government positions.
The G.O.P. has actually made strides on this front, and Dole's team of top advisers certainly contains more women than Clinton's. But the Republicans have to erase a lot of old memories. Who can forget the golden moment in the 1992 Presidential debate when President Bush, trying to prove that he had plenty of key female advisers, pointed to Rose Zamaria, an aide assigned to duties like handing out Presidential souvenirs, and praised her as "about as tough as a boot."
 
It's Abortion, Stupid
 Abortion-rights advocates frequently take credit for the gender gap, but a look at the polls shows that men and women do not really differ on abortion. Men, in fact, turn out to be more supportive of abortion rights in some polls. But abortion, like gun control, is an intensity-of-preference issue: the power resides with the minority of voters who will change candidates over that single question.
Since 1989, when the Supreme Court shifted to a more restrictive stance on abortion, the swing voters have been pro-choice. A study by Debra L. Dodson of the Center for the American Woman and Politics found that among people who voted for George Bush in 1988 but not in 1992, the greatest drop-off came among pro-choice women.
 
The Loudness Factor
 Women are so turned off by any hint of aggression, says Celinda Lake, that they even reject propositions about curing the trade imbalance that lean too hard on the idea of competition, or "beating" the other countries. In other words, women will not vote for men who yell. Loud-candidate rejection would explain the relative shortage of women at Pat Buchanan rallies, the gender gap in the George Wallace campaigns and the fact that women who'd voted for Republican candidates in 1994 started deserting the new Congress as soon as Newt Gingrich began appearing on the evening news. It does not account for women's relative lack of enthusiasm for Reagan and Bush. But it may have been at least partly to blame for Ted Kennedy's gap problem during the Democratic primaries in 1980. One of his former campaign workers says: "He'd go out and scream on the podium, and I'd think, imagine you're a retired woman, having your dinner in front of the TV in your nice quiet house, and you see this out-of-control, red-faced guy yelling. Maybe the gap had as much to do with that as Chappaquiddick."
 
Does Character Count?
 Conventional wisdom has always held that female voters are particularly concerned about the Inner Candidate -- a politician's personality and character. How then to explain their enormous preference for Clinton, a man subject to investigations into his personal finances and political ethics, and dogged by questions about his own past sexual behavior? The answer may be that women are not all that obsessed with character issues, at least when they're choosing a President. Lake has asked voters whether they would rather support a candidate they agree with on the issues but who had character flaws or a candidate with a good character but with whom they disagree. Both sexes chose the candidate they agreed with on the issues, by a wide margin.
 
Rescuing Hillary
 Democrats are beginning to question whether the huge gap they've found between young college-educated women and men may have something to do with the Hillary factor. The non-surprise datum of the polling season: women are more likely than men to feel sympathy for Hillary Clinton. (Experts say neither male nor female voters yet know enough about Elizabeth Dole -- another strong, career-minded woman -- to have much of an opinion.)
Senator Christopher Dodd, the Democratic national chairman, has several nieces whom he has long suspected of being closet Republicans. But one of them, he says, told him she had an epiphany last winter when she saw Hillary Clinton on TV talking to Martha Stewart about holiday decorations. "She said, 'Here's Mrs. Clinton, graduate of Yale Law, one of the hundred best attorneys in America, and she's doing an interview about the gold leaf on a few wreaths.' " His niece, Dodd says, decided Republican Hillary-bashing had gone too far if the First Lady was being relegated to gilding pine cones.
All these theories broadcast the same message: women are nicer. Men will take a flier on deficit reduction, but women worry about the human consequences. Men like guns; women like nuclear disarmament, civilized discourse and Medicare. The gender gap winds up sounding like a battle between good and evil. It's enough to make you wonder why we let men vote. Challenged to make at least one unfavorable comparison between women and men, a Democratic analyst paused. "Women didn't build the country," he said finally.
This is why some folks get nervous over gender-gap spin. It tends to hark back to all the old stereotypes -- women are morally superior, but they're afraid of risk and yearn for protection. Better they should stay home and fret while men forge into the wilderness, taming continents and extending civilization.
"I'm always reluctant to make statements about how if you're in this class, this is the way you vote," says Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute. "Not all women vote and think alike." Indeed, there are black women, unmarried women and college-educated women in this country who are planning to vote a straight Republican ticket this fall, just as there are middle-aged white men who prefer spending on social services to balancing the deficit. The generalizations that are central to the art of polling necessarily rob the population of its flavor and diversity, even when responses are divided into 32 subcategories and given homey names.
But Presidential campaigns are long past the sort of retail politics in which the candidates try to win over voters one by one. They aim their messages at the big targets highlighted by the polls. Support for Clinton among older, single and professional women has been enormous in many polls, so the President's campaign stretched its net in the direction of "married moms," one of the most conservative female voting groups. It was no coincidence that the President spent a great deal of the early campaign talking about curfews, school uniforms and television V-chips.
While the Democrats fantasize about winning every voter with two X chromosomes, the Republicans are counting on the gap, now in the double digits, to narrow considerably before Election Day. They have reason to be hopeful. The gap has never wound up higher than 9 percent in a Presidential election. Voters of both sexes tend to veer away from candidates who look like losers. The gap shrunk in 1984 when women perceived that Mondale's candidacy was going nowhere. When the Dole campaign was in a funk this summer, so many male voters migrated toward Clinton that the gap became negligible in some polls.
The Dole campaign desperately wants to send the message that the party is a place where women can feel comfortable and that its candidate, while opposed to abortion, should not be considered "extreme" on social issues. It's a delicate balancing act, since Republican women in many states have been known to bolt their party when a candidate seems likely to actually do something to restrict abortion access. (Douglas Wilder won a narrow Democratic victory in the 1989 Virginia governor's race thanks to pro-choice Republican women.) Thus Dole's painful struggle to get "tolerance" into the party platform, and his choice of the young, pro-choice Representative Susan Molinari of New York as the convention's keynote speaker.
Little of this gnawing over the gender gap, you will notice, has had much impact on actual government policy. By virtually every account, the most important single factor splitting women from men in the voting booth is women's greater confidence in government's ability to help people and their concern about the reduction in services for the young, old and needy. And ever since the gap first cropped up, the country has been moving away from activist government and the social safety net.
"Ouch," says Ann Lewis of the Clinton re-election campaign, when I suggest that the political response to the gender gap has been mainly cosmetic. "I know women have made a difference. Give me a second to think about this. I'm clutched over in pain." DiVall, meanwhile, says that Dole's campaign can appeal to women by doing "more personalizing." This means talking about his war injuries. Both parties still seem to regard the gap as a marketing problem that can be addressed by buying more advertising time on the Lifetime channel.
The gender gap era is just another stage in the evolution of the female voter that began with the struggle for suffrage. For generations after, politicians believed that to get women's votes, they had only to win over their husbands. Far more humiliating was when powerful campaign strategists thought what female voters wanted was a really cute guy. (Remember Dan Quayle?) Then there were all those campaigns in which Washington was obsessed with the angry white male. Now, women voters have reached a new plateau: They've arrived at the pander zone.

HEADLINE: Designs From the Dutch That Prompt a Smile

BYLINE: By RITA REIF 

 BODY:
Today's designers of furnishings are thumbing their noses at some traditions and embracing others, finding fresh ways of merging high and low technologies. A plastic sack is filled with soil to become a flowerpot; broken bits of pottery are recycled as bowls, and space-age fibers are woven into a hammocklike chair and stiffened with epoxy.
The best of contemporary design is now "less indulgent and flashy than in the 80's," said Paola Antonelli, the curator of design at the Museum of Modern Art. "Examples of these trends can be found all over the world," she said. But, she noted, in recent years a group of designers from the Netherlands has achieved results that merit particular attention. 
 To illustrate the point, Ms. Antonelli chose 36 colorful objects that were produced in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Voorburg over the last 10 years for "Thresholds: Contemporary Design From the Netherlands," an exhibition at the Modern through Nov. 5.
Not since Gerrit Rietveld designed his slab-back red-blue chair in 1918 has the Netherlands seen such innovations in design. Emulating Rietveld, his successors are using traditional craft methods to devise unconventional products.
Each piece in the show is characterized by an economical use of materials, a simplicity of form and an awareness of the environment. Several works are also witty, a quality absent in furnishings since the Italians began to dominate the design scene in the 1960's and early 70's.
In one case, trash is turned into trash baskets. For these works, discarded billboard posters are refashioned into what look like giant-size supermarket bags with bold graphic images. The designer, Jos van der Meulen, sewed the posters together so they could be flattened for shipping. Ms. Antonelli describes the resulting "Paper Bags" as an "ingenious example of the reuse of wasted materials."
To Dutch designers today, recycling and thrift are basic tenets of their unwritten professional code, and they consider ethics as important as esthetics, especially as they pertain to the environment. There is also a noticeable absence of bombast and ego in what they produce. In fact, some pieces look as if they were made for people with little money to spend on such objects. (It's an illusion, of course, considering the complexities of manufacturing these objects and the high prices asked for them. A plastic knob made to hang on a wall as a coat hook, for instance, costs $78.)
"It's as if designers never felt the need to mark their work with a personal signature," Ms. Antonelli said. "These products are so understated it's unbelievable. Of course, understatement is natural to Northern Europeans. But there's wit in these objects too, even though the Dutch seem so serious."
Take, for example, Henk Stallinga's flower holder made of a large kitchen sponge. The stems of the flowers are stuck into the top of the sponge, which is sealed on the bottom with polyurethane. Once the sponge is filled with water, the "vase" remains upright.
For his Blister lamps, Mr. Stallinga borrowed an idea from the world of packaging for a lighting fixture. He used the concept of snap-together clear-plastic packaging like that in which toothbrushes are sold to produce a string of lamps, each with a tapered round shade on a spherical base and a red bulb. The basic design is a cliche in lighting, but in this reincarnation it seems delightfully fresh.

THE MATERIALS USED IN most of the objects in the show are more experimental than the forms. Unlike the designers of the 80's, who seemed preoccupied with prettiness and self-conscious zaniness, today's innovators seem inspired by necessity rather than whim, even when the newness of their designs is sometimes literally skin deep. For example, the blackboard paint used by Djoke de Jong to create the slatelike surface on a Parsons-style table transforms this familiar-looking table into one you think you are seeing for the first time, especially when covered with a child's chalk drawings.
"Most of these works are formally austere but are made playful by their use," Ms. Antonelli said.
Two glass objects designed by Arnout Visser look as if they should be found in a laboratory. His bottle for salad dressing takes advantage of the fact that oil and vinegar do not mix. It has a spout on either side, one for oil at the top, the other for vinegar at the base. Each liquid is poured without disturbing the other.
Mr. Visser's Archimedes Letter Scale, adapts an ancient Greek principle of physics. A graduated cylinder of Pyrex floats in a liquid inside a larger cylinder. When a letter is placed on top of the floating cylinder, the cylinder is pushed down, registering the weight of the letter.
Sophistication rendered simply is the forte of the Dutch designers. "Their objects' apparent modesty has made them emblematic of what political correctness in design should be," Ms. Antonelli said.

HEADLINE: Habitats/79th Street and First Avenue;
To an Architect, 1 Plus 1 Equals 3

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
WILLIAM M. BERNSTEIN wanted to psych out the real estate market, and he thought he had a smart way to do it.
"It seemed clear that the smaller apartments in New York City were not considered that desirable," he said, "and I figured that by putting two one-bedrooms together I could make a three-bedroom for a fraction of the price of just going out and buying an existing three-bedroom." 
 Mr. Bernstein knew that when he and his wife, Julia, had started looking to buy apartments a few years ago -- squeezed out of their one-bedroom rental -- small apartments were the dregs of the real estate market. He had not only read about it, he had gut-wrenching personal experience.
"I knew -- I'd bought a studio in 1986 and tried to sell it in the depth of the recession," he said ruefully. "I'd renovated it myself, and the whole thing was probably the worst financial decision I'll ever make." He hesitated. "At least I hope it's the worst financial decision I'll ever make."
He looked around his new three-bedroom apartment, his dream -- created by merging two one-bedroom apartments in a postwar building on 79th Street near First Avenue on the Upper East Side. He and his wife and their 2-year-old son, Sam, had moved in only the day before.
Mr. Bernstein, who heads a five-person architectural office, had prepared spread sheets for every number, every detail of the apartment reconstruction. ("I took two semesters of real estate finance," he said, jokingly, as he unveiled his accordion-folded sheets of graph paper, full of minuscule notations.)
But finding two apartments that could be combined -- without creating a monster of long hallways and awkward rooms -- was almost impossible, and Mr. Bernstein cautioned that, like experiments with explosive substances, combining apartments is not a game for amateurs.
"I heard of one job where the owners combined two apartments to make a four-bedroom -- but the master bedroom ended up without a window," he said with a shudder.
Yet even Mr. Bernstein, with his Yale architectural degree and his myriad contacts with general contractors, had a rough time finding something that would work.
From his bulging manila folder -- the record of his search -- he pulled out a stack of floor plans and agents' notations. He found a ruler in a drawer: The stack was an inch and a half thick. "I saw over 100 apartments," he said.
At first, the Bernsteins tried picking the possible combinations out of the newspaper classified advertisements. "We'd see two apartments advertised next to each other and we thought we'd just waltz in and buy them," he said, pausing. "We wasted a couple of Sundays that way."
THEY rethought their strategy. "So then we thought we'd take a flyer and just look at one-bedrooms and stick a note under the next-door neighbor's apartments, not mentioning the one we'd just looked at, saying we might be interested in buying their apartment," he said. "No one ever called us back."
They then tried calling brokers, but they found that most of the brokers shied away after hearing their requirements: doorman building, Upper East Side, high floors with views, low maintenance -- and the kicker: Both apartments for a total of less than $400,000.
"In our price range, we used to joke that our priority was 'west of the river,' " he said, mocking the real estate advertisements for blue chip apartments that read "between Fifth and Madison" or "west of Third Avenue." "We never got much beyond First Avenue."
As for finding possible combinations in prewar buildings, "we just looked at them from the sidewalk," Mr. Bernstein said. "We were pretty much stuck with postwars."
The search seemed interminable.
"When I filled up the book, I knew I was in trouble," said Mr. Bernstein, looking at his thick ring binder. At one point, they hired an appraiser to investigate the financial ramifications of buying the apartment above the one-bedroom apartment they were renting on East 74th Street, which might have been purchased from the owner, although itwasn't actually on the market.
But the maintenance payments were high, and, with what the sellers above were asking, they decided it wasn't worth it. Mr. Bernstein and his wife thought about giving up their search, but they already had their son, and they thought things would get even worse.
"It really struck us that the people in all those one-bedrooms were mirror images of ourselves," said Mrs. Bernstein. "They were people who were stuck; people who had one, or even two, children, who couldn't sell their one-bedrooms for anything like what they'd paid. I felt bad for them."
The worst scenario, she explained, was when the apartment was what agents call a convertible two-bedroom. "They'd converted the dining el to the child's bedroom and sometimes there was a baby-sitter, too, and it was all so crowded."
Nevertheless, Mrs. Bernstein, who supervises the production of women's clothes for a catalogue company, wryly retold how they tried to be secretive about their intentions to combine two apartments -- fearing that if they betrayed their concept, both owners would get together and raise their prices.
"It was a riot," she said. "Sometimes we'd look at one apartment and then there was a whole charade -- like we'd have to go back downstairs and wait 10 minutes and then come up again and make lots of noise to show we were just coming up for the first time."
When a real estate agent sent them floor plans for two apartments on 79th Street in a postwar building near First Avenue, "we thought they had the makings of the thing," said the architect. "And we were also desperate; the co-op board where we were renting had told the owners no more renting."
Using only the floor plans -- before they even visited the apartments -- Mr. Bernstein came up with a design.
"There was a very unpleasant woman in one of the apartments, a tenant," recalled Mrs. Bernstein, "and after we had visited she told the owner she was sure we weren't going to buy it, because I just walked in and out -- a sure sign of failure.
"But when we came in, we already knew we were taking it -- we just had to look around to see the light and stuff," she said. "I didn't have to look at the kitchen because I knew we were ripping it out."
Eventually, after they negotiated prices for the two apartments, they had to come out in the open; they had to make sure the co-op board would allow them to combine the apartments. They had put a contingency in the contracts that if the board did not allow the combination they could withdraw. The board agreed to their plans.
At the end of negotiating they paid $308,500 for the two one-bedroom apartments, and closed on May 6.
They moved in July 15, after doing $50,000 worth of work -- a figure Mr. Bernstein warned is misleading.
"I think it would have been 50 percent more if a person without experience went to a general contractor," he said.
By working out a deal by which the contractor acted as construction manager -- for a flat fee, with time and materials for the work added on -- Mr. Bernstein said, he achieved big savings. "I assumed all risk," he said. "The general contractor usually does that. I was comfortable with that, but I wouldn't recommend it to others."
WITH this system, the architect explained, it was easier to change things as the job went along.
"There's always lots of unforeseen things on a job -- that column wasn't supposed to be there," he said, gesturing toward a white column on one side of the kitchen opening. "But we found a floor-to-ceiling gas pipe, so we had to cover it up.
"With unexpected things, the general contractors on bid jobs tend to really whack you for changes," he said. "Then you say: 'That sounds like a lot of money for a little change,' and it can turn into a nasty wrangle. But because of working with time and materials -- and a flat fee for managing the whole job, including the changes -- we never really had to discuss the price of the changes."
The apartment is almost done. Only a few details in the kitchen are left: the trim for the front of the $2,900 (contractor's price) SubZero refrigerator, and some shelves Mr. Bernstein is designing for a spot against the wall above the granite-topped kitchen peninsula that separates the cooking area from the dining room.
And after living for several years with their son in a one-bedroom apartment, the new place seems luxurious beyond belief.
"Last night, Sam was in his bedroom and my mother, who's staying with us, was in her bedroom," said Mrs. Bernstein. "My husband was drafting in his office in the passageway and I was sitting in the living room." She paused.
"And we still had one whole bedroom with nobody in it."

HEADLINE: A Phantom Hall Filled With Discord

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IT FLOATS ABOVE DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES, a mirage in the California sun. For Walt Disney, it offers remembrance with dignity; for Frank Gehry, a hometown monument to an architect's career. For the Los Angeles Philharmonic, it is an emblem of long-sought international eminence. For local politicians, it sings a siren song to far-flung Angelenos, drawing them inward to the troubled center of this exploding universe of a city.
It is the Walt Disney Concert Hall; that is, it would be if someone built it. Primed by an extravagant gift from Disney's widow nine years ago and originally expected to be well along in construction by now and to open next summer, Disney Hall is still a glorified hole in the ground, its assets-in-hand slowly bled away by mismanagement and delay, its original cost estimates nearly tripled. If the finances are not assured within one year, the hall will not be built at all. 
 Mr. Gehry's distinctive design has become both Holy Grail and albatross for the various players in the Disney Hall affair. A dangerous drain on money and civic confidence, it nevertheless holds up the seductive promise of a magical, magnetic cultural palace attractive not only to residents of Orange County but to the entire world. This is a quest not for just any symphony hall but for a particular one. A generic shoebox of a concert space would long since have been built.
If Disney Hall ever sets down to earth, there is a place waiting for it. The County of Los Angeles, which owns the land, has done its part by digging the subterranean garage on which Mr. Gehry's delicately designed structure is supposed to fit. This hole, capped like an oil well, sits across the street from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the orchestra's current home, which it shares with opera, ballet and, in spring, the Oscar ceremonies. For the moment, the parking garage looks like a low-slung warehouse, elegantly white. It is open for business, but business is reportedly sparse.
Hearts are being broken. Lillian Disney, who is said to be 97 years old, has seen no return on her generosity. Of the family's gifts, totaling $78 million (now more than $100 million with accumulated interest), $41 million has already been spent on "soft costs": architects' fees, drawings and specifications, lawyers, consultants. An accepted rule of thumb estimates soft costs of a construction project at 25 percent to 30 percent of hard, or actual building, costs. Here they have at times approached twice that.
Ernest Fleischmann, the Philharmonic's wily and intrepid managing director for 27 years, will retire from his job next year, and Disney Hall would have left behind even more for Los Angeles to remember him by. Mr. Fleischmann, a vigorous 71, expresses absolute certainty that the hall will be built, but it will not be easy.
Downtown Los Angeles needs saving, and Disney Hall, according to county planners, is to be among its saviors. The city center's cluster of tall buildings, set incongruously amid this vast grid of streets and boulevards, is busy by day but, given corporate mergers and suburban flight, not busy enough. The several hotels in the neighborhood do not appear full. Concert, opera, dance and theater audiences at the Music Center have few if any restaurants, cafes or safe promenades to tempt them on their way to their parking spaces. Spago is not far away, by car.
"Los Angeles was laid out in crossing boulevards and streets," said Mr. Gehry in his Santa Monica offices recently. "It was one of the first linear cities in existence, and Wilshire Boulevard stretched across it like connective tissue. But the city fathers thought every American city ought to have a downtown, so they turned their backs on Wilshire Boulevard and the linear city."
Irrelevant or not, downtown Los Angeles is there, looming out of the haze. So if Disney Hall is built, will people come and fill it? Despite local groanings, the network of Los Angeles freeways works remarkably well, yet the distances, and the travel times, are daunting. Can a nighttime downtown Los Angeles, no matter how brilliantly accoutered, seduce any more of what is largely an early-to-bed and early-to-rise work culture?
Optimists say yes, adding the hope that a less pressured Chandler Pavilion can become a center for the city's flourishing Pacific Rim cultures: Korean and Vietnamese theaters, for example. Whether Asian communities will actually get in their cars at night and pay the $7 evening parking fees is more fodder for debate.
Originally estimated at up to $100 million, Disney Hall's costs, according to the consulting firm brought in to clean up the current mess, will come to $264 million. (The $81 million parking garage was financed separately by a county bond issue.) The new completion date is 2001. But there is a catch. The project is $150 million short, and county officials, mixing hope with exasperation, have set a deadline for the raising of a major gift: $50 million or more, as a tangible demonstration that this hall can be paid for. If such a gift is not forthcoming by June 1997, Disney Hall will be dumped.
How did it happen? Mr. Gehry's design is a wonder. The interior curves like a boat: the orchestra settled in the prow, listeners seated all around, the ceiling undulating downward like blooming spinakers. To the sides of this boat are rectangular structures, housing everything patrons and performers will need. Around the design exterior walls bend, twist and swirl. Mrs. Disney is a gardener, and at her request, greenery and flowers will be everywhere. Disney Hall has been described flatteringly as a rose about to open and disparagingly as a collection of hatboxes sagging in the rain.

G IVEN AN ORIGINAL MANagement team that supposedly possessed experience, enthusiasm and political connections, Disney Hall went very wrong. One hears many explanations, often in the form of vague accusation, and one believes parts of all of them. Mea culpa is a phrase rarely come across in the brief annals of Disney Hall.
Mr. Gehry's firm, considerably smaller at the end of the 1980's than it is now, farmed out the architectural drawings to someone else. Mr. Gehry says the drawings "don't work" and will have to be done again (by Mr. Gehry's expanded forces and at a cost of $10 million). Harry L. Hufford, chief executive officer of the new management team, says the drawings work but are "incomplete." Dworsky Associates, who did the work, said, "The money wasn't there to do what was designed." Dworsky allies say privately that Gehry's work was confusing. Everyone agrees the drawings took much longer than anyone anticipated.
The county added to the confusion by attaching a hotel to the plan. New-found visitors to downtown would patronize it; visiting artists would travel from hotel room to dressing room in a single elevator ride. Designs were made to accommodate the hotel. (Mr. Gehry was enthusiastic, more so than the Disney family, which feared a clouding of the issue.) But when international hotel chains lost interest, the designs had to be undone and redone.
No one currently involved with Disney Hall wants to name names, but the original team does not seem to have done a very good job. Reins were loose. New managers hint at a prior preoccupation with self-protection. "The biggest mistake I made was not getting out of this thing a few years back," said Mr. Gehry, who is worried about Disney Hall's influence on his reputation and his future business. "I saw what was happening. I wrote letters of warning, but nothing happened."
Mr. Gehry points assertively to the branch of the Guggenheim Museum he is currently building in Bilbao, Spain. The design is similar to Disney Hall's, and Mr. Gehry says that despite distance and language barriers, the $100 million project is on budget and on schedule.
Los Angeles still bursts with money old and new. A number of film executives or local patriarchs could write out the requisite check for Disney Hall without a tremor. After taking hits from bank mergers and a post-cold-war malaise in the defense industry, Southern California's economy is picking up. Film and recording businesses here generate huge incomes from all over the world. The incidence of staggeringly expensive cars on Los Angeles freeways is staggering in itself.
But Disney Hall fund-raisers find themselves on a precarious ledge. For if Mrs. Disney's generosity goes unrequited, who among Southern California's philanthropists will be eager to give to the arts again? Asked whether Disney Hall is going beyond the Los Angeles community to get its money, Mr. Fleischmann will say only that the question is very delicate. Mayor Richard J. Riordan is an enthusiastic champion.
Disney Hall remains a tough sell, even though it is generally understood that a big gift will put the giver's name up in limestone. (The Disney name is, of course, not negotiable, but one possibility might be "The Walt Disney Concert Hall at the [blank] Symphony Center.")
General trends in giving run nowadays toward medical and social problems. In old Los Angeles, as in other American cities, culture was the purview and responsibility of an elite. Deficits at the symphony or opera were handled by a few personal checks. But the white, Anglo-Saxon and heavily moneyed class is dispersing in southern California, and the film community, heavily Jewish, was never readily invited into this cultural world. Today Disney Hall could use some of that Hollywood money, but Hollywood, a more or less self-contained community, seems uninterested in venturing where it was once made to feel unwelcome.

M R. FLEISCHMANN points out the city's lack of corporate headquarters, the favorite fishing grounds for arts organizations in Chicago, Pittsburgh or Detroit. As they immigrate farther into suburban southern California, people with money are making new artistic allegiances with performing-arts centers closer to home: the Thousand Oaks and the Cerritos Centers, the huge Orange County Performing Arts Center.
"Los Angeles is an entrepreneurial city," said Emily Laskin, who handles development for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. "People come here to develop a project, and then they leave. There are fewer fixed institutions, which is why many move here in the first place, to escape institutions. I worked in Minneapolis, and even those with modest incomes donated to the arts. They did it out of civic responsibility."
Disney Hall was in a hurry from the start, and that has been part of the problem. Though all parties agree that the Disney family has been unflaggingly supportive and patient, inescapable was the understanding that a generous patron, well along in years, wanted (and deserved) to see something in return. Disney Hall began on a fast-track basis; that is, plans went ahead without all the final details worked out. Mr. Gehry says fast-tracking is common practice, but Mr. Fleischmann, among others, regrets the lack of a specific budget.
Mr. Gehry says his original designs were scrupulously cost-effective, and subsequent studies indicate that the Disney project compares favorably to another troubled but now completed concert hall, the Meyerson, in Dallas.
There were other false starts: a downward revision with Mr. Gehry's proposed chamber-music hall excised; the replacement of the original limestone exteriors with more modest metal sheathing. There was the hotel idea, and legal fees have kept piling up. Each year Disney Hall is delayed means an additional $9 million.
The big trouble arrived two years ago, when construction bids came in. They were unexpectedly high, said Mr. Fleischmann. Feasibility studies were ordered from outside consultants (Hines Interests); professional fund-raisers (Milano, Ruff and Associates) were hired, and a new board was assembled to pull Disney Hall together. Mr. Gehry points out wryly that he is the only surviving member of the original team.
Does the Los Angeles Philharmonic really need a new orchestra hall? It would help. The Chandler is multipurpose, acoustically mushy, sedate and a little gloomy. Not much used in summer these days, it presents hectic competitions for space between orchestra, opera and other functions during high season.
"Large amounts of money are paid stagehands to take down and put up opera sets in a matter of hours so that the stage can be cleared for other things," said Mr. Fleischmann. "In that respect, the new hall saves money." More high-priced donor boxes have been allowed for, meaning added income for the orchestra.
The prospect of Disney Hall, furthermore, is a lure and an anchor for the orchestra's young, energetic music director, Esa-Pekka Salonen. Whether its failure would prompt Mr. Salonen to move on is unknown. He has, however, signed on until 2001, when the new hall is now scheduled to be completed.
Lev Yaroslavsky, a county supervisor, ticks off the usual reasons for building Disney Hall: the new restaurants, shops, hotels and cafes; the new jobs they will generate; in general, the reseeding of downtown Los Angeles for future growth. But Mr. Yaroslavsky, blunt and burly politician that he is, dreams the dream everyone else connected with this project continues to dream.
"One hundred years from now, if Disney Hall is still standing and even if the demographics here have changed, it will survive as a landmark, as an important expression of a community," he said. "The Gehry design is something unique, something very California. Is it necessary? William Mulholland, who designed the water system for Los Angeles, once said, 'If you don't bring the water, they won't need it.' Here it's the same. If they build this hall, it will become a destination point, a reason people go somewhere, like the Sydney opera house in Australia."

A ND WHAT IF THE BIG GIFT is not forthcoming by next June? Will the county grant more time? "I'm not in a position to say if an extension will be possible," Mr. Yaroslavsky said, "but if there is to be a major gift, we ought to know it in a year."
Meanwhile, don't underestimate the power of a monument. And Disney Hall promises a multipurpose monument to much and many: to Walt Disney, who posthumously will have paid for much of it; to Frank Gehry, who designed it, and Ernest Fleischmann, who imagined it, and to the people of Los Angeles, grasping for firm ground in this seductive, restless urban space.
"Maybe this hall is already obsolete," Mr. Gehry said in a moment of apparent whimsy. "Maybe I should start all over."

The Pleasure Police
How Bluenose Busybodies and Lily-Livered Alarmists Are Taking All the Fun Out of Life.
By David Shaw.
307 pp. New York:
Doubleday. $23. 
 IN "The Pleasure Police," David Shaw updates what Michel Foucault called "the repressive hypothesis." The latest version of that old story, told by conventional wisdom, goes something like this: After the sexual repression of the 1950's, still bound by postwar morality, the 60's accomplished a cultural revolution, which proclaimed the rights and liberated the prerogatives of pleasure. "If it feels good, do it!" was the moral imperative at Woodstock, but since the advent of Jimmy Carter, the nation has been swept by a counterrevolution. Now the rule is: "If it feels good, it must be risky and bad, immoral and dangerous to your health."
This cyclical movement of repression and return of the repressed has brought us back to the point where all fun is barred. David Shaw thinks that the pendulum has swung too far. He advocates a more tolerant, more moderate attitude toward pleasure, and toward sexual behavior in general. But however welcome his moderation, it risks ignoring what was invasive in the 60's revolution and much that is interesting -- complex, intensifying -- in the current climate of alarm and disapproval.
Mr. Shaw, the media critic of The Los Angeles Times, has read everything; surveying the field (including my own work), he persuasively argues, and abundantly illustrates, that the pleasure police, with their dire threats and condemnations, have insinuated themselves into every aspect of our lives. A new complicity has grown up between the religious Ayatollahs on the right and the sanctimonious alarmists on the left, united in their common determination to make everything we touch or ingest illegal, immoral or fattening. In chapters devoted to eating and drinking, smoking and making love, Mr. Shaw documents the excessive prudery and exaggerated warnings that have come to surround our every indulgence. In American culture, all universal sources of pleasure are eventually medicalized, then politicized and finally policed (if not prohibited): witness alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, fat, pornography, masturbation, perfume. Mr. Shaw aptly quotes H. L. Mencken's eternal definition of puritanism as "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy." All our most intimate spheres of solace and release are exposed to the prurient curiosity of those who cannot themselves enjoy, because of the envy they feel. We Americans, with our Puritan ancestors, are different from, say, the French, who are too busy passionately pursuing their own pleasure to worry much about other people's.
Mr. Shaw illuminates the strange contradiction that afflicts our society. At a time when Americans are living longer, with a generally improved standard of living, we have become excessively alarmed by the negligible and spurious risks in everything, frightened by the most peripheral and hypothetical problems. The media sell fear and anxiety to the middle class, grossly overplaying risks, overemphasizing the hazards of life. Obesity, for example, is treated like an epidemic, and now dieting is a $40 billion industry and eating disorders abound: already the fattest nation in the world, we are rapidly getting fatter.
Mr. Shaw's book belongs to a recent trend deploring the long season of whining about the somber state of American life; he suggests that it's perhaps some guilt over our very success that makes us susceptible to being told that "everything we eat, breathe, touch or see might hurt us." He defends those who take it as a sort of moral obligation to enjoy life, to partake exuberantly in the pleasures of our God-given bodies. "Don't people realize," Mr. Shaw quotes a sociologist friend, "every scientific study shows that the single best thing you can do for your health is have fun?"
But Mr. Shaw himself is no hedonist. Systematically, he deplores the excesses of the 60's and approves the new morality, up to the point where it crosses over into an anhedonic intolerance. One may wonder what gives Mr. Shaw the authority he exercises so confidently to set the margin between extremes, the limits of what is permissible pleasure and responsible behavior. He himself attributes his moderate view to Jewish culture. Although not a religious Jew, he aspires to embody Judaism's balance, its "stern discipline of moral restraints," its avoidance of "excessive prudery or asceticism." In its secular form, it is the morality of connoisseurship. In this highly personal account, Mr. Shaw tells us that he himself has only a few pleasures: food, wine, monogamy and an occasional cigar. But he surrounds each of them with a vast, meticulous economy of pleasure and a collector's attention to tiny detail. Under his pen, the details often acquire extravagantly refined proportions in discussions, say, of his beloved panatelas or the charms of his second wife.
Neither prudish nor ascetic, he has an immense, romantic enthusiasm for these things -- but only for these; hardly any other sort of pleasure interests him. His indifference seems at times smug and barely credible, at times perverse and a little alarming. Except for wine, he doesn't drink, not Scotch, not bourbon, beer or brandy; he's been drunk only once. He loves a good cigar, but wishes cigarette smoking would drop to zero. He doesn't drink coffee. He tried pot and didn't like it. He doesn't like skiing, surfing, gambling, golf, bowling, gardening, roller coasters, horror movies, opera, ballet, jazz, science fiction, risky sports or violence on television. He doesn't approve of adultery or fornication; he's had his orgies, but prefers sex with connection. He's personally disgusted by some pornography, and doesn't find the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders sexy.
Unless a pleasure has become the object of connoisseurship, Mr. Shaw isn't interested; he enjoys only when he places between himself and the focus of his desire the little distance of knowing appreciation. It is as if he took all his pleasure under glass, under the injunction of a prescribed ceremony accompanied by the grateful blessings the connoisseur mutters before and after indulging his appetite. Mr. Shaw's obsessive moderation, his relentless taste for good taste, is no chopped liver. But it misses out on both the sublime hysteria of abstinence, celibacy and self-abnegation, and the pagan perversity of chaotic pleasures -- sudden, uncontrollable, disruptive -- that are nasty, down and dirty.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/'Cuomo Tax' Repeal;
Developers Praise End of Property-Transfer Surtax

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
MORE deals are going to be done and New York will again be an attractive place to invest capital, real estate professionals say, as a result of the recent repeal of the 10 percent surtax on capital gains on property transfers of over $1 million. The repeal came as part of the state's most recent budget act, which was signed by Gov. George E. Pataki on July 13.
The levy, known almost universally as the "Cuomo tax," was imposed by former Gov. MarioCuomo and the Legislature in 1983 at a time when the real estate market was hot and seemed like a good source of funds to balance a budget. During the good times it brought in more money than expected, making it harder for state officials to relinquish, although revenues have dropped sharply in recent years. 
 But since then the market has gone through a deep slump, one that those active in it say was aggravated by the tax, which was unique to New York State.
"It was a disaster, because it discouraged transactions," said William Lie Zeckendorf, the president of Zeckendorf Realty. "Transactions are important to a healthy real estate market because new buyers invest in properties. And the tax discouraged outside investors by telling them they had to pay a 10 percent exit tax."
Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer Properties, which recently took over management of Rockefeller Center, said he believed "that from the first day this tax was discussed, it had a negative impact on commercial real estate."
"It made people think twice about deals," he said, "and they did not get done."
Mr. Speyer said that the tax did not affect his organization, because it sold no property in New York while the tax was in effect. Instead, he said, his objection was that the tax drained capital from the industry by reducing profits.
Mr. Cuomo did not respond to a request for comment on the tax and its effects.
With the repeal, many in the real estate business expect sales to increase, and for the city to be more attractive in general to outside investors. Although the tax applied statewide, most of the funds raised came from the city.
"The number of transactions will increase, no doubt about it," said Bruce Mosler, president of the Galbreath Company. "Better yet, it improves New York's competitive position with other cities. Now it looks like a lot better place to park capital."
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said the board had commissioned a study by the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting company, "that predicts an increase of 8.5 percent in activity in the industry without the tax."
"I personally think it will be more," Mr. Spinola said. "There are a lot of properties ready to go to market."
INDUSTRY participants said that in addition to discouraging transactions, the tax distorted the economics of the industry as the deals that did happen were structured to avoid its effects. Rather than making an outright sale, owners would take their profits out of a project by loading their properties with debt.
"You had instances where there were owners who would have loved to have sold, but could not because of the tax consequences," said Darcy Stacom, a senior director at Cushman and Wakefield. "Instead they cashed out by refinancing and putting big mortgages on their buildings."
But that just postponed the problem without solving it. If a long-held property that was purchased for $10 million many years ago rose to a value of $100 million in the mid-1980's, an owner could have probably got a mortgage for $80 million, real estate executives said. If it declined to $80 million and was sold, the owner would have no cash after paying the mortgage. Although the owner would have no cash from this transaction, the state would still calculate the gain as $70 million, and assess a $7 million tax.
The problem was particularly acute for family companies that own property for long periods of time and might be faced with issues of estate planning and other issues related to the operation of closely-held companies, even though a substantial part of the supposed increase in value was the result of inflation. Now that the tax has been repealed, industry officials said they expect some long-held properties, possibly including some controlled by the ailing Harry Helmsley, to come on to the market.
Loading up with debt was all right during the boom days of the 1980's, but it made it hard to meet mortgage payments when the crash came in 1990 and 1991 and rental rates tumbled. "Most of the transactions during that period were foreclosures," said Richard B. Baxter, a senior managing director at the Edward S. Gordon Company. "But you still had to file with the state and everything was delayed 30 to 40 days as the state did the processing."
Although the $1 million threshold for the tax was intended to exempt personal housing, sometimes it got in the way there too, brokers say. "Say you own a town house worth $1.075 million," said Howard Dolch, a broker at the Lansco Corporation. "If you pay 10 percent, you net $967,500. That's why you saw a lot of small buildings sold for $999,999. It was better than $1.1 million."
Similarly, the closing on a piece of property on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, now the site of a parking lot, was delayed until it became clear that exemption from the tax would be effective as of June 15. "They closed on July 11, the bill was signed on July 13 and the seller saved the Cuomo tax," said Mr. Baxter.
The 35,000-square-foot property was sold by Lennar NE Partners of Atlanta to Jack Resnick & Sons for $17 million. The Resnick organization plans to build a residential structure on the site.
The tax also had the probably unintended effect of greatly complicating corporate transfers of control where real estate was a major asset. "When you did a takeover, you had to go through a company and value every property to file the Cuomo tax," said Andrew J. Weiner, head of the East Coast real estate practice of the law firm Morrison & Foerster.
"It was a real headache in M&A and LBO circles," he said, referring to mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts. "It meant that property in New York was less valuable than property located elsewhere, and we believe it had a negative impact on corporate siting decisions."
During the boom days the tax was a real money raiser for the state, with peak revenues of $792 million in the 1987 fiscal year. But as boom turned into bust and deals were put together to avoid the tax, revenues declined.
Mr. Spinola of the Real Estate Board said the WEFA study showed that by suppressing purchases and sales the tax was actually raising less money than it appeared. The state's projections, he said, were for revenue of $80 million from the tax this year. "But," he said, "if you have an increase in activity of 8.5 percent, the loss to the state is only $17 million because other types of revenues are generated. Meanwhile, New York City gets $200 million in new revenues from transfer taxes and other things related to growth."
If developers and brokers were unhappy with the tax, the manner in which it was calculated and collected drove them to fury. "It never was a 10 percent tax, it was closer to 30 percent," Mr. Zeckendorf said. "The calculations were arbitrary and you could spend months in audits."
UNDER the law, builders and converters were not allowed to deduct the soft, but very real, costs of development. These include interest on site acquisition loans, marketing and advertising expenses, brokerage commissions for leasing, the cost of carrying unsold space after construction and tenant relocation costs.
"You could lose money on a property and still end up owing tax," said Steven H. Shepsman, managing partner of E&Y Kenneth Leventhal Real Estate Group. "You could run huge losses for years, but if you sold for more than you paid it counted as a gain. It was an ill-conceived idea made worse by regulations that were not well thought out."
A big part of the problem, Mr. Spinola said, "was that the definition of a gain was always in dispute." And, as the level of transactions dropped off, the state began to rigorously audit projects in search of undisclosed gains.
"Of the $80 million in projected revenue, 25 percent of that was to have come from audits of projects that have already closed," Mr. Spinola said. "Even now there will probably be more audits."
"That tax had hefty fines and penalties, and the state was actually budgeting the fine and penalties they expected to collect," Mr. Weiner said. But Mr. Zeckendorf thinks it was a futile effort. "By the end, it looks as if they were spending more on audit than they were collecting," he said.

HEADLINE: ARTS FESTIVALS;
A Failed Effort? Says Who?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As one who is active in support of Lincoln Center, its constituent organizations and their activities, and as chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center, I'm always delighted with favorable references to what Lincoln Center does and hopes to do. Nancy Malitz's article "Trying to Reinvent Summer in the City" [July 14] gives good reasons for what many of us hope and expect: a worthwhile and successful Lincoln Center Festival '96.
But regrettably Ms. Malitz refers to citywide festivals in 1988 and 1991 under the auspices of the New York International Festival of the Arts as a "failed effort." 
 Says who? A former employee of the New York International Festival of the Arts who did not serve in any capacity in the 1988 festival, made no constructive contributions to the 1991 festival and left long before final programs were in place?
The facts are these.
The International Festival of the Arts was designed to promote the city's pre-eminence and strengths as a center for the arts, to stimulate good will among participating countries and to bolster the economy of the city.
The two festivals featured some 500 events, with more than 6,000 performers at more than 60 locations in all 5 boroughs. Many of the events were free, and the festival provided 15,000 free or subsidized tickets to students, teachers, older people and underprivileged children.
Attendance exceeded 750,000 people, a third of them visitors to the city. These programs pumped more than $200 million into the city's economy and provided some $10 million in local taxes. More than 100 works were either performed for the first time in New York or commissioned by the festival.
Festival offerings received many favorable reviews worldwide (including those of New York Times critics) as well as some ecstatic ones. Naturally, there were criticisms, too, from The Times and others.
Were there some failures among the programs offered? Of course. What organization has only successes?
Did the International Festival of the Arts constitute a failed effort? Of course not. It accomplished all of its major goals and did so without public funds and without deficits.
We welcome constructive criticism. Unfounded allegations should have no place.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Problems About a Terrace
 
Q I live in a penthouse apartment in a rental building in the West Village. The apartment has a 200-square-foot terrace that runs along the front of it. It is one of the best features of the apartment. For the last three months I have had limited use of my terrace because the rental company is redoing the roof of the building and the terraces of all the penthouse apartments. All my patio furniture has been removed and I have not been able to plant a flower garden as I have in past years. Do I have the right to the return of any of my rent due to loss of use? . . . Kevin McCarthy, Manhattan.
 
 A Peter Schwartz, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant matters, said that the answer depends on whether the inability to use the terrace amounts to a decrease in services or a breach of the warranty of habitability on the part of the landlord. 
 If the apartment is rent-regulated, Mr. Schwartz said, the tenant may have a claim for a rent reduction as the result of a decrease in services. To make such a claim, he said, the tenant would have to file a complaint with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The division would then inspect the property, notify the landlord of its findings and give him an opportunity to respond.
Under the circumstances, Mr. Schwartz said, it is possible that the agency could determine that the situation is only temporary or the result of a necessity to make other repairs and would not warrant a rent reduction.
If the apartment is not rent-regulated, Mr. Schwartz said, the tenant would have to file a claim in Housing Court based upon a breach of the warranty of habitability. The claim, if successful, could result in a rent reduction.
"But if the owner is making capital improvements or conducting preventive maintenance," Mr. Schwartz said, "it would appear that the warranty of habitability is not being breached."
 
Security Issues In a Co-op
 
Q I recently moved into a four-unit co-op in Brooklyn. My upstairs neighbor on the top floor has no security gates or bars on her windows, making entry into the building possible from the roof. I've been told that there has been an intruder in the past and that my neighbor refuses to cooperate and get some kind of security device installed. Do we have any legal recourse or regulations we can utilize to press this issue? . . . Geri Ness, Brooklyn.
 
 A "The writer does not state if she is the owner of the apartment or a rental subtenant," said Sherwin Belkin, a Manhattan real estate lawyer.
If she is a subtenant, Mr. Belkin said, her landlord is the owner of the apartment and the terms of the tenancy would be spelled out in the rental lease.
"But I doubt that the unit-owner would make any representations about or warranties against events concerning other units," he said. "So I doubt that there would be a truly viable remedy."
On the other hand, Mr. Belkin said, if the letter writer owns the apartment, there may be provisions in the proprietary lease that mandate the installation of such security devices. If that is the case, he said, she should ask the board to require the upstairs unit owner to comply with the terms of the proprietary lease.
If such a provision is not in the lease, he said, the letter writer could ask the board to amend the bylaws or establish a requirement for the installation of security devices for the benefit of all shareholders.
The co-op board does not, however, have unfettered discretion in such matters.
Mr. Belkin said he believed that a co-op board cannot require "such Draconian steps as would destroy the value or enjoyment of the top floor unit that would be directly affected."

Developer Catches Golf-Housing Trend on Upswing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AFTER six years of planning and review, mostly involving environmental concerns, a 520-acre residential development with a golf course is beginning to rise in the Atlantic County township of Egg Harbor, 25 minutes from Atlantic City.
Now that 124 acres in the southern corner of the site, including 60 acres of wetlands, have been protected, Max Gurwicz & Son of Northfield is poised to start work on the first 133 of 246 one-family detached homes that will frame an 18-hole golf course and overlook a dozen manmade ponds. 
 The houses, which will be built only after they are sold, will sit on 15,000- to 27,000-square-foot lots, have 1,850 to 3,300 square feet of space and range in price from $195,000 to $350,000. Since sales opened in May, 19 homes have been sold.
All of the land improvements for the first phase are also in place, as is the course, which is to open to the public by the end of the summer. Construction is under way on an 18,000-square-foot clubhouse that is scheduled for completion next spring.
The site of the $93 million project, Harbor Pines Golf Club & Estates, was once mostly woodlands. It lies at the intersection of Ocean Heights Avenue (Route 559) and Steelmanville Road near Exit 30 of the Garden State Parkway.
It will be built in two phases over eight years, said H. Edward Gurwicz, president of the development firm, long active in South Jersey. Harbor Pines is its first golf-housing project.
The company secured an $8 million loan from Collective Federal Bank in Egg Harbor Township to prepare the site for development, build the course and start the housing. The rest of the project will be financed through the revenue generated from the sale of the houses and club memberships.
Harbor Pines is proceeding at a time when golf-housing projects have rebounded from their recessionary slump. The reason, say industry experts, is the state's slowly improving housing market and the steady growth in the sport.
According to the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla., of the 468 courses that opened or were under way in 1995, 147 -- or 31 percent -- have housing. While that percentage is lower than the 1989 peak when 50 percent of the courses built were tied to housing, the actual number of residential golf projects is slightly higher, indicating renewed developer interest.
In New Jersey, of the 11 courses opened or under way as of 1995, six have or will have housing. Ten more projects are planned.
Challenges persist, including the high cost and scarcity of suitable land, along with the huge expense associated with building the course. The use of pesticides at golf courses also remains a concern, but industry experts say development techniques have advanced and that chemicals applied properly will not hurt the environment.
DEVELOPERS consider the courses an amenity that will preserve open space and increase sales and land values. A 20 to 30 percent price increase can be expected for prime course-side homes over those without, said Gene Krekorian, senior vice president at Economics Research Associates, a real estate consulting firm in Los Angeles.
The trend in the 90's, he added, is toward building public instead of private courses, and golf clubs instead of country clubs. This way golf can stand on its own as a business and be less reliant on the housing, he said.
That is the approach at Harbor Pines. Mr. Gurwicz said he stayed the course through the long approval process because he felt "homes abutting golf courses is a lasting trend." It also is an opportunity to offer a housing option not now available in the township, he said, noting that the project was being marketed to move-up buyers, including empty-nesters.
Cheryl and Ralph DeMucy are buying a home on the 10th fairway overlooking a lake. Unlike most people who live on golf courses, the couple -- he is 53 and a consultant for a mortgage company, she is 46 and a homemaker -- play golf.
"This gives us what we have been looking for -- land, water and golf," said Mrs. DeMucy. "It's also a beautiful place to live and we feel the home will hold its value and increase."
Such projects also complement an initiative begun a year ago by the private Greater Atlantic City Golf Association.
Its aim is to promote Atlantic and Cape May Counties as golf travel destinations, in an area with many beaches and the attractions of Atlantic City close at hand.
Seven of the 12 casino hotels are being expanded, adding 3,000 rooms to the existing 9,500 and six more with some 9,000 additional rooms are planned.
In March the association -- which comprises nine courses, including Harbor Pines; 29 hotels and 22 allied businesses -- began to market golf travel packages via a computer network and automated software system. So far 4,130 packages have been booked, said Marcella Corti, its executive director.
"In the past golf travelers were hopscotching over us," Ms. Corti said.
A similar effort is under way in Sussex County. The nonprofit Sussex Golf Preserve Foundation hopes to promote private investment in open space and economic growth through the development of 15 to 20 golf courses by the year 2007. Half will be tied to housing, generating 1,500 residences.
Two courses are open, four are in the approval process and eight more are planned, said Jack Kurlander, one of the founders of the golf foundation three years ago. He is also a partner in the Black Bear Golf Club, in Franklin, one of the new courses.
Max Gurwicz & Son assembled the 520-acre site for Harbor Pines over the last 20 years but did not develop it because the area was not served by a public sewage system. That changed in the late 80's when both the township and county sewer authorities sought to bring sewer lines through the Harbor Pines site to mitigate septic problems at an adjacent housing community.
Still, progress was slow. Because the tract is in an environmentally sensitive coastal zone, governed by state regulations, its development required extra layers of review.
THE discovery of wetlands on the site, which is zoned for 30,000-square-foot lots, was another issue. State law prohibits wetlands from being developed and establishes buffers around them, which meant preserving the 124 acres and downscaling the project from the 330 homes allowed. By negotiating a modification to the zoning to permit the smaller lots, the developer minimized the loss of homes to 84.
"It is a decent trade-off for the benefit the township got," said Randall E. Scheule, its director of planning and development.
To soothe concerns over the environmental issues of golf courses, Mr. Scheule said, the developer agreed to the township's request to adhere to more strigent management guidelines. If followed, he said, "there should be no problems." The state also monitors the impact on the groundwater.
He said the project also brings diversity to the township's housing stock. Entry-level homes predominate in Egg Harbor, where population grew by 6,163 to 25,717 from 1980 to 1994. Some 200 to 250 housing permits are issued a year, he added.
The homes at Harbor Pines, designed by the Johnson Group, of Margate, will have two to four bedrooms and two-car garages. Six models are available, which buyers can customize. They can also come up with their own designs.
Up to 70 homes will also be custom built on prime lots, with up to $50,000 premiums, some possibly on combined lots, said Robert A Johnson, principal of the architectural firm. He said design guidelines had been set up by an architectural review committee, including the developer.
Residents have the option of joining the golf club. Memberships, range from $300 to $6,000 depending on length and family size. Daily fees are $45 to $85.

HEADLINE: Top-End Condos Start With the Finish;
The Upper Level ... And the Middle of the Road

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
IN the thick sales brochure for 353 Central Park West, a small and elegant new condominium at 95th Street, the developer lists 10 great qualities of his full-floor apartments, which sell for a fraction under $2 million each.
A decade ago, any developer worth his blueprints was bragging of beautiful views or great concierge service or a "swinging" address -- and, according to sales agents and the developers themselves, wasn't saying much about the interior fittings. But now, the developer of 353 Central Park West chooses to boast instead of a "marble entry gallery," "high ceilings in every room," "prewar crown moldings," a "mahogany paneled library" and "rosewood floors set in herringbone patterns." 
 Another new condominium, the Knickerbocker, at 308 East 72d Street, instructs the reader of its whimsical sales brochure to "Think of double sinks. Separate shower and bath. Smashing glass partitions. A phone! 3-paneled mirrored medicines, with 9 inches between countertops and cabinets. And plenty of drawers for your necessities."
In the mid-90's, developers say they are building far better, more luxurious, more brand-name-studded apartments than they have ever built before.
These developers, and the real estate agents who sell their apartments, are increasingly touting the small things, the things that, beyond the number of bedrooms, today's buyers are thought to crave.
The developers who are now building the city's luxury condominiums -- there are few other condominiums being built -- say they must spend more money than ever on interior finishes to keep up with the marketplace.
For William Lie Zeckendorf, who with his partner, Makoto Okuyama of Sumitomo Real Estate, developed Millennium Tower on West 67th Street, spending money on fancy finishes was a hard-fought decision. "The deal was committed to before the recession," he said. "We talked about putting in the standard cookie-cutter finishes that would have cost $4.50 a square foot. But in the end, we thought the situation was so scary that we decided to be one of the top 10 buildings in the city for finishes and we spent another $3 a square foot."
With an overheated rental market and a concurrent desire for bigger, more expensive condominium apartments, the developers of condominiums and rental buildings seem vehemently competitive in pointing out the width of their bedroom doors, the class of their marble ("This isn't just any beige marble," said Donald Trump, the developer), the thickness of their herringbone parquet and the joints -- or lack thereof -- in their granite countertops.
Every detail -- no matter how minuscule -- is duly pointed out to the prospective buyer or visitor. "Remember the old security chain?" said Robert Skolnick, vice president of sales for the Knickerbocker, with a disdainful snicker. "We prefer the fitted brass hasp; it doesn't swing loose and damage our wall finishes."
The developers of the condominiums billed as "luxury" or "superluxury" -- where an average two-bedroom price ranges from $600,000 to $2 million -- appear to believe, at least as judged by their comments, that each one is the only one to offer the so-called luxury finishes.
Erden Arkan, president of Kiska Development, which built 353 Central Park West: "I visited other developments and I saw many things that are different: We have solid-core doors, for instance."
Mr. Trump, discussing his new condominium at Columbus Circle: "With Trump International Tower, I'm offering top-of-the-line finishes, things that nobody else is offering -- things like solid-core doors."
William Lie Zeckendorf, touring his Millennium Towers condo on West 67th Street: "You know, we have solid-core doors; other developers don't do that."
In fact, every luxury developer -- at least in buildings built in the last few years -- seems to offer solid-core doors, even Daniel Brodsky, the developer respected as a master of the middle-income rental apartment.
Shown a typed list given a reporter by one of the developers interviewed, a list that purportedly compared details in luxury buildings with those in lesser cost buildings, Mr. Brodsky looked puzzled.
"What are they talking about?" he said. "I use solid-core doors," he said, talking about West End Towers, his sold-out new rental buildings at West End Avenue between 61st and 63d Streets.
AT West End Towers, a two-bedroom apartment rents for $2,650 a month, compared to between $4,000 and $5,700 for a two-bedroom apartment in the luxury rental just going up at the Strathmore at 84th Street and First Avenue, developed by the Related Group -- a building designed by Costas Kondylis that, of course, will have solid-core doors, along with a plethora of elegant carpets and floors and "upscale" appliances.
Mr. Brodsky is the first to agree that the level of finish, of details, in his rental apartments is a far cry from the finishes in the much-higher-priced residential units going up around town.
But the difference is "a conscious decision," said Mr. Brodsky, made in order to rent his apartments for much less money.
It is in the kitchen and bathroom at West End Towers that the difference becomes most clear.
The biggest difference is the pre-molded "granite look" laminate that blankets the countertops in the less-expensive rental apartments and juts out into the living room, not quite fitting against the wall without a large blob of caulk. In contrast with their marble-encrusted cousins, the bathrooms at West End Towers are windowless, with a tasteful mix of black and white ceramic tile instead of marble, a low enameled steel tub and basic white fixtures.
A quick price comparison illustrates the point: At a wholesale plumbing supply house in lower Manhattan, steel tubs sell for $ 108.50; a white Kohler cast iron steeping tub similar to one used at the Knickerbocker sells for $471.75. A plain white toilet sells for $85.50; a one-piece beige Kohler, similar to those at Trump International, sells for $334.13. One square foot of black and white tile mosaic sells for a little over $2; the most expensive 1/4-inch marble tile at a wholesale marble distributor may run as high as $10 a square foot. Developers, of course, pay less than wholesale prices on many items because of volume .
The rather perfunctory kitchens and bathrooms at West End Towers look very much like those in the "luxury" condominiums that went up on Manhattan's East Side in the 80's.
In fact, many agents point to the early Trump luxury towers as exemplifying the philosophy of architectural finishes in the 80's: Don't bother spending too much on details, because rich people are just going to have their decorators come in and rip it all out anyway.
And Mr. Trump, who has changed his strategy and freely concedes he has upgraded his finishes to satisfy the millionaire apartment buyer of the 90's, says he is still annoyed that decorators rip out his details to put in their own.
His newest project, Trump International Hotel and Tower, at One Central Park West -- his inside-out gutting of the old Gulf and Western Building -- now comes with higher quality kitchen cabinets and marble bathrooms than he has ever used before.
"They'll take the highest quality bathrooms and rip them out anyway," he said. "All because their decorators -- who are making a lot more than 10 percent of the cost of the materials, I can tell you -- tell them they don't want a beige bathroom; they want a black bathroom.
"Well, black bathrooms are magnificent, but you wouldn't build a building with all black bathrooms," Mr. Trump said.
While Mr. Trump said he was installing white lacquered kitchen cabinets manufactured by a Canadian firm for Trump International, he added, "You have to have flexibility, you have to have cabinets you can take off the wall without destroying the wall."
At the earlier Trump Tower, the developer said, "I did something different. I put in good cabinets that were easily removable, very practical cabinets but they were not of such high quality" as at Trump International Tower.
That choice was "both good and bad," he said. "It was good because the primary thing was easy removal; the bad thing was that I never liked the cabinets at Trump Tower.
"You hate to spend thousands of dollars, with 48 coats of lacquer, just to see a designer make a fee by ripping them out," he continued. "It's such a waste."
NEVERTHELESS, Mr. Trump said, he was forced to spend $10,000 to $25,000 more per kitchen at Trump International "because the market demands it now."
It is difficult to trace exactly when developers started stressing better kitchen cabinets and countertops -- and higher ceilings and better tubs -- but it may have started with Jack Heller and his partner, Duncan Macaulay, and their project at 1049 Fifth Avenue, a complete rebuild of the old Adams Hotel on 86th Street, right off Fifth Avenue.
In 1992, at the height of the real estate recession, Heller-Macaulay Equities unveiled a series of then-wildly expensive apartments with floors of rosewood parquet with ebony borders and separate maid's rooms for sale on the lower floors. It was a new concept -- and it has taken a while to sell out; there is still one sponsor apartment left. But Rush Limbaugh bought an apartment there -- along with one of the maid's rooms, which he turned into a 260-square-foot exercise room. And the scramble for luxury was on.
Mr. Macaulay said that although certain developers -- he discreetly did not name any -- plan their kitchens to be ripped out, he and Mr. Heller have had different results.
"Of the 44 apartments we've sold -- for $2 million and $3 million -- we don't know of one where they ripped out the kitchens and bath," the developer said. "They've added lots of moldings, and bookcases and bits and pieces, but there's been only one major makeover -- and they left the kitchens and baths."
WHILE 1049 was planned with excellent finishes from the start of construction, another condominium, the Europa, at 22 West 66th Street, originally was designed with cheaper details. Caught in the real estate recession of the early 90's, construction came to a halt. By the time the apartments were ready to be sold 14 months ago, the whole marketing strategy had changed.
The Europa was conceived in the mid-80's as a high-rise tower with lovely views. The recession hit, and the Europa was foreclosed upon and put up for sale. It was sold to Sterling Realty, a company composed primarily of Italian and Swiss investors, according to Joseph Pell Lombardi, the architect who was hired to transform it.
There was only bare concrete; there were no wooden floors. There were some walls, but only a stack of doors -- the much-maligned hollow-core doors -- leaning against the walls. There was the plan: for two apartments on each floor.
So the investors switched to one apartment per floor, and substantially upgraded the way the raw apartments were to be finished. "They went with classic prewar interiors," Mr. Lombardi said. "The original finishes had been planned at such a low level because that was all the mid-80's had demanded."
What had been mapped as two back-to-back kitchens in the two apartments were merged into one. Cherrywood kitchen cabinets were ordered. Granite -- the countertop material that seems to be mandatory now -- was laid on the counters; in this case, 3/4 inches thick with an applied bullnose, or curved strip, which makes the countertop look as if it is the thickness of the bullnose: an inch and a half. A SubZero refrigerator (contractors' price: $3,400) was installed, along with a top-of-the-line General Electric oven.
"It's these few things that people look at when they look at apartments now," Mr. Lombardi said. "A SubZero stands out."
So do the solid oak strip floors with the dark walnut borders, the 8-inch baseboards and the 3-inch cornice moldings (some prewar buildings have even higher cornice moldings). The hollow-core doors were thrown away, and full 2-inch solid paneled doors were hung, punctuated with Baldwin brass levers. A reddish-orange 6-inch-square Sienna marble alternates with white marble in a striking checkerboard design in one of the bathrooms. There is a separate marble-lined shower enclosure, a massive white pedestal sink and brick-shaped marble slabs on the walls.
These finishes, the architect said, may cost $50,000 more per apartment, "but they're worth hundreds of thousands more; you've got to have a sense of the market."
The 26 full-floor apartments at the Europa went on sale 14 months ago, with prices ranging from $815,000 to $2.6 million. Last week, there were only two left.
The market is very different in TriBeCa and SoHo, where the approach to finishes couldn't be more different.
"With loft conversions, you're furnishing clean white space," said Mr. Lombardi, who is involved in several conversions at the moment, including one at 55 Liberty Street, a 1909 Gothic revival skyscraper in downtown Manhattan. "To get the certificate of occupancy you put in a basic bathroom with the most inexpensive hexagonal tiles; you put in a steel tub and not much of a vanity."
Even though the huge new lofts might sell for over $1 million each, many do not even come with a kitchen, he said. "You just need an affidavit that the kitchen will be installed at a later date."
DOWNTOWN, Mr. Lombardi has found that a finished kitchen actually inhibits sales. "It's like buying some land in the country, in a development where everybody has to have the same builder's houses, maybe with slight variations," he said. "That wouldn't be the downtown buyer's cup of tea."
But uptown, developers say, the buyer wants -- and compares -- all the finishes, seeking what can only be defined as a prewar English look, which Mr. Skolnick, at the Knickerbocker, defines as "old world charm."
In the Knickerbocker's brochure, the sections on bathrooms ends: "I say. Be a good sort, Jeeves, and run me a bloody bath!"
To Mr. Macaulay, of Heller-Macaulay, developers of 1049 Fifth, the rush toward the English upper-class is amusing.
"New York is the ultimate city of new money, and new money wants nothing more than to look like old money, and the English aristocracy is perfect," he said. "So they dress in Ralph Lauren, they live in buildings called the Richmond and the Fairfax and they stare at their crown moldings -- and they feel good about themselves."
To Mr. Skolnick, such a sense of well-being is better induced through a series of elaborate and well-thought-out details -- but not necessarily the most expensive of everything. "You don't need a SubZero to score a 10," he said.
Passing through the spacious corridors, Mr. Skolnick pointed out one detail not seen in other new apartments: plinth blocks, the large wooden squares at the bottom of the door moldings, "so the porter didn't scrape them up when vacuuming," he explained. On the entrance doors, there are heavy round door knockers and a brass knob set with the number of the apartment etched into it.
At the Knickerbocker, the floors are a half-inch thick -- some building boast of three-quarter-inch floors -- but they are made of pecan, and set in a basketweave pattern, like many prewars. And, like many of the new buildings, there are 9-foot ceilings -- and 8-foot doors, which, because they are not the standard 6 feet, 6 inches, are easily double the price. (A 6-foot, 6-inch hollow-core door costs about $30, Mr. Skolnick said, while his taller doors cost $100 apiece if bought in quantity.)
THE 8-foot doors require four hinges, versus three for the shorter ones. "These taller solid doors weigh 78 pounds," said Mr. Skolnick, reciting the statistic from memory. "They feel like a bank vault -- it's kind of a subliminal thing."
There are many other little touches: the type of white marble ("statuary white -- 30 percent more than the ordinary white, which is really kind of gray"), the size of the marble tiles on the wall (12 by 18 inches, because it feels richer) and chrome fixtures rather than "old hat" brass.
The Knickerbocker, even though it is thought by brokers to be in a location that is slightly "off" -- 72d Street Street at Second Avenue -- seems to be an invigorating success. After only nine weeks of sales, 46 of the 74 apartments -- more than 60 percent -- have been sold.
To the developers, the little touches really make a difference to buyers, although the builders point out that without a good layout and a good location, apartments in today's picky market will be harder to sell.
But for Mr. Arkan of Kiska Development, who chose to build $2 million apartments at the corner of 95th Street and Central Park West, these details appear to be key to selling in what is normally considered another "off" location. That may be why his brochure emphasizes the finishes to an unusual degree, even for today's finish-conscious consumers.
To real estate brokers, to whom goes the task of selling these apartments, finishes assume differing levels of importance; agents disagree among themselves on the importance of the door heights (but all agree the doors must be thick and solid), the thickness of countertops (although all agree they must be granite) and whether the walls should be skim-coated with plaster or just taped with sheetrock tape and painted.
But they agree that the current competition over finishes is a reaction to the cookie-cutter condo apartments of the 80's.
"Developers are finding now that quality sells," said Peter Marra, president of William B. May Real Estate. "They only want jewelry from Tiffany and luxury cars.
"You want to live in a place that says you've made it and that seems to boil down to things like doorknobs," Mr. Marra said. "If you're spending $1 million on an apartment versus $100,000, you don't want 7-foot ceilings with hollow-core doors."
But Mr. Marra questioned whether "high ceilings and moldings and granite really improve the quality of your life."
"I mean, in the end, it's just fluff," he said. "Isn't it?"

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Whip Inflation Now? Lessons From the 70's

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
PRICES of commodities like oil, natural gas, wheat and corn have been rising this year; the question is whether the pricing pressures are merely a blip or signs of a longer-term inflationary trend.
At CDA/Wiesenberger, a fund information and tracking firm in Rockville, Md., analysts say evidence is mounting that many of the increases are, in fact, driven by demand and are not simply results of a one-time phenomenon like the weather. 
 If inflation is a concern, a look at recent history may provide clues about the best investments for inflationary times. Since sufficient mutual fund data became available in 1972, the worst such period was 1977 through 1980, when the Consumer Price Index rose an average of 10.34 percent a year. A look at the returns for each fund category then tracked by CDA/Wiesenberger shows an interesting correlation between fund performance in the late 70's and this year, the analysts said.
The most profitable funds to own then were those in gold and other precious metals, with average gains of nearly 58 percent a year. Similarly, those funds appear at the top of this year's list, with gains of 31.3 percent through May. In fact, the top 10 categories through May are the same as those in 1977 through 1980 (excluding two categories with insufficient data in the earlier years).
If you think inflation lies in wait, these numbers can provide a road map, the analysts said. Their conclusions: Stay out of income-dependent investments like bond and utility funds. Consider an equity-heavy portfolio with funds in the categories of energy and natural resources, small-company growth, technology and international issues. Stout-hearted souls might make a small allocation to gold and precious metals.

A Change in Pricing
One price for everyone. That's how Twentieth Century has always done business. Investors paid no sales charges when they bought shares, and they paid an annual flat rate to the company for managing their funds -- 1 percent for United States stock funds and 0.45 percent to 0.8 percent for bond funds.
The simplicity of Twentieth Century's pricing structure has stood out in an industry where front- and back-end loads, redemption fees and service fees, to name just a few, have made investment decisions more complex than ever.
But Twentieth Century is now joining the pack, with pricing changes that will take effect in October. The company will create four classes of shares: one for investors who buy directly from Twentieth Century, and others for the institutional market, for sales through financial intermediaries like Charles Schwab & Company and for sales through financial advisers.
Here is how the fees apply to domestic stock funds: Investors who buy directly will pay the same 1 percent as before, while institutional investors will pay less -- 0.8 percent. Shares sold through fund supermarkets will still have a maximum 1 percent sales charge, divided into an annual fee of 0.75 percent plus up to 0.25 percent in service fees. The adviser class will have fees of up to 1.25 percent, which includes an annual fee of 0.75 percent plus service and distribution fees of up to 0.5 percent, meaning that the shares can no longer be advertised as no-load shares.
"We feel that intermediaries provide a service and deserve to be compensated," said David F. Larrabee, vice president for alternate distribution at Twentieth Century. He said that of the company's $50 billion in assets, $18 billion was institutional money with about $8 billion or $9 billion coming through financial supermarkets, financial advisers, insurers and the like.
The new pricing is "a rational and fair response to market conditions," said Don Phillips, president of Morningstar Inc. But he said such pricing complexities "undermine the idea of funds as a simple product."

Albany Bill Expands Managed Care in Worker Injuries

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
FOR the thousands of New York State businesses that pay a total of $5 billion for workers' compensation insurance each year, the significance of recently approved legislation revamping the system should be as clear as the numbers on their premium bills: it will help reduce rates by as much as 25 percent, state officials say.
But for the workers who depend on the system to provide medical care for work-related injuries and compensation for lost wages, the impact of the new measure will be less clear, and probably less consequential. It will neither increase their benefits, as the bill's authors once promised, nor cause the dire consequences its critics had predicted. 
 Perhaps most important to workers, the legislation will not impose the major changes that Gov. George E. Pataki had sought and that organized labor had opposed, like caps on benefits and stricter standards for determining disabilities. Though he did not win those initiatives, Mr. Pataki supported the final bill, which passed in the Legislature two weeks ago, and is expected to sign it soon.
The compromise legislation does nip and tuck at the fringes of the 82-year-old system, placing restrictions on certain types of lawsuits, toughening anti-fraud measures and expanding the use of managed care in the diagnosis and treatment of injured workers. But while those alterations will certainly touch some workers, most people using the system will continue to receive treatment and benefits in the same ways as before.
"The average worker who gets hurt on the job is not going to be affected by our legislation," said Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, Democrat of Queens, chairwoman of the Assembly's labor committee. She opposed Mr. Pataki's original proposal.
The way that most workers will experience any changes is through the expansion of managed care. Currently, almost all workers can pick the doctors who will diagnose and treat their injuries. Critics contend that this freedom of choice has led to a pernicious form of "doctor shopping," in which workers move from physician to physician, searching for the one whose diagnosis will provide the most compensation.
The new system makes it easier for companies to use managed care by contracting with a single provider, usually a health maintenance organization, to handle compensation cases. That provider will diagnose and treat the injured workers, using all the standard techniques of managed care to reduce costs.
Critics of the change, mainly labor unions, said managed-care providers, because of their contractual relationships with employers, would be encouraged to skimp on care and overlook the severity of injuries. "Care won't be as good and medical claims will be rejected more often," predicted Arthur Wilcox, director of the public employee department at the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
But Mr. Pataki argued that expanded use of managed care would simply bring the hide-bound workers' compensation system closer into line with changes occurring throughout the health care industry.
The legislation will also allow injured workers to circumvent the system and negotiate payments directly with insurers. Currently, insurers and workers often fight over an injury claim in cumbersome and time-consuming hearings that can delay benefit checks for months. Allowing workers to negotiate claims directly with insurance companies will speed up payments and reduce litigation, Mr. Pataki's advisers say.
But critics say workers who are not receiving advice from lawyers or a union might be gulled into accepting bad deals, especially if they are poor and in need of quick cash. "The economics of desperation will have a grave impact on people's rights," Mr. Wilcox said.
Though most workers are unlikely to notice many of the changes, there is one group that could be significantly affected by the legislation: the personal-injury lawyers who specialize in so-called third-party lawsuits in workers' compensation cases.
When required to pay damages to injured workers, makers of equipment can file such third-party lawsuits against employers as a way of recovering some of their litigation costs. The companies often claim that the employer misused the equipment or installed it incorrectly. Only New York State allows the suits, but the new legislation would restrict them solely to cases in which workers have suffered "grave injuries," like amputation or blindness. The new restrictions would reduce the cost of third-party suits by about half, state officials say.
The change will not prevent injured workers from suing manufacturers of defective equipment. But trial lawyers and union officials argue that if a manufacturer cannot punish an employer who misuses equipment through third-party lawsuits, workplace safety will be diminished.
Mr. Pataki's aides scoff at such arguments, saying that lawyers, not injured workers, were the major beneficiaries of third-party lawsuits, and that the legislation will not hurt workplace safety or workers' benefits.
Even Ms. Nolan largely agreed with that assessment. "The really seriously injured worker will still be able to get large settlements," she said.

HEADLINE: For a Pessimist, a Vindication of Sorts

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
STEVEN LEUTHOLD did more than just predict the latest stock market rout, he put his money on it.
Mr. Leuthold, an investment strategist with a decidedly bearish point of view and a big institutional following, pulled largely out of equities at the beginning of July. When the market tumbled two weeks later, the Leuthold Asset Allocation fund was only 9 percent invested in stocks and protected by a large cash cushion. 
 So during the unnerving week of July 15 -- which started with the major indexes plummeting and proceeded with stocks seesawing wildly -- the fund gained 0.7 percent as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.15 percent.
It was something of a vindication for Mr. Leuthold, whose well-publicized bearishness during the last two years kept him mostly out of stocks during a bull market run. That, plus a too-heavy reliance on bonds, which performed badly earlier this year, dragged down the fledgling fund's returns. From its inception in November 1995 through July 19, the fund rose 4 percent, compared with 4.64 percent for all asset allocation funds and 8.11 percent for the S.& P., according to Morningstar, the Chicago fund researchers.
"The last couple of weeks feels better," Mr. Leuthold, 58, said in a telephone interview from Bailey Island, Maine, where he has ridden out the market swings in a vacation home equipped with a satellite dish and fax machine.
Mr. Leuthold, who was bullish for many years before turning pessimistic, relaxes by gardening: green beans, onions, beets, cucumbers and varieties of potatoes.
"I can get as much done here as I do in the office, maybe more," he said. "Then I can take a break and dig potatoes."
For his investment strategy, Mr. Leuthold relies on a proprietary trend index to help decide the mix of stocks, bonds and cash in his $32 million fund and for the $100 million in private accounts managed by Leuthold & Anderson in Minneapolis. The index was adjusted in February, with bigger weighting given to mutual fund cash inflows and several momentum measures.
The changes to the index kept it positive on equities, despite what Mr. Leuthold called the "radical overvaluation of the stock market." Still, he was uneasy and bought equity call options on the S.& P. 500, giving him the right to buy the basket of stocks in the index at a specific price by a specific date. That gave him equity exposure but limited the risk. If the market rose, the value of the call would rise, providing profits as if the fund owned the actual stocks. If prices fell, the fund would lose what it paid for the calls, a smaller loss than owning an equivalent amount of stocks.
Mr. Leuthold's trend index flashed red at the end of June, when mutual fund inflows began drying up. At the same time, new issues came to market faster than they could be absorbed.
Mr. Leuthold sold the call options and bought put options on the S.& P. 500. These options let holders sell the S.& P. index at a specific price by a certain date; if the market moves below that price, the put options increase in value. These options had accounted for 0.7 percent of the fund, but because of the market drop, they now account for 2.3 percent.
The puts hedged all but 9 percent of the fund's equity exposure. The remaining equities were all publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Half the fund was stashed in bonds, and the balance in cash. He has made no changes since then.
"We view this as a very dangerous stock market," Mr. Leuthold said, because valuation levels are extremely high, and the support for the market may be ending. Because of his bearishness, his accounts gained only 20 percent last year, much below the S.& P.'s increase of 37.6 percent. This year, he would be happy with gains of 12 to 15 percent, he said.
He called 1996 a repeat of the "great garbage market" of 1968 through 1970, when funds focusing on small stocks plunged 50 to 75 percent in value. With some shares selling for 100 times sales or earnings, "it's hard for me to look at the valuations and think that that's rational investment management."
Even so, he is hedging his bets. "I'm not exactly sure we're at the end and heading into a major bear market," he said. "But we are in a major topping-out phase." He added that the speculative part of the stock market had been broken, but there could be a rally in big, quality stocks.
"The risk is high enough," he said, "that we think it prudent to stay on the sidelines." He noted that if stocks reverted to normal, or median, historic valuation levels, the major market indices would be down more than 35 percent.
Is the fund's strategy suitable for the individual investor?
John Rekenthaler, publisher of Morningstar Mutual Funds, suggested that potential investors "wait and see how the fund does before investing, because it is run by someone without a public track record and it is poorly defined."
"It is just a bet on Steven Leuthold," he said.
To Mr. Leuthold, that is a good bet. Putting your money under the mattress may be one way for a bear to act, but "you still have to make the decision to re-enter the market," he said. He also noted that his fund was not just sitting on cash, but was half invested in bonds.
Mr. Leuthold said he believes he can make as much money in the next 12 months in bonds as in stocks, with much less risk. Of the bond portion of the portfolio, 25 percent is in Treasury bonds maturing in 23 and 25 years.
In his analysis, if inflation fears push yields on the long bond to 8 percent, from about 7 percent today, he would lose about 4 percent when he offsets the bond's lower price against the interest income that it pays. Should worries about inflation ease, however, and bond yields fall to 6 percent, he would gain 30 percent. "So the odds there look better to me than the stock market," he said.
Mr. Leuthold's fund also does not own gold, a typical inflation hedge. Although he said 5 percent of his own portfolio was in physical gold -- what he called an "apocalypse" investment -- the fund has not owned any gold stocks for two or three years, because he thinks they are too expensive.
Unlike many of the so-called contrarian mutual funds, Leuthold Asset Allocation does not short stocks, no matter how dark the managers' view of the market. "If you can run a fund 25 percent net short, that's more risk than we think appropriate for our investors," he said.
Besides, Mr. Leuthold said, "we're not necessarily trying to be contrarian."
"Contrarian means buying things just because they are out of favor," he said. "There are times when the majority is right on the market."
Still, the fund has risks other than that of underperforming if the stock market rises. The bonds can fall in price if interest rates rise. The portfolio's foreign bonds expose it to currency risks. In a worst case, the market could rise, rendering the fund's put contracts worthless, while the individual stocks it owns could fall.
How could this bear morph into a bull?
"Better inflation numbers combined with a resurgence of interest by the public in mutual funds, accompanied by a decline in interest rates, could get us back into a positive mode," Mr. Leuthold said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Climate Is Colder For Home-Grown Funds

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
CHILL winds are blowing on single-state municipal bond funds, those popular havens from state income tax. And with nearly 700 funds representing 44 states holding $113 billion in assets, the problems may give the shivers to more than a few investors.
The changes -- fewer issues for funds to choose from, for instance, and growing doubts about issuers' willingness to repay their debts -- are making these popular funds more risky. And this may blind-side the typical investor in these funds, whose sights are traditionally trained on just two targets: tax avoidance and high yields. 
 Many muni fund managers play down the new dangers, saying that their strategies and a quiet market will allow them to keep risks low. And, of course, the wisdom of taking these now-higher risks depends on the tax savings received for doing so, and these savings can vary.
While all muni investors avoid paying Federal tax on the bonds' interest, shareholders in single-state muni funds also escape state and local taxes on the interest they earn. That is because single-state funds invest primarily in bonds issued within their home states, where the states and, often, any separate city tax authorities typically treat such at-home earnings as tax-free. But this means that the savings investors realize from single-state funds will hinge on their state and local tax rate.
Nevertheless, many experts sense a growing change in the climate of this important area of investing. Because of stable interest rates and taxpayer resistance to publicly financed projects, for example, state and local governments are issuing fewer tax-free bonds than they did just a few years ago. That gives fund managers fewer securities to choose from.
In 1995, state and local governments sold $156 billion in new long-term bonds, down from $162 billion in 1994, and new bond sales are still dropping. Therefore, managers may be forced to buy bonds they may otherwise have spurned simply because the supply of bonds is so tight.
At the same time, more than half the new bonds are insured these days. Insurance provides protection against default, but at the price of a lower yield on the securities, reflecting the lower risk. Insurers have also begun insuring more bonds at the lower end of the investment-grade spectrum. These trends leave a smaller pool of higher-yield securities -- the kind investors often seek in this income-oriented market.
With a smaller pool of bonds and with "people wanting everything under the sun insured," said James F. Lynch, editor of the Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory newsletter, "in the universe that is left, indeed there are more bonds that are risky than are not."
And despite Orange County, Calif., which jolted the muni market when it defaulted on some bonds 19 months ago, people may still underestimate the dangers of munis.
Specifically, investors may still be too complacent about general obligation muni bonds, which are those backed by the full faith and credit -- and taxing power -- of the issuer. And they may not realize that new risks are arising for buyers of revenue bonds -- which are bonds backed only by the fees or revenues generated by the toll roads, bridges or other projects they finance. These risks stem from exotic new securities like "certificates of participation" and lease-backed bonds, which are proliferating among the more familiar "plain vanilla" revenue bonds.
"This market does not properly evaluate municipal risk," said Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer.
This point seems proved by Orange County's political decision to file for bankruptcy rather than rile residents by raising taxes to pay general obligation bondholders.
"If you have to rely on politics for the bond repayments, it's kind of iffy," Mr. Mysak said.
While investors may not have learned lessons from the episode -- one reason may be that Orange County bondholders eventually were fully repaid under the bankruptcy's outcome -- other municipalities may have a new perspective: they may now realize that it is acceptable to go bankrupt in such a case. This may deepen the political risks for investors.
Muni investors have also been hurt by a long-term development -- the narrowing gap since the early 1980's between the yields of triple-A rated bonds, the highest-quality investments, and lower quality, single-A issues. Largely because of the smaller supply of lower-quality bonds, the spread is now about one-half of a percentage point, or 50 basis points, according to Delphis Hanover Corporation. But portfolio managers, like Robert A. Dennis at Massachusetts Financial Services, recall that back in 1976, when New York City's credit problems were roiling the market much as Orange County's are now, the spread between the bonds was more than 150 basis points.
A result is that the many muni investors who are seeking higher yields are receiving comparatively less income for their increased risk.
All these developments seem to heighten risk in the muni market. Investors who buy individual bonds should look closely at each issue. Investors in nationwide muni funds should be more vigilant, too, although those funds afford more diversification.
But investors in single-state funds should be the most alert to these market changes because they are especially vulnerable. Like other fund investors, they rarely scrutinize their funds' individual holdings, but unlike investors in national funds they often have less diversification.
Some muni fund managers, however, disagree about these risks. Because muni funds have had net outflows this year, managers have not had to consider buying riskier securities, said Thomas Kenny, director of the municipal bond department at the Franklin Templeton Group of Funds.
Thomas Spalding, vice president and manager of the Nuveen Advisory Corporation, said he was raising yields in Nuveen's muni funds by investing in intermediate and long-term bonds. Although these longer-term issues can be more volatile in price, he has not added to his credit risk, he said.
Managers note that even if a bond issue is troubled, it often represents only a small percentage of a large diversified fund's holdings. Even in other funds, a manager may have bought just a small amount of a such an issue.
Nevertheless, these risks have come home to roost in some funds. The $19 million Riverside Capital Tennessee Municipal fund, for example, was scorched last year after the city of Lewisburg, Tenn., defaulted on $7.1 million in nonrated bonds issued in 1993 to build a golf course. The Riverside fund had invested $550,000, or roughly 3 percent of its portfolio, in the issue.
The fund fell victim to both credit risk -- the danger that the issuer cannot make the payments -- and political risk, the threat that the issuer simply will not pay. The golf course failed to make enough money to pay on the bonds and a local court ruled that Lewisburg's taxpayers did not have to make up the shortfall. The bonds sank in value, and the fund plunged to become the worst-performing Tennessee fund last year.
Luckily for investors, Lewisburg officials eventually agreed to issue new bonds and to compensate the old bondholders. Largely as a result, the fund ranked first among Tennessee funds for the first half of 1996.
Larger funds are not always safe from these dangers, either. The mutual fund giant, Fidelity Investments, ran into trouble when its $1.1 billion Massachusetts Tax-Free fund bought $4.8 million of bonds issued by the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency on behalf of Jacob's Pillow, a dance center in Becket, Mass.
The bonds, issued in 1989 and 1991, defaulted last year after Jacob's Pillow missed some interest payments. Here, credit risk was the culprit; the dance center faced cuts in Federal funds and stagnating donations. Fidelity later settled with Jacob's Pillow for $1.25 million.
Given such incidents, some advisers caution against investing solely in a single-state fund. "A single-state fund is the antithesis of what we preach," said Mr. Lynch, the newsletter editor. "We preach diversification."
Such thoughts have led one firm, Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in New York, to offer single-state funds only for two large states: New York and California.
"A bond portfolio is supposed to be safe and if you're saying 'invest to diversify,' in a smaller state you really can't diversify," said Guy Davidson, director of the municipal bond department at Sanford Bernstein. While the Franklin New York Tax-Free Income Fund has 294 holdings, for instance, the Merrill Lynch Arizona Muni Bond Fund has 27 and the Tax-Free Fund of Vermont has only 18.
But concentrating on even one big state can be dangerous. A downturn, say, in New York City, could depress many of New York State's bond issues. And when Orange County defaulted, many California issues also fell in value, simply because of a "guilt by association" reaction in the market.
Moreover, "Your advantages to staying in-state are really less than meet the eye," Mr. Davidson said. "You're not saving that much money by avoiding state taxes."
While New York's highest marginal tax rate is a relatively high 7.125 percent, for example, Connecticut levies just a flat 4.5 percent rate -- almost 40 percent less. And, as with all state and local income taxes, investors can itemize these payments as Federal tax deductions and thus trim their Federal bills somewhat. With the rising risks of munis, Mr. Davidson said, investors may find that these tax benefits are simply not worth the worry.
 
If You're Buying: Items to Check
Here are some ways to assess a single-state municipal bond fund:
* Find out if your fund is insured, a word a fund can use in its description only if 65 percent of its assets are insured for payment of principal and interest. Compare the yields on insured and uninsured funds for your state to see if the protection is worth it.
 * Read the fund's prospectus and ask its representatives about how many bonds the fund holds at each credit rating. Is there another fund for your state with a better credit profile and an acceptable yield?
* Determine if your fund is diversified. A fund cannot call itself diversified if more than 5 percent of assets are in one security.
* Make sure that a single-state fund, which enables investors to avoid state as well as Federal taxes, is worth it for you. "I'd sit down with a pencil and paper and figure out the after-tax yield," one fund manager advised.
Consider a resident of Connecticut, which has a 4.5 percent flat income-tax rate. Then imagine a single-state muni fund that pays 5 percent, and a national muni fund -- which gives the investor only a Federal tax break -- that pays 5.2 percent. The investor's after-tax yield on the single-state fund is the same as before taxes, 5 percent, while on the national fund the after-tax yield is 4.97 percent. On a $10,000 investment, that's a difference of $3. An investor must judge if this money is worth the risk. At different relative returns and different tax rates, of course, the conclusion may change. SHARON R. KING

HEADLINE: Where Lenin Ruled, Stocks Gain

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
WHERE are the world's hottest stock markets? Not in the economic powerhouses of Asia, but in a region that largely spurned capitalism until recently: Russia and its former satellites in Eastern Europe.
The stock markets there carry substantial risks, and even willing investors find it hard to gain access to them. But the performances have been mouthwatering. 
 Russia's market is up 64.78 percent so far in 1996, based on the MT index. Poland's Warsaw Stock Market index has risen 53.53 percent, and Hungary's BTI Stock Market index is up 77.82 percent. The Czech Republic Stock Market index, the most modest performer of the group, is still up 27.63 percent this year.
Economic changes and apparently cheap stocks are the biggest reasons for the regional run-up. By decisively defeating his Communist opponent in the final round of presidential elections this month, Boris N. Yeltsin has sent a signal that Russia, like its former satellites, may be committed to democratic capitalism, even if its performance is wobbly for a while. The prospect of that victory is what drew foreign investors to Russia this year.
Money continues to flow in despite concerns about the health of Mr. Yeltsin, who postponed a meeting last week with Vice President Al Gore and seemed weak when they did meet at a sanitarium.
As for Russian stock prices, Michael Klebnikov of the stockbroker H. Rivkin & Company in New York reckons that Russia's big natural-resource companies are valued at a fraction of comparable Western companies. For instance, the reserves of Lukoil, which controls 15 percent of Russia's oil and gas, are priced at only 23 cents a barrel, versus $6 a barrel for Mobil's.
"The risks are greatest in Russia, but so is the long-term value," said Barbara Insel, head of emerging European market research at Salomon Brothers.
Low stock prices combined with continuing economic change also explain why foreign money has flowed into Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Earlier this year, Eastern European shares were trading at 8 to 9 times earnings, compared with multiples of 20 to 25 on most Far Eastern emerging markets. And the tiny capitalizations of the Eastern European exchanges -- Poland's market is worth $6 billion, compared with $250 billion for Malaysia's -- means that a little money has a big effect on prices.
The good regional performance has inspired new investment vehicles and continuing confidence. Recently in the United States, Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich started the Vontobel East Europe Equity fund, a clone of its existing Eastern European fund. Arpad Pongracz, its manager, said he would "double our Russian exposure to 20 percent as fast as possible."
Since then, the Lexington Management Corporation of New Jersey and Troika Dialog of Moscow introduced the Lexington Troika Dialog Russia fund. "Shares have risen a lot, but we still think there is excellent value there," said Peter Derby, president of Troika Dialog.
Even with these new vehicles, however, eager investors will still find few points of entry for the markets. There are a few closed-end funds, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have some companies whose shares trade in the United States as American depository receipts. But most of those A.D.R.'s are unavailable to the individual investor. Similarly, 11 Russian companies trade as A.D.R.'s, yet most investors can get shares of just a few blue chips, like Lukoil and GUM, the big department store.
Before seeking access, however, investors must decide if these markets will continue to shine. That is an open issue, even according to experts who are high on the region.
"The questions about Russia are macroeconomic now, no longer political," said Ms. Insel, meaning that it is the new Government's approach to the country's economic problems that will determine investor confidence. An immediate challenge for Mr. Yeltsin's Government is to increase revenue and to cut the budget deficit by tightening tax collection.
Brokers point out that securities in these soaring markets still carry special hazards. Regulation is minimal. Managers often resent foreign institutions' buying into their firms. And while registering shares is becoming easier, typically only a handful of companies trade regularly.
Company accounting is opaque at best in the region, and that makes one of the markets' apparent advantages, low prices, difficult to gauge. Some experts argue that Russia's chaotic, poorly regulated markets justify its shares' low prices.
In any case, the markets' gains in 1996 have made them less of a bargain. Hungarian shares now trade at 25 times earnings, for example, while Czech stocks trade at 15 times earnings. Fewer bargains may partly explain something that has surprised many Russia watchers: that Mr. Yeltsin's victory has not prompted a further surge in share values.
The markets have specific problems, too. Stefan Bottcher, investment adviser to Robert Fleming's Russia Securities Fund in London, thinks Hungary is the riskiest. It has high inflation and foreign debt and a big budget deficit, he said.
While the Czech market is the region's biggest, with 1,700 quoted companies, its tiny turnover shows that most stocks are illiquid. The Prague exchange, dominated by several large privatization funds, also has a reputation for insider trading, though a law passed this month may help minority shareholders.
Still, skeptics cannot argue about the region's performance, and for some the past will be prologue. "We are very optimistic about Russia," Ms. Insel said.

HEADLINE: Appeasement as a Way of Life

BYLINE: By John R. Bolton; John R. Bolton, president of the National Policy Forum, a Republican study organization, was an Assistant Secretary of State in the Bush Administration.

 BODY:
Our European allies are professing anger at a recent Congressional measure that would penalize any foreign company investing more than $40 million a year in the Iranian or Libyan oil and gas industries. The Europeans appeal to "free trade," but they miss the point; this dispute goes far beyond economics.
The real problem is that the West is divided and aimless in the face of real, direct and growing threats to the lives and security of its citizens. Although recent Congressional debate focused on Iran's and Libya's support for terrorism, the support of these and other nations for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical and biological -- is even more pressing. 
 Congressional measures, however laudable, do not constitute adequate international leadership. That can come only from the President of the United States. So far, the field of battle is largely empty.
The supineness of our European allies toward Iran and Libya has been a painful thing to watch. Hugo Paemen, the European Union's representative in Washington, recently spoke of "countermeasures" against United States sanctions, but the real question is when the Europeans will take effective measures against the real enemy: outlaw regimes that threaten their national interests.
The Europeans oppose sanctions and other such "extraterritorial" measures, but they offer little to resolve the threat of mass destruction posed by Iran and Libya (and Iraq, Syria and North Korea). Citing the Iranian role in the recent exchange of Lebanese prisoners for the remains of Israeli soldiers, the Europeans argue that they have rendered Iran less dangerous by keeping up a "critical dialogue" with it and selling it high-technology equipment.
But this argument demonstrates only that some Europeans have never lost faith in appeasement as a way of life. It is clear that Iran is cynically manipulating gullible (or equally cynical) Europeans to advance its development of weapons of mass destruction. Iran has made the "critical dialogue" an end in itself, and many Europeans have acquiesced in the charade for financial gain.
But Euroblindness is not the only problem, and perhaps not even the main one. No serious analyst expects the European Union to lead on this issue. Whatever the difficulty of defining American national interests, weapons proliferation offers a clear case for asserting Presidential leadership.
Populist pressures here have led Congress to take on part of the problem, terrorism, and it would be a short leap to the even greater issue of proliferation. Lawmakers like Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, seeing a dangerous vacuum of leadership, are seeking to fill it the only way Congress can, through legislation.
But what is really necessary here, Congress cannot do. Building an international coalition against the purveyors of terror and fearsome weapons requires Presidential leadership, persistence and determination. It means taking risky political positions, like whether (and when) to take military measures against the proliferators. It means undertaking the arduous work of wrenching reluctant allies into line.
It means leading an American public on an issue that now seems obscure, but that could quickly become tragically immediate. So far President Clinton has attended a substance-free summit meeting on terrorism, but he has not seriously confronted the Western allies, choosing instead to act as though the Constitution left foreign affairs to Congress.
Directly opposing weapons proliferation and terrorism requires a long-term American commitment, starting at the top. For now, I'm not holding my breath. Neither are the Europeans.

HEADLINE: Keeping Cool in a Roomful of Smoke at RJR Nabisco

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
PICTURE this job listing: Wanted, chief executive for tobacco/food company with restive shareholders; duties include shedding highly regarded food operations, reviving tobacco products that have been declining for decades and competing at home and overseas with larger, deeper-pocketed rivals; must have thick skin and get used to being called a "merchant of death."
Since leading such a company is not most top-flight managers' idea of fun, the board of RJR Nabisco Holdings had few obvious options when gruff Charles M. Harper told them he wanted to quit last December after 18 months on the job. They could have begun an arduous search for an impressive outsider, though experience suggested that any recruit might come with one eye on the exit. They could have promoted one of their two seasoned vice chairmen, but one of them, H. John Greeniaus, the chief executive of Nabisco Holdings, had scant interest in tobacco, and the other, James W. Johnston, had been shunted into restricted roles by Mr. Harper after failing to light up the struggling tobacco business. 
 The other choice -- and one reached unanimously and quickly -- was Steven F. Goldstone, who had recently been named president after coming to the company as part-time general counsel less than a year earlier. Mr. Goldstone, 50, who is shorter than average but not as slight as he looked next to the 6-foot, 6-inch Mr. Harper, had rapidly become the chief executive's most trusted strategic adviser. He had also impressed the board with his ability to speak clearly about the most complicated issues and won the respect of other RJR executives who found him far more approachable than his boss.
When the appointment of the little-known Mr. Goldstone was announced on Dec. 5, many on Wall Street regarded him as a possible short-timer in the executive parade that has marched through RJR's New York City headquarters since 1989 when RJR was taken private by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company in the largest leveraged buyout in history. Of his six predecessors, the longest reign had been the four-year stint of Louis V. Gerstner Jr., who cut out on the last year of his five-year contract in 1993 to take the more lucrative and influential job of turning around I.B.M.
These days, though, it looks as though Mr. Goldstone, a cigar smoker who gave up cigarettes at his doctor's insistence 17 years ago, has every intention of staying indefinitely -- and he has the directors' strong backing to do so. He was elected chairman in May as Mr. Harper completed his transition to retirement.
Clearly, stability at the top would give the company a better shot at solving some problems that have festered in the tumultuous years since the buyout. Like every tobacco company, RJR has had to battle growing public condemnation of its products and marketing practices, wave after wave of lawsuits and the threat of tougher Government regulation.
But it also has its own set of woes. Though it had revenue of $16 billion last year, it continues to lose ground at home to the Philip Morris Companies, a much larger rival, and is outgunned in the race to expand globally by both Philip Morris and B.A.T. Industries of Britain. It is still struggling to stem a long decline of premium brands like Winston and Salem. Mr. Goldstone, like his counterparts in the 1980's, is chafing at the low value Wall Street places on RJR stock.
"What the market wants out of this company is a sense it is in control of its fate," Mr. Goldstone said.
The closer Mr. Goldstone comes to satisfying the market, of course, the more assured will be his place in the anti-smoking lobby's pantheon of arch-villains. At the same time, though, Mr. Goldstone, a corporate lawyer who had never run a company, would win not just acclaim on Wall Street but the chance to cash in on a rich, incentive-laden contract, including a bonus of 200,000 shares if RJR's stock, which closed at $30.25 on Friday, reaches $43.75 in the next three years.
MR. GOLDSTONE sympathizes with Wall Street's skeptical attitude, which he sees as a predictable response to RJR's rocky history since 1988. It was in October of that year that F. Ross Johnson, then chairman and chief executive, ignored the advice of Mr. Goldstone, his outside lawyer, and announced a bid by an investment group that he led to take RJR private.
The ensuing buyout battle, which Mr. Johnson and his team, including the apprehensive Mr. Goldstone, lost to Kohlberg Kravis, raised RJR's stock price beyond Mr. Johnson's wildest dreams. But it also cost him and many of his senior lieutenants their jobs. And it saddled RJR with $25 billion of new debt, much of it junk bonds with interest rates that climbed as high as 17 percent.
As RJR's new owners, Kohlberg Kravis recruited high-profile executives to clean up the financial mess. First came Mr. Gerstner from American Express, who impressed subordinates with his attention to detail but who also made it clear from the start that he saw the company as a stepping stone to other jobs, several company insiders say.
After a brief interlude when two executives from the Gerstner team acted as co-chairmen, Kohlberg Kravis lured Mr. Harper, who was then 66, from Conagra Inc. to finish the financial restructuring. Mr. Harper, who had given up smoking after a heart attack, was renowned for building Conagra from a small Nebraska food company into a multinational giant. He closed his tenure with the introduction of the spectacularly successful Healthy Choice food products.
His primary missions at RJR were to pare debt and split off Nabisco, the food company, from RJR's tobacco operations. But the spinoff plan bogged down in a blizzard of anti-tobacco lawsuits after the initial public offering in January 1995 of 19.5 percent of Nabisco's stock. Frustrated, Mr. Harper announced plans in December to return to his home in Omaha to be with his ailing wife, and he persuaded the board to turn over the reins at RJR to Mr. Goldstone.
It was not a hard sell. Mr. Harper, who goes by the nickname "Mike" but has been called Big Foot behind his back, was known for intimidating subordinates. "Conflict is extraordinarily desirable in coming to good decisions," an unapologetic Mr. Harper said recently.
Maybe so, but in this case, it wasn't enough to produce the sort of results that would have made him a hero to the RJR board. The company's share price inched up 8 percent on his watch, to $30.25 from $28.125, while shares of RJR's archrival, Philip Morris, soared nearly 80 percent in the same period.
To be sure, Mr. Harper could assert that forces beyond his control were at work, including Kohlberg Kravis's sale of its 40 percent stake in the company. Earnings also suffered from a ferocious price war initiated by Philip Morris in 1993 in response to Mr. Gerstner's earlier bid to grab market share with bargain cigarette brands.
Still, Mr. Harper delivered no pleasant surprises to offset such setbacks, and Mr. Goldstone, who had joined RJR in February 1995, quickly established himself as a potential leader.
His rapid advance from part-time to full-time work, and in October, his promotion to president, were welcomed by many senior RJR managers, who were only too happy to drop by his office and let him serve as mediator with Mr. Harper.
Mr. Goldstone's most obvious assets -- the legal skills and financial experience accumulated during his years as a lawyer specializing in corporate mergers and acquisitions -- became steadily more valuable as lawsuits piled up, along with demands from dissatisfied shareholders led by Bennett S. LeBow and Carl C. Icahn, to hasten the Nabisco spinoff.
"You couldn't have designed a better person to lead the battle against LeBow," said Lawrence R. Ricciardi, the former RJR general counsel and president, who eventually followed Mr. Gerstner to I.B.M.
Perhaps his most deft feat was winning the trust of so many senior RJR executives while working so closely with the increasingly unpopular Mr. Harper. "His fingerprints are on all my key decisions," Mr. Harper said. "He participated in the important people changes, and not just by saying, 'Yes, Mike.' "
Mr. Goldstone has been involved in RJR affairs much longer than most outsiders realize.
The son of a manager at a nightgown factory, he grew up in the Westchester County suburbs of New York City and went straight to work as a Wall Street lawyer after graduating from New York University Law School. He represented RJR when it acquired Del Monte in 1979 and Nabisco when it merged with Standard Brands in 1980, four years before the food company was acquired by RJR. He caught the attention of RJR's general counsel, Mr. Ricciardi, during a 1994 review of tobacco litigation and became Mr. Ricciardi's first choice as successor when he departed.
Before moving from his law firm to RJR, Mr. Goldstone said, he gave considerable thought to the anti-tobacco sentiment in the United States.
"If I believed a lot of the stuff I've read I'd be troubled," he said. "But I'm comfortable that it's a legitimate pleasure for adults with known risks." He noted that he takes flying lessons, exposing himself to a danger that his friends describe as lunatic. "Not to sound too red-white-and-blue about it, but taking risks is what this country is about," he added.
Asked about the recent comment of Bob Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, that tobacco isn't necessarily addictive to all smokers, he said: "Millions of adults enjoy the products and also millions have chosen to stop smoking without the aid of treatment centers, clinics or drugs. I don't think there's a lot more to add on the issue."
Mr. Goldstone's more immediate concern is not smokers' perception of health risks, but investors' qualms about the risk of buying RJR stock. To court disgruntled shareholders, he pushed through a dividend increase and a $100 million share repurchasing program this spring.
The measures were modest compared with what investors have come to expect annually from Philip Morris, but RJR hopes that by moving in the same direction for the first time since 1988, it can show Wall Street that it no longer should be trading at such a large discount to its rival.
Mr. Goldstone also argues that the company is in a better competitive position overseas -- an explosive growth market -- than most American investors realize. While smoking in the United States has declined 20 percent in the last two decades, exports of American cigarettes have more than tripled. And the big producers, including RJR, have invested billions of dollars to acquire production capacity in newly open markets in Asia and Eastern Europe. In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe alone, where tobacco was formerly controlled by state-run monopolies, smokers light up 700 billion cigarettes annually, compared with 500 billion in the United States.
American companies' share of world cigarette production is just 13 percent, but consumer surveys show smokers' preferences in many countries shifting toward "American blend" products like Philip Morris's Marlboro and RJR's Camel and Winston.
"There's a 10-year window to grab enough market share that you are too big for even Philip Morris to crush when the dust settles," said Jason Wright, a company spokesman. Mr. Goldstone predicts that the company's $3.2 billion international operations will grow at least 10 percent this year, and by steadily increasing percentages for many years after.
A REMINDER of how hard it could be to meet such goals cropped up in RJR's second-quarter earnings, reported on Tuesday. International sales were flat because of economic disruptions in Russia. Over all, the company had operating profits slightly above Wall Street forecasts, although there was a net loss of $27 million after absorbing a $246 million charge for restructuring at Nabisco.
For now, RJR is focusing most of its international effort on building its leading brands in big markets where the company already has a significant presence, like its heavily advertised program for Camel Lights in France. One of its toughest tasks will be reversing the decline in its share of cigarette sales in the United States, now down to about 25 percent. The erosion has come despite the strong performance of its discount Doral brand and the stunning turnaround of Camel, after decades of weakening sales, into one of the fastest-growing premium brands.
One of RJR's newest marketing ploys has been the creation of the Moonlight family of brands, specialty cigarettes like Metro and City Lights that are sold in nightclubs, discos and other urban gathering spots. They are aimed at smokers looking for novelty, juch as microbreweries have been a hit among beer drinkers seeking more variety.
The company also maintains hopes for Eclipse, the nearly smokeless cigarette that it is now test-marketing. So far, it is performing better than Premier, the company's previous stab at creating a market for products that primarily heat tobacco rather than burn it. If either the Moonlight line or Eclipse gains even 1 percent of the $45 billion market, it would be the industry's most successful product introduction since the 1970's.
At the same time, the company continues to experiment with adjustments in the taste, packaging and image of its mature brands. The newest Winston slogan, "No bull," for example, is an allusion to the absence of additives, like moisturizers and flavors, in the tobacco of Winstons being test-marketed in Florida.
"We are trying to put innovative ideas behind a portfolio of products," Mr. Goldstone said. "Salespeople get charged up if they get a sense they are working for a company that isn't brain-dead."
Most tobacco analysts say the industry is undervalued and a few argue that RJR is actually a better bet than Philip Morris at current levels. Still, Wall Street remains skeptical: in recent months, Philip Morris has traded roughly 12 times its projected cash earnings, while RJR has been at 8 times. If the gap closed to the single point that prevailed in 1988 before RJR became so beholden to its bondholders and to Kohlberg Kravis, RJR's share price would soar by about 40 percent, to around $42.
"Most companies trading at eight times cash earnings are in miserable shape," Mr. Goldstone said. "We're not. We've just got to demonstrate we're through punishing shareholders." Even a lawyer would have a hard time arguing.

A Law to Learn 'Em a Thing or Two About the American Language

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

 BODY:
WILL Los Angeles change its name to "The Angels" if a new bill making English the official language of the United States becomes law?
Probably not. But it would likely end the printing of Social Security forms, Internal Revenue documents and United States Park Service pamphlets in any language other than English. Documents for public safety, health or national security would be exempt. 
 Last week the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee narrowly approved such a bill, 19 to 17, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against. The House may vote on the measure as early as September; the Senate is considering a similar bill.
Although English is indisputably the central language of American life, Republicans say its primacy needs to be codified because the Government is catering too heavily to a growing number of immigrants who do not speak English well. Democrats, disagreeing, say that more than 97 percent of Americans speak English well, and that an English-first law is unnecessary, unconstitutional and racist.
Legislators last week jousted over how language defines what it means to be American. They also joked about regional idiosyncrasies that make English spoken with a Texas twang unintelligible to a New Englander. The hearing, of course, included occasional lapses in grammar and syntax. ERIC SCHMITT
 
George Miller, Democrat of California: We promote Amtrak passes. We promote Park Services passes overseas. We use Federal dollars and Government officials to go overseas to promote American tourism. All of those pamphlets would have to be written in English?
Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina: The purpose is to conduct the official business of the Federal Government in English. However, exemptions the bill has include actions, documents or policies necessary for national security issues, international relations, trade or commerce would be exempt. I think Part B of the bill would exempt what you're talking about.
Miller: So we would have an exemption to try to get a tourist to come here from Italy, but we wouldn't help someone get their Social Security?
Graham: Well, if you want to put it that way, yeah.
Miller: The U.S.G.S.[Geological Survey], the Park Service and the Forest Service publish maps with non-English proper names and places for a good portion of the United States . . .

Graham: I think that would be covered under utilization of terms of art or phrases, like de facto, or any Latin phrase.
Miller: And Los Angeles or Arroyo Grande or Sierra Nevada? . . . (laughter)
Graham: I don't believe that's what we're getting after.

Randy (Duke) Cunningham, Republican of California: I think we're getting to the point of ridiculous. There are common terms that are used on maps, like Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. All of those things are acceptable, and the gentleman knows that.
Matthew G. Martinez, Democrat of California: There are legal residents here who would be a part of that Census who are not required to speak English because they have not applied for naturalization . . .
When you're trying to restrict people from getting the information they need, or the communication, you're going to end up costing us a lot more money than you save us . . . From the beginning of the immigration of this country, all parents have wanted their children to learn English as well as they can . . .
Cunningham: Again, the demagoguing is unbelievable . . . There is also a trend in this country for American citizens not knowing English, which inhibits their ability to improve themselves and prepare themselves for the 21st century. The issue isn't even documentation. The issue is that we're trying to empower people. . . .
Have you ever been in a foreign country and you hear someone speak English and it doesn't excite you? It empowers people. If you want to keep your people in a barrio, if you want to keep them restricted in little tight communities so only you can communicate with them, and we can't in English, then be my guest. But we're going to empower them to get out of that so they can have a piece of the American dream . . .
Martinez: I don't live in a ghetto. I wasn't raised in a ghetto. I was raised in a neighborhood of community people. I represent people from neighborhoods, not ghettos. But who has tried to keep people in ghettos is people with the mentality like this, that would rather than understand the unity and collegialness of the American people that can come from all different and diverse backgrounds, would want to force on somebody because of their paranoia about not being able to understand what someone else is saying.

Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana: I've been here 18 years and this is most maddening debate I've sat through, for me personally. It's absolutely maddening. We're missing each other on all sides. What is the problem and will this bill solve it?
Graham: One of the problems, for example, is the I.R.S. has sent out 500,000 publications that cost $113,000 in Spanish. They got 700-and-something replies back, and it was a $157 per publication. They're going to expand that program. I believe that's a problem we need to cut off now.

Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey: The majority is guilty of a lot of things in pushing this legislation and one of the things they're guilty of is very sloppy drafting. I understand it was asserted by the sponsor of this amendment that coinage would not be covered, so that printing E Pluribus Unum on our money would not be against the laws of the United States. I'm not so sure that's right . . . If a citizen sues here and claims that they're somehow aggrieved by use of Latin on our money or our coins, there is very clearly an issue of whether Latin is necessary for trade.
Graham: The exception that I would point the gentleman to is not the trade, commerce or international relations exception. It would be the exception that says documents that utilize terms of art or phrases from languages other than English would be exempt. I think our money is a document that does that and is exempt.
Andrews: With all due respect, you may think so, but that doesn't preclude someone from filing a suit and wasting probably more money than the I.R.S. spent to send out those income tax forms . . .

Chaka Fattah, Democrat of Pennsylvania: Since we've all been speaking in English all day long, it's clear that we're not communicating very well with each other.
I hope that since there seems to be one thread of bipartisanship here, which is that we all agree, I think, that it'd be helpful to promote Americans learning other languages and that we probably ought to do more to make English available to people. And maybe one day soon we would spend all day actually working on that rather than working at cross-purposes.
Cunningham: People say symbolism isn't important . . . I think, for example, an American citizen, the very first time you take the oath of this country, that you do it in English. It's only symbolic but it's very powerful.
Fattah: I think as an American citizen, if you could not speak or read at all, what is important is that you be committed to the ideals of this country, and that you be given the protection of the United States Constitution. This issue of language is about communication. What we should be working on is the substance of being an American, not the symbols so much.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Learning Curve

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
During the Israeli election campaign there was one commercial that the Likud used every night on TV. It was the sound of breaking glass, simulating the sound of a terrorist incident, followed by old news footage of Yasir Arafat and Shimon Peres walking hand-in-hand. I don't think we'll be seeing that commercial anymore. Last week, Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, went to Gaza and warmly shook hands with Mr. Arafat on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu's new Government. As Israeli commentators noted the next day, "There was no sound of broken glass."
The sound you do hear coming out of Israel these days is the sound of Mr. Netanyahu bumping up against the reality of the peace process. So far, the new Israeli Prime Minister seems to be trying to avoid doing anything that would derail the peace process, while at the same time avoiding anything that might advance it and cause a split in his right-wing party. He is clearly probing for how far he can go toward implementing his campaign rhetoric without blowing up the peace process that has brought Israelis so many tangible economic benefits and openings to the world, which they don't want to sacrifice. Only when Mr. Netanyahu finishes probing and starts making decisions, or faces a crisis, will we know whether he is just a more articulate version of Yitzhak Shamir, only capable of treading water, or a Menachem Begin, capable of historic decisions, even though they might cause splits within his party and people. 
 Mr. Netanyahu's evolution will be shaped in large part by Wall Street and the Arab Street.
Mr. Netanyahu presented himself in the U.S. as an apostle of free-market capitalism and privatization, eager to sell off state-owned Israeli companies to global and local investors. But what Mr. Netanyahu obviously has not thought through is how he is going to privatize Israel's economy while nationalizing its politics. Privatization requires Israel to be connected to the global market and to have a stable political environment that will attract foreign investors. Nationalizing Israel's politics -- by freezing the peace process, building new settlements and keeping Yasir Arafat at a distance -- will lead to renewed friction between Israelis and Arabs. The reason the vast majority of Israel's business leaders voted against Mr. Netanyahu was that they understood how important the peace process has been for their country. Israel's economy grew at a stunning rate of 7.1 percent in 1995. Last year, it attracted $2 billion in foreign investment -- triple the year before.
But since Mr. Netanyahu's election, the Tel Aviv stock market has lost 16 percent of its value, largely because of investor uncertainty about his economic policies, and concerns that his global economics will clash with his nationalistic politics. Israeli companies cannot afford that sort of uncertainty. In the first five months of 1996, Israeli companies raised about $900 million for new investment. Some 75 percent of that had to come from Wall Street, because there isn't enough local capital. Israel cannot keep growing at its current pace without Wall Street, and Wall Street wants stability, and you're not going to have that without a meaningful peace process. Yes, violence will also attend any peace process. We've seen that. But terrorism under Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres never really shook the Tel Aviv stock market because investors viewed such violence as going against the trend of events. But if violence erupts again now, with no peace process in sight, it will be viewed by many investors as a harbinger of things to come, and it could have a very negative economic impact.
As for the Arab street, Mr. Netanyahu seems to believe that Israel's military superiority over the Arab states will eventually lead to Arab passivity, and a peace process based on "peace for peace" instead of "land for peace." Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan had a similar view after the 1967 victory. The 1973 war cured them of that view. The Likud peddled the same illusion after Israel evicted the P.L.O. from Lebanon in 1982. That led to the intifada. Sooner or later, if the feeling takes hold that this Israeli Government does not want to treat Arabs with equality or keep open, however slightly, the possibility of trading land for real peace and personal security, there will be a reaction. It may not be from the Arab governments. It might simply erupt from below, and it would spoil any tranquillity in Israel -- sort of like the sound of breaking glass.

HEADLINE: The Language Wars;
To the Barricades, Speaking in Tongues

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
NEVER mind the French military might that rumbled down the Champs Elysees and roared overhead on Bastille Day. The struggle closest to French patriotic hearts is being fought out at the Olympic arenas of Atlanta -- and not by the athletes.
The French Foreign Ministry includes a whole office devoted to spreading the French language; its head, Margie Sudre, insisted vehemently on giving the French language its full due in Atlanta as the second official language of the Games. So 1,000 French-language interpreters have been in place to roam the Olympic village; scoreboards are written in French as well as English, and Mrs. Sudre was there in person on opening day to check up on how well the American organizers kept their promises to be multilingual.

 
 
French Fries Allowed
 
 Americans may have trouble understanding why the French care so much about their language's survival in an increasingly anglophone world. For all the official prickliness about French industrial espionage, no one in the United States talks of banning french fries as a subversive influence. But in French-speaking Quebec, stores are banned from using signs with English words in bolder type than their French equivalents.
There is lots of talk in Europe, too, about cultural diversity these days, but on this side of the Atlantic the phrase stands for the desire to preserve the separate cultural and linguistic identities of the European nation states even as they move toward closer unity. Nobody wants nationalistic rivalries like the ones that caused two world wars, but nowadays nobody wants a United States of Europe, either, a federal state where everybody sees the same movies, buys the same store brands and speaks the same language.
If that kind of federalism ever did triumph here, survival of the fittest would probably mean that the common lingo would turn out to be English. So France resists -- and so does Germany -- putting up a valiant fight to spread the culture and the values their languages bear, along with commerce.
In Germany's case, proselytizing for the tongue of Luther and Goethe is partly a way of telling people that Hitler and the Holocaust are not all there is to German history. The larger reason for the sensitivity, and the one Germany and France share, is that the Continental tongues are so badly outnumbered in the world today. French, notably, remains the official language of 21 countries and the co-official language of five more, including Canada. But the number of French speakers in all of them -- about 200 million -- does not even equal the population of Brazil, where the lingua franca is Portuguese. English, though, is used by one out of every seven people on the globe.
European colonialism is what originally spread French (as it did English, Portuguese, and Spanish) so widely. Now, the French language is helping keep the colonial-era ties alive. Mrs. Sudre, who heads the Francophone Secretariat in the French Foreign Ministry, was born in French Indochina in 1943 and didn't even learn French, her father's language, until she was 8 years old. Ho Chi Minh's revolutionaries expelled the French colonial regime in 1954, but Vietnam has invited France's President, Jacques Chirac, to Hanoi next year for the seventh annual meeting of the 49 nations of the francophone movement, or Francophonie, which includes lands where the language is culturally respected if not exactly widely spoken.
"I don't think that you can compare the situation of French in the world with English," she said. "The English that is spreading around the globe is really Anglo-American, not the pure English of Shakespeare's day. We want to try to preserve the richness, subtlety and precision of the French language against the challenge of this new form of English."
Purity of language and the ideals of freedom get talked about a lot at gatherings of the Francophonie, but France also wants to preserve economic influence in the world, and is wary of the advantage that speaking English gives to English-speaking countries like the United States in global trade.
French speakers are not the only ones with a messianic urge. The German Government spends $200 million a year spreading German and German culture through 150 Goethe Institutes in 70 countries, but the German effort lacks the defensive overtone of the campaign led by France, which spends $1 billion on francophony. It doesn't bother Germans, for example, to call the programs that run computers "die Software." The French, on the other hand, insist "logiciel" is better.

 
 
The New Battleground
 More people in places like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic speak German than French, and the French fear that in the long run their influence in the European Union will wane as these countries become members. French used to be the language of diplomacy, not of war, and in part France yearns for the power and influence that it had when Cardinal Richelieu and Talleyrand had to be listened to in the royal courts of Europe.
So Mr. Chirac insists that the heads of international organizations nowadays should be able to speak French -- one reason France is eager to re-elect Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who speaks fluent French, as the United Nations Secretary General even though the United States opposes him.
In a moment of humility, Mr. Chirac might concede that the language spoken by most people today is Mandarin Chinese. But then, he might say, it does not need to struggle to preserve itself.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
America's Quiet Rebellion Against McDonaldization

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
AS millions of tourists flocked here for the Centennial Olympics this summer, many expected to find Tara and Scarlett and Rhett.
Instead, they found a Gap, a Gap Kids, the Limited and a Limited Too in a single mall. They also found that any anticipated charm had been muted by the kind of security that, since Lockerbie, the World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, and T.W.A. Flight 800, seems to have turned crowd events in so many American cities into near-military operations. 
 And any doubts that the security was needed evaporated early yesterday morning when an explosion rocked Centennial Olympic Park, killing at least two people and wounding more than 100 others.
The tourists may have concluded that whatever regional color Atlanta once had was long ago paved over.
Social scientists, too, have spent decades describing the nation's homogenization through network television and national brands, retailers and restaurant chains. "The McDonaldization of Society," one recent volume called it.
But arguably what's been happening in the mid-1990's is more like the Carolina-barbecuing, Cajun-seasoning and Tex-Mex-taco-stuffing of America. In regions often distinguished by common culture and not by the arbitrary political boundaries that define cities and states, a more mature sense of local identity has been thriving.
The Old, or Original, Regionalism grew from the earth and flourished under skies that gave the nation's distant locales their own foods, livelihoods, cultures and myths, from the cotton and salt-cured country ham of the South to the timber and planked salmon of the Northwest. Thriving in isolation, the Old Regionalism was above all provincial and humble.
The New Regionalism has seen the world and come back home. Forerunners of the New Regionalism can be found at least as far back as Charles Ives, who sent rivers of clashing rhythms coursing through his New England landscape, and William Faulkner. Even now, the regional revival is furthering the nation's long evolution from a provincial outpost of European tastes into a fresh cultural font, often removing the velvet ropes between high arts and low.
In Texas, a writer like Larry McMurtry, who once loudly rejected the tradition of historical cowboy novels, has since the 1980's returned to it with realism and harsh irony.
A decade ago, visitors to Dallas, Houston or Atlanta would be taken out for demonstrations that local chefs could cook authentic French or Continental cuisine -- at places invariably named La Maison de la Casa House, Calvin Trillin once said. Now they will have New Texan or New South, with chile verde or cheese grits.
If many corporations still impose their blandly uniform products on every corner of the nation, they are also spending more time scouring the country for regional trends, products and fashions that can be merchandised coast to coast.
Last year, Campbell Soup Company, knowing that salsa outsells ketchup, bought Pace Foods of San Antonio, a salsa maker, for $1.1 billion.

 
 
The Same Old Hops
 Now, behemoth breweries like Anheuser-Busch are trying to masquerade as local microbrewers. Elk Mountain Red Lager and Elk Mountain Amber Ale are named after Anheuser's hops farm in Idaho. For other beers made with the same hops, try Michelob or Bud.
Pollsters who can see past the Planet Hollywoods punctuating more and more cities notice that sharp distinctions between those cities persist.
"Regional differences tend to hold up over time," said Tom Smith, director of General Social Surveys at the University of Chicago.
In the 1970's, when these surveys began, Southerners were much more likely than other Americans to hunt, go to church and favor bans on homosexual college professors and racial intermarriage. Although every region has moderated its outlook on most racial and social matters since then, Southern ways on all these points remain just as distinctive, except that Southerners hunt less as they domesticate in suburbs and cities.

 
 
Stuck at Age Six
 As Mr. Smith of the University of Chicago notes, by the time children learn of national brands and network news, family, neighbors and schools have already passed along their local values. Racial attitudes are formed by age six, and most people practice our parents' religion.
Until yesterday's blast, Atlanta may have been viewed as the world's biggest billboard for plastic watchmakers and other proud Olympic sponsors. But in a week it goes back to being the sort of place whose suburbs sent Newt Gingrich to Washington, and where "How was church?" remains a standard Sunday afternoon greeting.
Far less reverent of the past than true antebellum citadels like Charleston and Savannah, Atlanta has thrived as a go-between, providing the transportation and services to link Northern markets and capital with the rest of the South. To appeal to all sides, Atlanta crafted a back-slapping but businesslike image. It was not exactly the stuff of carefully choreographed opening and closing Olympic ceremonies. "How are we supposed to make a number about economic opportunity?" the director of the ceremonies recently complained. "Have 5,000 dancing guys with briefcases?"
For all the new business executives, though, the region is as likely to change them as the other way around. Migrants generally absorb many of the values of their new communities.
"People move, neighborhoods stay the same," said Michael J. Weiss, author of "Latitudes and Attitudes: An Atlas of American Tastes, Trends, Politics and Passions" (Little, Brown, 1994).
Regional differences are now being reinforced by foreign ties too, as trade, international investment and immigration swell.
The Northeast is most closely tied to Europe and its fashions, food and culture. Miami is a Latin American capital and airline hub. Texas, responsible for nearly half the nation's exports to Mexico, has become a state of two nations. The West Coast depends more and more on the rest of the Pacific Rim, while the Northwest welcomes shoppers and immigrants from the newly opened Russian Far East.
Despite the debate over immigration, the nation's growing appreciation of its own regional diversity is tied to its growing tolerance that surveys indicate for racial and ethnic diversity.
Tourism has given the New Regionalism an added payoff. But if tourism furthers historic preservation in cities like Savannah, it also fosters a Disneyesque packaging designed to fulfill tourists' fantasies about what a city or region should look like. Movie-set Hawaii blooms at zillion-dollar Maui resorts, movie-set Atlanta thrives at a downtown restaurant like Pittypat's Porch, named for Scarlett's aunt, and movie-set New York is beginning to spring up in the rebuilding of Times Square, in which Disney has a stake.
Increasingly, though, many of the nation's habits and trends flow not from the cosmopolitan coasts, but outward from the Nashvilles, Austins and Santa Fes. Some of New York's most savvy restaurateurs, the owners of the Ollie's Chinese Noodle Shops and Carmine's Italian restaurants around Times Square and elsewhere, have most recently given midtown Manhattan a Virgil's, offering barbecue platters including Owensboro (Ky.) lamb, Memphis pork ribs and pulled Carolina pork shoulder.
Still, the New York state of mind requires the menu to note that the 1994 Chateau de la Chaise Brouilly goes well with Texas hot links and the ribs.

HEADLINE: Get a Job;
The New Contract With America's Poor

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the movement to repeal welfare boiled across the Senate last week, a noteworthy chart appeared on the chamber floor. Decorated with a sketch of a creeping infant, it advertised a Democratic amendment to provide vouchers to those children -- as many as four million -- who could be dropped from government rolls if the bill becomes law.
Through an eerie enumeration, the poster specified what the vouchers could buy: 
 Clothing.
Diapers.
Cribs.
Medicine.
School Supplies.
That the Democrats' hopes for the welfare poor has been reduced to a plan to salvage some diapers speaks volumes about the national debate. That the amendment failed says even more.
There's no doubt that the Republican bill, which passed the House and Senate and will be sent to the White House as soon as this week, would "end welfare as we know it." (To quote a certain President, now immersed in his re-election drive.)
The risk is that it may also end poverty as we know it. By making it even worse.
To the public, that may seem unimaginable, so wretched are the nine million children and four million parents who now receive aid, and so discredited is the program that sustains them. But the Republican plan does not "reform" welfare, which is known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. Technically, it abolishes it.

 
 
It's a Free Market
 In its place, it offers laissez-faire hopes that, faced with the consequences of bad luck and poor choices, the needy will somehow shape up. No doubt, some will.
But the weight of the evidence suggests that most either cannot or will not lift themselves from poverty in an economy where, for more than two decades, the bottom has been dropping out for low-skilled workers. In a nation that already has the highest child poverty rates in the industrialized world the poor may indeed get poorer. And more numerous and desperate as well.
Whatever the bill's substantive demerits, it succeeds brilliantly in what may be its deeper purpose: putting an electioneering President firmly on the spot.
If he signs the measure as is, President Clinton will appear to have fulfilled his famous pledge about ending welfare. In truth, he will have abandoned the vision that animated the slogan. Having sought office with the aim of a redefined social contract -- health care for every American -- he will be seeking re-election with a bill that begrudges poor infants their Pampers.
If he vetoes the bill, Mr. Clinton can preserve his allegiance to his original purpose, which promised more for the poor while demanding more from them. But he can also expect a rainstorm of Republican ridicule, from here to Election Day. In sending back a welfare bill for the third time, he will insure a parade of 30-second television ads calling him a back-tracker and a flip-flopper, a pledge-breaking defender of the status quo.
Welfare slogans are often at odds with welfare substance, as Mr. Clinton himself well knows, being a master of both. He underscored the distinction last week, in giving earthy consideration to what the Senate called welfare reform. "You can put wings on a pig, but you don't make it an eagle," he said.

 
 
No Promises Now
 But what the President didn't say last week was equally important. He didn't say he would veto the bill.
"He keeps his promise and he abandons his principles -- or he keeps his principles and abandons his promise," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Mr. Clinton's most vocal Democratic critic. "That's the dilemma he's in."
While the President is caricatured as a defender of the status quo, it's his activism that has landed him in this thicket.
"End welfare as we know it" -- it was remarkably bold and utterly vague, this snippet of 1992 campaign rhetoric that now holds social policy hostage. Had a Republican first said it, he or she would have been diagnosed with a case of hard-heartedness. But Mr. Clinton, a child advocate and husband of a child advocate, brought the notion instant credibility.
And great misunderstanding. Many people heard only the first two words: end it. But Mr. Clinton was mindful of the as-we-know-it qualifier. He was talking about new training programs, expanded child care, universal health care and, if need be, last-resort government jobs for those who exhausted a two-year limit.
When he finally put his plan in writing, in June 1994, it would have "invested" an extra $10 billion over five years in the hopes of future payoffs. Now he faces a plan that heads $70 billion in the other direction. It cuts $60 billion from the anti-poverty budget and ends welfare by, well, ending welfare.
Under the Republican plan, families may receive no more than five years of benefits in a lifetime, and states can set much lower limits -- as little as, say, 30 days.
According to estimates by LaDonna Pavetti of the Urban Institute, if the five-year limit were in effect today, about 2 million adults, with 4.5 million children, would be instantly shorn from the rolls. They are among the nation's least educated people, and are concentrated in the most blighted areas. In Detroit, 67 percent of the children receive welfare in the course of a year; in New York it's 39 percent. On what will they get by?
The Republicans haven't answered that question as much as they've turned it around: the middle class supports itself, so why can't the poor? With a handful of Democratic allies, they've put the status quo on trial. "We know the present system is a complete disaster," said Representative Clay Shaw, a Florida Republican and an architect of the House bill.
Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, says the apocalypse is now. "Millions of children are in poverty, with their parents leading lives of desperation and hopelessness," he wrote last week, in urging the President to sign the bill.
Virtually no one defends the current system, whose ameliorative successes are invisible (money for shoes or a bowl of cereal) and whose major flaws are on full display. It is an affront to prized values -- work, family, initiative and independence. The public hates it for good reasons (its indulgence of the indolent) and for bad reasons (its disproportionate support of racial minorities, who stay on the rolls longer).

 
 
The Risk of Chaos
 But to say the current system has failed is not to say it can't get worse. The few Democrats trying to salvage the safety net include the system's most acute detractors. Mr. Moynihan's fame originally derived from his warnings about illegitimacy. Edward I. Koch, former Mayor of New York, made a career of denouncing freeloaders. Now he asks, "Are we at the point in our history when we will permit children to starve?"
Of course not -- the Republican bill would not do that. Indeed, it offers more than last year's version (more day care money, more medical care), which is partly what tempts the President to sign it.
The risk isn't starvation; it's just additional chaos, hurt and need. The Urban Institute estimates the bill will drive 2.6 million people below the poverty line -- not to mention what it might do to those already there.
The nation's most successful job-placement program for welfare recipients, in Riverside, Calif., trimmed caseloads by about 10 percent; in removing anyone who has received benefits for more than five years, the Republicans assume that fully half of those on welfare can make it on their own. The Riverside program raised job earnings 26 percent -- to an average of $286 a month.
No doubt the harsh reality of an empty stomach will cause some people to do better. Some may indeed get jobs and marry, as Mr. Shaw predicts. Others may turn to prostitution or the drug trade. Or cling to abusive boyfriends. Or have more abortions. Or abandon their children. Or camp out on the streets and beg.
No one knows because no such risks have ever been taken. But if misery were motive enough, presumably the poor would have reformed themselves by now.
How odd that such a bill may become the chief legislative legacy of the first children's advocacy President. In deciding whether to affix his signature, Mr. Clinton will have to choose between welfare reform as he knew it and welfare repeal as his opponents came to define it.

HEADLINE: Serbs in Pragmatic Pullout from Albanian Region

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Serbia, July 22

 BODY:
In 1989 the Serbian strongman, Slobodan Milosevic, swooped down in a helicopter onto the field where 600 years earlier the Turks had defeated the Serbs at the Battle of Kosovo. In a fervent speech before a million Serbs, he galvanized the nationalist passions that two years later fueled the Balkan conflict.
Now, in this bedraggled southern province of Kosovo, a predominantly Albanian Muslim region where President Milosevic promised a glorious future for the minority Serbs, the Balkan conflict appears to be playing out a subdued denouement. 
 More than 90 percent of Kosovo's two million people are Albanians, and their resentment of Serbia's assertion of dominance has long made Kosovo a tinderbox that has threatened to entangle Macedonia, Albania, Greece and Turkey in a wider Balkan conflict.
But instead of seeing Kosovo reinforced as a Serbian stronghold with the resettlement of Serbs from the former Yugoslavia, as Mr. Milosevic promised, the last Serbs of Kosovo are fleeing, embittered that their leader appears to be deserting them.
"Many Serbs are leaving right now," said Momcilo Tradkovic, a former Serbian Governor of Kosovo. "More than 50 percent of the Serbs in Kosovo have already built houses in Serbia. If this continues, the bulk of the Serbs will leave in the next five years, and after that it won't matter."
The idea that Mr. Milosevic might allow Kosovo, the cradle of Serb history and mythology, to drift away would have been preposterous at the height of the Balkan war.
But boxed in by the Dayton peace agreement, which requires Serbia to safeguard the rights of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo or forgo access to international credits, Mr. Milosevic appears to be undecided about what to do, Western diplomats say.
The United States, in an attempt to demonstrate its seriousness about enforcing the accord, opened an information center here on July 20 -- the first office of a foreign power in Kosovo's capital. And in another effort to keep Mr. Milosevic on better behavior, the Clinton Administration has said it will not send an ambassador to Belgrade while Serbian authorities continue to abuse Albanians' human rights.
The possibility that Mr. Milosevic may be preparing to soften his stance on Kosovo was further signaled in a recent paper by a member of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, who argued that the Albanians and Serbs should share power in Kosovo or divide the province into two ethnic enclaves. In the past, Mr. Milosevic has often used the academy as a harbinger of policy shifts.
And in a move that was interpreted by the Serbs of Kosovo as another betrayal by the leader they increasingly distrust, Mr. Milosevic signed an agreement with the German Government this month that calls for the return to Kosovo of 120,000 Albanian refugees now in Germany.
The tensions over Kosovo intensified in 1990 when Mr. Milosevic infuriated the Albanian majority by revoking Kosovo's autonomy and incorporating it into Serbia. He then strengthened the hand of the heavily armed Serbian police who, human rights monitors say, have made life miserable for the Albanians. About 120,000 Albanians have been dismissed from jobs in state-run plants in the last five years, the monitors say, and Albanians have been subject to arbitrary arrests, beatings and shakedowns.
In 1993 Zeljko Raznjatovic, the paramilitary leader known as Arkan, who did much of the "ethnic cleansing" of Bosnia for Mr. Milosevic, turned up in Kosovo to warn the Albanians what might be in store for them.
Human-rights abuses persist, said Fred Abraham, a monitor from Human Rights Watch in New York, who recently spent a month in Kosovo.
"The most severe problem is police violence and torture," he said, adding that Albanians were frequently stopped in their cars by the police and beaten. Detention and sometimes torture in prison were particularly directed to politically active Albanians, he said.
Ibrahim Rugova, a former Albanian Communist leader during Tito's rule, has been leading a campaign for Albanian independence. Some more moderate Albanian leaders say they would accept a halfway step of autonomy, leading to eventual independence. To underline this goal, Mr. Rugova has formed a shadow government and established separate Albanian schools, medical facilities and local councils, much of it with funds from Albanians abroad.
Mr. Rugova's nonviolent civil disobedience and his support from Albanian exiles in Switzerland, Germany and the United States have resulted in a parallel society. Satellite dishes directed toward Tirana, the capital of Albania, enhance even the poorest Albanian dwelling here, suggesting that while Albanians physically live in Serbian-ruled territory, mentally they are elsewhere.
The inability of the financially strapped Mr. Milosevic to prevent the economic free fall in Kosovo is also propelling the steady Serb exodus, Serbs say.
"There is no life for us here," said Milica Borzos, a Serbian pensioner whose ancestry in Kosovo goes back centuries and who has seen the once prosperous zinc mining town of Zvecan, where she lives, sink into despair.
With most industry shuttered and agriculture moribund, Kosovo is kept afloat largely from the proceeds of Albanian drug-running to Europe and remittances from Albanian expatriates.
With the help of the drug money that filters down into Albanian villages from the couriers who drive their flashy cars from Kosovo to Switzerland, many Albanians are able to build a future that some Serbs, Mr. Tradkovic asserted, are beginning to envy.
In Veliki Trnovac, a strategically located Serbian village that borders Kosovo, a handful of tightly knit Albanian families are reported by Western drug enforcement agencies to control the traffic of heroin as it passes from Turkey to Germany and Switzerland.
Expensive European cars with Swiss license plates and tinted windows parked on the village's narrow streets are the only outward signs of the courier system that is reportedly run out of the village. But a cafe owner gave a sense of the importance of the European connections.
"There are 25-year-old men who linger in the street who have never worked in their lives," said the owner, who would give his name only as Ibrahim. "They are just waiting for money to come from Switzerland."
To help pay the $300-a-month rent for his cafe, Ibrahim said, he received money from three brothers in Switzerland.
Fehmi Agani, a sociology professor and vice president of the main Albanian party, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo, acknowledged that Albanians were involved in drug trafficking. But he said that the Albanians were not "in charge" of the drug trade and served only as couriers. "People have no other way to survive," he said.
And when Kosovo Albanians end up in Swiss jails on charges of drug trafficking -- about 3,000 are currently being held -- life is not so bad, he said.
"A large number of people live better in jail in Switzerland than here in freedom," said Mr. Agani, who gets by with the help of $150 his son sends each month from Germany.
The ability of the Albanians to survive economically, by legal or other means, rankles many Serbs, particularly those who arrived in Kosovo last year as refugees from Croatia.
In the basement of an ostentatious sports hall here built by Tito to celebrate the brotherhood of Yugoslavia's Serbs and Albanians languish about 500 ethnic Serbs who fled the Krajina region of Croatia last year as Croatian troops advanced and Mr. Milosevic failed to come to the Serbs' defense.
Instead of finding refuge in the heart of Serbdom, they now feel abandoned at the end of the world.
About 15,000 of the estimated 150,000 Krajina Serbs were sent by the Belgrade authorities to Kosovo. And like many of their Kosovo brethren, they are desperate to leave.
Mladenka Rajlic, the mother of two children, has visited all the shrines of Kosovo: ornate Orthodox churches, monasteries and the medieval battlefield where Mr. Milosevic proclaimed his vision of a new Serbia.
But history left her unimpressed.
"God forbid I should stay here; this place is 300 years behind civilization," Mrs. Rajlic shuddered as she sat in a makeshift room with no running water. "I'm only 36 and I'd rather die than remain in Kosovo."
