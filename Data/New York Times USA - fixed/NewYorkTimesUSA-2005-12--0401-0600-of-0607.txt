HEADLINE: Coca Advocate Wins Election for President in Bolivia

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Dec. 18 

 BODY:
Evo Morales, a candidate for president who has pledged to reverse a campaign financed by the United States to wipe out coca growing, scored a decisive victory in general elections in Bolivia on Sunday.
 Mr. Morales, 46, an Aymara Indian and former coca farmer who also promises to roll back American-prescribed economic changes, had garnered up to 51 percent of the vote, according to televised quick-count polls, which tally a sample of votes at polling places and are considered highly accurate.
At 9 p.m., his leading challenger, Jorge Quiroga, 45, an American-educated former president who was trailing by as much as 20 percentage points, admitted defeat in a nationally televised speech. 
 At his party's headquarters in Cochabamba, Mr. Morales said his win signaled that ''a new history of Bolivia begins, a history where we search for equality, justice and peace with social justice.''
 ''As a people who fight for their country and love their country, we have enormous responsibility to change our history,'' he said.
 Mr. Quiroga's concession signaled that he was prepared to step aside and avoid a protracted selection process in Congress, which, under Bolivian law, would choose between the top two finishers if neither obtained at least 50 percent of the vote.
 ''I congratulate Evo Morales,'' Mr. Quiroga said in a somber speech.
 The National Electoral Court had not tabulated results on Sunday night, though Mr. Morales echoed the early polls and claimed to have won a majority.
 His margin of victory appeared to be a resounding win that delivered the kind of mandate two of his predecessors, both of whom were forced to resign, never had. Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian-born political analyst from Florida International University in Miami, said Mr. Morales could be on his way to becoming ''the president with the most legitimacy since the transition to democracy'' from dictatorship a generation ago.
 A Morales government would become the first indigenous administration in Bolivia's 180-year history and would further consolidate a new leftist trend in South America, where nearly 300 million of the continent's 365 million people live in countries with left-leaning governments.
 Though most of those governments are politically and economically pragmatic, a Morales administration signals a dramatic shift to the left for a country that has long been ruled by traditional political parties disparaged by many Bolivians.
 The victory by Mr. Morales will not be welcomed by the Bush administration, which has not hidden its distaste for the charismatic congressman and leader of the country's federation of coca farmers. American officials have warned that his election could be the advent of a destabilizing alliance involving Mr. Morales, Fidel Castro of Cuba and Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, who has seemed determined to thwart American objectives in the region.
 In comments to reporters after casting his vote in the Chapara coca-growing region on Sunday , Mr. Morales said his government would cooperate closely with other ''anti-imperialists,'' referring to Venezuela and Cuba. He said he would welcome cordial relations with the United States, but not ''a relationship of submission.''
 He also pledged that under his government his country would have ''zero cocaine, zero narco-trafficking but not zero coca,'' referring to the leaf that is used to make cocaine.
 Mr. Chavez, who has met frequently with Mr. Morales, expressed confidence that Bolivia would turn a new page with the election. ''We are sure what happens today will mean another step in the integration of the South America of our dreams, free and united,'' he said earlier in the day from Venezuela.
 The election, which was marked by personal attacks, pitted two fundamentally different visions for how to extricate Bolivia from poverty. While Mr. Quiroga pledged to advance international trade, Mr. Morales promised to squeeze foreign oil companies and ignore the International Monetary Fund's advice.
 Mr. Morales enjoyed strong support in El Alto, a largely indigenous city adjacent to the capital, La Paz, where voters said they had tired of years of government indifference.
 ''The hope is that he can channel our needs,'' said Janeth Zenteno, 31, a pharmacist in El Alto. ''We have all supported Evo. It is not just what he says. It is that this is his base and he knows us.''
 For Javier Sukojayo, 40, a teacher, the election could signal a transformation of Bolivia into a country where the poor have more say. 
 ''It has been 500 years of oppression since the Spanish came here,'' said Mr. Sukojayo, who counts himself as indigenous. ''If we are part of the government -- and we are the majority -- we can make new laws that are in favor of the majority.''

HEADLINE: Small Internet Retailers Are Using Web Tools to Level the Selling Field

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
AMAZON, Walmart.com and other online retailing giants have always had upstarts nipping at their heels. But the little guys are starting to bite harder.
 Just how sharp their teeth are, however, is a matter of some debate.
Of the $26 billion in sales that are projected for Internet retailers this holiday season, about 45 percent will go to small retailers, according to Forrester Research, up from 42 percent last year. Even so, with revenues starting to flatten at eBay, the site so many of them use to market their wares, some analysts doubt they will ever be able to break through the 50 percent mark.
 But other analysts are not so sure. In the fast-changing world of Internet commerce, they say, smaller merchants have gained two important advantages: Google and consumers who are fussier than ever. 
 ''The game has changed,'' said Gene Alvarez, an analyst with Gartner, a technology consulting firm. 
 In years past, any retailer could put up a Web site fairly easily, although it had little chance of attracting the attention of Web browsers unless it had enough money to advertise on well-known sites like AOL and MSN. Yahoo and Amazon, which have long sold cheap Internet storefronts to small businesses, sweetened the deal by listing the businesses on their sites in return for a sales commission.
 But that exposure, while significant, pales in comparison to the publicity Web merchants can now gain by spending a few nickels per click on a text ad on Google. ''Before, people couldn't find these smaller guys,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''But now these stores can be much more easily discovered on Google.''
 At the same time, consumers are displaying a growing appreciation for small online retailers. According to the Kelsey Group, a media consulting firm, the portion of Internet searches that include local elements like ''dry cleaners and Greenwich Village'' or ''art galleries in Easton'' has doubled in the last year to 20 percent.
 One reason for that, no doubt, is the spread of high-speed Internet connections, which allow users to click through multiple merchants without waiting hours for Web pages to load.
 All of which leads to another phenomenon that could further threaten the dominance of the big players -- simplified e-commerce software with the potential to lure hordes of hitherto reluctant merchants onto the Internet.
 According to eBay, nearly 650,000 small businesses in the United States have an online presence, a sizable figure but a tiny fraction of the 7.5 million companies that the Kelsey Group estimates market most of their goods directly to consumers. Many of the holdouts have resisted the Web because they deem the transition to be too difficult, too expensive or both. But now, Yahoo Stores, ProStores from eBay, NetSuite and other companies that help businesses operate online hope to change the minds of the hesitant with software and services that are cheaper and easier to use.
 ''We're moving into the next generation for small and medium-sized businesses who want to sell online,'' said Mr. Alvarez of Gartner. ''Even a one-person shop can open an online store that's much more refined than it would've been a few years ago.''
 Liz Herbert, a Forrester analyst, said the biggest change in e-commerce software in the last few years was that it no longer comes in a box. It is delivered online, so businesses do not need technology specialists to install and run the company's system.
 EBay has for years offered sellers the chance to set up their own ministores, called storefronts, in this fashion, but the company this year intensified its efforts to reach small businesses that might not be interested in selling solely on its site. In January, it bought Kurant, an e-commerce software company, for an undisclosed sum; this year it renamed the service ProStores and upgraded the software with added features. 
 According to Chris Tsakalakis, eBay's senior director of stores and platforms, the ProStores service, which costs from $7 to $250 monthly, gives sellers templates to use in setting up a store, and will carry an online catalog of 10 items or more. For those who pay $30 or more a month, the service includes a personalized Web address, a secure checkout process and a selection of more sophisticated business tools, like those that help managers improve the store's rankings on search engine results.
 Such software tools sound like an obvious place for Google's engineers to focus, particularly if the company wants to attract more local businesses online so they will buy more Google ads. But Google -- which last month began giving away software to help Internet managers analyze their site traffic, but has not otherwise pushed into e-commerce services -- does not offer live customer service, and this is one market where such service is critical, executives said.
 ''We have hundreds of live agents that are highly trained, answering questions around the clock,'' said Rich Riley, vice president and general manager of Yahoo Small Business. ''That gives us a real head start.''
 And increasingly, these services include more than just the ability to post a Web site and accept transactions. NetSuite, a privately held company co-founded by Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, and Evan Goldberg, one of Oracle's chief technologists, has improved its tools for companies that want to manage their entire business -- including payroll, shipping and marketing -- through the Internet.
 For some retailers, like Mess Makeup, a New York seller of cosmetics, that is the most important feature in the latest incarnation of e-commerce services. ''I could go to the Bahamas, pull out my laptop, look at inventory, see how many leads came in, track people's shipping, and everything's extremely user-friendly,'' said Adam Furman, a former software consultant who co-founded Mess Makeup two months ago.
 Mr. Furman, who pays NetSuite about $1,000 a month for one of its more sophisticated service offerings, said he would have had to spend $500,000 to $1 million to develop the same technology on his own a few years ago. ''And we would've needed to hire a tech team of our own,'' he said. ''Now we can concentrate more on just selling makeup and building our business.''

HEADLINE: Crispin Porter Will Open An Office in Colorado 

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Crispin Porter & Bogusky is borrowing a page from the playbook of technology companies that open offices in cities where engineers like to work. Crispin Porter, part of MDC Partners, plans to open an office next summer in Boulder, Colo., to offer its nearly 400 employees an alternative to the Miami headquarters. 
 ''This business is increasingly becoming about talent, who can get and keep the best talent,'' said Chuck Porter, chairman at Crispin Porter. Offering employees a place to work ''that's the opposite of Miami is a new benefit,'' he added, ''like a matching 401(k).''
The agency plans to relocate 40 to 50 employees to Boulder, Mr. Porter said, adding that he and Alex Bogusky, the executive creative director, would spend time there. Crispin Porter, whose clients include Burger King, Gap and Volkswagen, also has a small office in Venice, Calif., that handles media assignments.

HEADLINE: A Down Payment on New Orleans

 BODY:
It is cheering to see that New Orleans has not been completely forgotten. The White House's request for an additional $1.5 billion for hurricane protection demonstrates that the city's fate has not slipped entirely off the agenda in Washington. As a result, residents hoping to return to their homes in time for Christmas can think about rebuilding with a little more confidence than before. 
 Most important of all, it ought to remove from the table for good the question of whether we should or would rebuild the city. We must rebuild it -- or to be more precise, give New Orleans the ability to rebuild itself. The administration has indicated it will stand by President Bush's pledge to do so. The issue now is not whether to do it, but how to do it right.
 As a first step, the White House request is a good one. But if this is the entire plan to protect greater New Orleans, it is woefully insufficient. It may protect against a storm of Katrina's size, but probably not a more ferocious one. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana probably put it best when she called it a ''down payment.'' 
 The president's absence at the announcement is also duly noted. He needs to step up personally and more forcefully to ensure that New Orleans receives the support he has promised it. And even this interim victory can't be declared too soon -- Congress still needs to act on his proposal and the larger aid package of which it would be a part.
 The president had previously committed $1.6 billion to repair the levees and the floodwalls that failed during Hurricane Katrina, patching and restoring them to their strength before the monster storm hit. The additional money would be used to reinforce the levees where they are vulnerable with concrete and rock. It would pay for new pumping stations to get the water out of the city. Several canals that carried the massive storm surge would be closed off, most likely with gates.
 On the day of the announcement, the mayor of New Orleans, Ray Nagin, stood next to Mr. Bush's Hurricane Katrina reconstruction czar, Donald Powell, and praised the plan. He said that the city had a commitment and financing for hurricane protection beyond what it had ever had before. Mr. Nagin said, ''I want to say to all New Orleanians, to all businesses, 'It's time for you to come home.' ''
 We owe it to those who heed the mayor's call to raise the system's strength until it can endure a Category 5 storm. That means more than just bracing existing walls. It means restoring the vanishing natural defenses of the wetlands, which need to be a significant share of any comprehensive plan. That alone will cost billions, but current proposals include just $250 million. 
 We can greet the new commitment warmly while still marveling that the city and the state had to beg and wait for what amounts to a rounding error in the federal budget. This is a good start. But more than 100 days after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, we should have long since moved beyond a good start.

HEADLINE: Bush's View: 'Work Is Not Done'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech to the nation last night about Iraq, as provided by the White House. A full text is at www.nytimes.com/world:

 Good evening. Three days ago, in large numbers, Iraqis went to the polls to choose their own leaders -- a landmark day in the history of liberty. In coming weeks, the ballots will be counted, a new government formed, and a people who suffered in tyranny for so long will become full members of the free world.
This election will not mean the end of violence. But it is the beginning of something new: constitutional democracy at the heart of the Middle East. And this vote -- 6,000 miles away, in a vital region of the world -- means that America has an ally of growing strength in the fight against terror. 
 All who had a part in this achievement -- Iraqis, Americans, and coalition partners -- can be proud. Yet our work is not done. There is more testing and sacrifice before us. I know many Americans have questions about the cost and direction of this war. So tonight I want to talk to you about how far we have come in Iraq, and the path that lies ahead. 
 From this office, nearly three years ago, I announced the start of military operations in Iraq. Our coalition confronted a regime that defied United Nations Security Council Resolutions, violated a cease-fire agreement, sponsored terrorism, and possessed, we believed, weapons of mass destruction. After the swift fall of Baghdad, we found mass graves filled by a dictator, we found some capacity to restart programs to produce weapons of mass destruction, but we did not find those weapons.
 It is true that Saddam Hussein had a history of pursuing and using weapons of mass destruction. It is true that he systematically concealed those programs, and blocked the work of U.N. weapons inspectors. It is true that many nations believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. But much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong. And as your president, I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq. 
 Yet it was right to remove Saddam Hussein from power. He was given an ultimatum -- and he made his choice for war. And the result of that war was to rid the world of a murderous dictator who menaced his people, invaded his neighbors, and declared America to be his enemy. Saddam Hussein, captured and jailed, is still the same raging tyrant -- only now without a throne. His power to harm a single man, woman, or child is gone forever. And the world is better for it. 
 Since the removal of Saddam, this war -- like other wars in our history -- has been difficult. The mission of American troops in urban raids and desert patrols -- fighting Saddam loyalists and foreign terrorists -- has brought danger and suffering and loss. This loss has caused sorrow for our whole nation -- and it has led some to ask if we are creating more problems than we are solving. 
 That is an important question, and the answer depends on your view of the war on terror. If you think the terrorists would become peaceful if only America would stop provoking them, then it might make sense to leave them alone. 
 This is not the threat I see. I see a global terrorist movement that exploits Islam in the service of radical political aims -- a vision in which books are burned, and women are oppressed, and all dissent is crushed. Terrorist operatives conduct their campaign of murder with a set of declared and specific goals -- to demoralize free nations, to drive us out of the Middle East, to spread an empire of fear across that region -- and to wage a perpetual war against America and our friends. These terrorists view the world as a giant battlefield -- and they seek to attack us wherever they can. This has attracted Al Qaeda to Iraq, where they are attempting to frighten and intimidate America into a policy of retreat. 
 Sept. 11, 2001, required us to take every emerging threat to our country seriously, and it shattered the illusion that terrorists attack us only after we provoke them. On that day, we were not in Iraq, we were not in Afghanistan, but the terrorists attacked us anyway and killed nearly 3,000 men, women, and children in our own country. My conviction comes down to this: We do not create terrorism by fighting the terrorists. We invite terrorism by ignoring them. And we will defeat the terrorists by capturing and killing them abroad, removing their safe havens, and strengthening new allies like Iraq and Afghanistan in the fight we share.
 This work has been especially difficult in Iraq, more difficult than we expected. Reconstruction efforts and the training of Iraqi security forces started more slowly than we hoped. We continue to see violence and suffering, caused by an enemy that is determined and brutal -- unconstrained by conscience or the rules of war. 
 Some look at the challenges in Iraq, and conclude that the war is lost, and not worth another dime or another day. I don't believe that. Our military commanders do not believe that. Our troops in the field, who bear the burden and make the sacrifice, do not believe that America has lost. And not even the terrorists believe it. We know from their own communications that they feel a tightening noose -- and fear the rise of a democratic Iraq. 
 The terrorists will continue to have the coward's power to plant roadside bombs and recruit suicide bombers. And you will continue to see the grim results on the evening news. This proves that the war is difficult -- it does not mean that we are losing. Behind the images of chaos that terrorists create for the cameras, we are making steady gains with a clear objective in view.
 America, our coalition, and Iraqi leaders are working toward the same goal - a democratic Iraq that can defend itself, that will never again be a safe haven for terrorists, and that will serve as a model of freedom for the Middle East. 
 We have put in place a strategy to achieve this goal -- a strategy I have been discussing in detail over the last few weeks. This plan has three critical elements. 
 First, our coalition will remain on the offense -- finding and clearing out the enemy, transferring control of more territory to Iraqi units and building up the Iraqi security forces so they can increasingly lead the fight. At this time last year, there were only a handful of Iraqi Army and police battalions ready for combat. Now, there are more than 125 Iraqi combat battalions fighting the enemy, more than 50 are taking the lead, and we have transferred more than a dozen military bases to Iraqi control.
 Second, we are helping the Iraqi government establish the institutions of a unified and lasting democracy, in which all of Iraq's peoples are included and represented. Here also, the news is encouraging. Three days ago, more than 10 million Iraqis went to the polls -- including many Sunni Iraqis who had boycotted national elections last January. Iraqis of every background are recognizing that democracy is the future of the country they love -- and they want their voices heard. One Iraqi, after dipping his finger in the purple ink as he cast his ballot, stuck his finger in the air and said: ''This is a thorn in the eyes of the terrorists.'' Another voter was asked, ''Are you Sunni or Shia?'' He responded, ''I am Iraqi.'' Third, after a number of setbacks, our coalition is moving forward with a reconstruction plan to revive Iraq's economy and infrastructure -- and to give Iraqis confidence that a free life will be a better life. Today in Iraq, 7 in 10 Iraqis say their lives are going well -- and nearly two-thirds expect things to improve even more in the year ahead. Despite the violence, Iraqis are optimistic -- and that optimismis justified.
 In all three aspects of our strategy -- security, democracy, and reconstruction -- we have learned from our experiences, and fixed what has not worked. We will continue to listen to honest criticism, and make every change that will help us complete the mission. Yet there is a difference between honest critics who recognize what is wrong, and defeatists who refuse to see that anything is right. 
 It is also important for every American to understand the consequences of pulling out of Iraq before our work is done. We would abandon our Iraqi friends -- and signal to the world that America cannot be trusted to keep its word. We would undermine the morale of our troops -- by betraying the cause for which they have sacrificed. We would cause tyrants in the Middle East to laugh at our failed resolve, and tighten their repressive grip. We would hand Iraq over to enemies who have pledged to attack us -- and the global terrorist movement would be emboldened and more dangerous than ever before. To retreat before victory would be an act of recklessness and dishonor, and I will not allow it. 
 I know that some of my decisions have led to terrible loss, and not one of those decisions has been taken lightly. I know this war is controversial, yet being your president requires doing what I believe is right and accepting the consequences.
 And I have never been more certain that America's actions in Iraq are essential to the security of our citizens, and will lay the foundation of peace for our children and grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Aid to Africa, From a Rock Star

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 I applaud Paul Theroux's views in ''The Rock Star's Burden.'' I was a Peace Corps volunteer teacher in Ethiopia from 1967 to 1969. I returned in 1999 and found the same deteriorated conditions. 
Ethiopia has fewer than 2,000 physicians for a population of 73 million. Some say there are more Ethiopian-educated doctors in the Washington metro area than in all of Ethiopia.
 Doctors in places like Malawi, Niger and Ethiopia have no economic opportunity outside the major cities, so perhaps we could provide supplies and subsidize doctors who work where they are most needed. Donor organizations could pay $50 for every surgery performed, or $25 for every baby delivered. This approach is successfully employed by Interplast, training and subsidizing plastic surgeons in developing countries.
 We need also remember that even here in the United States we face some of these same problems. For the rural and inner-city poor, education is a ''way out,'' and many graduates move to cities with more economic opportunity. Mr. Theroux is right as far as he goes, but I believe the solution is much more complicated.

HEADLINE: New Arrivals Struggle With Child's Illness

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
She wouldn't be able to bear children, her doctor told her. The three operations had left her sterile. So when the tiny 4-day-old baby showed up, abandoned, at the military hospital in Baku, Azerbaijan, where Donara Yusufova worked as a nurse, she knew they were destined for each other.
 It was after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although Azerbaijan, on the Caspian Sea, was rich with black oil and black caviar, it was imploding economically, like other former Soviet republics. Young children were being abandoned right and left by parents who hoped that someone could provide their babies a life they could not. 
 ''What touched my heart deeply was the thought that the child didn't have a mother,'' Ms. Yusufova, now 48, said in Russian through a translator. 
 That vow of parenthood is arguably more powerful than the promise of marriage. It is one of unconditional love through richer and poorer, sickness and health, till parting at death, with no reciprocal promise, or divorce as escape. 
 Ms. Yusufova and her husband, Iliya Yusufov, adopted the baby and named her Gulvar, which means ''there is a flower.'' When they brought her home, they told each other, ''There is a flower in the house,'' Mr. Yusufov, 53, said.
 But something wasn't right with the baby. When she started to walk, she had a limp. The doctor said it was cerebral palsy. Somewhere, she had suffered brain damage that affected her body movements.
 The next few years were a rush of medical obsession: doctors' treatments to help her motor coordination, mud treatments to help her walk, eye therapy to save her vision.
 When Gulvar was 5, the doctor gave Ms. Yusufova surprising news: She was pregnant. Perhaps, she thought, it was a gift from God.
 In 1999, she arrived in New York City eight months pregnant, caring for a child with cerebral palsy. It would be a year before her husband could join her. 
 Ms. Yusufova could not work because Gulvar's frequent seizures at school required her to be on call. Her husband, because of poor English, has had erratic employment. The family has survived on Social Security and support through the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charitable organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
 The agency has helped the family logistically, medically, financially and emotionally. Every week, a Russian-speaking aide visits Gulvar to teach her the skills of daily living, like writing and holding a pen. The agency also helped the family buy a power juicer and meat grinder to make food easier for Gulvar to eat. 
 Because high temperatures can cause Gulvar to have seizures, the family's apartment in Boro Park, Brooklyn, must be constantly air-conditioned during the summer, leading to very high electricity bills.
 But there, again, the agency was able to help. It paid a $350 electricity bill with money from the Neediest Cases.
 ''When she told me the situation and circumstances, she qualified of course,'' said Betty Slepchinka, a counselor who works with the family. 
 A successful operation this summer helped Gulvar walk. But a foot brace means that her feet are two different sizes so they must buy twice as many pairs of shoes. The Neediest Cases provided $500 to help the family buy shoes, in addition to winter clothes for Gulvar, 12, and her brother, David, 6. 
 While David loves art and drawing, Gulvar is fascinated by electronics. She taught herself the English alphabet and basic math through electronic toys. 
 Ms. Yusofova said, ''She wants a big computer.'' But they cannot afford one. When shown a silver laptop, Gulvar slowly tapped out her name with her forefinger: ''gulvar yusofova.''
 Gulvar's progress means Ms. Yusofova is now thinking of working again, as a medical assistant. She hopes eventually to work again as a registered nurse, as she did when she first saw that abandoned baby 12 years ago.
 David and Gulvar do not know that Gulvar is adopted, Ms. Yusofova said.
 They shouldn't, of course, as a vow of unconditional love is equal. She whispered, ''I love my children with all my heart.''

PERSON: T. Edward Hambleton

HEADLINE: T. Edward Hambleton, Theatrical Producer, Dies at 94

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
T. Edward Hambleton, the gentlemanly theatrical producer who was a founder of the Phoenix Theater, the trailblazing Off Broadway institution that helped develop the careers of actors, writers and directors for three decades, died on Saturday night in Baltimore. He was 94 and lived in Cockeysville, Md. 
 He became ill only the day before he died, his daughter Susan said. An esophageal tumor was found on Friday, but on Thursday he had been drinking Champagne and eating oysters. 
In 1953, working with Norris Houghton, Mr. Hambleton founded the Phoenix in a former Yiddish theater at Second Avenue and 12th Street in the East Village. Both men believed the economics and savage competition of Broadway to be bad for the theater, and their idea for the Phoenix was simple: great old plays and great new ones. The best seats would cost $3.30, with many others going for $1.
 The first production, in 1953, was Sidney Howard's ''Madam, Will You Walk.'' The comic fable starred Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, and it was not only a high point in their young careers but also a smashing debut for the company.
 ''Things have begun auspiciously for the new Phoenix Theater,'' Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times, adding that the Phoenix ''may turn out to be a very valuable institution.''
 Sure enough, over the next 30 years, the Phoenix would provide an artistic home for many luminaries in world theater at one time or another, including Tyrone Guthrie, Uta Hagen, Jerome Robbins, Marcel Marceau, Helen Hayes, Rosemary Harris and John Houseman. Montgomery Clift made his final stage appearance in a Phoenix production (Chekhov's ''Seagull'' in 1954); Meryl Streep made one of her first (''Secret Service'' in 1976). 
 The company put on more than 50 productions in its first decade -- and 164 in all. More than a few played on Broadway, including the musical ''Once Upon a Mattress'' in 1959 (with a young comedian named Carol Burnett) and Arthur Kopit's ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad,'' in 1963 (with a 22-year-old Sam Waterston).
 Mr. Houghton left the Phoenix in 1962, but Mr. Hambleton, as its managing director, continued to produce off and on Broadway, collaborating with the Association of Producing Artists for several seasons, and eventually moving the Phoenix to the Upper East Side. (Mr. Houghton died in 2001, at 92.) 
 After 1976, the Phoenix increasingly concentrated on new plays. It helped develop work by Wendy Wasserstein (''Uncommon Women and Others'' and ''Isn't It Romantic''), Marsha Norman (''Getting Out'') and Peter Handke's ''Sorrow Beyond Dreams'' before the company's shoestring existence finally forced it to close for good in the early 1980's. 
 Prone to neither grandstanding nor gamesmanship, Mr. Hambleton -- known as T. by friends -- kept a low profile but was passionate about the arts, said Harold Prince, who got his first directing job from the Phoenix, an early-1960's road production of ''The Matchmaker.'' 
 ''T. was a breed that was not unfamiliar then but is increasingly unfamiliar now,'' said Mr. Prince, who went on to direct the Broadway premieres of ''Cabaret,'' ''Company'' and ''Sweeney Todd,'' among other shows. ''He was elegant and inquisitive, but really respectful. He honored artists.'' 
 Born to a wealthy, respected family -- his father was a Baltimore banker -- Mr. Hambleton attended St. Paul's, the prep school in Concord, N.H., and graduated from Yale in 1934. He considered a career in chemistry, but that fizzled in the face of a newfound love for theater. 
 ''I decided it was theater or nothing,'' he said in a 2000 interview with The Times.
 He soon decamped to New York and started rubbing shoulders with Houseman and Orson Welles during the fervent years of the Mercury Theater. In 1937, he had his first Broadway producing credit with a drama called ''Robin Landing.'' It was not a hit, nor was his follow-up, ''I Know What I Like.'' Neither was his third attempt, ''The First Crocus,'' in 1942, which ran less than a week.
 World War II interrupted the losing streak; Mr. Hambleton served with the Navy in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945. Upon his return, he made headlines when he produced Bertolt Brecht's ''Galileo,'' an attack on fascism, just weeks after the author had fled the United States after testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington. The play, which ran for just a week on Broadway in 1947, was Brecht's last original drama produced on Broadway before his death in 1956.
 In 2000, Mr. Hambleton received a Tony Award for lifetime achievement, and in June, Mr. Prince and others created The T Fellowship at Columbia University to support and develop emerging theatrical producers. Mr. Prince said Mr. Hambleton was very active in the program till the end of his life, often traveling to New York to discuss it. The first fellows are to be named next year. 
 Mr. Hambleton's first wife, the former Caroline Hoysradt, died in 1947. Two years later he married Merrell Hopkins, who survives him. He is also survived by three daughters, Susan, of Manhattan, Mary, of Brooklyn, and Linda Hambleton Panitz, of Baltimore; two sons, T. Edward Hambleton Jr. of North Salem, N.Y., and Mark Hambleton of Timonium, Md.; six grandchildren; and five great grandchildren.
 On the occasion of his Tony, Mr. Hambleton was asked what he thought was the legacy of the Phoenix. His response was typically simple. ''I think that most of the things we did were good for the theater,'' he said. ''I'm glad that we did them.''

HEADLINE: China Says It Grew Faster Than First Thought 

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Tuesday, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
China said on Tuesday that its economy, the fastest growing in the world, is larger than it had previously reported. The government reported this morning that its gross domestic product was nearly $2 trillion in 2004, not $1.6 trillion as it had previously reported, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. 
 The nationwide survey suggests that China's economic growth is an even more influential factor in the global markets and that its people are even richer and consume more than previously estimated.
The new figures also suggest that China is set to overtake Britain and France to become the world's fourth-largest economy this year, ranking behind the United States, which has a gross domestic product of about $12.6 trillion, Japan and Germany. 
 The government said the census discovered that millions of companies in the service and other sectors had been previously unaccounted for in the nation's economic statistics. 
 Last year, for instance, China said, its economic output was nearly 17 percent, or more than $250 billion, larger than previously reported. 
 The revisions are certain to result in significant changes in the way economists assess the Chinese economy, investment in the country and perhaps its role in the global markets. 
 Many economists have already praised the figures as a step forward in understanding how the Chinese economy works, and in evaluating investment opportunities. For years, economists have raised doubts about some of China's statistics, and even published their own estimates of the economy and its rate of growth.
 ''It's all good,'' said Stephen Green, senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank. ''A bigger economy means all the dangerous ratios, such as investment as a percentage of G.D.P., all fall. And they are usually cited as showing that the Chinese economy is in danger or headed for a fall.''

HEADLINE: Shares Decline, Along With Hopes for a Year-End Rally 

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street's hopes of prolonging its year-end rally were set back yesterday as cautious traders sold stocks and the technology sector posted a steep decline. 
 The market opened little changed but turned lower at midday despite a court victory for Pfizer and a multibillion-dollar acquisition by the FPL Group. The investment by Google in America Online and strong earnings from Circuit City Stores were unable to lift tech shares, which have fallen sharply in recent days.
 A lack of economic news left investors with limited guidance and made them eager to take profit at any sign of a downturn of the market. Data on gross domestic product, housing and consumer spending later this week could determine whether stocks rise before January. 
 Low trading volume is expected this week ahead of the holidays, said Rick Pendergraft, an equity trader at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
 ''The week after Christmas is typically pretty strong,'' Mr. Pendergraft said. ''But given how much we've run up since October, I don't know if you should expect the same kind of gains.'' 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.06 points, or 0.36 percent, to 10,836.53, after spending most of the day in positive territory. 
 Broader stock indicators also finished lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index sank 7.40 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,259.92, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 29.74 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,222.74. 
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, and gold prices inched higher. 
 Crude futures declined for a second consecutive day as warm weather persisted throughout the Northeast, reducing expectations for a spike in heating-fuel demand. A barrel of light crude oil fell 72 cents, to settle at $57.34 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
 So far this month, Wall Street has followed a familiar pattern of whittling early gains and finishing with losses as traders lock in short-term profit. Some investors held onto hope that stocks would have one last run-up this year, but several weeks of aimless trading have nearly exhausted the market's momentum. Traders have been jumping at any chance to lock in gains for the year. 
 ''For two, almost three weeks, people have been saying the market is too high,'' said Bill Groenveld, head trader for vFinance Investments, based in Boca Raton, Fla. ''They're looking for the pullback. At any point we start our way back, people say, 'Here's our pullback.' '' 
 After logging early gains, Google was unable to revive the tech sector, falling $5.55, to $424.60, while AOL's parent, Time Warner, lost 5 cents, to $17.95. Microsoft, which had been trying to strike a deal with AOL, fell 7 cents, to $26.83. 
 FPL confirmed a deal to buy the Constellation Energy Group for $11 billion, creating one of the nation's biggest energy suppliers with $27 billion in yearly revenue. The stock swap values Constellation at a 15 percent premium. FPL sank 19 cents, to $42.76, while Constellation lost $2.52, to $59.10. 
 A United States court ruled that Ranbaxy Laboratories, a drug firm in India, infringed Pfizer's patents for the cholesterol drug Lipitor, narrowing Ranbaxy's chances to release a generic version within the next five years. Pfizer climbed $1.74, to $24.32. 
 In earnings news, Circuit City posted a better-than-expected profit last quarter, helped by strong television and Web sales. The retailer reversed a year-ago loss as sales swelled 15 percent. Circuit City rose $1.45, to $22.70. 
 Bond prices were flat, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note unchanged at 4.43 percent from late Friday, and the price unchanged at 10016/32. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Seculars Trail In Early Count Of Iraqi Ballots

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Sahar al-Najib and Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Early voting results announced by Iraqi electoral officials on Monday, with nearly two-thirds of the ballots counted, indicated that religious groups, particularly the main Shiite coalition, had taken a commanding lead. The secular coalition led by Ayad Allawi, the former prime minister, had won only meager support in crucial provinces where it had expected to do well, including Baghdad.
 The front-runner among Sunni Arab voters was a religious coalition whose leaders have advocated resistance to the American military and have demanded that President Bush set a timetable for withdrawing the American military from Iraq. 
The preliminary results accounted for more than 90 percent of votes cast in 11 of Iraq's 18 provinces. About 7 million ballots have been counted, of an estimated turnout of 11 million in the vote on Thursday for a full, four-year government, electoral officials said.
 Officials warned that the results could still change. The Iraqi electoral commission has received 692 complaints of campaign violations or voter fraud, at least 20 of which are considered potentially serious enough to ''affect specific election results,'' said Adel al-Lami, the commission's chief electoral officer. Several candidates, including Mr. Allawi, have angrily accused the main Shiite coalition of underhanded tactics, such as tearing down posters and ordering police officers to campaign for it.
 The early election results gave strong indications that Iraqis cast their ballots based on sectarian or ethnic allegiances. The results also indicated that much of the electorate is staunchly religious, even though experts once believed that the country had a large secular middle class.
 The early results for Baghdad Province, the most diverse in the country, provided the strongest indication of the religious nature of the voting. With 89 percent of the ballots here counted, the main Shiite coalition, the United Iraqi Alliance, had won 1.4 million votes, or 59 percent. The runner-up was the Iraqi Consensus Front, the main religious Sunni Arab coalition, with 19 percent. Mr. Allawi's secular coalition, the Iraqi List, was third, at 14 percent.
 Another prominent secular candidate, Ahmad Chalabi, the former Pentagon favorite, won less than a half of 1 percent of the vote in Baghdad, possibly denying him a seat in the Council of Representatives.
 Fifty-nine of the 275 seats in the council are up for grabs in Baghdad, more than in any other province. 
 The results come as a blow to Mr. Allawi, a White House favorite, and his fellow candidates, who had expected to win broad support in Baghdad. In the province that is home to Basra, the country's second largest city, Mr. Allawi won only 11 percent; in Sunni-dominated Salahuddin Province, he had 14 percent. Mr. Allawi had been hoping that growing discontent with the transitional government, which is led by religious Shiite parties, and the earnest participation of Sunni Arab voters would get him more support than he had in January, when his group won only 40 of 275 seats in the transitional assembly.
 Mr. Allawi has filed formal complaints against the Shiite coalition, accusing it of campaign malfeasance and vote fraud. ''We're waiting for their response to the violations and falsifications,'' Saad al-Janabi, a candidate in Mr. Allawi's coalition, said of the electoral commission. ''We're asking for the United Nations, the United States and international groups to intervene at once.''
 An important question is whether the Sunni Arab parties will be invited to join in the new government. They disagree with the religious Shiites on fundamental issues like whether autonomous regions should exist and how oil revenues should be distributed. If the Sunnis are denied their say, that could further inflame the insurgency and possibly undermine plans to draw down the 160,000 American troops here. 
 Until all the ballots are counted, it will be impossible to determine exactly how many seats each political group will get. The number of seats will dictate what alliances the parties will make as they negotiate to form a government, which requires a two-thirds vote of the Parliament. The early results show that the Shiite coalition will again be at the center of the negotiations because it will almost certainly win more than a third of the seats, giving it veto power over any proposed government.
 Mr. Allawi still has a slim chance of cobbling together a government if he can unite with the Sunni Arabs and the Kurds, and pull away some religious Shiites. That task would undoubtedly be made more difficult, though, by a poor showing and by the influence of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered Shiite cleric in Iraq, who has fought hard to put the religious Shiite parties in power. 
 After a lull around the elections, violence flared across parts of Iraq on Monday. A car bomb exploded near an Iraqi police patrol in Baghdad, killing at least two civilians and wounding at least eight others, including four policemen, an Interior Ministry official said. Gunmen fired on a convoy carrying the deputy governor of Baghdad, Tarik al-Zawbai, killing three bodyguards and wounding Mr. Zawbai, another guard and a pedestrian, the official said. 
 The American military said a marine was killed Sunday by small-arms fire in Ramadi, the insurgent-rife capital of Anbar Province. 
 The Islamic Army in Iraq, a Baathist militant group, released a six-second video showing what it claimed to be the killing of Ronald Alan Schulz, 40, an American security contractor abducted earlier this month, according to the SITE Institute, which tracks insurgent postings. Because the victim has his back to the camera in the video, it is impossible to identify him.
 In its announcement on Monday, the electoral commission did not release early numbers for several provinces with significant Sunni populations, except for Salahuddin. 
 The main Kurdish coalition overwhelmingly dominated the three northern Kurdish provinces, as did the main Shiite coalition in the south.
 ''I feel sorry for some lists,'' said Hadi al-Amiri, a senior member of the Shiite coalition. ''I hope they get at least one seat. This election shows who has support and foundations on the ground.''
 But protests against the Shiite-led government erupted in some southern cities on Monday, after Mr. Chalabi, a vice prime minister, announced Sunday that the government was cutting back on its consumer fuel subsidies. The price of one liter of leaded gasoline has increased to the equivalent of 10 cents from 3 1/2 cents. Free-market economists say the subsidies have drained the government's budget, and smugglers have been selling the cheap gas for enormous profits in neighboring countries.

HEADLINE: TRANSIT UNION CALLS FOR STRIKE IN DIVIDED VOTE 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Leaders of the transit workers' union rejected the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's latest contract offer last night, and voted to call a strike shortly after 1 a.m., according to two members of the union's executive board. But the vote to call a strike was not unanimous, and so for at least a half an hour after the formal vote, union leaders remained divided on whether to actually proceed with the walkout.
 Adding to the confusion, the president of the Transport Workers Union of America, the parent union for the city's transit workers, told the local executive board he could not support a strike, the two members said. They said that the president, Michael T. O'Brien, said he believed that the transportation authority might change its offer, and he urged the union to re-enter the talks.
A transit strike, the city's first in a quarter century, would prevent people from going to work, cause hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage and upend the life of the city in the week before Christmas. 
 The vote by the union board came after a 12-hour round of intense negotiations between the two pivotal figures in the talks -- Peter S. Kalikow, the transportation authority's chairman, and Roger Toussaint, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union -- who bargained face-to-face yesterday for the first time since Friday.
 But with just an hour to go before the deadline, Tom Kelly, an authority spokesman, said that efforts to settle the dispute had faltered after the union turned down what he called ''a fair offer.''
 ''Unfortunately, that offer has been rejected by the Transport Workers Union, and they have advised us that they were going -- that they are going -- to leave the building, and going to the union hall,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''The M.T.A. remains ready to continue negotiations." Union officials would not discuss the developments as they headed into their private strategy session.
 The developments capped a day in which the transit union stepped up the pressure by beginning a strike yesterday morning against two Queens bus lines, stranding about 57,000 passengers in what the union portrayed as a prelude to a strike that would shut down the nation's largest transit system.
 The union first threatened to shut down the whole system on Friday, but pushed back the deadline to today, seemingly to increase its leverage by warning of a walkout the week before Christmas, one of the busiest weeks for retailers. The state's Taylor Law prohibits strikes by public employees and carries penalties of two days' pay for each day on strike.
 As a result of all the threats and deadlines, many New Yorkers for the second straight week felt wildly off balance, straining to figure out how their children would get to school and how they would get to work or to doctors' appointments. 
 Some New Yorkers backed the transit workers, some saw them as greedy lawbreakers, and some said that both sides in the negotiations deserved the public's disdain.
 Warning that a strike would be illegal, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stepped up their campaign to pressure the union, with the mayor saying that a strike would be ''reprehensible.'' 
 ''The city and state and courts -- everybody is going to enforce the law, and anybody that thinks that they can just go break the law is sadly mistaken,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''There can be no winners in a strike -- it's not going to force the M.T.A. to make a settlement. If anything, it's going to probably dig them in.''
 At rallies outside the governor's office and in Queens alongside the striking bus workers, Mr. Toussaint and many union members trumpeted their defiance, insisting that it was more important to obtain what they viewed as a just contract than to obey the law barring strikes. 
 ''Unless there is substantial movement by the authority, trains and buses will come to a halt as of midnight tonight,'' he said at a rally for the bus workers in East Elmhurst, Queens.
 With anger in his voice, he added, ''We maintain, as we have in the past week, that threats are not going to produce a contract and are not going to work against us.'' Later, at a rally outside the governor's office in Manhattan, he sought to justify a walkout by saying, ''There's a calling that is higher than the law, and that's the calling of justice.'' 
 City officials have prepared an emergency plan that would increase ferry service, allow taxis to pick up multiple fares, close several streets to traffic except for buses and emergency vehicles, and prohibit cars with fewer than four passengers from entering Manhattan below 96th Street during the morning rush. The city is also deploying hundreds of police officers to secure subway entrances in the event of a walkout. 
 The transportation authority's 11th-hour offer included a 3 percent raise in the first year, 4 percent in the second year and 3.5 percent in the third year of a new contract, representatives on both sides said. Before yesterday, it was offering 3 percent a year for three straight years.
 The authority dropped its demand to raise the retirement age for a full pension to 62 for new employees, up from 55 for current employees. But the authority proposed that all future transit workers pay 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions, up from the 2 percent that current workers pay.
 The transportation authority asserts that it needs to bring its soaring pension costs under control to stave off future deficits. But union leaders vow that they will not sell out future transit workers by saddling them with lesser benefits.
 Earlier yesterday, Mr. Toussaint hinted at some movement in the talks at the Grand Hyatt hotel, saying that the union would reduce its wage demands to 6 percent a year, from 8 percent a year, if the authority promised to reduce the number of disciplinary actions brought against transit workers. The authority has offered raises of 3 percent a year for three years. 
 The union began its strike against two Queens bus lines, Jamaica Buses Inc. and Triboro Coach Corporation, in the hope of pressuring the authority to reach an overall settlement. The walkout angered many Queens commuters and caused many to squeeze into vans and taxis.
 The 707 workers at the two bus companies have been without a contract for 33 months. The authority is taking control of those two companies and five others, and union officials assert that the strike against the companies is not prohibited because the authority has not taken full control of them.
 The Public Employment Relations Board, a state body that oversees labor relations for government employees, did not issue a decision yesterday in response to a complaint that the union filed on Sunday, asserting that the authority had violated state law by including its pension demands as part of what it said was its final offer. The union has asked the labor board to seek an injunction ordering the authority to drop its pension demand.
 At 9:15 p.m. yesterday, the board's executive director, James R. Edgar, said the board had not yet received the authority's legal papers replying to the union. 
 Many New Yorkers said a strike would disrupt their lives. Doreen Simon, 55, who lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and works as a housekeeper in Riverdale, the Bronx, said, ''I'm going to stay home. What can I do? I can't take a cab to the Bronx. It's going to hurt.''
 The union has repeatedly urged Mr. Pataki to join the talks, trying to put the onus on him if there is a walkout. But the governor, like the mayor, says that the professionals at the authority should handle the talks.
 Workers at the Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road are not expected to strike in support of transit workers. Anthony J. Bottalico, the chairman of the union that represents Metro-North engineers, conductors and rail-traffic controllers, said none of his members planned to strike.
 However, two other unions, which represent Metro-North ticket collectors and track workers, have vowed to show solidarity with Local 100 by refusing to cross picket lines, and they could conceivably delay, though not disrupt, regular train service.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Holding Pattern

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization might as well just adopt the slogan, ''Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow?'' Because, once again, negotiators have postponed until next year difficult decisions to open up closed markets in agriculture. 
 The global trade talks that ended in Hong Kong on Sunday weren't a complete bust. Trade ministers from 149 countries agreed to eliminate export subsidies for farm products by 2013, to offer technical export assistance to poor countries and to get rid of cotton export subsidies by next year.
But this lame stopgap measure isn't even in the same ballpark as what was envisioned when this latest round of trade talks began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001. The talks were supposed to move countries toward eliminating all of the trade-distorting subsidies that America, Japan and Europe employ to give their coddled farmers an unfair leg up on the global competition. Doha also called for liberalization in services, which would be extremely beneficial to rich countries. But since those countries, egged on by France, balked at making good on their promises to liberalize farm trade, which would help poor countries, those poor countries weren't exactly feeling very amenable to liberalizing services.
 Now ministers are supposed to gather in Geneva next March to figure out how they plan to get Doha done. But that doesn't leave much time to get a deal completed before President Bush's authority to get a bill through Congress expires in 2007. 
 This is all really sad. After more than 50 years of reaching agreements that have largely helped wealthy industrialized nations like the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Japan, this round of trade talks was supposed to finally put the needs of developing countries at the top of the agenda. But the interests of textile companies in America and farmers in France and Japan continue to mean more in the trade negotiating world than the fate of a hungry child in West Africa.
 This raises the question of what, exactly, is the point of the W.T.O.? Free trade is not sustainable unless there's something in it for everyone. If the rich world can't figure out a way to get poor countries on board, then America, Japan and France might as well kiss goodbye any trade liberalization that will help their companies. And that would be tragic for the global economy.

HEADLINE: A Remote Boomtown Where Mainly Newcomers Benefit

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: KORLA, China 

 BODY:
The prop plane packed with businessmen swoops into this once sleepy oasis town in far western China, flying in low over the spectacular Tian Shan mountain range, now snowcapped.
 At the tiny, primitive airport here, where people have to wait outdoors in the biting cold for their luggage, a billboard over the shabby terminal announces the arrival of change clearly enough: ''Petroleum Hotel,'' it reads, in Chinese, English and the Arabic script used by the region's Uighur ethnic minority.
There are three ways to get to this city, sprouting on the edge of one of the world's largest deserts, the Taklimakan, and they all bespeak the remarkable boom under way. By night, flares from new oil fields blaze on the horizon in every direction on the bleak roads that cross the desert and run along its edge. 
 By day, trains disgorge passengers: newly arriving ethnic Chinese migrants from the country's crowded east or, in the harvest season, day laborers who come by the tens of thousands to pick cotton and fruit grown on spreads owned by big east coast investors. 
 Since this little airfield hardly befits a boomtown, a fancy new airport is being built a short distance away.
 Thriving ''insta-cities'' are common on the prospering eastern seaboard. But in many ways what is happening in Korla and cities like it here in Xinjiang Province is even more impressive. And to a degree little suspected back east, the country's future depends on their success.
 China has a bottomless thirst for oil and gas, and Xinjiang these days is producing both in ever greater quantities. Moreover, because of its proximity to Central Asia, the province has become the favorite route for pipelines bringing imported energy from Kazakhstan and beyond.
 Since this is China's largest province in area, and home to the largest Muslim minority population, what happens here is crucial to the country's future stability. As with Tibet to the south, China's hold on Xinjiang is recent. Elements of the Uighur and Kazakh minorities have long yearned for independence and have sporadically engaged in terrorism.
 Beijing has cracked down harshly on separatists and has banned religious schools in Xinjiang, for fear they will foment Islamic radicalism and separatism. But for now, as elsewhere in China, the government seems to be betting that strong economic growth is the best way to consolidate its control.
 The province's recent record of discovering new sources of oil has certainly created an air of confidence here among government leaders and business people, most of whom hail from the east. Natural gas output has doubled in the last five years, and oil production is also rising fast, especially from the nearby Tarim Basin.
 ''This place is blowing and a-glowing,'' said Jim Scott, an ebullient Louisiana native who spends much of the year here, selling high-pressure valves and other oil field equipment to Chinese companies. ''I guarantee you there's a boom on here. There's more drilling and exploring around here than you can imagine.''
 Beyond foreign oilmen, the explosive growth in the petroleum sector is drawing thousands of Chinese entrepreneurs from coastal cities like Shanghai and Wenzhou. Some arrive wealthy, ready to invest. Others, like, Qian Bolun, 36, who has been here for 15 years, sought their fortune in Korla when it was little more than a dusty township.
 ''See this,'' he said, nudging a glass across the lunch table at a fancy downtown restaurant owned by a Wenzhou entrepreneur. ''In the old days if I bought one of these for one yuan I'd sell it here for 1.20.'' Nowadays Mr.Qian, who dresses in nice suits and drives a late-model Japanese sedan, deals exclusively in big-ticket items like industrial generators, tractors and mining equipment.
 The new petroleum economy has left its mark all over downtown Korla, from the smart department stores and shopping malls that line the broad streets of the central city to a large nightclub district that bathes in flashing neon after sunset. 
 At one club, Chinese fashion models strut and Russian dancers shimmy on a stage for ogling oil workers. An entertainer with an atrocious voice belts out karaoke songs urging patrons who disapprove to ''throw your money, your cellphones, whatever you've got at me.''
 The local Communist Party leaders speak proudly of the city's development. ''In the 1990's we were a relatively backward, small and poor agricultural city, with only 100,000 residents,'' said Hao Jianming, deputy party secretary.
 Now the city boasts 420,000 residents and is growing by 20,000 people a year. ''People come here because we've become a tourism city, a recreational city with a good environment,'' the official said.
 For all of these economic successes, Korla's problems with minorities have not been solved so much as pushed aside. On the streets of the fancy downtown, Uighur-owned shops are a rarity and Uighurs themselves are few. Across the river that divides the town into old and new, that balance is reversed.
 ''Uighurs usually don't have a storefront -- they'll rent a place in a corner,'' said Hao Lin, 32, a personal computer merchant in a new computer mall. ''Their main customers are Uighurs. Very few of them have business with the Tarim oil company. Those who do are Han,'' members as he is of China's main ethnic group.
 In a barbershop that sits amid a frigid outdoor market across the river from downtown, three Uighur men sit in chairs near a coal-heated stove that warms the place. 
 ''I studied at the university in Urumqi,'' the province's capital, ''for three years, majoring in mechanical engineering,'' said the Uighur barber, Yasen Keyimu, 25, ''but I can't find a job with the oil industry. Such great skills, and I can't get work.''

HEADLINE: Orthodoxies On Trade Worn Down In Marathon

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
The low point of the World Trade Organization conference here came on Saturday evening, as ministers were despairing of progress, while outside, protesters' steel pipes rained down on the shields of police officers and tear gas grenades spewed choking clouds.
 But 30 hours later, Pascal Lamy, the W.T.O.'s director general, jubilantly handed John Tsang, the conference chairman, a ceremonial gavel. Mr. Tsang tapped the gavel once, closing the conference and approving the Hong Kong Declaration, calling for changes in trade barriers including subsidies for European farm exports and industrial nations' tariffs on imports from countries like Bangladesh and Zambia.
To be sure, the document papered over divisions on some of the most difficult issues in world trade, notably tariffs and quotas on such politically weighted products as apples, beef and rice. 
 While the agreement requires the elimination of agricultural export subsidies, mostly used by the European Union, it leaves untouched even larger domestic subsidies to farmers by the United States and the Europeans that can also distort trade. 
 Negotiators did not agree on how quickly industrial and farm tariffs should be cut, and they set rules for how to negotiate the opening of developing countries to service industries like banking without actually agreeing on any services.
 But the declaration does require the elimination of industrial nations' tariffs and quotas on almost all exports from the world's poorest countries and does resolve disputes over cotton and other issues among developing countries that had led to the collapse of talks at the last W.T.O. conference two years ago in Cancun, Mexico.
 The lengthy document produced here showed significantly more progress than anyone had expected when ministers from the 149 nations and customs territories in the W.T.O. convened here last Tuesday. It also allowed the ministers to avoid another collapse of talks.
 What changed in the 30 hours over the weekend was the weaving of a series of deals -- all night, in marathon talks.
 The European Union, faced with blame for a collapse in negotiations, changed course and put forward a crucial proposal on agriculture.
 India, a champion of the developing world since the days of Mohandas K. Gandhi and now a computer programming power as well, played an important intermediary role in persuading poor countries to accept portions of the agreement calling for freer trade in services like telecommunications and banking.
 And Venezuela, forced to decide whether it would bring the negotiations to a dead halt over its objections to the provisions on services, backed down at the last moment and allowed the Hong Kong Declaration to be approved by consensus.
 ''Real progress was made,'' said a cheerful Susan Schwab, a deputy United States trade representative, on Sunday night as the ministers prepared to give final approval. Just a day earlier, Ms. Schwab was decidedly unhappy about the state of the conference. Talks with the European Union were going nowhere and acrimonious disputes were developing that pitted rich countries, especially the United States and the Europeans, against poor countries, many of them in the Southern Hemisphere.
 ''There are a range of points where this could go off the rails,'' Ms. Schwab said over lunch. ''The obvious dynamic everyone is worried about is this turning into another Cancun, with a North-South dispute.''
 The most contentious issue was an effort by a group of developing countries to restrict negotiations on the opening of international competition in services. Beginning Thursday evening, a coalition led by South Africa, Kenya, Jamaica, Venezuela and Cuba had been demanding changes in a proposed text to make it easier for countries essentially to opt out of the talks on services and shield domestic industries like hospital management, insurance and education.
 By Friday, those countries had persuaded the broadest caucus of poor countries here, known as the Group of 90, to endorse their threat to block a consensus on the entire agreement. W.T.O. rules require unanimity for any agreement like Sunday's declaration; it was the first time in the six ministerial conferences since the formation of the W.T.O. in 1995 that services had turned into an issue that could potentially bring broader negotiations to a halt.
 At the same time, the poor and the rich were struggling over the two issues that sank the Cancun talks: cotton and a broad category called trade facilitation that includes the likes of foreign aid and a streamlining of customs regulations.
 Among the world's poorest nations are five in West and Central Africa that depend on cotton for two-thirds of their meager exports, and that blame American cotton subsidies for depressing global prices. Another deputy United States trade representative, Karan Bhatia, spent most of the week negotiating a complex plan for phasing out subsidies and providing American technical assistance to African farmers who have had much lower crop yields than farmers elsewhere.
 In the trade facilitation talks, rich countries offered to eliminate tariffs and quotas on 90 percent to 95 percent of all categories of imports from the poorest nations and to increase foreign aid. But Zambia's trade minister, Dipak Patel, the leader of the W.T.O. caucus of least-developed nations, said in an interview on Friday that his group wanted a deadline for 100 percent coverage.
 Even the cotton-growing nations, who stood to gain from all the programs being offered here, were adamant that no matter what the United States offered them on cotton, they would still side with other poor countries on many other issues.
 Chad's trade minister, Odjimbaye Soukate Ngarmbatinan, remarked, ''I don't think anyone should get the impression we would take what we can get and abandon our friends.'' 
 That stance underlined a vexing problem for American officials at these and other W.T.O. negotiations: their lack of influence in talks that require a consensus, yet can be derailed by a single country with a strongly held position. By contrast, the United States has much more influence in two-party pacts -- like recent free trade agreements with Morocco and Bahrain -- and regional accords like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 The United States trade representative, Rob Portman, and his senior aides had been warning in the weeks leading up to the Hong Kong conference that if these talks did not produce progress soon, the Bush administration might start putting more of its negotiating energy into the pursuit of such regional and two-party deals.
 While the negotiators wrangled inside the hall, the situation in the streets was deteriorating. Demonstrators armed with steel bars and pieces of plywood outflanked lines of helmeted riot police officers with shields. They began fighting less protected officers in the street in front of the convention center, and tried to push over a police van that blocked their path.
 The officers responded by closing off streets, firing tear gas and parking armored personnel carriers on a nearby path to the convention center's entrance. As fighting continued at half a dozen locations, trade ministers who had left the convention center for dinner had to be brought back in boats along the harbor front.
 The Hong Kong government said late Monday that 137 people had been injured in the fighting, including 67 police officers, and more than 1,000 people arrested, all but 14 of whom were released without charges on Sunday and Monday.
 Inside the center, though, the negotiations were turning around, and Mr. Portman said in an interview on Saturday evening that he was beginning to see progress. The first big change was that after days of insistence by the European Union that it would not accept any deadline for phasing out farm export subsidies, European officials did just that.
 In Brussels, European Union leaders had approved a new budget through 2013 on Saturday morning. Hours later, Peter Mandelson, the European trade commissioner, and Mariann Fischer Boel, the agriculture commissioner, gave a proposal to Mr. Portman and other negotiators that would set 2013 as the deadline as well for an end to subsidies.
 While the United States, Brazil, Australia and other farm exporters had been pressing for 2010, they accepted the deal.
 In the talks to eliminate tariffs and quotas on goods from the poorest countries, Zambia won a commitment that 97 percent of goods should be covered. Support for 100 percent coverage was fading: countries like Kenya already have duty-free access to the United States, and realized that total coverage would give duty-free access for the first time to Bangladesh's extremely competitive garment industry. Bangladesh outsells Kenya in the American garment market, even though Bangladeshi companies face high tariffs and Kenyan companies do not.
 The services talks were beginning to shift as well, a result in part of energetic efforts by India, a nation with enormous influence in the developing world. Until the 1990's, India had some of the world's most protectionist policies, and it still has high tariffs on imports like food and shoes. But the rise of telephone call centers, computer programming, accounting and financial analysis in cities like Bangalore, Hyderabad and Mumbai, formerly Bombay, has created a big lobby in India for offering these services to other countries.
 With weary delegates negotiating all night, Kamal Nath, India's minister of commerce and industry, spoke strongly in favor of the services agreement at 5 a.m. on Sunday.
 ''It was music for the ears of the E.U. and the U.S.,'' he said in an interview.
 When the conference chairman, Mr. Tsang, asked all the ministers on Sunday night if anyone objected to the text of the declaration, leaders of the delegations from Venezuela and Cuba rose to say that they reserved the right to limit their countries' participation later in the talks on opening services. But neither official blocked the consensus.
 Mr. Tsang tapped his new gavel and it was over.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Grant to Armenia, but Urges Greater Political Rights

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
President Bush's foreign aid program aimed at reducing poverty in well-governed developing countries announced its second-largest grant yesterday. It will give $236 million to Armenia over five years, but warned the country's rulers that the assistance would be suspended or canceled if its record on political rights continued to deteriorate.
 The Millennium Challenge Corporation, the agency administering the program, delayed its approval of the plan to invest in rural roads and irrigation projects in Armenia after allegations of fraud and electoral mismanagement arose in a constitutional referendum on Nov. 27. 
Even as the agency announced yesterday that it was moving forward, it released a stern letter to Armenia's president, Robert Kocharian, calling for corrective steps to improve the fairness of the political process. Stephen P. Groff, a managing director at the agency, said it was awaiting a reply.
 A spokesman for the Armenian Embassy in Washington did not return repeated phone calls yesterday requesting comment.
 Mr. Groff acknowledged that it would not be simple to halt the aid once the United States had spent tens of millions of dollars in Armenia, a former Soviet republic with a population of three million. ''We'd be fooling ourselves to say it wouldn't be difficult to get out,'' he said, ''but we are willing to cut countries off if their performance doesn't continue on a trend.'' 
 The Millennium corporation relies on Freedom House, a nonprofit group that promotes democracy, to rate countries' respect for civil liberties and political rights. Christopher Walker, the group's expert on the former Soviet Union, said political rights were severely restricted in Armenia, deteriorated in 2004 and had not improved this year. He also said corruption was pervasive.
 ''It's still not really clear that Armenia has the institutional capacity and independence to move forward with reforms,'' Mr. Walker said. He noted, for example, that a council the government set up last year to control corruption was not politically independent of the president.
 President Bush advocated the creation of the corporation, now almost two years old, to aid poor countries that rule justly, invest in their people and have sensible economic policies. His theory, shared by many development experts, was that well-governed countries would not waste aid, but would use it to spark economic growth and reduce poverty.
 Armenia has done well according to many of the agency's indicators, though it has slipped on measures of government, officials said. It is open to trade, has inflation under control and is a relatively easy and inexpensive place to start a business and has made progress on corruption. It has increased its spending on health and education, sustained high levels of immunization and improved the rate at which girls finish primary school.
 The Millennium corporation's plan for Armenia includes $67 million to rehabilitate almost 600 miles of rural roads and improve the productivity of 250,000 farm households through gravity-fed irrigation and higher-yield crops, among other things.
 The agency, which did not get off the ground for almost two years after Mr. Bush announced his intention to establish it, has recently come under pressure from Congress to speed up its approval of projects. Noting the slow pace of spending, Congress almost halved Mr. Bush's budget request for the agency for next year. Mr. Groff said such pressures did not affect the decision to go forward with the Armenia project.

HEADLINE: Immigrant Finds His Stride After Cancer Ends a Dream

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
If you don't have English, you can substitute endurance. That is the immutable law of the American food chain. Fruit picking, poultry processing, meatpacking plants, New York City restaurants -- all have a ravenous appetite for immigrant workers, legal or illegal. Feeding New Yorkers is a series of strenuous and physical tasks. It is an endless routine of 12-hour days standing in a hot kitchen, pedaling through snarled Midtown traffic or washing stacks of dishes. 
 Senxing Lin slipped seamlessly into the restaurant system when he arrived in New York City a decade ago. In Shanghai, he was an engineer for textile factories. In New York he became a deliveryman.
''We don't have a lot of choices,'' Mr. Lin, 45, said in Mandarin. The choices: inside the kitchen or outside the kitchen. Mr. Lin decided on outside, so he could see the city via bicycle and learn a little bit of English from interacting with customers. 
 In an economy where low-wage workers serve high-wage professionals, food is the most universal of demands. The workers slide in and out of the urban background, leaving scant evidence of their presence. But someone had to cut the California rolls in the corner Korean buffet. Someone wrapped the gourmet sandwiches at Pret a Manger in crisp cellophane. Someone cooked the General Tso's chicken that arrived in the white takeout containers in the office lobby.
 ''They don't talk to you very often,'' Mr. Lin said. ''Often you just knock and say, 'I'm delivery.' They will tell you to come up to what floor. Then you knock on the door, and say, 'This is your order.' They take the order, say 'thank you' and give you money.''
 So Mr. Lin didn't learn much of the English he was hoping for. Mostly, it was just a handful of essential phrases: ''Thank you for tips.'' ''See you next time.'' ''Thank you for order for us.'' He supported a wife and a teenage son on $1,500 or $1,600 a month, working 12-hour days, six days a week.
 Shrewdly, he decided that the fastest way up the restaurant ladder was to become a sushi chef: slicing raw fish pays well by restaurant standards and rewards deftness of hand. 
 The New York sushi industry is powered by Chinese and Mexicans, Mr. Lin explained. ''They won't let the Mexicans sit up front because Americans think sushi is a Japanese product, but Chinese and Japanese basically look the same,'' he said. The Mexicans are in the back kitchen making the more frequently ordered rolls, he said.
 Despite the delicacy of the sushi, the work is grueling. The chefs and their helpers nap between the lunch and dinner rushes by putting their heads on the table or lying across the restaurant chairs. 
 But while he was working at the sushi counter, Mr. Lin's English did improve. The sushi chef is a latter-day bartender, a conversation magnet for lonely customers. ''They are bored,'' he said. ''We don't talk to them. They usually talk to us.'' 
 But in March 2004 he felt a murmuring pain in his stomach. Without health insurance, he ignored it and continued to work. Months later, he threw up while at work and knew he had to go to a hospital.
 A doctor told him he had intestinal cancer. 
 ''I didn't understand what it meant,'' he said. Surgeons needed to remove 30 inches of his intestine, he said. As he lay in the hospital, he realized, ''Oh, having cancer is actually a little problematic.'' The hospital helped him apply for Medicaid.
 After the operation and a year of chemotherapy that drove the cancer into remission, Mr. Lin, who lives in Brooklyn Heights with his family, isn't able to withstand long hours on his feet. ''I can't do sushi,'' he said. ''My body is too weak.'' 
 But he did find another option. He began job training as an office clerk at WeCare, a program run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
 ''I really got inspired by his intelligence, and how he wanted to deal with everything, regardless of what he went through,'' said Miriam Ramos, Mr. Lin's counselor. ''And he's a good father.''
 WeCare's assistance did not end with job training. Besides helping Mr. Lin try to focus on a long-term future, the program has been an ally in meeting shorter-term needs. 
 Recently, it helped Mr. Lin, who had been out of work for more than a year, obtain $425.98 from the Neediest Cases fund to buy clothes suitable for interviews, and winter coats for him and his son.
 Mr. Lin's new coat was red -- for good luck.

HEADLINE: No New Stadium, No San Jose Team 

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Major League Soccer played the first game in its history in San Jose, Calif., in 1996. It is quite possible that the last M.L.S. game in San Jose was played Oct. 29. That is because the Earthquakes (at least the front office and the players) picked up and moved to Houston last week when a deal for a publicly financed stadium in Northern California collapsed.
 M.L.S. has exchanged the California rivalry between the Los Angeles Galaxy and San Jose, a two-time league champion, for an Interstate 45 series between Houston (your nickname here) and FC Dallas.
''We couldn't wait any longer for San Jose,'' M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber said Friday in a telephone interview. ''We had to move forward with plans in Houston.'' 
 The Anschutz Entertainment Group had been trying to sell the San Jose team and was in discussions with the owners of the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League. When the stadium deal evaporated, A.E.G. decided to leave. The new team, which has yet to be named, will play for at least several years at the 32,000-seat Robertson Stadium on the campus of the University of Houston.
 A.E.G. operates 4 of the 12 M.L.S. teams -- the MetroStars, the Galaxy, the Chicago Fire and Houston -- which are in the league's four biggest markets in the United States. At one time, the company also operated D.C. United and the Colorado Rapids.
 As part of the move, M.L.S. and officials in San Jose signed a letter of intent on a deal that would give the city an expansion team in 2007. According to The San Jose Mercury News, the deal, which is subject to approval by voters, would cost the city $80 million, including $36 million toward a stadium.
 Just as the National Football League kept alive the name and team records of the Cleveland Browns when Art Modell moved his team to Baltimore, Garber, a former marketing executive with N.F.L. Europe, said the Earthquakes name, records and team colors would remain in California.
 Houston, which had a team, the Hurricanes, in the North American Soccer League, has only three months to prepare for next season.
 ''If we can take on hundreds of thousands of Hurricane Katrina refugees and help them the way this city did, we can launch a soccer franchise in the next few months,'' Oliver Luck, the team's new president, said at a news conference Friday.

METROSTARS -- The club has re-signed the French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff for the 2006 season. Djorkaeff, 37, was the team's most valuable player last season, when he scored 10 goals and had 7 assists.

MEXICO
Toluca Beats Short-Handed Monterrey
 Toluca won the Apertura (opening tournament), its eighth title, when it defeated Monterrey, 3-0, in the second leg of the home-and-away championship series. The first match ended in a 3-3 tie at Toluca.
 Monterrey, which had a 15-game unbeaten streak during the season, was reduced to seven outfield players by the end of the game. Pablo Serafin was ejected for a dangerous tackle in the 14th minute, Jose Joel Gonzalez was ejected in the 48th minute for punching a Toluca player and Luis Perez drew his second yellow card in the 81st minute.

THE TRICOLORES -- Mexico's national team will play five games in the United States leading up to the World Cup in Germany next year. Mexico will play Norway on Jan. 25 in San Francisco; South Korea on Feb. 15 in Los Angeles; Ghana on March 1 in Dallas; and Paraguay on March 29 in Chicago. The final game will be in Pasadena, Calif., on May 12 against a team to be announced.

EUROPE
Bosman Ruling Is 10 Years Old
 Friday was the 10th anniversary of a decision by the European Court of Justice that changed the game. Jean-Marc Bosman, a 25-year-old journeyman midfielder with Standard Liege in Belgium, had finished his contract in 1990 and planned to join Dunkirk in France.
 Up until that time, European clubs asked for transfer fees when a player's contract ended. The system was similar to the reserve clause in baseball before courts ruled that players could be free agents and negotiate freely with other teams when their contracts were completed.
 Instead of being allowed to transfer, Bosman was offered a new contract by Standard, with a 75 percent cut.
 He took the case to court, which meant his playing career basically ended while he waited for the ruling. On Dec. 15, 1995, the Court of Justice ruled that players were free when their contracts expired and that the clubs in European Union countries could sign an unlimited number of players from other E.U. countries.
 Bosman's career never recovered. He is divorced, unemployed and living with his parents in Belgium. He never benefited from the ruling that has made millionaires of players throughout Europe.

Corner Kicks

WORLD PLAYERS OF THE YEAR -- Ronaldinho (Brazil) and Birgit Prinz (Germany) were named the male and female players of the year yesterday by FIFA. Prinz won for the third straight year, getting more votes than Marta (Brazil) and Shannon Boxx (United States). Ronaldinho won for the second consecutive year.

UNITED STATES -- The United States Soccer Federation and the union that represents men's national team players have settled a labor dispute that had threatened the players' participation in the final round of qualifying games for the World Cup. The sides said yesterday that they had reached a five-year collective bargaining agreement through 2010. It will pay players $3,750 for each appearance in World Cup games. The team will make $150,000 for each point earned in the first round (3 points for a victory, 1 for a draw) and would also split $2.7 million for advancing to the second round. The players could make an additional $3.75 million if they win the World Cup.

CANADA -- Jonathan de Guzman, an 18-year-old from Toronto who plays for Feyenoord Rotterdam in the Netherlands, may soon obtain Dutch citizenship, according to an article in The Toronto Globe and Mail. De Guzman has played on the youth international level for Canada, but under FIFA rules, he could still play for a country other than Canada as a senior international. Another Canadian, Owen Hargreaves, joined the German club Bayern Munich at age 16, and because of family ties was able to play internationally for England.

WEEK'S BEST

CLUB -- In England, Chelsea maintained its 9-point lead in the Premier League on Sunday, beating Arsenal, 2-0, for its first victory at Highbury in 15 years. The victory gave Chelsea its first two-game sweep over the Gunners in nearly 40 years.

PLAYER -- In Yokohama, Japan, the substitute Ronald Gomez scored on a free kick in the 89th minute to give Deportivo Saprissa of Costa Rica a 3-2 victory over Al Ittihad of Saudi Arabia in the third-place game of the Club World Championship.

HEADLINE: Bolivia's Newly Elected Leader Maps His Socialist Agenda

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
After his decisive win in the election for president on Sunday, the Socialist indigenous leader, Evo Morales, vowed Monday to respect private property but repeated his pledge to increase state control over the energy industry and reverse an American-backed crusade against coca, the plant used to make cocaine.
 Wearing his trademark black jeans and tennis shoes, Mr. Morales arrived in La Paz to begin laying the groundwork for an economic and political transformation that he says will give voice to the poor, indigenous majority that fueled his campaign. ''The voice of the people is the voice of God,'' he said late Sunday. 
 Mr. Morales, 46, a former small-town trumpeter and soccer player who turned a movement of coca farmers into the country's most potent political force, stunned his countrymen on Sunday by burying seven challengers in the most important election since Bolivia's transition from dictatorship to democracy a generation ago.
 Unofficial results showed that Mr. Morales won up to 52 percent of the vote to become the first Indian president in Bolivia's 180-year history, a victory that solidifies a continent-wide shift of governments to the left.
 ''For the first time a candidate wins with 50 percent plus 1, and it's the biggest margin between the first two finishers,'' said Gonzalo Chavez, an economist and political analyst at Catholic University in La Paz. ''This is a democratic revolution. The voting was tremendously strong, and signifies a tremendous demand for change in Bolivia.''
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and President Nestor Kirchner of Argentina, two of the continent's leading left-leaning leaders, quickly offered their congratulations, as did Chile, Spain and the European Union. 
 The United States tried to discredit Mr. Morales in the past by alleging ties to drug trafficking, and ended up increasing his popularity. The administration offered cautious congratulations to Mr. Morales and to the Bolivian people ''for carrying out a successful election.'' 
 But American officials acknowledged that they viewed his presidency with serious concern, while insisting that they would wait to see how he actually governed. 
 A State Department official noted that Bolivia had experienced several years of chaos in government, ''and now they have chosen a leader and still have a constitutional process.'' adding, ''We have to respect that, whatever else Morales has said.'' He declined to be identified, citing department policy.
 Mr. Morales's party, the Movement Toward Socialism, won nearly half the 27 seats in the Senate and up to half the 130 seats in the lower house. Unofficial figures showed the MAS, as the party is known, also won at least two of nine governorships.
 Podemos, the party of Jorge Quiroga, a former president, finished a distant second. Three other traditional parties practically disappeared from the national scene.
 The MAS is now poised to push through legislation tightening the terms on British Gas, Repsol YPF of Spain, Petrobras of Brazil and other foreign energy companies operating here. Mr. Morales has promised to ''nationalize'' the lucrative natural gas industry, not by expropriating it, but rather by expanding state control over operations, policy and the commercialization of gas.
 ''The government will exercise its right to state ownership of Bolivia's hydrocarbons,'' he said Monday.
 Foreign oil companies have in the past said that financially onerous terms could prompt them to cut back on investments, which have fallen from $608 million in 1998 to $200 million last year. But on Monday, Ronald Fessy, spokesman for the Bolivian Hydrocarbon Chamber, said it was too soon to predict.
 ''Governments have to be seen in action, not in times of campaigning,'' he said. ''We hope that this government will work to achieve scenarios that would lead to policies that are good for investments that this industry and Bolivia urgently need.''
 Mr. Morales has also pledged to reverse Bolivia's longstanding alliance with the United States in the generation-long fight against drugs, which has greatly curtailed the coca planting but has set off politically volatile uprisings by coca farmers. Mr. Morales and his followers say much of Bolivia's coca goes for traditional uses, to be chewed or used in tea, while Washington says most of it becomes cocaine.
 ''The fight against drug trafficking is a false pretext for the United States to install military bases,'' Mr. Morales told reporters on Monday. 
 Even with the mandate from voters, Mr. Morales is not expected to have an easy time in a country rocked by years of social protests fueled by inequality and poverty.
 He will be under pressure to ensure that the country's budding exports of textiles and furniture continue, while answering to indigenous leaders who seek radical change. Some social movements have vowed to apply pressure. The Bolivian Workers Central, the country's largest labor confederation, said the government would have to expropriate private energy installations from private companies, or face the kind of protests that forced out two presidents since 2003.
 ''He has to make changes or he falls,'' Jaime Solares, the head of the confederation, said in an interview.
 In the main square of La Paz, where one president was lynched on a lamppost in 1946, most people seemed tired of protests and wanted to give Mr. Morales a chance .
 ''We have to give him some time,'' said Martin Bautista, 35, a truck driver. ''I feel happy because here a lot of things are about to change.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Cut Force in Afghanistan 

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld signed orders on Monday that will reduce American troop levels in Afghanistan next year, meaning that 3,000 soldiers in Louisiana will learn before the holidays that they will most likely not have to deploy as previously scheduled. 
 Under the plan, the number of United States forces in Afghanistan is to decrease to 16,000 by next spring, from 19,000 now. The Fourth Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, based at Fort Polk, La., will send a battalion task force of 1,300 soldiers instead of the entire unit of more than 4,000 troops, said a senior military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because the orders have not been made public. The troops staying home will be on standby, if needed, he said.
The American troop reduction has been anticipated since NATO, whose soldiers now oversee security and reconstruction missions in northern and western Afghanistan, agreed to assume control over an American command in the south next year. Additional Afghan security forces, which now number 27,000 soldiers and 55,000 police officers, will also take on additional security duties. 
 The Pentagon spokesman, Larry Di Rita, said the decision to reduce a portion of the Army unit scheduled to replace the 173rd Airborne Brigade, now in southern Afghanistan, was based on recommendations from Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, the senior American commander in Afghanistan, and Gen. John P. Abizaid, the overall American commander in the Middle East and Central Asia. 
 ''The overall level of security forces in the country, NATO's role, and the political developments are all moving in the right direction,'' Mr. Di Rita said in an interview. 
 Congressional officials and the Army unit commanders were notified Monday of Mr. Rumsfeld's decision. A formal Pentagon announcement is expected Tuesday. 
 Pentagon officials were quick to note Monday that the United States would still have the largest number of foreign soldiers in Afghanistan, and that it would remain committed to ensuring political, economic and security gains there.
 American forces will also continue to have the lead responsibility for counterterrorism missions against remnants of Taliban and fighters for Al Qaeda, who have attacked allied forces from redoubts in the mountainous region along the border or Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 The battalion task force from the 10th Mountain Division will join NATO soldiers from Canada, Britain and the Netherlands, who are scheduled to take control of the country's southern sector, including Kandahar, around next July, Pentagon officials said. 
 Pentagon officials said they expected similar decisions soon, perhaps as early as this week, on troop levels in Iraq.

HEADLINE: ABN to Pay $80 Million For Violations

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
ABN Amro Bank, a global banking giant based in the Netherlands, has agreed to pay a total of $80 million in fines for violating regulations to prevent money-laundering, regulators and the bank said yesterday. 
 The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury Department said that ABN's ''serious, longstanding and systemic'' problems allowed people from Russia and other former Soviet republics to move $3.2 billion to shell companies in the United States from August 2002 to September 2003.
Investigations by state and federal officials also found that the Chicago and New York branches of the bank participated in wire transfers and trade transactions from 1997 to 2004 that violated economic sanctions on Libya and Iran. 
 ''It's by far the largest such penalty,'' said Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor whose company, Alert Global Media, produces newsletters, seminars and conferences that track money-laundering.
 The Bank of the Netherlands, which regulates Dutch banks, participated in the agreement although it did not levy a fine.
 ABN said that the fines and operating changes required by the agreement resulted from lapses in controls that required the bank to identify, analyze and report suspicious transfers, many from Russia to New York. The bank had too few people monitoring the cash flows and they were too poorly trained to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, which governs money-laundering, according to the agreement. 
 The fund transfers to the shell companies for which the bank was fined had been identified by the government in 2000 as a way criminals were illegally transferring wealth out of Russia and other Eastern European countries.
 The violations of the sanctions involved indirect dealings with the Bank Melli of Iran and a Libyan-controlled bank in the United Arab Emirates. ABN's Dubai branch changed documentation to hide the fact that it was dealing with those banks, according to the agreement. ABN's United States branches failed to adequately respond to the ''negative'' internal audits related to such problems, the agreement said. 
 The fines will have little financial impact on ABN, which posted operating profits of about $5.53 billion in the first nine months of this year. But the bank also had to agree to numerous changes in its oversight and compliance programs, including additional scrutiny from outside auditors for some of its operations. 
 The bank signed cease and desist orders that could lead to further punishment for future transgressions. 
 ''Further improving our compliance is the highest priority of the bank,'' said Rijkman Groenink, chairman of ABN's managing board, in a statement issued yesterday.

President Reagan
The Triumph of Imagination
By Richard Reeves
Illustrated. 571 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
 In an effort to describe President Ronald Reagan, reporters and biographers have resorted to all sorts of metaphors and images. Garry Wills called him ''the perfect Scout,'' a ''Doctor Feelgood,'' ''the demagogue as rabble-soother.'' Lou Cannon wrote that both conservatives and pragmatists in the Reagan White House treated him ''as if he were a child monarch in need of constant protection'' -- ''they paid homage to him, but gave him no respect.'' Others have described him as a visionary cowboy, a masterly illusionist, ''an authentic phony,'' an ''idiot savant,'' an ''amiable dunce,'' an ''ancient king'' and the ultimate actor who confused ''real life'' with ''reel life.''
 Reagan's official biographer, Edmund Morris, was so flummoxed by this man he described as both ''a great president'' and ''an apparent airhead'' that he abandoned his efforts to write a serious life of his subject, and instead produced ''Dutch'' (1999), an embarrassing hodgepodge of fact and fiction narrated by an imaginary alter ego. 
Because Reagan has remained so elusive over the years, more symbol than human being, more mythic figure than flesh-and-blood politician, the reader turns in eager anticipation to Richard Reeves's new book, ''President Reagan: The Triumph of Imagination,'' the first major portrait of his presidency to be published since his death in 2004. 
 Mr. Reeves's earlier books on President John F. Kennedy and President Richard M. Nixon provided engrossing and illuminating studies of these two endlessly dissected politicians, simply by giving the reader minutely detailed accounts of what each president knew and when he knew it and what he actually did day to day, month by month. In this volume, Mr. Reeves applies the same technique to Reagan, but once again the Gipper eludes capture -- perhaps because the details of so much policymaking in his White House were delegated, perhaps because so many of his appearances were tightly scripted.
 Indeed, this book turns out to be a sorry disappointment: a plodding recitation of events that happened during Reagan's two terms, patched together from official government documents, earlier biographies, memoirs by former administration members, the president's own contemporaneous diaries and copious newspaper accounts. Most of Mr. Reeves's observations about Reagan are either poorly supported contrarian assertions or shop-worn cliches (i.e., that Reagan's words were frequently more bellicose than his actions, that he imagined ''a gentle God-fearing and whitewashed American past that never was''). 
 Much of this book feels as though it were written on automatic pilot, resulting in a narrative that flattens out the iconic moments in Reagan's presidency -- like the ''Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' moment in Berlin and the 40th anniversary of D-Day moment at Pointe du Hoc. The evaluative intelligence that was showcased in Mr. Reeves's Nixon book and the first half of his Kennedy book is largely absent here. There are few insights into Reagan's decision-making process that haven't been made before; no fresh assessments of his larger, zeitgeist-y achievements in giving the country a new sense of confidence and hope; and equally little analysis of how his often troubled tenure in office -- which saw the ballooning of huge budget deficits and the Iran-contra scandal -- was refurbished by the myth-making machinery of history. 
 In fact, this volume is at its most useful in reminding us of the disparity between Reagan's mythic reputation as one of the greatest presidents of all time and the rampant speculation, during his second term, about his intellectual disengagement, his memory lapses and his short attention span, and of the disparity between his image as the godfather of today's Republican Party and the reaction in real time by the right wing to his negotiations with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. (George Will asserted, as the Soviet leader left the 1987 Washington summit conference, that that day would be remembered as the day when the United States ''lost'' the cold war.) 
 In the early pages of this book, Mr. Reeves writes that he does ''not subscribe to the many theories of Reagan's passivity'' and that the Reagan he found in the course of his research was ''a gambler, a bold, determined guy.'' He adds that Reagan, in his view, was ''staff-dependent but not staff-driven,'' that ''he went where he was told to go,'' but ''possibly more than any politician of his time he said what he actually thought, often to a fault.'' 
 This theory is poorly supported by the remainder of Mr. Reeves's book. Though we get glimpses of the president's stubbornness on matters like Star Wars and support for the contras, the Reagan who emerges from this volume is substantially the same Reagan we've read about in many earlier biographies and articles: a professional actor, who presided over a highly stage-managed administration; a charismatic front man, endowed with some sterling gifts -- an unshakeable optimism, a heartfelt sincerity and a brilliant ability to sell his ideas -- but hobbled by a limited interest in policy and an even more limited command of policy details. 
 As in Mr. Cannon's 1991 biography ''President Reagan: The Role of a Lifetime,'' we are reminded again and again in this volume of Reagan's early training in Hollywood. Mr. Reeves writes that the national security adviser William Clark introduced film or videotape briefings for the president, knowing ''that Reagan could instantly memorize such material and quote it for years.'' And he writes that in order to prep Reagan on the Middle East, Secretary of State George P. Shultz ''assigned four of diplomacy's bright young men -- Robert Ames, Nicholas Veliotes, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Fairbanks -- to produce a drama with each of them playing roles,'' including those of Menachem Begin of Israel, King Hussein of Jordan and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. 
 Reagan's prescience about the economic woes of the Soviet Union is duly noted, as is his vital role in reaching an arms agreement with the ''evil empire.'' But it is Mr. Gorbachev who comes across, in these pages, as the cannier, more visionary politician; Reagan as the one who, in the wake of the Iran-contra scandal, ''needed some kind of foreign policy triumph'' to avoid being perceived as a lame duck. In another chapter, Mr. Reeves concedes that Reagan had a ''reactive nature,'' which informed his daily routine: he ''responded to what was brought to him, to letters from strangers, anecdotes from Reader's Digest, or conservative dogma in Human Events.'' 
 Although Mr. Reeves writes that he does ''not think Reagan was an unwitting tool of a manipulative staff,'' his book is filled with descriptions of the president's appearing blase, bored or detached, and descriptions of staff members vociferously pushing their own agendas or careers. He shows us Alexander M. Haig Jr. circumventing the president to order the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, ''to abstain rather than veto a Security Council resolution calling for an immediate cease fire in the Falklands war'' (she got the order three minutes after casting the veto). And he shows us Donald Regan, the chief of staff, behaving ''as if he were a prime minister rather than a hired hand.'' 
 As described by Mr. Reeves, the day-to-day functioning of the Reagan White House was bizarre to say the least: not just in terms of Nancy Reagan's astrologer, who had a hand in setting the president's schedule (Donald Regan first wrote about this in his 1988 White House memoir), but also in terms of the curious interaction (or rather lack of it) between the president and his men. ''When the boss did speak in private to the fellows, it was usually cryptic, often confusing,'' Mr. Reeves writes. ''It was the job of everyone else, staff and cabinet included, to figure out what to do about it. His typical cabinet meeting exit lines were: 'Maybe we should sleep on this,' or 'You fellas work it out.' '' 
 Mr. Reeves never really assesses the palpable consequences of this dynamic, nor does he integrate such observations into a cohesive view of Reagan and his presidency. His unsatisfying book fails to illuminate Reagan's many contradictions -- an outspoken foe of big government who presided over historic budget deficits; a tough-talking anti-Communist who engaged in a series of history-making meetings with the leader of the ''evil empire'' -- and it leaves us with those unhelpful adjectives so frequently used to describe the 40th president ringing in our ears: genial, opaque, unknowable.

HEADLINE: Insurance Concern in China To Sell 25% Stake to Carlyle

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
In one of the largest private equity deals ever done in China, the Carlyle Group, the global private equity firm, has agreed to invest $410 million for a minority stake in the China Pacific Life Insurance Company.
 The Carlyle Group said Monday it would buy a 25 percent stake in China Pacific Life, the country's third-largest life insurance company after the China Life Insurance Company and Ping An Insurance, both of which are publicly listed in Hong Kong and the United States. The deal gives Carlyle a foothold in the world's fastest-growing life insurance market, where income from life insurance premiums has already reached $40 billion a year.
This is the second major deal in China in recent months for the Carlyle Group, which acquired an 85 percent stake in the Xugong Group Construction Machinery Company in October for $375 million. That deal marked one of the first times a foreign company had ever engaged in a direct buyout of a Chinese state-owned company. 
 The Carlyle Group had been pressing to complete the two deals for some time, but had faced repeated delays and red tape as it sought to invest over $1 billion in China by 2006.
 The investment in China Pacific, which is based here in Shanghai, is part of a flood of private equity and venture capital investments rushing into China. The companies making them are hoping for big returns in this country's humming but still highly inefficient economy.
 Some of the world's biggest private equity and venture capital firms, like Carlyle, Warburg Pincus, Accel Partners, Intel Capital, Doll Capital Management and Hambrecht & Quist Asia Pacific have been seeking large investments in technology, health care and other booming sectors.
 Indeed, investment in China has been hot all year. Foreign banks and financial institutions have spent billions of dollars to acquire minority stakes in some of China's biggest state-owned banks, many of which are readying public stock offerings.
 Foreign and Chinese venture capital firms have also helped finance a new wave of Chinese Internet and technology companies, like Shanda Interactive Entertainment, Baidu.com, Ctrip.com and Tencent, all of which have gone public. 
 And even the world's largest beer companies have been pushing into China, competing for stakes in the nation's biggest breweries, even though many of those companies are struggling with low profit margins.
 Now Carlyle is eyeing China's fast-growing insurance market in the wake of huge initial public stock offerings from China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance, which went public in 2003 and 2004, respectively, together raising more than $5 billion.
 China Pacific Life was founded only three years ago, but the company already has more than 20,000 employees, $3 billion in revenue and 11 percent of the life insurance market. Together, the three big life insurers command about 80 percent of the marketplace.
 As part of the announcement Monday, the China Pacific Insurance Group, the parent company of China Pacific Life Insurance, said it would inject about $400 million in cash into its China Pacific Life subsidiary to help strengthen the company.
 And Pramerica Financial, a unit of Prudential Financial, one of the largest life insurance companies in the United States, also said that it would form a strategic alliance with Carlyle to improve the business and bolster the fortunes of China Pacific.
 Prudential could also be positioning itself for a stake in a future initial public offering, or could very well buy Carlyle's 25 percent stake after a three-year lockup period is over.

HEADLINE: E-Mail Can't Reach Mr. Kringle 

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: Haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT will be left to the Vicar of Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, to duke it out with his critics over whether they have declared war on Christmas or he is the bearer of tidings of discomfort and joylessness.
 Somewhat overshadowed in all that huffing and puffing is the status of a jolly fat fellow in a red suit who has a habit of showing up at this time of year. 
Call him Santa Claus or Father Christmas or St. Nicholas (or if you prefer a more secular approach, Mr. Claus, Father Holiday or Dude Nicholas), it is clear that many New Yorkers continue to believe in him. At the least, they like the idea of him. For proof, you need only to head to the main post office building, across Eighth Avenue from Pennsylvania Station.
 There, as in decades of yore, letters to Santa have been pouring in: hundreds of thousands of them, sent by the luckless and the guileless, by the friendless and the helpless -- all having decided, be they children or adults, that this is someone to turn to when times are rough. But then, you've probably seen ''Miracle on 34th Street,'' so you know all this.
 Operation Santa Claus is the United States Postal Service's name for the program. Letters come from across the city and from other states. A few arrive from as far away as Poland and Britain. A growing number are written in Spanish. Regardless of language or point of origin, they end up at the colonnaded building on Eighth Avenue, even if addressed to ''Santa Claus, North Pole'' or ''Father Christmas, Lapland'' or just ''Santa Claus,'' period.
 The thought occurred here that, in an age of pervasive cynicism and with the advent of e-mail, the Santa letters may be in decline. Who writes real letters anymore?
 That assumption could not have been more misguided.
 The numbers, like lords on the 10th day of Christmas, are a-leaping. About 400,000 letters landed at the post office last year, and more are expected this year, said Pat McGovern, a Postal Service spokeswoman. Compare that with roughly 280,000 letters five years ago, or 155,000 in 1998 or a ''mere'' 65,000 in 1993. The only decline during that period came in 2001, on the heels of 9/11 and the anthrax scare, but it was soon reversed.
 If nothing else, ''it's nice to encourage children to write letters,'' Ms. McGovern said. ''It's becoming a lost art.'' 
 How to explain the boom? Hard to tell. It could be the result of increased publicity for the program, Ms. McGovern said. There are also quite a few duplicate letters. But perhaps the bulging mail sacks are one more sign that the economic recovery is trickling down neither fast enough nor deeply enough to reach many who are bone-chillingly poor.
 Some are gimme letters: I want this and I want that. Many more, though, speak of need, not greed.
 A woman in Elmhurst, Queens, wrote to Santa because ''I'm going through a personal family crisis,'' what with a husband out of work and three children short of warm clothes. A Bronx girl named Angelica asked nothing for herself but pleaded for a little cousin. ''My aunt cannot afford toys right now because she is no working,'' Angelica wrote. Her English may have been imperfect, but not her heart.
 MANY New Yorkers respond to such pleas. They become proxy Santas by going to the 33rd Street side of the post office building to sift through the mail in search of someone to help; they can continue to do this till Friday. Some people do the same by calling a toll-free number: (877) 840-0459.
 ''A lot of people are coming in to read letters,'' said Esther Gonzalez, one of about 20 postal workers who sort Santa mail. ''You even see them sitting on the floor.''
 They are New Yorkers like Shawn James, who said that he and a friend, Jennifer Dobbin, each put away a dollar a week through the year to save $100 for surrogate Santahood. Mr. James sat reading letters at a table off the post office lobby. ''Basically, I look for kids who ask for stuff for their mom or their brother and sister,'' he said.
 Typically, about a third of the letters are answered. These people just want to do good, said Richard Aron, who supervises the mail sorting.
 Using a phrase that perhaps Bill O'Reilly would not much like, for he seems to prefer keeping religious metaphors pure, Mr. Aron added, ''As we say in the old country, it's a mitzvah.''

HEADLINE: That Blur? It's China, Moving Up In the Pack

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and DANIEL ALTMAN; David Barboza reported from Shanghai for this article, and Daniel Altman from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Many economists have long suspected that official government statistics here provided only a shadow of reality. 
 With China's announcement on Tuesday that its economy was considerably bigger than previously estimated, economists and financial prognosticators are scrambling to rethink their assessment of China's rise and its role on the world stage. China's new figures suggest that it probably has passed France, Italy and Britain to become the world's fourth-largest economy.
Some economists are even accelerating their timetables for when China may eclipse the United States as the world's biggest economy. With the new figures offering a more expansive view of economic activity, some said China could overtake the United States as early as 2035, at least five years earlier than previous projections. 
 ''We now have a new snapshot of the Chinese economy,'' said Hong Liang, an economist at Goldman Sachs. ''This is not slightly bigger -- it's a significantly bigger economy.'' 
 China said it revised its economic data after a yearlong nationwide economic census uncovered about $280 billion in hidden economic output last year. The new output was the equivalent of an economy the size of Turkey's or Indonesia's -- or 40 percent the size of India's economy.
 As a result, China's gross domestic product for last year is now estimated at nearly $2 trillion, not the previously reported $1.65 trillion. That translates into an adjusted increase of 17 percent, making China the sixth-largest economy in the world in 2004.
 With China expected to report another year of sizzling economic growth in 2005, its economy may already be ranked No. 4, trailing only the United States, Japan and Germany. Moreover, even after two decades of very strong growth, China is still the world's fastest-growing major economy, expanding more than 9 percent over the last few years. 
 The United States economy is still far in front, with a value of about $11.7 trillion last year. And for all China's fast growth and its rapid ascension to the major leagues among national economies, it remains a relatively poor country. 
 Even with the expected revision, China's output per person will climb to a little more than $1,700 this year. It ranked 134th in income per person in 2003, according to the World Bank.
 Though its statisticians are highly trained, China is still quite secretive about its methods and means for gathering economic data. This has long generated debate among economists, much as the Soviet Union's economic figures did: some economists think China's figures disguise weakness, while others think they hide strength. 
 The figures for China's national accounts -- the numbers that measure gross domestic product, including spending and trade -- are supplied by its National Bureau of Statistics.
 The bureau publishes several sets of statistics -- some as often as monthly -- based either on its own estimates or upon numbers supplied by China's local governments. But those figures can vary widely. Totting up regional gross domestic product in 2003, for example, gives a figure of $1.6 trillion, 12 percent to 15 percent higher than the bureau's own estimates.
 The discrepancy also underscores a difference in incentives. Provincial and municipal authorities want to impress Beijing and limit any embarrassments, as the delays in reporting bird flu cases and the chemical spill in Jilin Province have shown. 
 Beijing worries more about its reputation in the rest of the world, where accuracy is paramount. 
 There are other reasons that huge swathes of the Chinese economy are unreported, said Frank Gong, the chief China economist for J. P. Morgan Chase.
 ''The way they collect the G.D.P. is really from supply-side, production-based statistics,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gong suggested that collecting data from the demand side -- what consumers actually spend -- would be more telling.
 In a system left over from when China was almost entirely a planned economy, however, all the factories and supermarkets report their own sales and spending. 
 ''That's problematic,'' he said. ''The service part -- the cash component of the economy -- can be omitted easily. That's why the statistics tend to understate the actual level of activity.''
 Economists say the new figures provide good news for China, suggesting that the economy is healthier, more diversified and more sustainable than previously believed. 
 The revised figures, for instance, show that a much stronger services sector has emerged in the Chinese economy, taking some weight off manufacturing. Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said Tuesday in a statement that China might still be underestimating the size of its services sector by about $200 billion.
 The new figures also relieve some worries that the economy was too heavily dependent on investment and could overheat. And they show that there are more small and medium-size companies in the country. Stephen Green, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said the new figures calm some fears about imbalances in the economy.
 ''It's all good,'' Mr. Green said. ''A bigger economy means all the dangerous ratios, such as investment as a percentage of G.D.P., all fall. And they are usually cited as showing the Chinese economy is in danger or headed for a fall.''
 The new figures are also expected to affect government planners and policy makers, altering things like monetary policy and inflation forecasts, or how government officials allocate money in the economy.
 On a more technical note, Jiemin Guo, a senior economist at the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, pointed out a fundamental problem with China's numbers.
 Most wealthy nations use a changing base for their gross domestic product series, to allow for differences over time in the basket of goods and services that consumers demand: experts don't want to use the price of a 1985 home computer, for example, in calculating today's gross domestic product. 
 But China uses a fixed base for several years at a time, Mr. Guo said, which results in a growing bias. Like the underreporting of the service sector, this issue is especially serious, because it could affect the accuracy not just of the gross domestic product but also of its growth rate over time.
 The statistics bureau has acknowledged several of these problems and, unlike the old Soviet scorekeepers, it is eager to improve the quality of its statistics.
 The bureau is working with the World Bank to develop a plan for its statistical apparatus, which would include reconciling the national and local figures. 
 Ms. Hong at Goldman Sachs offered an analogy to explain why the new figures were important.
 ''Does China have some structural illness or cancer, or is there an error with the X-ray?'' she asked rhetorically. 
 ''The last few years, so many famous economists cited the very high investment-to-G.D.P. ratio as a serious problem. Now it looks like the X-ray machine had a problem, not the patient.''

HEADLINE: Where's a Tutor When You Need One? Check Upstairs

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Lisa Hwang thought she would end up with an impressive job at a research institute or possibly the World Bank after receiving a master's degree in international education administration and policy analysis from Stanford University in May 2004.
 Instead, Ms. Hwang, at age 29, is living in a cramped dormitory on the top floor of a high school here. Alcohol and overnight guests are banned, and residents subsist on peanut butter and cereal purchased with their $600-a-month stipend.
''My parents were like, 'What are you doing?' '' Ms. Hwang said.
 Ms. Hwang changed course after hearing about Match Corps, a yearlong tutoring program at the Media and Technology Charter High School here, which primarily enrolls minority students from poor urban neighborhoods. According to the Massachusetts Department of Education, 77 percent of the students are classified as low-income. 
 The full-time tutoring program, now in its second year, pairs tutors -- most of them recent college graduates -- with four students at a time. The students spend a minimum of two periods a day with the tutor. 
 The tutoring has played a large part in improving the school's test scores, administrators said. 
 This year, 69 percent of the school's sophomores tested as advanced, the highest possible rating, on the math portion of the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, the fourth-highest percentage in the state. The school ranked 18th out of 338 Massachusetts high schools in English, with 32 percent of students testing as advanced. 
 The scores represent a sea change for the students, all Boston residents admitted to the charter school through a blind lottery. The majority tested in the bottom rungs of the test in eighth grade, administrators said. 
 The scores also signify a major shift for the school, validating its philosophy of long hours, discipline and strong student-mentor relationships, administrators said. 
 ''There's an authenticity here,'' said Charles Sposato, the school's principal. ''We truly care for these kids, and they can see it. We have to know the playing field is uneven for these kids, and we do everything we can to even it. That means going to their houses, the hospital, jail, you name it.''
 In 2002, the first year Match sophomores took the math test, 20 percent of students failed and 46 percent tested as needing improvement. English scores were better -- nearly half of the students scored in the second tier, or proficient, while 6 percent tested as advanced. 
 Administrators and experts who have seen the school said it took not only a dedicated staff, but also a group of demanding tutors, to help such students succeed.
 ''There's a very clear focus on what needs to be learned, and a very clear support strategy -- if they don't learn it in class they'll learn it in tutoring,'' said Katherine Merseth, a professor at the Harvard University Graduate School of Education. ''There's an academic sense of purpose and seriousness that the school is about learning. It's permeated to the kids and permeated to the staff.''
 Some critics charge that the test scores are deceptive because of the school's nearly 20 percent attrition rate.
 Students who cannot handle the work pass back into regular public high schools, said Marilyn Segal, director of Citizens for Public Schools, a Boston watchdog group.
 ''When you look at all those kids passing M.C.A.S. with flying colors, take a look at how many students entered the class and where the rest of them went,'' said Ms. Segal. ''They went back into the Boston public school system and had their scores counted in those schools.''
 After two years of part-time tutors, administrators hatched a plan in 2003 to create a full-time tutoring corps, converting the school's top floor into a dorm. 
 The goal was to have the tutors help the students master basic skills so teachers could teach more effective lessons. 
 The tutors also act as teachers' assistants, helping with administrative tasks and research. 
 Only sophomores had to have tutoring until 2004; now all students must. 
 The school raised $1.05 million for the building conversion from individual donors, along with an additional $250,000 for operating costs and a $309,000 AmeriCorps grant. The charter school, which can solicit grants and donations, advertised at universities and on the Internet.
 The program received 460 tutoring applicants for 45 spots last year; this year there are 42 tutors supervised by Ms. Hwang, who became the program director. Tutors sleep three to a room and share a common living area and small kitchenette. 
 ''When we first did it people were thinking we're totally nuts, that it would become 'Animal House,' '' said Michael Goldstein, the school's founder and research director. ''But now that the results are in, it shows that the corps members are unbelievably dedicated.''
 The arrangement, however, has put a crimp in the tutors' social lives. Many say they are too tired at the end of the day and too broke to go out.
 ''I don't go shopping,'' said one of the tutors, Claire Hackney, 23.
 ''I'm a single guy in Boston,'' said Zach Svigals, 23, ''and I'm not about to bring anyone I date back to my room, where I'm sleeping with two other guys.'' 
 Justin Sallis, 22, moved out when a cheap rental became available. 
 ''It's a stressful position. A nice beer when you get off is nice,'' he said.
 Mr. Svigals said he needed to leave the building daily to get away from the pressures of work for a while. But, he added, the upside to living above the school is the commute. 
 ''On Mondays I try to get my kids to stay for extra help,'' he said. ''I get calls at 11 at night. The communication lines are open, and whenever they need help I give it.''
 Proponents of the program, including Professor Merseth, say the model can be duplicated on a smaller scale and budget. Others, while enthusiastic about what the school has done, do not think it can be widely replicated.
 ''You couldn't run a public school district this way,'' said Doug Sears, dean of the Boston University School of Education.
 On a recent gray, soggy morning, students and their tutors huddled around tables in a large classroom, drilling vocabulary words, discussing Alex Haley's ''Roots'' and plotting vectors. Mr. Sallis, a recent graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, played ''Algebra II Jeopardy!'' with Terrell Moon, 17, and Alex Paul, 15, both sophomores. 
 Terrell, who repeated the ninth grade last year, had struggled through school, and enrolled in Match hoping it would prepare him for college. He felt frustrated and overwhelmed by the workload and rules, but said that tutoring helped him pass to the 10th grade. 
 ''I know if I didn't have a tutor I wouldn't get the grades I got,'' he said. ''I don't want to be the average person making the average pay and do everything average. I want to push myself above that and achieve my goals.''

HEADLINE: An Unnecessary Transit Strike

 BODY:
The bar for job actions by New York City transit workers is set, legally, out of reach for good reason. A strike that halts buses and subways that daily carry seven million riders can devastate New York's economy and countless lives. The New Yorkers who took to the streets yesterday, some walking miles to work or other appointments, deserved better than the explanation they got from leaders of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union -- who said they had no choice but to tell their 33,000 members to begin an illegal walkout. That's ridiculous. 
 Negotiations did not have to end when they did. There was no impasse. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state entity that runs the system, had compromised on several major points at the negotiating table. When Roger Toussaint, the union chief, walked away, his members were being offered a chance to continue to retire with full pensions at age 55. New hires would have to pay into that pension, but workers would continue to pay nothing toward their health benefits. That's a deal that many riders, including those who struggle to pay the $2 fare, would gladly take.
The authority also made other concessions, including a better wage offer, that could be seen as generous, considering that its finances will be awash in red ink for foreseeable years and it cannot just let fares skyrocket to pay for any deal it cuts for its workers.
 Many other issues remain to be hammered out, but none justify a strike, especially in the frigid days before the holidays. While New Yorkers fought the freezing cold, the transit union leaders seemed to be steamed about the enormous number of disciplinary actions against their members. The issue deserves study, but even the transit workers' parent union did not see it as sufficient reason to strike.
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg's strike contingency plan appeared to help move people who car-pooled. Beyond that, he can offer only a bully pulpit and the kind of moral support he displayed when he took a page from Ed Koch and walked -- hatless -- across the windswept Brooklyn Bridge with others who hoofed it to their jobs yesterday. Clearly angry, the mayor demanded an end to the strike before talks resume, but that is not his call, and the sequence is less important than ending the strike fast.
 Mr. Toussaint should not have the ability to hold the city hostage. That he can do so says little about the leadership on the other side of the table. The executives of the M.T.A. answer to Gov. George Pataki. We understand that Mr. Pataki has higher aspirations, but it was a bad call to visit New Hampshire as the first strike deadline approached and the city was increasingly anxious. The governor is in a position to impose some reason. If Mr. Pataki wants any chance to fulfill his ambitions, he should do all he can to help get a settlement, and quickly.

HEADLINE: Stranded on the Flip Side Of the American Dream

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
The documentary ''Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room'' wrested only tragedy from the corporate scandal of its title, but it probably should come as no great surprise that now Hollywood is looking to mine big laughs from the same. Hence the sort-of-new Jim Carrey vehicle ''Fun With Dick and Jane,'' what may be the first post-Enron comedy. Based on the 1977 Me Generation laugh-in of the same title with Jane Fonda and George Segal, this comic redo doesn't so much update the plight of its fast-sinking upwardly mobile couple as dust off the story's central conceit: namely, the flip side of the American dream is a nightmare but, you know, also kind of funny. 
 Set in and around Los Angeles, the film pivots on the plummeting fortunes of Dick and Jane Harper (Tea Leoni plays the missus), a happily married couple with a cute kid, a subdivision house stuffed with shiny consumer goods and a German import parked in the driveway. Jane works for a travel agency, though Dick brings home the big bucks from a company called Globodyne, which has something to do with consolidation and media properties but is really just an enormous Enron-like shell game. When the company goes up in shredded paper and smoke, and its chief operating villain, Jack McCallister (the invaluable Alec Baldwin), flies the coop in his helicopter, Dick's brand-new promotion to vice president, along with his family's financial safety net, goes bye-bye too.
 It takes a few months for the full impact of Dick's unemployment to affect the family's status and rhythms. They don't plunge into poverty; they descend gradually, one indignity at a time. When the electricity is shut off, it's inconvenient but not a calamity: the housekeeper just stops vacuuming. It's more worrisome when Dick scrambles for one job with dozens of other identically suited and suitable applicants with the ferocity of an action hero. In the battleground of the executive unemployed, briefcases and empty water-cooler jugs are the weapons of choice, and a warrior like Dick isn't just jobless, but he is also on a rescue mission to save his family from doom or at least from poverty, which here mean more or less the same thing. 
 The fun in the film's title initially comes from watching comfortably middle-class people do without the usual buffers and privileges. This tacky, comic Schadenfreude works as long as the family's woes make for quirky gags, as when the three, soaped up and wearing bathing suits, shower under their neighbor's lawn sprinklers. But as the Harpers' fortunes continue to decline, the light tone darkens precipitously. By the time Jane mentions rising early to eat at the local soup kitchen, a pall has settled over the film. Mr. Carrey's and Ms. Leoni's sprightly performances can't obscure that the adversity endured by their characters mirrors some very real suffering. But before there's time to feel too bad, Dick and Jane pick up a couple of guns and start making like Bonnie and Clyde, ushering the proceedings into full-blown absurdism.
 One of the film's insights is that poverty stinks, which could be news only in the la-la land of Los Angeles big-studio moviemaking. It's nonsense to expect social commentary from a high-concept comedy, especially one as self-congratulatory as this one (they care, they really, really care), but this is the rare studio comedy set in something like the real world. If the film never settles into a groove, zigging and zagging from belly laughs to pathos, it's because Enron remains raw as a wound. Too many cooks probably didn't help: directed by Dean Parisot, ''Fun With Dick and Jane'' has a screenplay credited to Judd Apatow and Nicholas Stoller, and, according to The Los Angeles Times, includes the efforts of David Koepp, Ed Solomon, Ted Griffin, Peter Tolan, Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. 
 Mr. Carrey's admirers may not mind the zigging and zagging, since he spends most of his screen time slaloming from one high jink to the next, really misting up with actorly sentiment only once. His spasmodic riff to the song ''I Believe I Can Fly'' is even better than the overexposed television advertisement suggests, while a tabletop freakout in a sepulchral club would work at twice the length. Mr. Carrey is such an attention hog that most actresses have a hard time holding on to their corner of the screen when he's onboard, especially in broader comedies. But Ms. Leoni never cedes her ground. Both performers exude such acute neediness -- there's a touch of Jerry Lewis and Lucille Ball in their mutual frenzy -- that not to love them even a little would seem cruel.
 ''Fun With Dick and Jane'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A gun is waved around a few times.

HEADLINE: U.S. Keeps a Wary Eye on the Next Bolivian President

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY; Juan Forero contributed reporting from La Paz, Bolivia, for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
On the campaign stump, Evo Morales liked to say that if he was elected president of Bolivia, he would become America's nightmare. After his election on Sunday, a State Department official said essentially the same thing, calling Mr. Morales ''potentially our worst nightmare.''
 The Bush administration says it fears that Mr. Morales will follow through on his promise to join Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan president, as an anti-American, leftist leader, while also carrying out his promise to reduce restrictions on his nation's production of coca leaf, the primary ingredient of cocaine, much of which finds its way to the United States. 
Mr. Morales made an early strike on Tuesday when he told Al Jazeera television in an interview that President Bush was ''a terrorist'' and that American military intervention in Iraq was ''state terrorism.''
 The administration's public stance is to wait and see what policies Mr. Morales puts into place.
 At the State Department briefing on Tuesday morning, Sean McCormack, the spokesman, said the department had congratulated Mr. Morales on his victory and expressed hope for Bolivians that ''with this election that they can begin to move beyond what has been a difficult period in Bolivia's political history.'' 
 ''And as for the future, we'll see what kind of policies the next Bolivian president pursues and that the kind of relationship and the quality of the relationship between the United States and Bolivia will depend on what kind of policies they pursue,'' he said, ''including how they govern, do they govern democratically and do they have a respect for democratic institutions.''
 The election could add to a string of difficulties for the Bush administration, which is held in low regard in many Latin American countries.
 During a visit to the region this fall, Robert B. Zoellick, the deputy secretary of state, described Mr. Chavez and others with similar approaches and policies as ''pied pipers of populism.'' State Department officials say Mr. Morales's campaign speeches appear to place him in that group, assuming he continues the same course in office as he did during the campaign. The officials declined to be identified, citing department policy.
 Stephen Johnson, a former State Department official and now a senior policy analyst with the Heritage Foundation, said of Mr. Morales, ''It will be difficult for him to moderate his position because he has a political base that is a little bit more hard-line, more populist, than he is.''
 That base is Bolivia's indigenous population, from which Mr. Morales came. Many of those people are coca farmers in a region where chewing coca leaf and making coca tea are deeply ingrained in the culture. 
 In Bolivia, though, the election of Mr. Morales on Sunday is seen as a potent signal that the country has tired of the traditional and often corrupt politicians who had long been in power. Saying they were tired of old economic formulas, Bolivians not only elected Mr. Morales but also voted three main parties out of national prominence.
 Mr. Zoellick and other American officials have been openly critical of Mr. Chavez, a close ally of Mr. Morales's, saying he is eroding democratic freedoms in Venezuela. Mr. Morales has not indicated any intention of doing that.
 Still, he ''has certainly unleashed strong expectations'' among his constituents, said Peter DeShazo, another former senior State Department official who now directs the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ''If he is seen as too moderate and accommodating, he risks invoking the wrath of these groups that want radical change.''
 Several State Department officials said the primary challenge that the United States faced in Latin America was the fragility of democratic governments in the region, which makes them vulnerable to populist leaders who, they said, were almost by definition anti-American. Those leaders, the officials said, also tended to chip away at democratic freedoms. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in an interview with CNN on Monday, said: ''The issue for us is, will the new Bolivian government govern democratically? Are they open to cooperation that, in economic terms, will undoubtedly help the Bolivian people, because Bolivia cannot be isolated from the international economy? And so from our point of view, this is a matter of behavior.'' 
 The State Department office that monitors drug trafficking says Bolivia produces the third-largest coca crop in the hemisphere, behind Colombia and Peru. In a report put out in March, the department said Bolivia exceeded its coca-eradication goals in 2004. Nonetheless, ''coca cultivation increased by 6 percent over all.'' A department official said little had changed since March.
 During a news conference in La Paz, the capital, on Tuesday, Mr. Morales said that he would not allow unlimited production of coca and that he would hold a referendum to determine how it should be controlled. He promised to fight drug trafficking, but he did not rescind his promise to drop support for the American-financed coca eradication program. 
 The primary focus of that campaign has been to eradicate coca plants in the Chapare region, where Mr. Morales is from. If restraints are lifted, ''there is the potential for large-scale industrial production in the Chapare,'' Mr. DeShazo said. ''And that would be of grave concern for the United States.''
 In 2004, the United States spent $150 million on coca-eradication programs in Bolivia, the State Department said. But Bolivia still produced 60,500 acres of coca plant, enough to manufacture 72 tons of cocaine. The Bush administration says, however, that it plans to give Mr. Morales every chance. A senior official is likely to be sent to La Paz to meet and congratulate the new president in the weeks ahead.

HEADLINE: A Land of Northern Lights, Cybercafes and the Flat Tax

BYLINE: By Mark Landler

DATELINE: TALLINN, Estonia 

 BODY:
Estonia, one realizes after a few days in the abiding twilight of a Baltic winter, is not like other European countries.
 The first tip-off is the government's cabinet room, outfitted less like a ceremonial chamber than a control center. Each minister has a flat-screen computer to transmit votes during debates. Then there is Estonia's idea of an intellectual hero: Steve Forbes, the American publishing scion, two-time candidate for the Republican presidential nomination and tireless evangelist for the flat tax.
Fired with a free-market fervor and hurtling into the high-tech future, Estonia feels more like a Baltic outpost of Silicon Valley than of Europe. Nineteen months after it achieved its cherished goal of joining the European Union, one might even characterize Estonia as the un-Europe.
 ''I must say Steve Forbes was a genius,'' Prime Minister Andrus Ansip declared during an interview in his hilltop office. ''I'm sure he still is,'' he added hastily. 
 The subject was the flat tax, which Mr. Forbes never succeeded in selling in the United States. Here in the polar reaches of Europe it is an article of faith. Estonia became the first country to adopt it in 1994, as part of a broader strategy to transform itself from an obscure Soviet republic into a plugged-in member of the global information economy.
 By all accounts, the plan is working. Estonia's economic growth was nearly 11 percent in the last quarter -- the second fastest in Europe, after Latvia, and an increase more reminiscent of China or India than Germany or France.
 People call this place E-stonia, and the cyber-intoxication is palpable in Tallinn's cafes and bars, which are universally equipped with wireless connections, and in local success stories like Skype, designed by Estonian developers and now offering free calls over the Internet to millions.
 The flip side of Estonia's market ethos is a thinner social safety net than those in Europe's welfare states. Opponents of the flat tax here -- and there are some -- say it has widened the divide between rich and poor, making Estonia less like its Nordic neighbors and more like the United States.
 Germans showed how allergic they were to the idea when Angela Merkel chose a flat tax advocate as her economic adviser. Antipathy toward him was so intense that political analysts say it probably cost Chancellor Merkel's party a clear majority in the German Parliament.
 Yet the concept has caught on in this part of Europe. Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia all have a flat tax, while the Czech Republic and Slovenia have considered one. Tax policy, not support for the American-led war in Iraq, is the bright line that separates the so-called old Europe from the new. ''Everybody dreams about a society with no inequality,'' Prime Minister Ansip said. ''But the best policy is to have a strongly growing economy. With more prosperity we can increase social benefits.''
 Taxes and welfare are not the only issues where Estonians seem to be diverging from Western Europeans.
 People here are increasingly ambivalent about adopting the euro, even though the government still hopes to do so by 2007. The prime minister has been at odds with the European Commission, which has threatened to reduce its money for roads, bridges and other infrastructure. And Parliament recently voted by a wide margin to extend the deployment of the country's tiny contingent of troops to Iraq by another year.
 The war, which has inflamed much of Europe, is not a divisive issue here. Only two Estonian soldiers have been killed in Iraq. ''We know what it means to live under a dictatorship in Estonia,'' Mr. Ansip said. ''We were always dreaming that help would come, and we did get help, especially from the United States.''
 Make no mistake: Estonia is grateful to be in the European fold. Membership in the European Union -- and NATO -- throws a security blanket over a land that has been subjugated repeatedly by foreign powers, most recently the Soviet Union.
 With Estonia safely inside, though, Europe no longer looks like much of a draw. The euro, which once symbolized prosperity, is now viewed by many here as an invitation to higher prices. Inflation has already doubled since Estonia joined the European Union in May 2004. As a cautionary tale, people here point to Italy, where the cost of a haircut or a cup of coffee spiked after it retired the lira.
 In any event, Estonia may miss its deadline of January 2007 for adopting the euro, because its inflation rate, close to 4 percent, is above the limit imposed by treaty. That would apparently not faze too many people. In a recent survey commissioned by the government, 54 percent of respondents said they did not want the euro, while 41 percent favored it.
 ''We have always had mixed feelings about joining the monetary union,'' said Marje Josing, the director of the Estonian Institute of Economic Research. ''We have some experience of being part of a union.''
 Feelings toward Europe soured further after Britain, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, proposed reducing financing to new member states by $16.8 billion between 2007 and 2013. Estonia, Mr. Ansip said, is counting on the cash. [European leaders worked out a compromise on Dec. 17 that lessens the cuts, which mollified Mr. Ansip.] 
 The suspicion goes both ways. French and German leaders complain that Estonia and other flat tax countries practice ''tax dumping,'' using their rock-bottom rates to attract foreign investment. The solution, they say, is for European countries to harmonize their taxes, a proposal that gives most Estonians disquieting memories of their centrally planned past within the Soviet Union.
 Still, not everybody loves the status quo. The economics minister, Edgar Savisaar, is among those who believe that the flat tax has deepened class differences. A prime minister of Estonia under Soviet rule, Mr. Savisaar now leads a popular center-left party, which is in a shaky coalition with Mr. Ansip.
 Reinstating a progressive tax, he said, would pay for education and for more aid to families and the elderly. With Estonia facing a national election in March 2007, Mr. Savisaar is expected to make that a political issue.
 ''What are the best societies to live in?''' asked Mr. Savisaar's top adviser, Heido Vitsur. ''The best societies in the world to live in are the Nordic societies. We have to move in that direction.''
 Mr. Ansip is all for catching up with Finland and Sweden. But he says Estonia should not do it by abandoning a policy that he says helped propel the country this far. ''I don't think it's the right thing for every country in the world,'' he said. ''But it really suits Estonia.''

HEADLINE: Jazz Gem Made in '57 Is a Favorite Of 2005

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
My favorite jazz record released this year, and one of my favorites of any year, was made in 1957. I first heard ''Thelonious Monk Quartet With John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall'' (Blue Note) at the Library of Congress in April, after the news of its discovery had been made public. It sounded pretty good then, but you can never really tell when hearing something over a high-quality sound system in front of interested parties. I have listened to it repeatedly since, and it seems to be much better than I first thought -- solid, juicy, truly great.
 Another of the year's new jazz records -- John Coltrane's ''One Down, One Up: Live at the Half Note'' (Impulse) -- was made in 1965. It disqualifies itself from consideration for my list of the year's best jazz albums only because it has been heard, in bits and pieces, on illegal tapes for 40 years. (I got mine from a great saxophonist who wanted to spread the word.) But it is also, I think, a masterpiece.
There's a reason why these records stand out as the year's best, and I get the sense that many people feel they know that reason. 
 They believe, or have heard, that jazz crinkled up and collapsed after Coltrane. That the musicians have defaulted on audiences, going deep into their own heads instead. That there's been no successor, because Coltrane broke the mold, threw away the key, set the bar too high, stretched the envelope as far as it would go, established a holding pattern, and other truth-obscuring cliches.
 It would simplify things, but no. In fact, I don't think the reason has much to do with Coltrane per se -- other than the obvious fact that he made superior music. (He did create a few stock models in jazz that persisted for an impressively long period after his death, but that's a different matter.) 
 These are among the year's great albums because they are high-quality proofs of one of jazz's basic properties: the possibility for transcendence on the gig, for a great band to be even better. This is true in any kind of music, but it is much more true in jazz. 
 There are a lot of great jazz musicians in New York, and in the world. But the number of great and economically sustainable bands has declined, along with an international audience and a circuit of clubs that encourages those bands to feel a sense of competition, and opportunities for those bands to play repeatedly for regular audiences in the same small places. A. J. Liebling once wrote that French food declined after World War I with the rise of highway driving, since small restaurants weren't committed to satisfying the same clientele night after night. Instead, they could serve the same dishes and not worry about improvement; regular waves of new diners would chew away, unaware of the stasis. 
 In a way, the same goes for jazz. Both bands, the Monk-Coltrane Quartet of 1957 and the Coltrane Quartet of 1965, had places in New York to take root. Monk and Coltrane played as many as 75 nights within a five-month stretch at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village. The Coltrane Quartet played 14 weeks at the Half Note in the span of a year, from spring 1964 to spring 1965. Fourteen. It was a different time in many ways: it seems that anytime I meet someone who saw either of those bands at those clubs, they won't say that they went once, as if to cross it off a list; they went twice or three times a week, as part of their lives. (No Internet. No TiVo. Cheap rent. No risk of being thought a loser if you liked to go to jazz clubs at night.)
 So there were hundreds of new jazz records this year that weren't as good? It gets forgotten, so it needs repeating: the studio is an unreliable gauge of what the best jazz groups are really up to, even at the highest levels. 
 Monk's quartet with Coltrane recorded three songs in the studio in summer 1957, at the beginning of that band's short existence. They can be heard on ''Thelonious Monk With John Coltrane'' (Riverside/Fantasy). They're very good, and they contain a newly advanced Coltrane. But they are dry-runs when set next to the 51 minutes from Carnegie Hall, which were discovered for the first time in January. 
 The Carnegie tape comes from late November 1957, after five rigorous months of Five Spot gigs, toward the end of the band's six-month life. (Very little taped material of this band in that year at the Five Spot, and with low fidelity, is known to exist.) On the Carnegie album the band is relaxed, limber, magnetic; the tempos are more wakeful. Compare the tune ''Nutty'' between the studio and stage versions, and you will hear it quickly. Coltrane has become agile, finding a flexible way of running his original patterns. Monk balances an inscrutable serenity against driving, almost violent figures. And everything coming from Shadow Wilson, the drummer, is to be savored: he guards and upholds the groove, while building small, richly detailed accents around it. 
 But the band ended a little more than a month later, and contractual issues between Coltrane and Monk's record labels made it impossible for them to record again. We're lucky to have this.
 The Coltrane ''One Down, One Up'' recordings were made by the radio station WABC-FM, in 1965, for a radio show called ''Portraits in Jazz'' with Alan Grant. Even more than the Monk-Coltrane recording, the music is completely based in the rhetoric of the band's live performances; it is a different discipline entirely from studio recordings. The longest piece on the Monk-Coltrane, ''Sweet and Lovely,'' is nine and a half minutes; the title track of ''One Down, One Up'' runs to nearly 28. The Coltrane band had been playing pieces at this length for at least four years, but was still making fairly structured music in the studio. What we hear is a band's shared language in its highest period; Coltrane and the drummer Elvin Jones rarely sounded more individually free, and still elastically tethered to each other.
 The same principle has generated other good records this year, too. An excellent, previously unknown Charlie Parker-Dizzy Gillespie concert from 1945, released on Uptown Records. A new Wynton Marsalis record, ''Live at the House of Tribes,'' recorded in front of an audience of 50 -- his best, to a certain way of thinking, since ''Live at Blues Alley'' in 1986. And coming in February, a recording from 1996 of the Omer Avital Sextet at Smalls, an excellent band of its moment that played hundreds of nights at that tiny club and never got to put out a record properly during its life. 
 Whenever history tells you that a masterpiece was recorded in the studio on a certain day at a certain hour -- Charlie Parker's ''Koko,'' Pat Metheny's ''Bright Size Life,'' Ornette Coleman's ''Shape of Jazz to Come'' -- it's probably not a patch on what those groups did later that night. 
 This is how jazz works. It is not a volume business. (Its essence is the opposite of business.) Its greatest experiences are given away cheaply, to rooms of 50 to 200 people. Literature and visual art are both so different: the creator stands back, judges a fixed object, then refines or discards before letting the words go to print, or putting images to walls. A posthumously found Hemingway novel is never as good as what he judged to be his best work. But in jazz there is always the promise that the art's greatest examples -- even by those long dead -- may still be found.

HEADLINE: Some Books Are Worth Giving; Some Books Are Also Worth Keeping

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON

 BODY:
There's no escaping the glut of holiday books. They're handsome, they're expensive, they're all too easy to sell at a secondhand bookstore or repackage as a birthday present a few months from now. 
 But here are a two suggestions for books that you will want to keep (or buy with that nice gift certificate). They are books that sharpen the mind and stir the heart.
The first is ''The Solitude of Self: Thinking About Elizabeth Cady Stanton,'' by Vivian Gornick, published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. 
 Stanton belonged to that astonishing band of 19th-century American radicals who changed the way we live -- among them Frederick Douglass, Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Susan B. Anthony and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. Abolitionism taught the women to fight for justice; feminism challenged the men to expand their vision of what justice means. 
 I love writers who treat thinking as a dynamic process. Ms. Gornick does -- here, and in all her books. Imagine a photographer of the psyche. She studies her subject from all angles. Whether in close-up or on a landscape crowded with political and religious movements, she explores the public and private selves. 
 Stanton was brilliant -- driven by, in Ms. Gornick's words, ''a passion for thought'' and for language. In her early years she cared for seven children during the day, then sat down in the kitchen at midnight ''to write a two-hour speech that demanded to know what it meant to be a human being.'' In later years she toured the country to deliver those two-hour speeches in person and went before Congress to petition for suffrage. 
 In 1848 Stanton and a small band of radical women had officially opened the war for women's rights at a convention in Seneca Falls, N.Y., issuing a ''Declaration of Sentiments'' based on the Declaration of Independence and written by Stanton. (Among their demands were the right to vote, attend college and own property if married.) How stirring it is to read: ''He has compelled her to submit to laws, in the formation of which she has no voice.'' ''He has endeavored in every way that he could to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.'' 
 But Ms. Gornick's book opens at a women's rights convention in 1892. Stanton is a 76-year-old veteran of a 44-year struggle. She will die in 10 years and she has learned, Ms. Gornick writes, that ''beyond the need for political equality lay an equally great need to create the conditions in which the inner life could flourish.'' 
 Women may desire to be coddled and sheltered, she told her audience; men may encourage that desire. But in the end, despite family, friends, lovers and allies, each of us is ''a solitary voyager. Our most bitter disappointments, our brightest hopes and ambitions are known only to ourselves. Alike amid the greatest triumphs and darkest tragedies of life, we walk alone.'' 
 This is the reality of human nature, Ms. Gornick writes, in words that bind Stanton's past to our present: ''We are compelled to create a society that will help us fight the worst in ourselves. To deny anyone the tools of survival -- that is, the power to act -- is criminal.'' 
 Stanton did not equivocate or retreat. She chastised the state first, and then the church. Her Women's Bible subjects every passage written about women to stern scholarly analysis. She criticized the social and religious bigotry of women. 
 So does Ms. Gornick. Stanton was born into a distinguished Anglo-Saxon family. She too could be a snob and a bigot when pushed to the wall, heaping scorn on ''ignorant and degraded men'' -- native-born like ''Sambo'' or immigrants like ''the Irishman.'' How dare they have the vote when cultivated white women like herself did not? 
 What, Ms. Gornick asks, is this ''strangely persistent'' human need to see others as alien and unreal, even when we have suffered exclusion ourselves? Suffering can humanize people, she answers, but it also damages them. One of the first signs of damage is the need to turn our rage and shame onto someone else; to play, however briefly, the superior ''Us'' to a lesser ''Them.'' 
 What a potent book this is! What a boon to be reminded that politics, like art, demands bold thought and unceasing imagination. 
 Another book worth making a place for on your shelf is ''No Applause -- Just Throw Money: The Book That Made Vaudeville Famous,'' by Trav S. D. (Faber & Faber). This delicious cultural history tracks America's sturdiest entertainment form back to Roman clowns and medieval Feasts of Fools, then forward to snake-oil salesmen and blackface minstrels; magicians and ventriloquists; trained mules and seals; stars like Mae West, Bert Williams, the Marx Brothers, Fanny Brice, W. C. Fields, Fred Astaire and the Nicholas Brothers; the comics who ruled 1950's television and those who rule each new season of ''Saturday Night Live''; the avant-garde of Becket and Ionesco and ''new vaudevillians'' like Penn and Teller, Bill Irwin and the Bindlestiff Family Circus. 
 The author was formerly known as D. Travis Stewart; Trav S. D. is his vaudevillesque pen name. With its aesthetic of surprise and constant stimulus, he writes, the variety show is perfect for our ''post-MTV, post-postmodern, attention-deficit-ridden age of electronic-induced schizophrenia.'' A typical show encompassed everything ''from the puritanical to the licentious, from the patriotic to the anarchistic; from idolaters of wealth to egalitarians; and on and on.'' 
 The writing is as snappy as these troupers and headliners deserve. And the scholarship is high-class. Nothing reveals a people more clearly than what entertains them and how they define it. Mr. Stewart links the history of the form to the social, economic and sexual history of the nation. Vaudeville matured as the United States became a manufacturing power. ''Like pop bottles or Colt pistols, variety performers now passed by continuously on an 'assembly line' '' of acts that played from 10:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
 In the late 19th century, vaudeville's managers decided to divorce it from bawdy saloons and low-life clubs patronized only by men. They stressed the pure and the wholesome to attract women and children. (Is it a surprise that at the same time, feminists were being roundly attacked as unwomanly and immoral?)
 Now that movies are at the center of the culture, we get plenty of good books about film. But theater was there first. After all, isn't America a kind of ethnic, social and political variety show? 
 Books as fine as these never fail to save us from what Stanton called ''the solitude of ignorance.''

PERSON: William J. Oswald

HEADLINE: W. J. Oswald, 86, Algae Miracle Worker, Dies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
William J. Oswald, a scientist who pioneered ways to use algae to address immense human problems -- including treating sewage, increasing food supplies, generating energy and facilitating voyages into deep space -- died on Dec. 8 at his home in Concord, Calif. He was 86.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, said the University of California, Berkeley, where Dr. Oswald was a professor emeritus in civil and environmental engineering. 
Dr. Oswald promised miracles from the humblest of plants and proceeded to perform more than a few. 
 He developed a system of ponds in which algae eat and purify wastewater, and built more than 100 around the world. The algae could then be harvested using his patented process as protein-rich food for animals or people able to ignore its provenance. The leftover water, now cleansed, could be used for irrigation, as a coolant for engines and even, with more purification, for human consumption.
 The sludge from the bottom of the pond could be added to the soil as humus, he advised. Methane gas produced by the algae could be captured and used. The per-acre yield of protein is 10 times that of soybeans, and algae suffer from few of the diseases that affect other crops. Since algae can do all this work in seawater, more precious freshwater can be conserved.
 ''It is technically feasible to apply controlled photosynthesis to reclaim and reuse our wastes an indefinite number of times and in so doing to produce unprecedented quantities of food, water and raw materials at costs within the economic reach of most societies,'' Dr. Oswald said in a speech in 1960. 
 Many of these concepts were realized in experiments or actual projects. Dr. Oswald's ingenious idea for having astronauts take along some algae to treat their waste, while producing oxygen and water, has so far been tested only with mice, successfully.
 Treatment systems designed by Dr. Oswald or patterned after his design are now in use in Bolivia, Brazil, Greece, Mexico and South Africa, as well as in the United States.
 Dr. Oswald was particularly interested in applying his ideas for simple, affordable, sustainable wastewater treatment to developing countries. In recent years, he worked with the government of India to develop a way to use algae ponds to purify the Ganges River.
 In a 1998 article on this Ganges effort, The New Yorker declared, ''Oswald is to algae what Michael Jordan is to basketball.''
 This year, Dr. Oswald received a lifetime achievement prize from the International Society for Applied Phycology (the branch of botany dealing with seaweed and algae). In addition, colleagues from around the world have nominated him for next year's Stockholm Water Prize.
 Dr. Oswald was born in King City, Calif., on July 6, 1919, and grew up on a ranch in Southern California, where his interest in water, agricultural production and human health began. As a child, he witnessed the choking death of a schoolmate from a roundworm infection caused by poor sanitation.
 During World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces and was responsible for food and water sanitation for one of the D-Day invasion camps. While still in the Army after the war, he was a hospital administrator and coordinated the care of patients suffering from the effects of contaminated water.
 He used the G.I. Bill to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a degree in civil engineering. He stayed on to get a Ph.D. in sanitary engineering, biology and public health in 1967, the same year he joined the Berkeley faculty. He became a full professor in 1970.
 In 2001, Dr. Oswald joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a senior staff scientist.
 Dr. Oswald is credited with developing the advanced wastewater pond systems technology in which wastewater passes through a series of ponds to be treated. These ''high-rate ponds'' use algae fermentation to produce oxygen, which purifies sewage. The more common and much more expensive methods use electromechanical methods to produce oxygen.
 Dr. Oswald, who wore two hearing aids and had an impish smile, is survived by his wife, Eileen; his sons, Patrick, of Alamo, Calif., and Michael, of Chula Vista, Calif.; a sister, Roberta Oswald of King City; and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Regulators Urge Mortgage Caution 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
Bank regulators issued proposed guidance on Tuesday telling lenders that they should be cautious with innovative mortgage products that might strain the finances of borrowers and banks as interest rates rise. 
 ''While innovations in mortgage lending can benefit some consumers, the agencies are concerned that these practices can present unique risks that institutions must appropriately manage,'' bank regulators said in a statement.
 The guidance addresses nontraditional mortgages, like those in which the borrower pays only interest initially. Other concerns involved reduced documentation to qualify for loans and pairing nontraditional loans with second mortgages.
 The proposal was issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration. 
 Regulators and some economists have started raising concerns about loose lending practices and the more aggressive use of what some have called ''exotic'' mortgages that carry greater risks than traditional 30-year fixed-rate loans.

HEADLINE: Chinese Computer Maker Recruits a Chief From Dell 

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Lenovo, the Chinese computer company, said yesterday that it had recruited a senior vice president from a rival, Dell, as its new chief executive and president. 
 The management move comes seven months after the Chinese company completed its purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer business. Analysts say the arrival of the executive, William J. Amelio, suggests that Lenovo wants to move swiftly to generate growth to try to match Dell's prowess in global operating efficiency. 
''Clearly, Dell is targeted by this move,'' said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, a research firm in San Jose, Calif.
 Mr. Amelio succeeds Stephen M. Ward Jr., who led the management team that came from I.B.M. The Lenovo purchase of I.B.M.'s PC business, a $1.75 billion deal announced a year ago, has been widely seen as a sign of China's economic rise and the global ambitions of its corporations. But while I.B.M. played a crucial role in creating the PC industry when it entered the market in 1981, the company rarely made money selling personal computers.
 So there was a question about whether an I.B.M. executive like Mr. Ward was the right person to lead Lenovo. Mr. Ward will remain a consultant to Lenovo.
 Under Mr. Ward, Lenovo assembled an international management team from a variety of companies. It attracted a $350 million investment from three private equity firms. And the market share of Lenovo, the world's third-largest PC maker, after Dell and Hewlett-Packard, has increased slightly since the merger.
 Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's chairman, praised Mr. Ward's skills in speeding the smooth integration of the two companies, and he emphasized that Lenovo's strategy would not change. But the next step for the company, he said, would be to focus on growth and improved efficiency.
 ''Bill Amelio's skills and experience are the best fit for the next phase of our business,'' Mr. Yang said.
 Mr. Amelio, 48, has been the head of Dell's business in the Asia-Pacific region since 2001. Before that, he held senior executive positions at NCR, Honeywell and Allied Signal. Mr. Amelio, who earned an M.B.A. at Stanford, also has an I.B.M. heritage, having worked at the company from 1979 to 1997. His last 18 months at I.B.M. were spent as the general manager of worldwide operations for its PC business.
 In an interview, Mr. Amelio called his new job ''a great honor and an opportunity,'' and said he would focus on building the Lenovo brand, customer service and increasing the efficiency of the company's procurement and operations.

HEADLINE: Home Construction Is Up; Producer Price Index Falls 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Home building picked up speed in November, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the housing market in much of the country remains robust, though below records set earlier this year. 
 A Labor Department report, also released yesterday, showed that the Producer Price Index fell by 0.7 percent last month as energy prices fell 4 percent. Prices excluding the volatile energy and food sectors were up 0.1 percent from October, less than economists had expected.
Taken together, the reports further supported the opinion of many analysts that the economy has recovered from much of the damage inflicted by high energy prices and the hurricanes and is poised to end 2005 on a high note. 
 A major concern in the last few months has been the health of the nation's long housing boom, which has shown signs of slowing.
 The Commerce Department said housing starts increased 5.3 percent last month, to an annual rate of 2.2 million, from the month before and was 17.5 percent higher than in November 2004. Permits for new housing, a measure that indicates future construction, were up 2.5 percent for the month and 3 percent for the year.
 The housing start statistics have a significant margin of error -- plus or minus 7.7 percent for the monthly change and 6.8 percent for the annual change -- suggesting that the figures are likely to be revised up or down as more data is collected.
 ''There is no question that we are going out in this year with a lot of momentum,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a research firm. 
 ''That momentum will carry us through at least the first half of next year,'' he said, but added that construction would slow in the second half of the year as mortgage interest rates continue to rise and the benefits of reconstruction on the Gulf Coast taper off. 
 He said he expected the annualized monthly rate to slip to 1.84 million homes in the second half of the year, down from the 2.2 million in November of this year. 
 Mortgage rates, at historic lows for much of the year, have recently climbed to a national average of 6.3 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage last week, from a low of 5.53 percent in June, according to Freddie Mac. Mortgage rates are expected to rise further because the Federal Reserve has indicated it will continue to raise interest rates in the new year.
 The housing market, particularly for new homes, has proved forecasters, and even home builders, wrong in recent months. The National Association of Home Builders said Monday that an index that measures the confidence of its members fell 4 points this month, to 57. 
 While still considered an optimistic reading, the decline was the second consecutive monthly one and it left the index at its lowest level in more than three years.
 Builders surveyed said they were offering more promotions to lure buyers, who are increasingly resisting higher home prices.
 On the broader inflation front, prices also appear to be cooling off, mostly because of lower energy prices. At the wholesale level, gasoline prices dropped 10.7 percent and heating oil tumbled 15.5 percent last month after increasing by similarly large numbers in September and October. Prices for cars and light trucks fell 0.8 percent.
 But the November price declines have not made up completely for the sharp increase in energy prices earlier this year. The Producer Price Index, which in contrast to the Consumer Price Index does not include distribution costs, subsidies and taxes, was up 4.4 percent from November 2004; excluding energy and food it was up 1.7 percent for the 12 months.

HEADLINE: Thrown Together in a Crisis, Strangers Share Cars and Life Stories

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Janon Fisher, Corey Kilgannon and Fernanda Santos contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The BMW in Brooklyn held an office temp, a lawyer and a technology worker. The courier's van in Queens was crowded with the driver and his buddies and a man who had flagged them down. 
 Then there was the minivan, down from the Bronx, in northern Manhattan. In it were a doorman, a dental office worker and a man with his son.
Yesterday was a day many New Yorkers will long recall, a day when many put aside their fear and loathing of the stranger, a day when doctors, dancers and designers traded in the normal anonymity of subway trains for the intimacy of an unfamiliar car.
 It was also a day of creative transportation, when scooters scooted and bicyclists biked. For some, there were corporate chartered buses. For the well-shod, sneakers were a mainstay of the commute. 
 Of all the possibilities, however, the simple car pool -- brought on by a city rule requiring at least four people in vehicles heading into Manhattan south of 96th Street -- seemed to rise above the pack.
 Throughout the city, strangers crammed into sedans and minivans. Rides were offered from rolled-down windows. Makeshift hitchhiking posts sprung up along the curb.
 The regulations -- and the car-pooling they inspired -- were more widespread than in the last transit strike, in 1980. Then, cars with two or more occupants were allowed on Manhattan streets and only those with a single rider were prohibited south of 96th Street and in certain tunnels and bridges.
 ''Are you going into the city?'' Steven Lai demanded of the man in the van whom he saw stopped at a traffic light in Queens yesterday. ''Can you give me a ride, too?''
 So it went on West 111th Street as well, where Miguel Tejada, a doorman from the Bronx, stopped to pick up Marie Russo, a dental office worker, and then George Estevez and his son.
 In the crowded van, things got personal. Fast.
 ''Since my son refuses to give me grandkids,'' Mr. Estevez explained, ''I had to adopt my own.'' His son, George Jr., rolled his eyes.
 In Brooklyn, Heidi Mortensen, a lawyer, stopped for Hilesh Panchal, a technology consultant, then watched as Lisa White, a temporary worker, hopped in the car.
 ''God bless you,'' Ms. White, who was wearing a white down jacket with a fur-trimmed hood, said. It was an odd collection: Mr. Panchal with his laptop and glasses, Ms. Mortensen behind the wheel of her BMW convertible in an overcoat and chic Angora hat. 
 Still, an instant fellowship developed and there was not a silent moment as they drove. Ms. Mortensen talked about her real estate adventures, first apartments, things like that. Ms. White confessed that she was worried about her job, a temporary spot at Fisher-Price. Mr. Panchal, more the silent type, did not say much. He wondered how he might get home at night.
 There were also those, of course, who couldn't fill their cars. At the entrance to the Queensboro Bridge, Mihai Ibanescu, a taxi driver, argued with a traffic officer who told him that his empty cab was not allowed across until 11 a.m.
 ''It's silly not to let me into Manhattan,'' Mr. Ibanescu said. ''Don't they need cabs there?''
 He pulled to the curb, stepped out and began to flag down riders from the steady stream of walkers heading to the bridge. Nearby, Vasco Macas, a livery driver, also stood there yelling: ''Three to Manhattan, I need three. Three for free. No pay. I just need to get over.''
 Meanwhile, on the Manhattan side, pedestrians were met by American Red Cross workers offering snacks and coffee.
 ''Congratulations, guys, you made it,'' yelled Henry Chin, a volunteer. ''Have some coffee or hot chocolate. You need the energy for the rest of your trip.''
 For those who worked for major corporations, shuttle buses were dispatched. As passengers streamed off the Staten Island Ferry, a fleet was waiting from Con Edison, White & Case, Lehman Brothers, Sidley Austin Brown & Wood. 
 Not all of the shuttle systems worked, however.
 ''Was supposed to be here an hour ago,'' Randy Bollinger said of his Wall Street-sponsored bus. He was waiting at 93rd Street and Broadway, carrying an overnight bag.
 Then there was Benjamin Niemczyk, who learned a simple economics lesson. On Monday evening, Mr. Niemczyk thought ahead and placed an advertisement on the Internet offering a free ride for yesterday from Brooklyn to the Upper East Side. He received only one response. Yesterday, however, he placed another ad for rides for this morning, this time for a fee.
 ''No fewer than 15 responses arrived in the first five minutes,'' he wrote in an e-mail message to The New York Times. 
 ''New York: a walking city? Perhaps. New York: a money city? Definitely.''
 In general, transportation yesterday was limited by the imagination alone. There were, of course, the obvious modes: scooters, skateboards, bicycles and feet.
 ''Wheels,'' said David Arnowitz, a media consultant, ''that's the crucial element.'' He was traveling by in-line skates from his apartment on West 98th Street to his office at Eighth Avenue and 33rd Street. 
 Jerry Litwin, a property manager, had mounted a sturdy Trek bicycle for the ride from 101st Street and West End Avenue to 38th Street and Fifth Avenue. At 51st Street, though, his eyes began to leak.
 ''I've got weak tear ducts,'' Mr. Litwin said, his face slicked with the salty, frozen drops. ''But the bike is doing fine.''
 One intrepid soul approached a desk attendant at the Claremont Riding Academy, on the Upper West Side, to inquire if he might rent a horse.
 ''Nobody's going to work by horse today,'' the attendant, Sharon Halley, said. ''There's nowhere to put a horse once you get to work.''
 Meanwhile, Ms. Mortensen's BMW drove west along Canal Street, where the traffic was light enough that it prompted Ms. White to say, ''Wouldn't it be great if a strike happened more often? There's no traffic in Manhattan.''
 Mr. Panchal got out at Canal and Avenue of the Americas. Ms. White got out at West 21st Street. Ms. Mortensen's destination was the New York office of the Macquarie Bank in Rockefeller Center.
 ''It's kind of nice what happens to people when there's a crisis in this city,'' she said. ''Somehow, they're just nicer to one another than they're used to being.''
 ''I didn't even worry when I stopped to give these people a ride and I took the first person I asked, the first guy I saw walking down the street. I really believe that when you're nice to people, they're going to be nice to you back.''

HEADLINE: As Traffic Dwindles, Strike Inflicts Broad Economic Pain

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Reporting for this article was contributed by Charles V. Bagli, Corey Kilgannon, Colin Moynihan, Robin Pogrebin and Daniel J. Wakin.

 BODY:
At Century 21, the discount department store near Wall Street where shopping is usually a contact sport, a smattering of customers yesterday found the retail version of a Christmas miracle: entire aisles to themselves and no lines at the registers.
 At F. illi Ponte, a venerable TriBeCa restaurant that gave its employees cab fare on Monday to make sure they would show up to work yesterday, half the day's reservations were canceled. 
And at a Midtown spot near Bryant Park where a 52-story office tower is being built, barely half the construction workers made it to the job, and those who did were slowed by delays in getting building materials delivered.
 The strike called early yesterday by subway and bus workers had a ''severe to devastating'' effect on businesses, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said, denouncing the Transport Workers Union and demanding an end to the walkout. City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated the cost to the city's economy at $400 million the first day, and $300 million for each subsequent weekday this week.
 Whether such assessments are accurate, a drive past storefronts with their security gates locked at midday or a stroll through eerily quiet shops the week before Christmas left no doubt that the strike was inflicting widespread economic pain.
 Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an alliance of hundreds of businesses, said that about 20 percent of those companies' employees were absent. Most affected, she said, were the lower-level employees who are more likely to live in the city and are most reliant on public transportation.
 But many city office workers who live in the suburbs also stayed away, dissuaded by the prospect of a city paralyzed. The region's commuter railroads and bus lines had fewer riders than usual from the suburbs. 
 The stores and restaurants so reliant on the surge of commuters into the city and the holiday boom in sales were especially injured.
 At Lord & Taylor's flagship store in Midtown, so many sales clerks were absent that managers were pressed into service helping the small number of customers. At a Brooks Brothers store in the Financial District, salespeople with little to do but straighten and re-straighten the displays outnumbered customers yesterday morning.
 Ordinarily, commuters stream through Flushing News Island, a shop next to a No. 7 subway entrance in Flushing, Queens, but not yesterday. ''I'm just sitting here,'' said Qamar Ali, the owner. ''It's totally dead. I hope this strike ends soon, or otherwise we can't pay next month's rent.''
 Mitchell Modell, chief executive of Modell's Sporting Goods, said sales at his stores in the city fell by at least half. ''If it goes on much longer, I'll be on suicide watch,'' he said.
 Burt P. Flickinger III, a retail industry consultant, said that if the strike lasts only a day or two shoppers will mostly make up for it by buying more later in the week. But if the walkout continues, stores will lose their most important week of the year, he said, and ''the economic impact could be pretty egregious.''
 ''If it goes a full week, sales could be off 50 percent or more for the week,'' he said. ''In terms of lost operating income, it could be a quarter- to half-a-billion dollars.''
 The drop in retail and restaurant sales also cut into the city's and the state's sales tax revenues. But the city's loss could be a gain for the suburbs and businesses with Internet sites, if shoppers who do not want to come into Manhattan decide to shop near home or online instead.
 There was some dispute among experts over the city's estimate of economic losses. Rosemary Scanlon, a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that much of the hardship is tough to gauge, occurring person by person and small business by small business, but that she thought the city's figures were about right.
 ''The nursing aides, the nannies, the store clerks, the people with back-room jobs at restaurants -- these are the hardest hit, but we can't see it as readily as the big businesses,'' said Ms. Scanlon, who teaches at New York University. ''There's a real income class difference in who can work at home on the computer and who can't, and that's one of the biggest changes from previous strikes.''
 Rae Rosen, a senior economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that official estimates might be exaggerated, noting that much of the financial services industry was operating almost normally. The effects will decline over time, she said, ''as people figure out how to do business, how to get to work.''
 Some businesses said the strike had little effect on them. Several Manhattan hotels, nearly full with holiday travelers, said occupancy rose, as local business executives sought to wait out the strike in hotel rooms, rather than brave the trip home.
 Tourists staying in Midtown continued to seek out nearby attractions like Radio City Music Hall. Several members of the concert hall's orchestra slept in a lounge on Monday night, and other players rode bicycles or walked yesterday. 
 Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, which promotes tourism in the city, said, ''What we think is really going to hurt is the tourism industry in the outlying areas -- Harlem, Lower Manhattan, the outer boroughs.''
 Work on Wall Street continued unabated. Most of the 3,000 traders and others who work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange made it to work -- in fact, many arrived early. Trading was slightly heavier yesterday than it was the same day last year, 1.47 billion shares.

HEADLINE: In Final Hours, M.T.A. Took A Big Risk On Pensions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
On the final day of intense negotiations, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, it turns out, greatly altered what it had called its final offer, to address many of the objections of the transit workers' union. The authority improved its earlier wage proposals, dropped its demand for concessions on health benefits and stopped calling for an increase in the retirement age, to 62 from 55.
 But then, just hours before the strike deadline, the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, put forward a surprise demand that stunned the union. Seeking to rein in the authority's soaring pension costs, he asked that all new transit workers contribute 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions, up from the 2 percent that current workers pay. The union balked, and then shut down the nation's largest transit system for the first time in a quarter-century.
Yet for all the rage and bluster that followed, this war was declared over a pension proposal that would have saved the transit authority less than $20 million over the next three years. 
 It seemed a small figure, considering that the city says that every day of the strike will cost its businesses hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues. But the authority contends that it must act now to prevent a ''tidal wave'' of pension outlays if costs are not brought under control.
 Roger Toussaint, the president of the union, Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said the pension proposal, made Monday night just before the 12:01 a.m. strike deadline, would effectively cut the wages of new workers by 4 percent.
 ''They're trying to beat down wages for our new workers,'' Mr. Toussaint said yesterday.
 In the days immediately before the strike deadline, the union kept hammering the point that the authority's pension demands would save little over the life of a three-year contract. 
 Indeed, not just Mr. Toussaint but some other New Yorkers are questioning whether it was worthwhile for the authority to go to war over the issue when the authority's pension demands would apparently save less over the next three years than what the New York City Police Department will spend on extra overtime during the first two days of the strike.
 ''What they'd be saving on pensions is a pittance,'' Mr. Toussaint said.
 Robert Linn, a former New York City labor commissioner, questioned the transportation authority's decision -- with the backing of the mayor and governor -- to go to the mat over pensions with a union that can exact huge pain on the city in a year when the authority was enjoying a $1 billion surplus.
 ''They might have picked a union that was more willing to consider the subject,'' Mr. Linn said. ''It not just the considerable economic power of this union, it's also the timing,'' just before Christmas. ''It's tremendously problematic.'' 
 Gary J. Dellaverson, the authority's director of labor relations, said he and the authority's other negotiators had tried to be flexible in making the pension offer.
 ''We tried to remold our position, to be reflective of their issues and still be consistent with our finances and our bargaining goals -- what we considered a good faith effort to close the deal,'' he said.
 Labor negotiations resemble high-stakes poker, and it was not until a few hours before the strike deadline that the authority 's chairman, Mr. Kalikow, showed his hand, making an offer far different from what he had previously said was his final offer.
 With the transit workers' union demanding raises above inflation, Mr. Kalikow raised his wage offer so that raises would average 3.5 percent a year for three years, up from 3 percent in his previous offer. Responding to the union's demand that he not raise the retirement age, Mr. Kalikow also dropped his proposal that future transit workers not qualify for a full pension until age 62, up from 55 for current workers.
 But then he put his new demand on the table, that new workers contribute 6 percent of their wages to finance their pensions -- a demand that clashed with Mr. Toussaint's oft-repeated refusal to sell out the ''unborn,'' meaning new workers. 
 Mr. Dellaverson declined to spell out how much that proposal would save each year. ''Pension changes always have small effects at the beginning and grow over time,'' he said.
 John J. Murphy, a pension expert and former executive director of the New York City Employees' Retirement System, said he computed that the authority's pension proposal would have a modest saving at first: $2.25 million in the first year, $4.8 million in the second year and $7.8 million in the third year.
 But he said the plan would achieve significant savings, more than $160 million in the first 10 years, with some officials estimating that it would save more than $80 million a year after 20 years.
 Mr. Dellaverson said it was important for the authority to try to control its pension outlays even in a year when it had a surplus. The authority's pension outlays for the transit workers have soared to $453 million this year, triple the amount in 2002.
 ''If you know a tidal wave is coming and you can still play around in the surf because it's not here yet, anyone would think that's foolishness,'' Mr. Dellaverson said.
 That wave, he suggested, is a continued rise in pension costs and the authority's forecast of a $1 billion deficit in 2009.
 Mr. Dellaverson said the week of negotiations at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Midtown were unusual because the union made hardly any firm counteroffers. ''The longer you wait to start to address the problem,'' he said, ''the more dramatic the changes must be to address them.''
 He said the union made no new offer countering the authority's pension offers. The union, he said, asked for an 8 percent raise a year, without ever specifying how many years of 8 percent raises it wanted.
 He said that just before negotiations broke off on Monday, ''We made another offer, even though the union had never countered our earlier offer,'' he said. ''From a tactical standpoint, it's unusual in my little business.''
 Several union officials said Mr. Toussaint was often reluctant to make a new proposal -- for instance, lowering a wage demand -- because the clamorous dissidents in the union might seize on such a move to accuse him of selling out.
 E. J. McMahon, a budgetary expert at the Manhattan Institute who favors reducing government pension costs, said there were wise and unwise aspects to the authority's focus on pensions in the bargaining.
 ''On one hand, the transit workers are the hardest union to bring this up with,'' he said. ''On the other hand, this has really put a spotlight on the pension issue.''

HEADLINE: Both Resentment and Regret For Strikers on the First Day 

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Outside the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's power command center, a brick building on West 53rd Street, a dozen subway workers paced the picket line yesterday, carrying their green and white strike placards and dissecting each of the reasons that they said led them there.
 As they saw it, they were looking at an old deal that did not keep up with inflation and a new offer that would set them further behind, a billion-dollar surplus that provides discounts to riders but cannot accommodate a decent wage increase, and a pension proposal that is generous to current workers but stingy to future employees. 
Collectively, the workers sounded as defiant as they did in days past, charging that the authority is sitting on a pile of money but wants them to have none of it. Individually, however, every one of them wished that the authority and their union had been able to reach a compromise instead of leaving them no option but to walk off their jobs.
 ''None of us really want to be on strike,'' said Mark Solomon, 45, a subway booth clerk, ''but we were left with no other choice.''
 ''I have six children -- and four of them still have to get to college. I have a home. I have a family, and my family is suffering too,'' Mr. Solomon said. ''But we're all in this together, and we have no choice but to stick together until the bitter end. I just hope the end will come soon.''
 The state's Taylor Law prohibits strikes by public employees, and a judge ruled yesterday that the union would have to pay $1 million each day it is on strike. 
 The workers themselves are being fined one day's pay, in addition to one day of lost wages for every day they are on strike, and the loss weighs heavily on their minds, they said. This is, after all, the holiday season, and less money will mean less holiday bounty, and if they do not take a stand this time, they said, they will never get the respect and the money they deserve.
 ''We're tired of being ignored,'' said Anthony Westby, 46, a power inspector. ''This is our chance to prove once and for all that the work that we do is important and that we deserve better pay, better benefits and better treatment.'' 
 The transit system was last brought to a standstill in April 1980, for 11 days. Back then, however, New Yorkers did not brave below-freezing temperatures as they walked or biked to work, and retailers did not have to fear losing millions of dollars during one of the busiest shopping weeks. 
 But to argue that retailers will lose money during a transit strike, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has done, adds ''insult to the injury,'' as one worker put it. ''It's just proof that the city is really not concerned about the public,'' said Antonio Trinidad, 35, a subway booth clerk. ''This is about Macy's, it's about Bloomingdale's, and it's about the tourists.''
 After a pause to gulp from a cup of hot tea, Mr. Trinidad added: ''The bottom line is that we went on strike because the M.T.A. has squandered and mismanaged my money, your money and every taxpayer's money -- and that has got to stop.''
 The Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents 33,700 transit employees, has asked its members to staff 60 picket lines throughout the five boroughs for as long as the strike lasts. 
 Throughout most of the afternoon outside the power command center, which workers described as ''the brains of the New York City subways'' because it controls power distribution to the tracks, passing drivers tooted their horns as a sign of support. One man who rolled by on a bicycle gave the strikers a thumbs-up sign and said, ''I hope you get what you want.''
 ''To know that people are on our side makes us feel good,'' said David Ramirez, 46, a conductor on the B line.
 ''It's very sad that we had to go on strike; we're all very sad that it had to happen,'' Mr. Ramirez said. ''But even if we wanted to go to work, we couldn't because all the subway stations are locked.''

HEADLINE: U.N. Creates Commission to Assist Nations Recovering From Wars 

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 20 

 BODY:
The General Assembly and Security Council passed resolutions on Tuesday founding a Peacebuilding Commission to help stabilize and rebuild societies emerging from war.
 Creation of the commission represented the first concrete achievement of a session dedicated to adopting proposals for major institutional and management changes, which were showcased this fall in the largest meeting of heads of state and government in the United Nations' 60-year history. 
 Jan Eliasson of Sweden, president of the General Assembly, said the commission was critical for keeping war-torn countries from reverting to hostilities, which he said had occurred in half the cases over the past 20 years where conflicts had ended.
 The commission is intended to pick up the international effort in such countries when peacekeeping missions are completing their tasks of bringing fighting to an end and monitoring cease-fires.
 Secretary General Kofi Annan told the General Assembly that while many parts of the United Nations had traditionally been involved in helping countries in longer-term recovery after protracted conflicts, there had never been an entity to coordinate those activities, develop expertise and strategy and focus attention on reconstruction and the building of institutions.
 ''Too often,'' he said, ''a fragile peace has been allowed to crumble into renewed conflict.''
 The new commission will have 31 members. Seven, including the 5 veto-holding permanent members, will come from the 15-member Security Council; 7 from the 54-nation Economic and Social Council; 5 from the 10 top contributors to the United Nations; 5 from the 10 nations that supply the most troops for peacekeeping missions; and 7 chosen to assure geographical balance by regional groupings.
 Representatives of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other institutional donors will be expected to attend meetings.
 While the Peacebuilding Commission was always considered the least controversial of the institutional proposals under consideration, and was approved by consensus without a vote, its passage still raised concern among many members of the 191-member General Assembly. Those members felt that they and not the 15-member Security Council should play the dominant role in its function.
 Maged Abdelaziz, the ambassador from Egypt, told the General Assembly that the makeup and rules of the commission constituted a ''flagrant contravention with the principle of national ownership of peace-building activities'' and held the new commission ''hostage to the prerogatives of the Security Council.''
 In an effort to achieve balance, the resolution said that while the commission's main purpose would be to provide advice to the Security Council, it would submit an annual report to the General Assembly for debate.
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, said the United States supported the Peacebuilding Commission. But he said he was concerned that reform proposals the United States thinks of as a priority, like the modernization of management practices and the creation of a Human Rights Council, were lagging and needed to be addressed before the biennial budget is decided this month.
 He noted that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had called on the United Nations to institute ''a lasting revolution of reform.''
 Mr. Bolton said, ''A lasting revolution takes a lot more work than we've accomplished so far.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall a Fourth Day; Interest Rate Worries Cited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Speculation that an increase in housing starts will give the Federal Reserve a reason to keep raising interest rates sent stocks lower yesterday, their fourth day of declines. 
 Shares of General Motors, the world's largest automaker, sank to their lowest price since 1982. The stock's plunge weighed on the Dow Jones industrial average, which has erased almost all its gain for the year.
 Last month's unexpected increase in housing starts overshadowed figures showing that prices paid to producers, like factories and farms, dropped more than predicted. Producer prices declined 0.7 percent last month, the most since April 2003, as energy prices receded, the Labor Department said. 
 The Dow average lost 30.98 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,805.55, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.30 point, to 1,259.62. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.32 point, to 2,222.42.
 Trading slowed on the New York Stock Exchange as the city's first transit strike in 25 years forced traders who ride buses and subways to find alternative ways of getting to work. About 1.47 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board.
 Housing starts in November rose by the most in seven months, with the Commerce Department reporting that builders broke ground on 2.123 million homes at an annual pace, up 5.3 percent from October. 
 The report set off speculation that the White House economic adviser, Ben S. Bernanke, who is expected to become Fed chairman on Feb. 1, may continue raising borrowing costs after taking over.
 ''People are really starting to focus on inflation and interest rates because of the transition at the Fed to Bernanke at the end of January,'' said Scott Jacobson, chief investment strategist for Jefferies & Company in New York.
 Concern that the Federal Reserve will continue its series of interest rate increases, as well as near-record fuel prices have held back gains in stock indexes in the fourth quarter.
 G.M. fell $1.20, to $19.85, the lowest level since October 1982. Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, the world's two largest carmakers by market value, said they expected their 2006 United States sales to rise 10 percent next year, eating away at domestic carmakers' market share.
 Ford Motor lost 18 cents, to $8.05. DaimlerChrysler slid 61 cents, to $50.47.
 Sprint Nextel declined 17 cents, to $24.47. The company has had lackluster subscriber growth since Sprint bought Nextel in August, David Janazzo, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note to clients.
 Morgan Stanley rose $1.04, to $57.71. For the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, the company reported net income of $1.68 a share on revenue of $6.96 billion.
 Crude oil for January delivery increased 1 percent, to $57.98 a barrel in New York.
 Buoyed by the increase in oil prices, a measure of energy stocks had the top gain among 10 groups in the S.& P. 500, adding 0.8 percent. Transocean, the world's largest offshore oil and natural gas drilling company, rose $2, to $68.45. Occidental Petroleum, the fourth-largest United States oil company, added $1.53, to $83.13.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 6/32, to 100 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.46 percent, from 4.43 percent on Monday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: An Unusual Higher Education Moneymaker

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
It is not uncommon for academic institutions to dabble in real estate investments, but the University of Washington's nest egg is unusual -- 11 acres in the heart of the city's downtown, about five miles from its campus. Over the last half-century, rental income generated by this site has played a major role in the development of U.W., one of the state's largest employers. 
 Proceeds from this downtown property, known as Metropolitan Tract, are being used, for example, to repay $44.8 million in construction bonds for William H. Gates Hall, a glassy building that houses the university's law school; it is named for the father of Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft. Private funds made up less than half of the cost.
 The site of the university's original 19th-century campus, Metropolitan Tract today is home to the city's most luxurious hotel, the Fairmont Olympic, which opened in 1924, and the ornate Fifth Avenue Theater. Six buildings of diverse architectural styles have a total of 1.4 million square feet of office space and 207,000 square feet of retail space. 
 The best-known of the buildings is Rainier Tower. In a review in The New York Times in March 1977, Paul Goldberger, who was then the newspaper's architecture critic, described it as ''rather terrifying, since it is hard not to feel a considerable nervousness at the sight of a 40-story skyscraper looming overhead on a concrete pedestal that touches the ground only in the center.'' 
 The architect was Minoru Yamasaki, who also designed the World Trade Center in New York as well as a second building in the Metropolitan Tract where I.B.M. leases four and a half floors.
 These days, many universities are seeking to develop land near their campuses either to enhance their neighborhood or provide housing for students and faculty members. But they are generally reluctant to own large chunks of real estate purely as an investment, said Maureen L. McAvey, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a developers' organization based in Washington, D.C. ''It's expensive to own and maintain, and it's not their expertise,'' she said.
 For 171 years, Columbia University owned the 11.7 acres in Midtown Manhattan that became Rockefeller Center in the 1930's. In 1985, Columbia sold the land because it wanted to make its investment portfolio more liquid.
 But Jeanette L. Henderson, U.W.'s director of real estate, said her university was pleased with the financial performance of the Metropolitan Tract, which is bounded by Union and Seneca Streets and stretches from Third Avenue almost to Sixth Avenue. 
 The university fell into the real estate business by accident. When downtown Seattle was still a wilderness, a group of private citizens anticipated the need for a university and donated a wooded knoll overlooking Elliott Bay for its campus. The university opened in 1861 but by 1895, it had outgrown its campus and moved away. Efforts to sell the original site failed, leaving the university no choice but to lease it. 
 Since 1954, the university's development and management partner (for everything but the hotel) has been a private Seattle company now known as Unico, which built the Rainier and I.B.M. buildings. It was founded by Roger L. Stevens, a real estate investor who once owned the Empire State Building and was also the producer of dozens of Broadway shows, including ''West Side Story.'' 
 Over the past half-century, Ms. Henderson said, the tract had contributed $350 million in gross revenue to U.W. -- money that, by law, can be used only for capital improvements. ''It's been a very productive partnership,'' she said. The buildings are valued today at $500 million, she said.
 But the partnership could well come to an end when Unico's ground lease expires in 2014. The university plans to invite bids from other companies -- a process that will not take place for a few more years -- and Unico itself has been diversifying its interests to prepare for the possible loss of the Metropolitan Tract. 
 With its own future role uncertain, Unico has been trying to make the tract more productive. It is transforming a 1910 medical office building at the corner of 4th Avenue and University Street into 90 high-end apartments. And it is trying to position the strip of Fifth Avenue that lies within the tract as a high-fashion district like the Faubourg St.-Honore in Paris.
 These efforts are coming at a propitious time. New condos have been proliferating downtown, and real estate specialists are optimistic about the city's increasingly diversified economy. During the year that ended Sept. 30, employment in the Seattle area grew by 2.7 percent, compared with an average national growth of 1.7 percent, according to the brokerage firm Grubb & Ellis.
 Marcus & Millichap, an investment brokerage company based in Encino, Calif., recently ranked Seattle as the retail market likely to improve the most over the next two years. The median income of $54,000 is 13 percent higher than it is nationally, and job growth is expected to continue to exceed the national average, said Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services. Yet there is less retail space here than elsewhere. The Seattle area has 34.5 square feet of retail space per capita, compared with 42.3 square feet for the nation as a whole, Mr. Nadji said.
 Downtown shops and restaurants have also benefited from the city's flourishing cruise business, said Mick Schultz, a spokesman for the Port of Seattle, which counted 550,000 passenger trips in and out of Seattle last year, 4.6 times the total in 2000. 
 Shoppers have several fancy local shops to choose from in the Metropolitan Tract as well as a few luxury international retailers like Escada and Louis Vuitton, which is currently expanding its store. Though the I. Magnin store moved out of the 1926 Skinner Building years ago, Brooks Brothers recently opened a 15,000-square-foot store there.
 But much of the retailing -- and the pedestrian traffic -- has migrated northeast to the streets surrounding Pacific Place, a vertical mall that opened in 1994.
 Unico has had little success so far in upgrading the shops at Rainier Square, a lackluster mall adjacent and connected to the office tower. Dale Sperling, the chief executive of Unico, said he had hoped to attract a Four Seasons Hotel to the Fifth Avenue side of the building after the chain lost its management contract for the Olympic to Fairmont in 2004. But Four Seasons has decided to build near the waterfront instead. 
 Uncertainty about the future has made long-term planning difficult, Ms. Henderson said. The developers were able to negotiate an extended lease that applies only to the Cobb Building so that they could realize a profit on their investment 
 Unico is likely to have better results with its Cobb renovation, a painstaking process that has cost more than $30 million and was feasible only because historic-building tax credits were available, Mr. Sperling said. The building is not scheduled to be completed until the spring; some apartment offers views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. 
 Redevelopment of the Cobb was prompted in part by an earthquake in 2001. It caused only slight damage to the building's curved Beaux-Arts facade and left its most distinctive feature, terra-cotta gargoyles representing Iroquois Indians, intact. But a seismic upgrade was ordered.
 Mr. Sperling said he was optimistic that Unico's track record would give his company the edge when the Metropolitan Tract lease expires. But he expects competition to be intense.
 ''They will line up in the street for this account,'' Mr. Sperling said.

HEADLINE: Seven States Agree on a Regional Program to Reduce Emissions From Power Plants

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
New York, New Jersey and five other Northeastern states have formally agreed to join in the first mandatory regional program in United States history to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. 
 After more than two and a half years of intense negotiations that nearly collapsed last week after the withdrawal of two states, the governors of the remaining seven states signed an agreement yesterday to jointly reduce carbon dioxide emissions 10 percent by 2019.
''We will use a market-based system to curtail harmful CO2 emissions and spur the development of innovative technologies that will reduce our dependence on foreign energy, strengthen our economy and take meaningful steps in the fight against climate change,'' Gov. George E. Pataki, who initiated the multistate effort in 2003, said in a statement. 
 Environmentalists praised the regional agreement as a turning point in American efforts to reduce heat-trapping gases that have been linked to global climate change. The seven governors hope that other states will follow their example, leading eventually to the adoption of a national program. 
 ''In the absence of federal leadership, these states have taken real steps to cut carbon dioxide emissions,'' Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey of New Jersey said in a statement. 
 The states' efforts to create a national model were slowed by the loss of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which dropped out over concerns that controls would push up energy prices. Environmentalists also suggested that Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who is expected to run for the Republican nomination for president in 2008, withdrew to distance himself from potential rivals, including Mr. Pataki. 
 Mr. Romney denied that politics played a part in his decision. 
 Representatives of the electric power industry who oppose mandatory controls said that establishing a national program would be impossible because of the conflicting needs of different states. 
 ''It's much easier to sign an agreement than to make it work, even in regions with similar interests,'' said Frank Maisano, a spokesman for the electricity generating industry. Plant operators are switching to clean energy as fast as they can, he said, but imposing caps will only ''affect those who can least afford it.'' 
 The other states in the pact are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. Maryland, Pennsylvania and five Canadian provinces have participated in discussions but are not yet ready to join the program. And several Western states, including California, are working on similar proposals. 
 Under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, as the Northeast plan is known, the seven states will create a flexible system of pollution permits, called allowances. Each state will issue one allowance for every one of the 121 million tons of carbon dioxide that power plants in the region now produce. 
 At least 25 percent of those allowances will be auctioned off, with the proceeds going to consumer subsidies or conservation projects. The rest will be given to power plant operators free of charge. 
 Each power plant will need enough allowances to cover all its emissions. Plants that run on cleaner fuels like natural gas may not use all theirs and can sell surplus ones to generators that need them. 
 Plants that burn coal, which emits far more carbon dioxide, may have to buy additional allowances. 
 Operators also have the option of covering some emissions by financing ''offsets,'' environmentally sound projects that reduce carbon dioxide from sources other than power plants. For example, they can pay to plant trees or finance projects to recover methane gas from landfills. 
 This system of allowances and offsets is intended to encourage technological innovation. A similar program was established in the early 1990's to handle the problem of acid rain. 
 In an attempt to keep Massachusetts in the agreement, the other states amended their original proposal last week. If allowances exceeded $7 a ton, the amount of pollution offsets available would increase. If allowances exceeded $10 a ton, offsets would increase even more, and would be allowed to be financed anywhere in the world. 
 But Mr. Romney did not accept the compromise, and Massachusetts will enact its own program next year. The changes, however, have remained in the plan.
 Based on cost estimates done by the states, average household bills could go up by about $20 a year, although some plant operators claim the increases will be much higher. 
 Andrew O. Ertel, president of Evolution Markets, a brokerage firm in White Plains that handles emissions allowance trading around the world, said the last-minute changes would help create a workable market. 
 ''They add a layer of complexity,'' Mr. Ertel said, ''but in the end they are going to lead to low-cost reductions in CO2 and true environmental benefits.''
 Each of the seven states will issue draft regulations for public review early next year. States must then either submit them for legislative or regulatory approval.

HEADLINE: Gas Emissions Reached High In U.S. in '04

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
American emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming reached an all-time high in 2004, rising 2 percent from the year before, the Energy Department said, nearly double the average annual rate measured since 1990. 
 The department's Energy Information Administration, in a report issued Monday, also raised earlier government estimates of emissions for 2003, pushing that year past 2000 into second place.
No estimates were available for United States emissions in 2005, although energy experts say increased economic growth this year is likely to make it another record-setter. 
 The increases in 2003 and 2004 followed a brief dip in emissions in 2001 and 2002. Government officials said that decline reflected a slowdown in the economy, the departure of some manufacturing industries overseas, and emissions cuts in other industries.
 Less than two weeks ago, Bush administration officials at climate-treaty talks in Montreal repeatedly cited the short-lived drop in emissions after 2000 as evidence that President Bush's climate policy, using voluntary measures to slow growth in the gas releases, was working. 
 In its report, the energy agency said that while overall emissions were growing, the rate of growth continued to slow relative to economic growth, and so remained on the track set by Mr. Bush.
 Yesterday, Lord Rees, the president of the Royal Society, an independent British scientific academy similar to the National Academies in the United States, said the new American data showed that all industrialized countries needed to intensify efforts to cut emissions. He noted that Britain's emissions had also risen in the last two years.
 Lord Rees said that the two countries and the other members of the Group of 8 biggest industrialized nations clearly had to do more to live up to a statement they issued at a summit meeting in Scotland in July, in which they resolved to act with ''urgency'' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 ''We should not underestimate the challenge of achieving economic growth whilst reducing emissions, and the United States is not the only country that is struggling to do this,'' Lord Rees said in a statement. ''But it seems unlikely that the present U.S. strategy of only setting emissions targets relative to economic growth, reducing so-called greenhouse gas intensity, will be enough.''
 Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas generated by humans, remains an unavoidable byproduct of burning the fossil fuels that underpin modern life. Other powerful greenhouse gases include methane, which leaks from landfills and gas pipelines, and nitrous oxide, released mainly from fertilizer use in large-scale farms.
 The gases are measured collectively in tons of carbon dioxide by converting the heat-trapping capacity of each gas into the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same warming effect. 
 By this measure, total American emissions of the six major greenhouse gases in 2004 added up to the equivalent of 7.1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, up 2 percent from 6.98 billion metric tons in 2003. Emissions in 2000 were 6.97 billion tons, the agency said.
 The energy agency's greenhouse gas report is online at eia.doe.gov/environment.html.

HEADLINE: Qatar Finds A Currency Of Its Own: Natural Gas

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: DOHA, Qatar 

 BODY:
''This was a sleepy little town when I moved here eight years ago,'' said Mohamad Moabi, from an office overlooking the turquoise waters alongside this city's crescent-shaped corniche, where dozens of half-built skyscrapers are going up. ''Now it's on the frontier of the global economy.''
 Drawing on a cigarette as he gestured northward, Mr. Moabi, 44, the Lebanese-born chief economist at Qatar's largest bank, pointed to why this tiny emirate, no bigger than Connecticut, is elbowing aside other energy-rich countries to become the leader in the emerging international market for natural gas.
''It helps,'' he said, ''when you have a natural gas field up there that can be extracted for about a century.'' 
 In a shift that has drawn historical comparisons to the ascent of Saudi Arabia's oil industry several decades ago, Qatar has moved swiftly in recent years to develop its huge offshore natural gas reserves -- once dismissed as practically worthless because of the difficulty of transporting gas to distant markets -- while cementing strong military and economic ties with the United States.
 Driven by an ambitious, reform-minded ruling elite, these moves have allowed Qatar to leap ahead of Russia and Iran, the only nations with larger reserves of natural gas, seizing new opportunities to export the fuel to markets in North America, southern Europe and the Far East. 
 Tankers laden with gas supercooled to liquid form already depart each day for Japan and South Korea from the northern port of Ras Laffan, not far from Al Udeid Air Base in the Qatari desert, the American military's main air operations center in the Arabian Peninsula. Soon the ships will start delivering their cargoes to ports in Texas and Louisiana in the most ambitious project to date to bring natural gas from the Middle East to American consumers. 
 These plans, which would help transform the United States into the largest importer of liquefied natural gas, have created some unease at a time when American reliance on oil from the Middle East is still unabated. Even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries tries to strengthen its grip on world oil markets, Qatar has moved to exert greater influence over the trade in natural gas through the creation of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum. 
 With a liaison office in Doha, the group's 12 members, including Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela, control more than 70 percent of the world's gas reserves and more than 40 percent of production. Though in its infancy, the organization has been likened to OPEC in its early efforts to control oil prices, an aspiration that officials here contend is not under consideration. 
 ''Natural gas is not as flexible a commodity as oil and is sold in longer-term contracts,'' Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyeh, Qatar's energy minister, said in an interview. ''The purpose of the forum is to exchange information. We don't believe in confrontation with our consumers.'' 
 Indeed, Qatar's ability to emerge as the world's leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas, with plans to produce 77 million tons of the fuel by the start of the next decade, depends on cooperation. It is working with Western energy companies and Asian shipping concerns in the construction of an immense industrial complex in Ras Laffan near the maritime border with Iran, about an hour's drive through the scorching desert north of Doha. 
 ''We're building what might be the largest plant facility anywhere in the world,'' Wayne A. Harms, the president of operations in Qatar for Exxon Mobil, the largest foreign investor in the country, said in an interview. 
 ''It's happening in a very fast, almost unprecedented period of time,'' Mr. Harms said, describing the frenzied activity of more than 50,000 workers, largely from India and Pakistan, toiling to build the complexes needed to condense natural gas so it can be shipped across the sea. 
 It has been just a decade since the emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, overthrew his father in a bloodless coup, strengthening ties with the United States and betting on an offshore natural gas reserve of 900 trillion cubic feet -- the world's largest purely natural gas reserve, called the North Field -- that it shares with Iran.
 That shift gave Qatar, long a marginal oil producer, a commodity to help it escape the Saudi orbit and the wealth to plot its own path to prosperity. 
 The North Field, discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in 1971 and considered useless at the time because it had no oil and its natural gas was difficult to transport, is now described by some geologists as the second-largest petroleum deposit in the world after the Ghawar oil field in Saudi Arabia. 
 And in an interview at an ornate receiving room at the headquarters of Qatar Petroleum, Mr. Attiyeh, the energy minister, said he expected to see some $100 billion invested in the country through the end of the decade. That cash injection is fueling economic growth estimated at 25 percent in 2004 and 29 percent this year, before adjusting for inflation, according to Qatar National Bank. As a result, after languishing for much of the last century as a sleepy British protectorate, Qatar is surging in population, up almost 50 percent since 1997, to an estimated 750,000 in 2004, a number that is expected to grow by an estimated 100,000 this year. (Fewer than 200,000 people in the country are believed to be Qatari citizens.)
 The surge, led by an influx of poor Asian laborers and large numbers of Americans and European professionals lured by tax-free salaries, has left a shortage of housing and office space. Rents in parts of Doha, its streets clogged with new sport utility vehicles and the occasional Rolls-Royce or Maserati, have climbed almost 50 percent this year. 
 ''I sometimes feel like I'll live with my family forever,'' said Abdalla Eisa Rasheed, 24, a Qatari technician at a water desalination plant operated by the AES Corporation of Arlington, Va. Mr. Rasheed, one of six siblings, said two older brothers, both married with children, also lived under the same roof. ''There's the positive and the negative of the economy,'' he said. 
 Not surprisingly, the remaking of Doha is creating a bonanza for international infrastructure companies. Bechtel of San Francisco won a $2.5 billion contract to build an airport designed specifically for the Airbus A380-800, the world's largest passenger aircraft.
 Near neighborhoods where goat herders can still be glimpsed tending their flocks, projects include an Islamic Museum designed by the Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei and a photography museum by Santiago Calatrava of Spain. 
 The Japanese architect Arata Isozaki was commissioned to design a national library, after the construction of his futuristic medical school, operated by the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in Qatar's newly named Education City, a collection of colleges run by administrators and faculty from Texas A&M, Georgetown University and Virginia Commonwealth University. 
 Far more numerous are brazen projects without marquee architects, like The Pearl, a planned complex for 30,000 residents, with neighborhoods meant to evoke parts of Monaco, Marrakesh and Venice. In one area, intended to emulate New York, pedestrians can stroll on an avenue called Broadway away from the din of Doha's streets. 
 ''We want to attract the Ivy Leaguer type, the more select customer,'' said Khalil al-Sholy, managing director of UDC, the Qatari company building The Pearl. 
 Not far away sits a dusty work site where workers are feverishly building what is expected to be Doha's tallest skyscraper, an 80-floor complex called the Dubai Towers. With about 30 skyscrapers invarious stages of completion, the description of Doha as the ''next Dubai,'' a nod to its flashier neighbor on the Arabian Peninsula, is inevitable here. 
 Still, there is a fundamental difference between the two emirates. Dubai has turned to dream-world architecture and tourism to prepare for the not-so-distant day when its oil runs out; Qatar, its coffers swelling from natural gas sales, shows little sign of contemplating an economy not reliant on energy exports. 
 Andrew Brown, Shell's country manager in Qatar, said that greater natural gas and oil production should result in overall daily energy production equivalent to about 5 million barrels of oil a day by early in the next decade, nearly half the daily oil output of Saudi Arabia.
 ''Over the next five years,'' Mr. Brown said, ''Qatar is going to see an energy boom as significant as any other in the past.''
 Few in Qatar worry that the natural gas frenzy will fizzle anytime soon, despite predictions from some analysts that natural gas prices in countries like the United States and Britain could fall sharply by 2007 or so as large amounts of liquefied natural gas reach the market.
 Still, the torrid expansion at Ras Laffan, as well as Qatar's increasingly interdependent relations with the United States and other gas-importing nations, has created some unease within the prosperity bubble. In an attempt to clamp down on rising infrastructure costs, the government earlier this year unexpectedly imposed a moratorium on new gas export projects.
 Perhaps most troubling to the relatively cosmopolitan society taking shape in Doha, an Egyptian employee of Qatar Petroleum exploded a bomb last March during a performance of Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night'' at a theater in a district where many Western expatriates live. 
 The blast killed a British man and wounded 12 others. Authorities and executives from foreign energy companies described the incident as an isolated act, by an individual extremist.
 And yet the offices at Shell can be reached only after passing through thick steel protective doors. Exxon Mobil's executive suite in Doha does not even have a sign on the door, camouflaged by the name of an obscure Qatari company with which Exxon shares an old building.
 For all the caution, little seems to be standing in the way of Qatar becoming even richer. One of the country's leading newspapers, The Peninsula, noted recently that Qatar was already the third-wealthiest country, with per capita income of $38,241 in 2004, trailing only Switzerland and Luxembourg.
 ''I hope some of the money reaches down to me,'' said Mohammad Omer Mohammad, 25, who despite being born and raised in Qatar, remains by law a citizen of the homeland of his parents, Pakistan. Mr. Mohammad, who works at a modest job at an immigration office in Ras Laffan, still cannot own land in Qatar but aspires one day to be rich. 
 ''The economy's good, I guess,'' Mr. Mohammad said. ''But it could be better.''

HEADLINE: Intelligent Design Derailed

 BODY:
By now, the Christian conservatives who once dominated the school board in Dover, Pa., ought to rue their recklessness in forcing biology classes to hear about ''intelligent design'' as an alternative to the theory of evolution. Not only were they voted off the school board by an exasperated public last November, but this week a federal district judge declared their handiwork unconstitutional and told the school district to abandon a policy of such ''breathtaking inanity.'' 
 A new and wiser school board is planning to do just that by removing intelligent design from the science curriculum and perhaps placing it in an elective course on comparative religion. That would be a more appropriate venue to learn about what the judge deemed ''a religious view, a mere relabeling of creationism and not a scientific theory.'' 
The intelligent design movement holds that life forms are too complex to have been formed by natural processes and must have been fashioned by a higher intelligence, which is never officially identified but which most adherents believe to be God. By injecting intelligent design into the science curriculum, the judge ruled, the board was unconstitutionally endorsing a religious viewpoint that advances ''a particular version of Christianity.'' 
 The decision will have come at an opportune time if it is able to deflect other misguided efforts by religious conservatives to undermine the teaching of evolution, a central organizing principle of modern biology. In Georgia, a federal appeals court shows signs of wanting to reverse a lower court that said it was unconstitutional to require textbooks to carry a sticker disparaging evolution as ''a theory, not a fact.'' That's the line of argument used by the anti-evolution crowd. We can only hope that the judges in Atlanta find the reasoning of the Pennsylvania judge, who dealt with comparable issues, persuasive. 
 Meanwhile in Kansas, the State Board of Education has urged schools to criticize evolution. It has also changed the definition of science so it is not limited to natural explanations, opening the way for including intelligent design or other forms of creationism that cannot meet traditional definitions of science. All Kansans interested in a sound science curriculum should heed what happened in Dover and vote out the inane board members. 
 The judge in the Pennsylvania case, John Jones III, can hardly be accused of being a liberal activist out to overturn community values -- even by those inclined to see conspiracies. He is a lifelong Republican, appointed to the bench by President Bush, and has been praised for his integrity and intellect. Indeed, as the judge pointed out, the real activists in this case were ill-informed school board members, aided by a public interest law firm that promotes Christian values, who combined to drive the board to adopt an imprudent and unconstitutional policy. 
 Judge Jones's decision was a striking repudiation of intelligent design, given that Dover's policy was minimally intrusive on classroom teaching. Administrators merely read a brief disclaimer at the beginning of a class asserting that evolution was a theory, not a fact; that there were gaps in the evidence for evolution; and that intelligent design provided an alternative explanation and could be further explored by consulting a book in the school library. Yet even that minimal statement amounted to an endorsement of religion, the judge concluded, because it caused students to doubt the theory of evolution without scientific justification and presented them with a religious alternative masquerading as a scientific theory. 
 The case was most notable for its searching inquiry into whether intelligent design could be considered science. The answer, after a six-week trial that included hours of expert testimony, was a resounding no. 
 The judge found that intelligent design violated the centuries-old ground rules of science by invoking supernatural causation and by making assertions that could not be tested or proved wrong. Moreover, intelligent design has not gained acceptance in the scientific community, has not been supported by peer-reviewed research, and has not generated a research and testing program of its own. The core argument for intelligent design -- the supposedly irreducible complexity of key biological systems -- has clear theological overtones. As long ago as the 13th century, St. Thomas Aquinas argued that because nature is complex, it must have a designer.
 The religious thrust behind Dover's policy was unmistakable. The board members who pushed the policy through had repeatedly expressed religious reasons for opposing evolution, though they tried to dissemble during the trial. Judge Jones charged that the two ringleaders lied in depositions to hide the fact that they had raised money at a church to buy copies of an intelligent design textbook for the school library. He also found that board members were strikingly ignorant about intelligent design and that several individuals had lied time and again to hide their religious motivations for backing the concept. Their contention that they had a secular purpose -- to improve science education and encourage critical thinking -- was declared a sham.
 No one believes that this thoroughgoing repudiation of intelligent design will end the incessant warfare over evolution. But any community that is worried about the ability of its students to compete in a global economy would be wise to keep supernatural explanations out of its science classes.

To Israel, a Fair Solution;To Palestinians, a Fence
Israel is overhauling its separation barrier along the West Bank and Jerusalem to cut the crossing time for people and goods from hours to minutes. By constructing 27 terminals, Israel hopes to ease the burden on Palestinians and soften international criticism. But some Palestinians say the changes are just another example of Israel's imposing solutions that suit itself, and that the barrier still fences them in. A1

Israel said that if the militant faction Hamas took part in next month's elections for the Palestinian Parliament, Palestinians in East Jerusalem would not be allowed to cast ballots there. 
Jerusalem is one of the most explosive issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and status of the city has great symbolic importance. The Palestinian leadership said that it might postpone the voting. A3

Hussein Cries Foul
After another day of testimony about torture, beatings and executions under his rule, Saddam Hussein sought to turn the tables on his prosecutors with an outburst in which he accused American military guards of beating and torturing him and his co-defendants. Mr. Hussein did not say why he waited through six days in court without mentioning such mistreatment before. A14

Seventy percent of registered Iraqi voters participated in last week's election, the highest turnout in a vote since the fall of Saddam Hussein, according to the Iraqi electoral commission. Commission officials warned that figures could still change; they are looking into more than 1,200 complaints of possible fraud or irregularities. A19

Afghan House Takes Shape
President Hamid Karzai's chief political rival, Yunus Qanooni, was elected chairman of the lower house of Afghanistan's new Parliament. Mr. Qanooni, who is a Tajik, a member of the country's second largest ethnic group, defeated Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who is a Pashtun, a member of the largest ethnic group. The race split the lower house down the middle and revealed an ethnic divide that may plague future debates. A19

Iran Talks for the New Year
Representatives of three European countries and Iran met in Vienna for the first time since negotiations over Iran's nuclear development program were suspended. The purpose of the meeting was to see if enough common ground existed for the stalled negotiations to resume next year. An agreement was reached to hold further talks in January. A5

Russian Limits on Charities
Russia's lower house of Parliament amended legislation intended to increase government control over charities and other private organizations, but left provisions that critics said could pressure groups politically, even forcing them to close. The legislation advanced despite international pressure, including a resolution of the United States Congress and appeals from leading Bush administration officials. A3

Senate Stops Drilling Plan;Patriot Act Extended
In a chaotic conclusion to the Congressional year, the Senate blocked an effort on Wednesday to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling and struck a last-minute accord to extend the law known as the USA Patriot Act for six months. With Vice President Dick Cheney casting the decisive vote, the Senate also approved a $40 billion budget-cutting plan. And the Senate sent to President Bush a second Pentagon policy measure with a ban on torturing detainees linked to terrorism. A1

Court Halts Detainee Transfer
A panel of a federal appeals court refused to allow the transfer of Jose Padilla from military custody to civilian law enforcement authorities to face terrorism charges, saying the Justice Department's effort gave the appearance that the government was trying to prevent the Supreme Court from reviewing the case. A1

The airline whose 1940's seaplane crashed in Florida on Tuesday grounded the rest of its fleet after investigators found a large crack in the wing spar of the plane involved in the accident. A27

Pressure on Union Builds As Transit Strike Continues
The stakes rose for those on the picket line as New York City plunged into Day 2 of the transit strike. A judge raised the possibility of sending union leaders to jail and commuters grappled with life without buses or trains. Late last night, members of the union's executive board were told there would be an emergency meeting at 1 a.m., though later it was postponed indefinitely. A1
 The economic burden was felt citywide -- hundreds of thousands of children skipping school, commuters spending extra hours shuttling to work and back. B1

HEADLINE: Top Banker To Be Retried In Germany

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
A German federal court ruled on Wednesday that the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, would be tried again in a corporate criminal case, casting him back into legal limbo and stirring doubts that he will survive at the bank's helm.
 The court threw out last year's acquittal of Mr. Ackermann on criminal charges that he broke the law by awarding rich bonuses to top executives at the telecommunications company Mannesmann, amid a takeover battle with Vodafone of Britain. He was then a member of Mannesmann's board.
Five other people, including Mannesmann's former chief executive, Klaus Esser, also face a new trial.
 Ruling that the lower court had erred, the federal court in Karlsruhe said that the bonus payments, awarded after Mannesmann acquiesced in Vodafone's bid, might have constituted a criminal betrayal of the company's interests. The strong language in the decision, lawyers said, suggested that Mr. Ackermann faced a daunting battle. 
 Five years after Mannesmann was absorbed by Vodafone, the Mannesmann case has become a symbol of German antipathy toward corporate greed. It has haunted Mr. Ackermann's tenure of three and a half years as chief executive at the bank, Germany's most prominent, complicating his efforts to impart a British-American management style.
 Deutsche Bank's supervisory board said it had ''unrestricted trust'' in Mr. Ackermann, a Swiss-born investment banker who is wrapping up a profitable year at the bank. The board said that he would ''continue his work successfully'' and that it would ''support him doing so.'' 
 Mr. Ackermann, 57, said in a one-paragraph statement that he did not plan to step down.
 But privately, officials at the bank were more guarded, and the supervisory board has sent mixed signals about the depth of its support. Its chairman, Rolf E. Breuer, said in a recent newspaper interview that he was thinking about possible successors for the chief executive.
 Mr. Ackermann's contract expires next October, and with the new trial not expected to start until the second half of 2006, the board may have to decide on his future while he is still in legal jeopardy.
 ''If he feels he is damaging the reputation of the bank, he will step down,'' a senior executive said. ''He's certainly not going to step down at this juncture; he will go away and think about it over Christmas.''
 Shares of Deutsche Bank slipped after the ruling was announced, but rebounded after the bank's expression of support.
 Other reactions varied. A German stockholder group said Mr. Ackermann ought to resign to spare Deutsche Bank months of uncertainty. But several lawyers said he should defend himself, given that the case turns on fuzzy legal principles rather than a clear-cut incidence of wrongdoing.
 At issue is 57 million euros ($67.4 million) in bonuses that Mr. Ackermann and other directors awarded to Mr. Esser and his Mannesmann colleagues in February 2000, soon after they abandoned their opposition to the $183 billion takeover by Vodafone, the largest in European history.
 Prosecutors argued that the payment was a quid pro quo; Mr. Ackermann's lawyers said it was a legitimate reward for the shareholder value that Mr. Esser created in selling the company to Vodafone.
 After six months of testimony, a state court in Dusseldorf ruled that the payments violated German corporate law because they were not in the company's interest, but that this did not rise to the level of a criminal act. It also said that in certain decisions, the defendants were not aware that their conduct was illegal.
 ''An acquittal is an acquittal,'' a visibly relieved Mr. Ackermann said as he left the courtroom in July 2004.
 But a German acquittal is not the same as an American acquittal. Under German law, prosecutors are allowed to appeal, which they did in this case. The federal court upheld the appeal, ruling that the lower court had been wrong to excuse the misconduct on the ground that it was not grave enough to be criminal, and to exonerate the defendants for not recognizing the illegality of their actions.
 Deprived of these two arguments, legal experts said, Mr. Ackermann could have a weaker defense in a new trial. The case will be heard in the same Dusseldorf court, but by a different panel of judges. A conviction could result in a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years, though most lawyers said Mr. Ackermann would probably be required to pay a fine instead.
 ''The outlook is really not good for them,'' Marcus Lutter, a law professor at the University of Bonn, said of Mr. Ackermann and the others accused.
 He said the ruling encouraged him because it demonstrated that Germany is not budging from its resistance to bloated pay packages for executives. A recent law tightens the requirements on companies to disclose the pay of top executives.
 But other lawyers are troubled, contending that the case turns on subjective judgments about how much pay is reasonable. The court, they said, did not recognize the peculiar economics of hostile takeovers, in which executives are richly rewarded for, in effect, putting themselves out of a job.
 ''Josef Ackermann's personal integrity is not in question,'' said Michael Adams, a law professor at the University of Hamburg. ''He didn't see the red line that some courts have seen. But it's a squishy concept.''
 Mr. Ackermann's position at Deutsche Bank may depend on logistical matters and public perception. During the last trial, he spent two days a week in court, using an office set up for him at a Dusseldorf branch. He might view another six months of that as untenable. His lawyers, though, say that the next trial is likely to be much shorter, perhaps two to three months.
 Deutsche Bank will presumably decide if it wants to weather another year of negative publicity. German newspapers made much of Mr. Ackermann's travails, including an ill-advised V-for-victory sign that he flashed to fellow defendants on the opening day of the last trial.
 ''Ackermann is more and more of a problem for Deutsche Bank,'' said Klaus Nieding, a representative of the German Shareholder Protection Association. ''Deutsche Bank is a deutsche bank -- a German bank. It comes out of Germany; it works for German industry.''
 Outside Germany, where Deutsche Bank earns the majority of its profit, Mr. Ackermann's plight is viewed with puzzlement. Analysts credit him with increasing earnings by cutting costs -- through thousands of layoffs, among other means -- and building up the bank's lucrative bond-trading franchise.
 The bank came under criticism last week for freezing its core German real estate investment fund. Analysts said it was acting to forestall a run of withdrawals from the fund, amid indications that it might write down the value of the property in its portfolio.
 Replacing Mr. Ackermann would not be easy. In an interview with The Financial Times published on Wednesday, Mr. Breuer said he was focused on internal candidates.
 Speculation has centered on Rainer Neske, 41, the head of retail operations. But others at Deutsche Bank cautioned that neither he nor other managers were obvious successors.
 ''Mr. Ackermann is Mr. Deutsche Bank these days,'' said Boris Boehm, an asset manager with Nordinvest in Hamburg. ''He holds in his hands the vision and strategy for the bank.''

HEADLINE: Tough Stance, Tougher Fines

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
When Roger Toussaint, the president of the transit workers' local, defiantly announced a strike, he proclaimed that his union was taking a proud stand against the concessions that employers had demanded nationwide.
 But Mr. Toussaint has quickly discovered that engaging in an illegal walkout can leave a union with a weak hand. His union faces a $1 million fine for each day on strike, a state judge is threatening to throw him in jail and thousands of individual strikers stand to lose two days' pay for each day out.
Not only that, but the mayor, the governor and editorial writers are denouncing the union as greedy and showing contempt for the law. The front page of The New York Post screamed, ''You Rats.'' And the transit workers' parent union has come out in opposition to the strike. 
 ''They have painted themselves into a corner,'' said Barry L. Feinstein, the former president of New York City's largest Teamsters local and now a member of the transportation authority's board.
 Looking for a way out of this corner, Mr. Toussaint yesterday seized on Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's characterization of the strikers as ''thuggish'' and ''greedy,'' saying it was insulting language to describe workers whom millions of New Yorkers rely on each day to ferry them to work. A dozen union leaders, including the heads of the teachers and the firefighters, backed his effort to resist the transportation authority's demand for pension concessions. But they stopped short of giving enthusiastic support to the illegal walkout.
 In an impassioned news conference, Mr. Toussaint invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks as he sought to rally his troops, and New Yorkers, in effect portraying the strike as a civil rights campaign to help a work force that is largely black and Hispanic.
 Mr. Toussaint also sought to throw Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki on the defensive by asserting that the dispute was essentially a showdown between hard-working New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet and a moneyed establishment. At the head of that establishment, Mr. Toussaint said repeatedly, is a billionaire mayor, out of touch with working-class New Yorkers.
 ''The language that is being used is undignified and an unbecoming description of public servants,'' said Mr. Toussaint, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. ''To New Yorkers: your next door neighbor is a transit worker -- a bus driver, a cleaner, a station agent.''
 He continued: ''We appeal to you. Unlike the person using this kind of language, we are the ones who know the lives of hard-working people, and not the mayor.''
 If Mr. Toussaint's words were powerful, it was not at all clear whether they would be potent in helping his union out of a tight spot. To do that, he must protect his union's honor and win his workers a better deal than the one he rejected just before the strike deadline.
 With the fine against the union growing by $1 million each day, Mr. Toussaint may well hope to shoot the moon, reasoning that the financial penalties might grow so large, and bankruptcy so certain, that his union might just as well stay out for 30 days as for 3. 
 Or, as John H. Mollenkopf, the director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University Graduate Center, put it, ''The union recognizes that there is no difference between unbearable fines and doubly unbearable ones.''
 Mr. Toussaint, the truculent bargainer, has drawn so many lines in the sand -- refusing binding arbitration, or any contract that treats new workers worse, or any wage offer that does not exceed inflation -- that it is hard to imagine that he might not eventually have to accept a deal that will make him eat some humble pie. But the history of labor relations is peopled with negotiators who steadfastly assert that they will never accept this or that and then a week or two later accept it, saying that they were cleverly posturing.
 Robert W. Snyder, author of ''Transit Talk,'' an oral history of subway and bus workers, said Mr. Toussaint had created problems for his union by striking when he did. He said Mr. Toussaint had not acted as wisely as his famed predecessor, Michael J. Quill, who led the union's 12-day strike in 1966.
 ''For decades Quill spoke with great militance, yet he only walked out once,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''Quill grew up in the Irish Republican Army and he knew something about guerrilla warfare -- the first rule is you don't fight when the advantage lies with your adversary.'' 
 He said Mr. Quill was smart for striking when John V. Lindsay was weak -- it was his first day as mayor. In contrast, Mr. Toussaint has gone on strike when the tide seems against him. Mayor Bloomberg was just resoundingly re-elected and Governor Pataki is thinking of running for president.
 ''Pataki knows that if he is friendly to the unions it won't play well in the South Carolina primary,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''And Mayor Bloomberg has no appreciation of labor unions. He is very business-minded.''
 Today the city will be in court seeking additional fines against individual strikers, while Justice Theodore T. Jones of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn might order the jailing of Mr. Toussaint -- a move that some city officials fear could turn him into a martyr but might not move the strike closer to settlement. 
 By no means is everything lost for Mr. Toussaint and the union, Mr. Feinstein said. 
 ''There are any number of honorable exits for him, but the first thing he has to do is get back to the bargaining table,'' Mr. Feinstein said.
 Many labor experts say the best opportunity to reach a settlement is over the next few days. If the work stoppage drags on for more than a week, union leaders, already facing union bankruptcy, may feel they have little more to lose, and union members, facing large fines, may believe that the longer they stay out the more likely they will somehow win amnesty, reducing the fines.

HEADLINE: The Second Time Around, Marriage With Jewels

BYLINE: By BARBARA O'DAIR

 BODY:
THE first time she got married, in 1986, Kaethe Cherney was an aspiring actress. Her wedding was a modest ceremony at New York's City Hall. And the ring, fittingly, was ''a simple silver band,'' said Ms. Cherney, 44, who now works in the film industry and lives in London. At the time she thought it romantic, but the ring's no-fuss aspect also signaled some indifference on her part. ''I had never considered a traditional engagement ring,'' Ms. Cherney said. ''It hadn't even crossed my mind.''
 Seven years later, when Ms. Cherney remarried, her indifference was gone. ''I felt like I was getting it right this time,'' she said. She wanted a real wedding, she said, the kind where the bride gets to walk down the aisle. Her husband-to-be, Andrew Wheatley, a London gallery owner, picked up on her feeling and commissioned a special engagement ring. After several months of laboring to meet the couple's high standards, the ring maker produced a gorgeous, colorful piece: six attached silver bands, each with a tiny gold post holding a different semiprecious stone. 
On a visit to Manhattan, Mr. Wheatley presented the ring to Ms. Cherney on the observation deck of the Empire State Building. ''The ring symbolized everything that was right'' about the relationship, she said.
 At Christmas 10 years later, in 2003, he gave her an anniversary ring, which she finds more meaningful still: a gold ring studded with green garnets and, in the center, a fat Brazilian tourmaline. ''I've gone from a $5 ring to bling,'' she said, adding, ''With age comes emotional intelligence and a taste for the good things in life.''
 Ms. Cherney is one of many women who find greater meaning in the ring the second time they marry. According to The Wedding Report, an online market research study of weddings and marriage, 1 in 10 of the more than two million American brides in 2006 will remarry. And about 67 percent of these women will get an engagement ring, said Dana Telsey, a luxury goods research analyst with Bear Stearns. Although no statistics indicate how many of these women skipped that part of the tradition the first time around, observers from jewelers to older brides have seen the change.
 Women who once rigorously avoided a fancy engagement ring are revising their notions about this classic symbol of commitment and love. The older bride wants a ring that proclaims: I'm getting married, I'm proud of it, and I want a way to show it. 
 ''Second marriages are planned a lot more,'' said Steven Nock, a self-described scholar of marriage who teaches sociology and psychology at the University of Virginia. The engagement ring trend is likely ''part of a larger trend of making marriage a grander celebration,'' he said.
 Even if a bride's second wedding ceremony is not as elaborate as her first, without the big, white dress and the train of bridesmaids, the ring may grow in significance, especially if the bride is someone who used to think of herself as a feminist. 
 ''For my first marriage I had no ring by choice,'' said Freddi Greenberg, 56, editor in chief of Nick Jr. Family Magazine, who also chose an unconventional ceremony without a traditional wedding dress in 1973. Back then she found the idea of a ring ''really hokey.'' Rings seemed to symbolize a woman's dependence on a husband, financially and otherwise, and Ms. Greenberg was a woman who intended to stand on her own two feet. 
 By the time she remarried almost 20 years later, Ms. Greenberg said, ''I had lived the life of a strong, independent woman,'' and so had nothing to prove in that regard. She and her future husband, David Mauer, believed that a ring would help make their impending marriage ''more official'' and symbolize stability to the children of their first marriages, two of them hers and three of them his. Her fiance gave her a one-carat, bezel-cut diamond ring from the New York jeweler Reinstein/Ross, a tasteful alternative to a traditional solitaire.
 Many jewelers see the increasing focus on rings primarily as a sign of how much money second-time couples have. ''The second marriage always means higher-priced diamonds,'' said Elizabeth Chatelain, president of the marketing company Jewelry Consumer Opinion Council. ''Women are more comfortable with diamonds these days. Women are even buying diamonds for themselves.''
 Karl M. Taps, assistant manager at Cartier, said of second-time brides: ''They have more of the ways and means to get bigger stones. They don't need to set up a home,'' or have many of the other financial burdens that young marrieds carry.
 Martha McPhee, 42, a novelist in New York City, admits that money is what prompted her to get a better engagement ring, though she did so without remarrying. When she and her husband, Mark Svenvold, married 10 years ago, he was a starving poet.
 ''I remember saying to Mark that I had my grandmother's ring and wanted to replace the setting at Tiffany,'' Ms. McPhee said. ''He looked at me as if I were completely insane.'' 
 They ended up exchanging simple gold bands. But eight years later, after the couple had settled into their teaching and writing careers and had two children, Mr. Svenvold surprised her with a gold band encircled by diamonds.
 Kamy Wicoff, 33, of Manhattan, author of ''I Do But I Don't: Walking Down the Aisle Without Losing Your Way'' (to be published in June), traded rings several years after she got married for something more meaningful too, but hers was a switch to something less showy. Her first ring was an emerald-cut diamond that was more than two carats. But she found that when people looked at it, they made inferences about her husband's economic status, and that made her uncomfortable. 
 ''I found that my ring spoke louder than I did,'' Ms. Wicoff said. She wanted it to be a sign of love, not of wealth. After four years of marriage, she put the diamond in a safe-deposit box, and she and her husband exchanged matching gold bands rimmed with little rubies, a gesture that was more meaningful to them both, she said. 
 Some women who once dismissed the idea of engagement rings have come to feel that they missed out on an appealing romantic ritual. Marcelle Karp, 41, founding editor of Bust magazine, wed six years ago at New York's City Hall not long after giving birth to her daughter. ''I got married in a practical, punk rock way,'' she said. ''We didn't want to spend the money'' on a ring. Two years later she divorced, and today, she said, she would do things differently. ''If I get married again, I'd want an engagement ring. I want it to be a fantasy.''
 ''In the last couple of years,'' another woman said, ''I've been looking at diamond rings on other people's hands and what they symbolize. They are lovely, feminine, powerful.'' An architect in her mid-40's, this woman married 15 years ago with no engagement ring because, she said: ''We had already lived together for seven years. I basically wanted to downplay the whole thing. I was very sensitive to having a career and not being a wife.'' She asked not to be identified by name to avoid hurting or embarrassing her husband. Now, she said she feels both ''stupid'' for not caring about a ring to begin with and ''guilty'' for wanting one now.
 Ms. Wicoff is not surprised by the wedding ring's hold on people's emotions. ''The rings are so symbolically powerful,'' she said, ''it's hard for us to part with the process.'' They signify the hope in marriage.
 As Diane Meier Delaney writes in ''The New American Wedding,'' (Viking Penguin, 2005), ''We stand in the face of broken families, broken promises, broken contracts and believe that this time it will be different.''

HEADLINE: For Renovators, a Rude Awakening

BYLINE: By ERNEST BECK

 BODY:
THE hurricanes that battered the Gulf Coast and Florida this year devastated communities and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Now consumers everywhere are likely to feel the impact of the storms in the form of rising prices for construction and building materials.
 Many of those materials were already going up in price, but within six months things may be much worse. 
Tack $7,000 onto the cost of building a typical house in 2006, according to Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Because materials account for about a third of the cost of a new home, the increase ''will have to be absorbed somewhere, most likely by consumers,'' he said.
 And count on spending more to renovate.
 ''Prices are creeping up on all fronts,'' said Paul Winans, president of Winans Construction, a contractor in Oakland, Calif., which has added 15 percent to its bids over the last year to reflect a sharp increase in wholesale prices for materials.
 Kitchen cabinets have risen 10 percent, he said; insulation is up 14 percent; finished lumber, 10 percent; windows and skylights, 8 percent; plaster and drywall, 15 to 20 percent. Materials for electrical work are up 15 to 20 percent, Mr. Winans said, partly because of factory closings after Hurricane Katrina. 
 Along with knocking out oil and gas platforms that supply plastics factories, Katrina shut down two big gypsum wallboard factories.
 Although many oil production facilities are back in operation, the factories that depend on petroleum products are still facing shortfalls.
 Ken Simonson, the chief economist at Associated General Contractors of America, a trade organization in Arlington, Va., says this uncertainty makes it likely that prices for some P.V.C. products used in home building, like insulation and roofing materials, ''will remain 20 percent to 50 percent more expensive than in 2005.'' 
 Because of continuing production and delivery difficulties, cement and concrete prices are likely to surge 10 percent to 15 percent in 2006, on top of a 10 to 13 percent increase from October 2004 to October 2005, according to Mr. Simonson. And all this is before rebuilding in the gulf region gets under way. When that happens, says Mr. Winans, who is also president of the National Association of the Remodeling Industry, ''it will be like a vacuum sucking up things like drywall, plywood, insulation and roofing.'' 
 Exactly how much will be required isn't known, because plans for the reconstruction of New Orleans and other cities are not final. And intensive rebuilding would not begin until mid-2006, at the earliest.
 That's assuming it happens. But if it does, initial estimates suggest that rebuilding New Orleans alone would require at least 3.86 tons of cement -- the main ingredient of concrete -- over five years, according to the Portland Cement Association, a trade organization in Skokie, Ill.
 Ed Sullivan, the chief economist at the cement association, says that spot shortages are possible as rebuilding gets under way. 
 ''If there is a shortage, typically those who are shut out are the smaller guys who don't plan ahead,'' he said. ''Do-it-yourselfers would face the most difficulties.'' 
 Where there are shortages, price increases often follow. ''We expect rising material costs to show up at the consumer level,'' Mr. Simonson said. ''Everyone will have to deal with them.'' 
 Do-it-yourselfers probably do not need to worry about higher prices just yet. Home improvement chains like the Home Depot, partly because they are able to make large, long-term deals with vendors, have not increased prices, although Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the Lowe's chain, acknowledged that ''there have been pressures.'' 
 Price increases before the storms hit partly reflect the housing boom, and partly a growing demand for cement, steel and copper in rapidly developing countries like China and India. (China alone uses about a third of the world's cement.) 
 Other homebuilding essentials, like plywood, have faced constraints because factories can't keep up with demand. 
 Surprisingly, the supply of one crucial building material -- lumber -- has not been hurt. In fact, the hurricanes' downing of trees with an estimated 15 billion to 19 billion board feet of timber -- enough to build 800,000 single-family homes, according to the Forest Service -- is expected to hold prices steady. 
 That is, if the downed trees can be salvaged before they rot: only about 20 percent of the wood may be saved in time, the Home Builders group estimates.

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about the rising costs of rebuilding New Orleans misstated the amount of cement, the main ingredient of concrete, that will be needed over five years. It is 3.86 million metric tons, not 3.86 tons.

HEADLINE: Shaking Off the Rust/New Suburbs Are Born

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH and DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: Bethlehem, Pa. 

 BODY:
IN the shadow of the hulking industrial carcass of the Bethlehem Steel site here, a cozy boutique called Comfort and Joy is selling ''aromatherapeutic'' cleaning products, herbal teas nested in silk pouches and $1,200 designer quilts. Down the street, another store, Home and Planet, is offering $800 end tables made from recycled steel beams.
 The pricey quilts and tables are increasingly being marketed to an influx of middle-class New Yorkers who have come to the Lehigh Valley in search of affordable housing and good schools they could not easily find back home. The newcomers are recasting this former steel and coal-mining area into a new kind of bedroom community, bringing their cosmopolitan tastes with them.
 America's newest suburbs are neither the classic towns close to a major city, nor are they distant exurbs built on once-empty farmland. They are aging industrial cities and their environs, on the far periphery of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the northeast and California -- places where middle-class parents can still buy homes for their growing families while keeping their big city jobs. 
 Last year the cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton drew almost 14,000 new residents from the New York region, more than twice what they did in 1998. The area was the fourth most popular destination for expatriate New Yorkers, after Miami, Orlando and Poughkeepsie, another industrial area being recycled as a bedroom city. 
 In New England, the former textile cities of southern New Hampshire, including Manchester, are drawing hundreds more Boston residents than they did just a few years ago. Outside Washington, the long trip down Interstate 270 from West Virginia has grown crowded with commuters. In Northern California, hardscrabble Stockton is attracting more departing San Francisco Bay Area residents than anywhere other than Sacramento, despite a 90-minute drive without traffic.
 The chance to buy a spacious four-bedroom house in a place with good public schools and wide open spaces ''sort of outweighs everything else,'' said Lou Fiscella, who moved with his family to the Lehigh Valley from Staten Island three years ago and has been making the two-hour commute to Manhattan every weekday. His bus is nearly always filled. 
 Longtime residents view the newcomers as a mixed blessing. House prices have jumped, making it harder for young locals to buy their first home. But new residents have also helped lift long-struggling economies by luring homebuilders and new stores.
 Not so long ago, Billy Joel sang that ''they're closing all the factories down'' in Allentown. Now developers plan to build a casino, a hotel and new condominiums at the old Bethlehem Steel site. Part of the attraction is the middle-class population that is moving in. ''The New Yorkers go out, the Jerseyans go further west, and there you are,'' said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark & Company, one of the developers. 
 Near Allentown, an upscale grocery chain, Wegmans, has built three new stores in the last seven years. A new luxury mall is also going up, attracted by the incomes of residents moving into the area, said its developer, Terry McEwen, president of Poag & McEwen Lifestyle Centers. 
 Olympus America, the digital camera and medical device maker, is moving its headquarters to nearby Center Valley, from Long Island, in part because of cheaper housing. 
 A median-priced home in the Lehigh Valley costs $190,000, according to the local Realtors Association, less than half the $461,100 it costs to buy a house in the New York region. House prices in New York have soared in recent years, while houses around Allentown have done little better than inflation until recently, when the newcomers have helped push up prices. 
 Not every part of the region has been gentrified. In downtown Allentown, pawn shops, cut-rate clothing outlets and a discount variety store still line the main street. Starbucks has yet to plant a store, though one has opened in Easton. For all the benefits the transplants bring, they are also starting to change the community in unwelcome ways. The grueling commutes from Allentown, for example, have left church groups and children's sports teams struggling to find volunteers. 
 Busy parents' schedules account for part of the decline, said Pam Bonina, director of member ministries at the Lutheran Church of the Holy Spirit in Emmaus, Pa. ''But then you add some spouses getting on a bus at 6:30 and coming home at 8 at night, and that hardly gives them enough time for their own nuclear family, let alone to volunteer in any capacity.''
 In 2002 the Fiscellas moved to a much bigger house than the one they had on Staten Island, in part to be closer to the sister of Mr. Fiscella's wife, Stephanie. He was able to keep his job as a computer network engineer in Manhattan.
 On a recent icy morning at 6:15 a.m., Mrs. Fiscella dropped off her husband at a park-and-ride, where he boarded a bus for the Port Authority. By then, all 100 parking spaces in the lot were filled, and several cars sat in unmarked spots or pulled up on a snow bank.
 Because of the commute, Mr. Fiscella rarely makes it home for his daughter's soccer practices or for his youngest son's games of T-ball. Andrew, 13, Nicole, 11, and Justin, 7, are sometimes in bed before he gets home. ''I'm not able to see them and ask them how their day is,'' Mr. Fiscella, 45, said. 
 But he and his wife said they were happy with what they had gained. On Staten Island, the children attended day camp at a local public school and played in the water from fire hydrants. Here, they spend summers at a camp on 150 acres of land. At school, they have a television station and computers in every classroom, none of which they had in New York.
 Mrs. Fiscella said that in the years since the family moved to the area, she has been able to find more of what she misses of New York, including her favorite brand of cold cuts. And this year she and her sister opened a children's clothing boutique that features christening outfits and party dresses made by New York designers.
 Though people have been leaving the New York metropolitan area for eastern Pennsylvania for years, the outflow has increased from about 7,000 people a year in the 1980's and 1990's to more than 10,000 in 2002 and to about 13,700 last year.
 Farther north in Pennsylvania, the Poconos are also attracting former New Yorkers who still commute to the city, though in smaller numbers.
 Homebuilders have started to notice the demographic changes. Toll Brothers, a developer of luxury homes, started building houses in the Lehigh Valley three years ago. Tom Argyris, Toll's regional president for North Central New Jersey and Northeast Pennsylvania, said that about 40 percent of the company's homebuyers around Allentown are coming from the New York metro area.
 Mr. Argyris said that one of the company's popular home models, the Coventry, a 4,400-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath house, starts at about $625,000 around Allentown. In Basking Ridge, N.J., a little over an hour by train from Manhattan, the same house goes for about $1.7 million. 
 As a rule of thumb, house prices seem to fall by about $1,000 per commuting minute from New York. 
 Robert Galea, a computer engineer who works in Roseland, N.J., and his wife, Yvonne, looked at houses in Easton, 15 minutes closer to his job. But homes there were on average $15,000 more expensive than equivalent houses farther west. 
 So they ended up in Macungie, just outside Allentown, in a home that is more than twice the size of the three-bedroom ranch house they sold in Scotch Plains, N.J. Mr. Galea has tripled his commute time, and now Mrs. Galea and their two young daughters usually eat dinner without him. 
 Lower prices helped Charlene Frye, a manager of sales promotions with Olympus, to buy her first home when she moved with her job to the Lehigh Valley. Back on Long Island, she was never able to afford a home, but just outside Allentown she bought a four-bedroom town house for $180,000.
 Many of the people moving far beyond New York have middle-class incomes or even higher, according to Jason Bram, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Just taking the bus to Manhattan for work costs more than $400 a month.
 ''There are plenty of affordable places in the five boroughs of New York that people just don't want to live in,'' Mr. Bram said. The same is true of nearby suburbs and cities, like Yonkers. 
 But these places tend to be poor or have troubled public schools, and hold little appeal for families with more money. Some decide that more space trumps a longer commute.
 ''It is very rough and tiring,'' said Amadou Diakite, a dispatcher for a courier company in Manhattan who rides the bus every morning from Fountain Hill, near Bethlehem, where he and his wife moved six years ago from the Bronx. His children, now 6, 4 and 4 months, all benefit from living in a large house with a bigger yard. ''It is for them that I am there,'' he said.
 Kathleen Gerson, a sociologist at New York University, noted that small cities have become a draw for young families at the same time that center cities, including Manhattan, have, too. 
 ''Small cities provide that proximity'' to cultural events and other families, Ms. Gerson said, ''without the sense of isolation that has become associated with the suburbs.''
 Many of these small cities have amenities that traditional suburbs do not. In Bakersfield, Calif., which is drawing increasing numbers of Los Angeles residents, there is a symphony orchestra and a minor-league baseball team. Manchester, N.H., has a fast-growing airport with numerous flights on Southwest Airlines. 
 Perhaps inevitably, the newcomers lured by such attractions can make life more difficult for longtime residents.
 In Lower Macungie Township, just west of Allentown, new houses with steeply sloping roofs are cropping up in former cornfields and old dairy farms. And as people from New York and New Jersey come in with large chunks of equity from the sales of their homes, they are driving up prices.
 As she drove around Spring Ridge, a subdivision of upscale town houses, Ginny Voros, a real estate agent, noted that her office recently took on a listing for $330,000, a price she called insanity. 
 Area residents, she said, are starting to feel priced out. ''They can get more for their house,'' she said, but now it is much harder for them to trade up to something nicer. The area, she said, ''has become too expensive.''

HEADLINE: Economy Grew at a Quick Pace In Summer Despite Hurricanes 

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
The economy grew at the fastest pace in one and a half years in the summer as booming auto sales offset the adverse effects of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. But the year is expected to end with much slower growth. 
 The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at a 4.1 percent annual rate from July through September. That was down from a 4.3 percent estimate made a month ago but it was still the fastest pace since early 2004. The gain was even more remarkable considering the devastating hurricanes and gasoline prices that topped $3 a gallon.
 ''The bottom line is that we had a very strong quarter of growth,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's in New York. Mr. Wyss said the hurricanes shaved about a half of a percentage point from growth in the third quarter, having less of an impact than economists had originally feared.
 Asha Bangalore, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, forecast that consumer spending would slow significantly to a growth rate of 0.5 percent in the current quarter. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity.
 While rebuilding in the hurricane areas will offset some of the slowdown in consumer demand, analysts do not expect that stimulus to be felt until next year, given the delays in reconstruction efforts.
 Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, a private forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., said that in addition to the drop-off in consumer spending, the economy would be held back by a surging trade deficit, which has hit records in recent months.
 ''Robust industrial production growth suggests inventories are being rebuilt, which will dampen any slowdown,'' he said.
 An inflation gauge tied to the G.D.P. rose at a rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace in more than a year and up from a 3.3 percent rate of increase in the second quarter.
 Excluding food and energy, however, the G.D.P. inflation measure was up a more moderate 1.4 percent, the slowest increase in almost two years. A month ago, prices by this inflation measure were estimated to have increased by an even lower 1.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Shares Break 4-Day Losing Streak on Earnings and Deals

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks snapped four days of losses yesterday after the FedEx Corporation reported strong results, lifting transportation stocks, and deals were announced in technology and real estate.
 But declines in the Dow components General Motors and General Electric limited the gains.
 FedEx, one of the world's largest air-express carriers, reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' estimates and increased some full-year forecasts, sending the Dow Jones transportation average to a 52-week high. 
 FedEx shares climbed $5.21, or 5.3 percent, to $103.70, while a rival, United Parcel Service, rose $1.39, or 1.9 percent, to $76.62.
 ''FedEx came with a strong report that certainly helped many stocks,'' said Noah Blackstein, vice president and portfolio manager at Dynamic Power American Fund. ''But trading now is getting very volatile, with Christmas approaching and the strike in New York, which may have contributed to some of the easing in the afternoon.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.18 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 10,833.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 3.17 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,262.79. The technology-laced Nasdaq composite index was up 9.24 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,231.66.
 The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 7/32, to 100 3/32. Its yield was 4.49 percent, up from 4.46 percent on Tuesday.
 G.M. lost 80 cents, or 4 percent, to close at $19.05 after the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian sold 12 million shares.
 General Electric dropped 22 cents, to $35.32, pulling on both the Dow and the S.& P. 500. The Wall Street Journal reported that G.E. and other investors were in advanced talks to buy the real estate investment trust Arden Realty in what would be one of G.E.'s largest real estate purchases. 
 In other corporate news, Seagate Technology announced plans to buy a rival computer disk-drive maker, the Maxtor Corporation, for $1.9 billion in stock, aiming to cut costs and drive development of new products. Maxtor shares rose 53.3 percent, or $2.41, to $6.93. Seagate rose 63 cents, to $20.23.
 I.B.M. said it would buy the software developer Micromuse for $865 million. Shares of I.B.M., a Dow component, rose 64 cents, to $83.12. Micromuse rose $2.71, or 37.6 percent, to close at $9.92.
 ''Companies are finally putting their money into play, and that is a vote of confidence in the strength of the economy and a positive for stocks,'' said Jim Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management. 
 Technology stocks also got a lift when Goldman Sachs raised its 2006 profit forecast for Apple Computer, whose shares rose $1.39, to $73.50 on Nasdaq.
 Steel companies gained after solid earnings reports from manufacturers, including the Chaparral Steel Company. Chaparral gained nearly 13.7 percent, or $3.69, to $30.56. On Tuesday, the company said quarterly profit had risen more than 50 percent on heavy demand.
 Other gainers included Cleveland-Cliffs, up $5.68, or 6.5 percent, at $93.15, and the Nucor Corporation, up $2.35, or 3.6 percent, at $67.90.
 Crude oil futures at the New York Mercantile Exchange rose even as government data showed an increase in crude oil inventories last week, helped by a rally in heating oil. February crude oil rose 47 cents, to $58.56 a barrel.

HEADLINE: For Some, a Little Loan Goes a Long Way

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
With Hurricane Ivan bearing down on Pensacola, Fla., last year, Kimberly and Ronnie Whitman moved the equipment and files of their landscaping business to a back room of their rented office. It was not enough.
 The storm ripped away a rear section of the building's roof, and the lashing rains damaged their computer, soaked their tax files and ruined $9,000 worth of seeds, fertilizer and pesticides. With mold and mildew spreading, they moved their business -- incorporated as R and R Irrigation and HydroSeed but also known as Turf Care Specialties -- a mile and a half away and took stock.
For the time being, they knew, they could not do their usual work of installing underground sprinklers, so they tried to make ends meet by clearing debris from yards and repairing irrigation systems. But their weekly revenue dropped to about $2,000, from $4,000 before the storm hit, not nearly enough to pay all their bills.
 With just $12,000 in savings, they applied for a Small Business Administration disaster loan with a 2.9 percent interest rate, but weeks went by with no word. Desperate, the couple turned to the source that they had used to start their business in 1999, Community Enterprise Investments, a Pensacola nonprofit that makes small loans quickly to start-ups and struggling family businesses. 
 Within five days, Community Enterprise had rolled a $10,000 balance that remained on the Whitmans' existing 10 percent loan into a five-year, $25,000 loan at 6 percent, resulting in an infusion of $15,000 in new money and at a much lower interest rate. (By contrast, it took the S.B.A. six months to finish all the paperwork and sign off on the couple's request for $35,000.)
 ''It was a godsend,'' said Ms. Whitman of the Community Enterprise money, which she used to pay electric and gas bills and buy inventory. Without it, she says, the company would have gone bankrupt.
 Small businesses are increasingly turning to nontraditional sources of capital, like nonprofits that are willing to make microloans when banks are not. The Association for Enterprise Opportunity, an Arlington, Va., trade group, says microloans generally range from as little as $500, for entrepreneurs who need to establish a good credit rating, to $35,000. Accion USA, the nation's largest microlender, has made 25,000 loans since 1994, averaging $5,600 and totaling $140 million.
 Though the microloan movement is more generally associated with transfers of hundreds of dollars or less to help people in developing countries start fruit stands and other low-technology ventures, it gained a foothold in the United States in the early 1990's and has been quietly spreading through the lower end of the small-business world ever since. A 2005 study by the Aspen Institute, an international nonprofit organization that studies global issues, said microlending in the United States grew in 2003, the last year for which figures are available, to 246 lenders, who made 13,231 loans totaling $114 million. In 1992, 42 lenders made 6,429 loans, totaling $44 million.
 Experts attribute the trend to various factors, including an increased awareness that even small amounts of capital can help low-income people pursue their entrepreneurial dreams, and a continuing flow of immigrants from regions like Latin American where microfinance is a longstanding practice.
 The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh helped start the microloan movement 30 years ago by providing advances of as little as a few dollars to impoverished women to start village businesses, with very positive results. At about the same time, microenterprise gained momentum in Recife, Brazil.
 Microlenders in the United States get their capital from various sources, including government agencies, foundations and wealthy individuals. Community Enterprise, the organization that provided financing for the Whitmans' landscaping venture, for example, began in the 1970's with financing from the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity and a loan from the state of Florida. Now, it gets funds from the S.B.A., the Agriculture Department's rural development program and commercial banks fulfilling their obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act to invest in low-income neighborhoods.
 Daniel R. Horvath, Community Enterprise's president, says typical borrowers are either start-ups in urgent need of cash, or small established companies that cannot get financing elsewhere because of poor credit or insufficient capital.
 Mr. Horvath is quick to add, however, that Community Enterprise adheres to strict lending standards, scrutinizing borrowers for the soundness of their business concepts, their management expertise and their credit records. Evaluators also look at a borrower's financial history and projections, as well as business and personal tax returns, he said. About 3 of 10 applications are approved.
 The default rate on the 468 loans, totaling $13 million, that the nonprofit has written since 1982 has been 5.2 percent. By comparison, the S.B.A. has a default rate of 7 percent on the guaranteed loans in its 7(a) program, which can be for as much as $2 million, often go to businesses with a stronger credit rating and are sold on the secondary market.
 ''We feel this is pretty remarkable since our loans are usually nonbankable,'' Mr. Horvath said.
 Microloans fill an important gap, helping entrepreneurs pursue small-scale ambitions that banks and other lenders may think are not worth the bother. Clive Anthony Senior of Bridgeport, Conn., is one example. A college dropout, Mr. Senior built a successful computer networking company that fell on hard times when his clients began sending their work to India, and he turned his attention to his passion for cars.
 After buying a car at an auction and selling it to a former classmate for a small profit, he decided to embark on a career as an auto broker and started a company in 2001 now called qualikar.com. After reviewing his business plan and credit history, Micro Credit Businesses of Bridgeport, Conn., gave his a $4,000 loan at 7 percent and a revolving credit line of $6,000, also at 7 percent, to acquire an inventory of used cars.
 Mr. Senior expects to purchase, restore and resell around 30 cars this year, a good start toward a goal of 100 annually that Micro Credit thinks he needs to create a viable business. He is going through growing pains, notably difficulty in finding a reliable mechanic, but he is hopeful, recently expanding his business plan to broker new as well as used cars.
 ''I think my prospects are limitless,'' he said.
 For those who encounter unexpected setbacks, microenterprise can also offer business planning and support. Two years ago, Aubrie and Joseph Augustus Jr., of New Orleans, poured retirement savings and the proceeds of a home equity loan into a $194,000 mobile shredder and began running Shredex L.L.C., a mobile document-shredding business. 
 As their business grew and they needed a truck and storage bins, they turned to the NewCorp Business Assistance Center, a New Orleans microlender through which they obtained two $25,000 loans at 8 percent interest. Then Hurricane Katrina struck, seriously damaging their equipment. Their shredder spent two months in the shop awaiting parts, but they stayed in business by paying to use another shredding company's machines.
 Meantime, they have an oral agreement with Vaughn Randolph Fauria, NewCorp's president, to defer payment of their loan until January. William W. Burrus, president of Accion USA says he gives struggling entrepreneurs a cheaper alternative to another fallback option, credit cards.
 ''Our loans certainly provide a less expensive and more flexible alternative to them,'' Mr. Burrus said.
 The Whitmans, the owners of the landscaping business in Pace, Fla., near Pensacola, say they are back on their feet today. They are still struggling, Ms. Whitman says, but she is hoping to make up for lost revenue in their landscaping work with sales of plants, fertilizers, outdoor fountains and lighting at their store.
 ''I'm not giving up,'' she said. ''I'm not giving in to a stinking storm. I'm more determined than before to make this business work.''

HEADLINE: Red Sox Taxed; Yanks Taxed More

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THE bill arrived at Yankee Stadium yesterday: please remit by Jan. 31, 2006, in a check made payable to the Major League Central Fund, the sum of $34,053,787. A bill arrived at Fenway Park in Boston, too, with the same instructions. That one, however, was a relative puny $4,156,476. 
 These were the luxury, or competitive-balance, tax bills, the sums that the Yankees and the Red Sox have to pay for exceeding the payroll threshold of $128 million. Including about $8 million in benefits, the Yankees had a competitive-balance payroll of $213,134,467, the Red Sox $141,854,919. No one else has to pay the luxury tax, the Mets being the closest to the threshold at $119,237,389. 
The heat and the passion that fuel the rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox tend to obscure a fact that the Red Sox point out to anyone who will listen, but that no one really hears: The Red Sox do not have the money to spend for players that the Yankees have. 
 The Red Sox might have had the second-highest payroll in the major leagues last season, but it was $71 million below the Yankees' payroll. If that doesn't sound like a lot of money, know that the difference was greater than the competitive-balance payrolls of 10 teams. 
 Computing payrolls on another basis, using 2005 salaries instead of the average annual value of contracts, the Yankees were about $75 million ahead of the Red Sox, a sum greater than the payrolls of more than half of the other 28 teams. 
 Payroll emerges as a factor today because the Yankees signed Johnny Damon and the Red Sox did not. 
 Just as a young George Steinbrenner snatched Luis Tiant away from the Red Sox in 1978, wrenching the heart out of the team the Yankees had just overcome in a fitting finish to a scintillating season, the Yankees once again reached deep into the Red Sox's chest and yanked out their leadoff hitter and center fielder.
 ''People tend to lump the Yankees and the Red Sox together in spending, '' John Henry, the Red Sox' principal owner, wrote in an e-mail response yesterday to a series of questions about the team's current status. But he said he believed the Yankees had outspent the Red Sox by $70 million last year. 
 ''We have constraints and have to be careful in order to successfully compete with them,'' Henry added.
 Waiting for what they thought was the right strategic moment, the Yankees leaped into the Damon pursuit Tuesday and, ignoring his agent's stated desire for a seven-year, $84 million deal, signed him to a four-year, $52 million contract. 
 ''We were consistently told -- even on the last day -- that it was going to take five years to sign Johnny,'' Henry wrote. ''We weren't willing to do that. Our best offer was $40 million over four years.''
 Having lost Damon to the hated rivals, would he do anything differently if he had a chance to do it over?
 ''No,'' Henry wrote. ''We weren't looking to spend $13 million per year even over four years.''
 The Yankees, believe it or not, know the feeling of letting a good player get away. A year ago, as the Mets were heatedly pursuing Carlos Beltran, his agent, Scott Boras, who is also Damon's agent, offered Beltran to the Yankees at a discount: $100 million for six years.
 But the Yankees very reluctantly declined. Their payroll was already approaching $200 million, and the Beltran contract would have cost them not $100 million but $140 million, the additional $40 million coming over six years in the form of the luxury tax.
 This year, the Yankees exceeded the payroll threshold for the third time, pushing their payroll-tax rate to 40 percent. (The amount of payroll over $128 million is taxed at that rate. Had the Yankees signed Beltran, the tax bite would have exceeded $40 million, $6 million more than the current tab.)
 The Red Sox, because they were surpassing the threshold for the second time, were taxed at 30 percent. After handling the latest bills, the Yankees over the past three years will have paid $63 million in taxes, the Red Sox $7 million. The tax has nothing to do with revenue sharing. That element of baseball's economic structure will cost the Yankees another $75 million this year. So the Yankees have reason to occasionally watch their dollars and cents. They expect their 2006 payroll to drop to about $180 million from this year's $203 million.
 Even if the Yankees can pare their payroll to that level, they will still be about $50 million ahead of the Red Sox. Henry said his team's 2006 budget ''is about the same as last year,'' which would be around $128 million.
 To demonstrate a difference in the revenue the teams generate, the Red Sox sold out all of their games at Fenway Park last season and drew 2.8 million fans. The Yankees did not sell out all their games and drew nearly 4.1 million, the most in the majors. 
 Fenway fans may be cranky next season because their team will be absent some familiar players: Damon, Bill Mueller, Kevin Millar, Edgar Renteria. If the Red Sox grant players' wishes, they will also play without Manny Ramirez and David Wells, though trading the unhappy Ramirez seems highly unlikely at this juncture.
 But even if they shed no more players, they need a shortstop, a center fielder, a first baseman and a leadoff hitter to make their team whole. Henry was asked if developments to this point had left the Red Sox lagging behind compared with where they were a year ago.
 ''Probably,'' he replied. ''We will certainly miss Johnny, in the clubhouse as much as on the field. He's a rare individual. But we still have dollars to spend and holes to fill. We may end up getting younger this year, something we needed to do.''

HEADLINE: Even With a Script, Ending a Strike Can Be Difficult

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
In 1966, Michael J. Quill ended the 12-day transit strike by thrusting four fingers through the oxygen tent of his Bellevue Hospital room. 
 In 1980, the transit strike was settled when state officials, rebuffing the mayor, sweetened their ''final'' contract offer slightly, bringing around union board members who, after 11 days, were wearied by a costly walkout.
Neither strike was supposed to have happened. In each case, some of the principals had even choreographed a way to settle the dispute. But union leaders apparently miscalculated, and after inconveniencing millions of subway and bus riders for nearly two weeks, they discovered an enduring axiom of labor relations: It is easier to start a strike than to end one. 
 If transit riders are wondering about the way to end the current walkout, history teaches a few things: In the past strikes, mediators intervened early, negotiations continued despite the illegal walkouts, and a politically attuned management found some method for union leaders, fending off dissidents in their ranks, to save face.
 Theodore J. Kheel, one of three mediators appointed in 1966 by Mayor John V. Lindsay, recalled yesterday that Quill rejected the mayor's 11th-hour demand for binding arbitration and called a strike for 5 a.m. Saturday, Jan. 1 (''Give the drunks time to go home,'' he said). 
 ''Quill called the strike in the belief it could be settled by Sunday,'' Mr. Kheel recalled. But the Transit Authority obtained an injunction, and union leaders were sentenced to civil jail, where a few days later Quill suffered congestive heart failure, thwarting his plan for a short strike. 
 With the bargaining going nowhere and the walkout crippling the city's economy and tarnishing the newly elected Lindsay, Deputy Mayor Robert Price secretly conferred with Quill at Bellevue to gauge his negotiating bottom line. Quill held up four fingers, meaning the $3.65-an-hour top pay for bus drivers should be raised to $4, or about 15 percent. To provide political cover, Lindsay demanded that the mediators, who had not intended to formally recommend a settlement of their own, embrace that formula. They did. 
 After tinkering to address another fundamental political wrinkle -- employees with low skills, mostly black, were making almost as much as skilled motormen and bus drivers, most of whom were white -- both sides agreed to a new contract. 
 By the 1980 strike, transit officials had a powerful weapon: the state's Taylor Law, which provided for automatic penalties against striking public employee unions and their members. Richard Ravitch, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman, and John E. Lawe, the Transport Workers Union president, orchestrated a negotiating finale: Mr. Ravitch would present a final offer, and the union would reject it. Then, for public relations purposes, before going on strike the union would make its own final offer, which Mr. Ravitch would accept.
 But the union's board balked, and the strike began. 
 Again, negotiations continued during the strike. Mayor Edward I. Koch was cheerleading pedestrians and vigorously resisting proposed wage increases that might set precedents for municipal union contracts that were about to expire. Wringing some productivity gains from the union, Mr. Ravitch and Gov. Hugh L. Carey agreed to sweeten the M.T.A.'s last offer despite the mayor's opposition.
 ''They're still cheering the mayor on the Brooklyn Bridge,'' the city's budget director angrily reminded the governor's staff.
 To which Meyer S. Frucher, the state's labor relations director, tartly replied: ''They cheered Hitler in Berlin, too.'' 
 Lawe presented the contract to his fractious board. The vote was 22 to 22. ''It goes to the membership,'' he declared, and ducked out a back door. The rank and file, already faced with Taylor Law penalties that would wipe out the first year's wage increases, voted for ratification . 
 The story of the 2005 strike is still being written, of course, but while some factors are not analogous, some of the lessons of earlier negotiations seem to have been forgotten. 
 In the earlier contracts, wage increases helped compensate for more fundamental sticking points: in 1966, officials narrowed salary differentials between high- and low-level employees, and in 1980, the M.T.A. enjoyed unprecedented success in winning concessions on work rules. 
 This time, the chief sticking point appears to be the M.T.A.'s demands for less generous pensions for future employees, which, the union argues convincingly, is not legally a mandatory subject of collective bargaining, much less of binding arbitration, which was made possible after the 1980 strike. 
 ''Collective bargaining is a communications undertaking,'' Mr. Kheel, who is 91, said yesterday. ''They desperately needed a mediator here. A mediator is a catalyst on a hot tin roof.''
 Mr. Kheel also suggested that, given the Taylor Law penalties, the union may have already overplayed its hand by striking. He recalled that in 1964, a transit strike was averted after an all-night negotiating session when Quill, bowing to reality, abruptly abandoned his principal demand. How, he was asked that morning, could he agree to a contract that failed to provide for a four-day week? 
 ''Common sense,'' he replied.

HEADLINE: Tolls Start to Mount: Financial, Medical, Emotional

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and MARC SANTORA; David M. Herszenhorn and Shadi Rahimi contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
For a day, maybe, it felt like a communal challenge, a dare to New Yorkers to demonstrate their pluck and ingenuity. But by yesterday, the reality of a transit strike had wiped away any sense that this was an adventure. It was an annoyance, a hardship, a source of suffering.
 Every apartment block, office, store or sidewalk had its tales of people who were unable to get to work, of businesses that had trouble functioning or were able to operate only at a daunting cost, of workers and employers who reached their jobs and found there had been little point in trying because the customers were missing.
 The economic burden was felt citywide, but there were other costs, too -- hundreds of thousands of children missing school, commuters spending extra hours shuttling to work and back, and pervasive fear of how long this will go on. 
 ''This should be our biggest week, but I had to shut down my business,'' said Olga Diaz, owner of Olga's Salon in the financial district in Lower Manhattan. ''If it wasn't for the strike, I would be back to back, maybe 30 clients a day through here, but yesterday I had only one, and today only two. I could lose $3,000 worth of business this week.''
 The hairdressers in that shop, like Maria Lozano, earn only on commission. So no work, no pay. Ms. Lozano, who lives in Queens, was unable to get to work on Tuesday. So on Tuesday night, she left her children with her mother and went to her boyfriend's home on Staten Island. She commuted to work by ferry yesterday, but there was little to do.
 ''I still have to buy a lot of presents, and I'm stuck,'' she said. ''I don't have any money.''
 Visiting Nurse Service said it feared that if the strike continued, its workers would not be able to keep up with the need for in-home care. It warned hospitals that in the coming days, they might have to hold patients longer than usual, rather than releasing people who need home care.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg continued to describe the strike's economic impact in dire terms, saying that business at restaurants fell by 40 percent, that street traffic on Fifth Avenue's glittering shopping district was down by 50 percent, that sales dropped by 60 percent at the stores on Fordham Road in the Bronx. The office of City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated that if the strike continues through Christmas, the cost to the city's economy would reach $1.5 billion.
 Experts agreed that the pain would be widespread and deep, but cautioned that so far, the only measure is anecdotal evidence. The first reliable data may be from sales tax reports, which the state's Department of Taxation and Finance said would not begin to trickle in until the first of the year.
 Stores and restaurants appeared to be especially hard hit, losing customers and workers at what would ordinarily be their busiest season. The financial company A. G. Edwards estimated yesterday that Federated Department Stores, the nation's largest department store chain and owner of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Lord & Taylor, would lose 1 to 2 percent of its December sales for the entire nation because of the New York strike. 
 The greatest hardship may be felt by smaller businesses and their employees, who have fewer resources to fall back on.
 The owners of the Coffee Pot, a small chain of restaurants in Manhattan, hit the streets at 4 a.m. yesterday in rented vans to pick up 20 employees who live in the city's other boroughs. They paid for the vans, for parking, and for another 20 workers' cab fare, as much as $50 apiece, roundtrip.
 In all, said Sonny Patel, one of the chain's owners, it is costing Coffee Pot close to $1,000 a day just to open the doors each day -- and for curtailed hours, at that. And despite their efforts, some workers were unable to make it. 
 ''We're still paying everybody, but I don't know how much longer we can do that,'' he said.
 Nerys Santos lives in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan and works as a bookkeeper at a grocery in Queens, earning $55 a day to support herself and three children. But on Tuesday and again yesterday, the logistics of getting her children to school and herself to work defeated her, so she stayed home and earned nothing. Her boss told her it was essential for her to reach work today. ''If he pays for me to go, I'll go,'' she said. ''But I can't afford to get there myself.''
 Many New Yorkers said that while they had some sympathy for the transit workers, it was quickly wearing thin. In particular, some said, walking out just before Christmas seemed intended to inflict maximum pain.
 ''A lot of people in this country work a lot harder for less money,'' said Ms. Diaz, the salon owner. ''They're complaining about health benefits and pensions; a lot of people don't have health benefits and pensions, including the people who work here in my shop.''
 Mayor Bloomberg said the strike had stranded some of the tens of thousands of infirm people who rely on home health aides and visiting nurses. But agencies that do such work said that so far, with few exceptions, they had reached their patients' homes -- albeit hours late in some cases, and with extraordinary measures in others.
 Gloria Ramos, 74, who lives on the Lower East Side and takes 17 medications daily, was seen yesterday by both a visiting nurse and a home attendant, but she feared what would happen in a prolonged strike. ''More than anything else, I do not want to be alone,'' she said.
 The nurse, Margaret L. Torres, from Visiting Nurse Service, was able to reach her clients by staying at a Holiday Inn, rather than going home on Tuesday night. In fact, hotels, like car services, were among the few business sectors that were benefiting from the strike.
 Carol Raphael, the Visiting Nurse Service president, said that like many other businesses, it was hiring vans and cars to transport workers, renting hotel rooms, shifting schedules and reimbursing people for cab fare. But that effort is expensive, she said, and she was unsure of how long the company and its workers could continue, prompting talks with hospitals about limiting the number of people they send home each day.
 Attendance at the city's public schools was 71 percent yesterday, officials said, meaning that about 300,000 students stayed home -- and that was a significant improvement from Tuesday. For the second consecutive day, schools started two hours later than usual to ensure that the staff was able to get to work. Nearly all teachers did make it, but the late start caused more problems for parents who took children to school before heading to their own jobs.
 Among elementary students, who mostly live near their schools, attendance was fairly good. But high school students, many of whom commute long distances, fared far worse -- 41 percent attendance citywide -- and those who made it said little instruction took place.
 ''We watched some movies, but the movies are boring,'' said Kima Polite, 17, a senior at Springfield Gardens High School in Queens, where attendance yesterday was 27 percent. ''The teachers don't really want to teach and then have to re-teach.''
 She said some students saw the strike as an early start to their holiday break. ''You have got time off before you have got time off,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Monetary Losses Starting To Be Felt by Workers

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Shadi Rahimi and Matthew Sweeney contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Early on Dec. 12, two days after bus and subway workers voted to authorize a strike, Muriel Scott borrowed $2,500 from her 401(k) plan and set it aside in a savings account. With her husband sick at home, a mortgage to pay, Christmas gifts to buy and two teenage daughters to raise, Mrs. Scott, a bus driver, felt she needed some cushion in case transit employees staged a walkout.
 ''That money isn't much, but I'm glad that I have it,'' Mrs. Scott, 50, said yesterday at the picket line outside the Michael J. Quill bus depot on 11th Avenue and 41st Street. ''I'm just scared to death because I don't know what might happen if this strike drags on for a while.'' 
For the 33,700 striking workers who face daily fines and the loss of wages, the costs of the walkout are beginning to sink in, with some having second thoughts and wondering if the battle is worth the pain.
 Already, some transit employees have crossed picket lines and reported to work, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference, though Douglas Weiss, a strike organizer, said that the only ones who showed up for work yesterday were newly hired workers who are on probation and risk losing their jobs if they join the strike. He estimated their number to be in the low hundreds; Mr. Bloomberg did not offer any estimates.
 Late yesterday the transit authority started running television commercials urging the workers to return to their jobs. 
 On the picket lines, Mrs. Scott and many of her colleagues wished they could be back at work but said they did not intend to break ranks by crossing the picket line.
 ''If I had a choice, I'd be driving my bus, but I've got to do what my union wants me to do,'' said Mrs. Scott, whose husband, Richard, has been on disability since he was injured in a car crash in March.
 The striking members of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union face fines of twice their daily pay rate for every day they stay out. On top of that, the loss of wages comes at an especially painful time, just before the holidays.
 In interviews with some three dozen transit workers, many said the prospect of a longer strike and its attendant financial hardship was unfathomable. Most of these workers have children, so they have to set aside money for school supplies, clothing and food, they said. But many also said they have to meet mortgage and car payments, while some said they have ailing relatives whom they must support.
 Paul Zambuto, 54, who monitors the power on subway tracks, still remembers what happened after transit workers went on strike for 11 days in 1980. He lost about $5,000 in pay and, in the end, ''we barely got what we wanted,'' he said. He is not hopeful it will be much different this time.
 ''We should have settled this contract a long time ago, Mr. Zambuto said. ''We should have gone back to the bargaining table before striking. Now, the longer this goes on, the more we lose.''
 At the Liffey Bar II in Upper Manhattan, where a group of transit workers got together after spending the morning picketing outside the 207th Street Yard, many said they had voted in favor of a strike but did not think a walkout would occur. The overall feeling was that the negotiations this year would be a lot like the negotiations in 2002, when the union and the authority reached a last-minute deal.
 ''We didn't prepare for a strike this time because we didn't think we were going to have one,'' said Krishendat Sukhnanan, 51, a bus maintainer. ''We spent all our money for Thanksgiving and we bought gifts, so now we're broke.''
 Steve McCluskey, 50, a maintenance worker at bus depots, said, ''I've only got one month's mortgage in the bank.''
 That last contract, which expired on Dec. 15, gave the workers a much improved health plan, but wage increases that did not keep up with inflation. Mindful of that, union leaders are demanding raises above inflation.
 Just minutes before Monday's 12:01 a.m. deadline, the authority sweetened its wage offer so that raises would average 3.5 percent a year for three years, rather than just 3 percent, as it had previously proposed. In the end, it was a demand for higher pension contributions from new workers that brought the negotiations to a standstill.
 Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100, has sought to justify the strike as a quest to ensure a decent standard of living to future generations. He articulated this message by proclaiming on the eve of the transit strike, ''We will not sell out the unborn'' by concessions on pensions and health care.
 Many bus and subway workers on the picket lines feel, however, that this fight is not worth the sacrifice.
 ''Roger Toussaint seems more concerned about guys that aren't on the job than guys that are on the job,'' Ronnie Clarke, 48, a bus driver for 22 years, said as he sipped a beer at the bar.
 ''I don't really care about anybody that's not on the job yet,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''I think we're out here for the wrong reasons. I wished I was out here for the active members and the retired rather than the unborn members.''

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Mineola: Man Acquitted In Second Rape Trial 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE (NYT); Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
After two criminal trials and 18 years in prison, a 41-year-old Long Island man was acquitted yesterday in the rape and murder of Theresa Fusco, a 16-year-old from Lynbrook, in 1984. In a nonjury trial, Acting Justice Victor Ort of State Supreme Court found the man, John Kogut, not guilty on three counts. Mr. Kogut, then an unemployed landscaper, was one of three men who were convicted, based on his videotaped confession. He was freed in 2003, after improved DNA technology demonstrated that a semen sample from Ms. Kogut's body did not match any of the three men convicted. A few months later, however, the Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon, announced that he would retry Mr. Kogut. Mr. Dillon has not said whether he will seek retrials of the other two men, John Restivo and Dennis Halstead. ''Justice was finally done after 20 years,'' said Paul Casteleiro, Mr. Kogut's lawyer.

HEADLINE: Students to Bear Big Burden Under the Final Budget Bill 

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Nearly one-third of all the savings in the final budget bill comes from student aid, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.
 Under the bill, college students would pay higher interest rates on loans. Many banks will receive lower subsidies. And the Education Department will work with the Internal Revenue Service to ferret out students and parents who underreport incomes on financial aid applications. The budget bill is estimated to save $39.7 billion over the next five years. Student aid accounts for $12.7 billion of the savings, or 32 percent.
Not since 1997 has Congress made such an ambitious effort to slow the growth of benefit programs. The legislation includes these changes: 
 States would have sweeping new authority to impose premiums and co-payments on millions of low-income people covered by Medicaid. States can also scale back benefits for many recipients.
 For the elderly, it would be more difficult to qualify for Medicaid coverage for nursing home care if they transfer assets to their children or other relatives for less than fair market value. 
 Medicare would freeze payments for home health services and reduce payments for medical imaging. 
 Welfare recipients would be subject to stricter work requirements. States would be subject to new financial penalties unless they put more people to work or further reduce the number of families receiving assistance. 
 Aid that helps states collect child support from absent parents would be reduced. 
 The Bush administration worked closely with Republicans in Congress on provisions that affect student aid. But Education Secretary Margaret Spellings declined to comment until the bill cleared a final hurdle on Capitol Hill.
 Republican negotiators said virtually all the cuts in student aid would be borne by banks and other lenders, an assertion sharply disputed by Democrats and college administrators, who said that two-thirds of the savings would be at the expense of students and their families.
 Even as it makes those cuts, Congress is creating a new program for students from low-income families who are eligible for Pell grants. The amount of aid will not be based on financial need. To qualify, students would have to be United States citizens, have completed ''a rigorous secondary school program of study'' and be taking courses full time at a ''degree-granting institution of higher education.''
 The student would have to maintain ''a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0.'' Juniors and seniors will be eligible only if they have declared a major in the physical or life sciences, computer science, mathematics, technology, engineering or a foreign language deemed critical to national security.
 College and university groups, as well as most Democrats, opposed the overall bill. 
 ''This is the biggest cut in the history of the federal student loan program,'' said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, an umbrella group for public and private colleges and universities.
 A lobbyist at the council, Becky H. Timmons, said, ''Students will be paying higher interest rates than they are currently paying.'' 
 The rate would be fixed at 6.8 percent for students and 8.5 percent for parents. The current rates, which vary with market conditions, are several percentage points below those levels.
 The new aid for freshmen and sophomores is known as academic competitiveness grants. Freshmen would be eligible for $750 grants, and sophomores for $1,300 grants. Juniors and seniors would be eligible for $4,000 a year in what Congress calls Smart grants. The name is an acronym for ''science and mathematics access to retain talent.''
 The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said the new support for math and science education would increase America's ability to compete in a global economy. 
 ''China and India are generating scientists and engineers at a furious pace while America lags dangerously behind,'' Mr. Frist said. 
 The bill would not change the maximum Pell grant, which has been $4,050 for several years. President Bush had proposed a $100 increase. The bill would increase the maximum amount of subsidized loans, to $3,500 and $4,500 for first- and second-year students, from $2,625 and $3,500.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the math and science program would abandon the Pell grant principle that the neediest students should receive the most help.
 ''Under this proposal,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''a single mother who can attend college only part time because she has to work 40 hours a week to put food on the table will not be eligible for a penny in new grant aid.''
 Republicans said the budget bill squeezed far more savings from banks than from students. Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Committee on Education and the Work Force, said the bill would increase benefits for some students while saving money for taxpayers. 
 ''Vast increases in federal student aid'' have coincided with a decade of tuition increases, Mr. Boehner said.
 He suggested that federal investments in higher education had contributed to ''the college cost explosion that is squeezing the budgets of low- and middle-income families.''
 Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, said the Republican proposals would make it even harder for many families to pay for college. About 70 percent of the savings in student aid ''come off the backs of students and their families,'' Mr. Miller said.

HEADLINE: FedEx Profit Up 33% in Quarter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The FedEx Corporation said yesterday that fiscal second-quarter profit climbed 33 percent as deliveries rose around the world and it raised surcharges to cover higher fuel prices.
 Net income rose to $471 million, or $1.53 a share, from $354 million, or $1.15 a share, a year earlier, the company said. Earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, and the company increased its full-year forecast a second time. 
 FedEx, based in Memphis, is benefiting from an increase in shipments from Asia and China, where the value of goods traded with the United States has risen 25 percent this year. Shipments by businesses grew in the quarter even as the company charged customers more to help offset the rising price of fuel.
 ''We continue to see year-over-year economic growth in the U.S. and Asian economies,'' the chief executive, Frederick W. Smith, told analysts and investors on a conference call. ''Business orders remain strong, and the labor market is improving steadily.''
 FedEx's sales in the second quarter, which ended Nov. 30, rose 10 percent, to $8.09 billion. Total shipments rose 3 percent, including a 4 percent volume increase at its United States ground transportation unit. Shipments from outside the country increased 8 percent.
 The company said it expected third-quarter profit of $1.15 to $1.30 a share. The company also increased its full-year forecast 20 cents, to $5.45 to $5.70 a share, including a charge of 15 cents taken in the first quarter.
 FedEx shares rose $5.21, or 5.3 percent, to $103.70.
 FedEx is taking market share from its larger rival, United Parcel Service, in the United States ground parcel and freight business, Jon Langenfeld, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company, said in a report. 
 FedEx and U.P.S. both gained business in September as the DHL unit of Deutsche Post struggled to integrate operations at its air shipment hub in Ohio.

HEADLINE: Race Bubbles To the Surface In Standoff 

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Sewell Chan and Mike McIntire contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The standoff between the Transport Workers Union and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, tense and perilous, was already taking a harsh physical and economic toll on New Yorkers.
 But now, as representatives of a mostly nonwhite work force trade recriminations publicly with white leaders in government and at the transportation authority, the potentially volatile issue of race, with all its emotional consequences, is bubbling to the surface.
The examples are both blatant and subtle, some open to interpretation, some openly hostile. Regarding the latter sort, the union -- representing workers who are largely minority -- shut down a Web log where the public could comment on the strike after it became so clogged with messages comparing the workers to monkeys and calling them ''you people.'' (Seventy percent of the employees of New York City Transit are black, Latino or Asian-American.) 
 And what may have begun inadvertently, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Tuesday that union leaders had ''thuggishly turned their backs on New York City,'' took on a life of its own yesterday as minority leaders and union members attacked the mayor's conduct as objectionable, or worse. ''There has been some offensive and insulting language used,'' said Roger Toussaint, the union leader. ''This is regrettable and it is certainly unbecoming for the mayor of the city of New York to be using this type of language.''
 But others were more extreme in their response. Leroy Bright, 56, a black bus operator who is also a union organizer, saw racial coding in Mr. Bloomberg's choice of words. ''The word thug is usually attributed to people of color whenever something negative takes place,'' he said, adding that the language was ''unnecessarily hostile.''
 The Rev. Al Sharpton, who called an evening news conference to blast Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview: ''How did we become thugs? Because we strike over a pension?''
 ''I do not think the language would have been used in a union that was not as heavily populated by people of color,'' he added. ''And whether he intentionally did it or not, he offended a lot of people of color and he ought to address that, and come to the bargaining table.''
 Earlier in the day, the Rev. Herbert D. Daughtry, a Brooklyn pastor, joined elected officials at a City Hall news conference and compared Mr. Bloomberg to Eugene (Bull) Connor, the Alabama police chief who used police dogs and fire hoses on civil rights protesters in the 1960's. 
 Ed Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, dismissed those comments, saying, ''It's despicable for anyone to inject race into this situation.'' He noted that when police and fire union members were trailing the mayor during contract negotiations, Mr. Skyler had accused them of ''acting like thugs,'' to little comment. 
 But for all the accusations and counter-accusations, clues of a simmering racial tension have hovered over the contract negotiations between the union and the transit authority all along. 
 Mr. Toussaint, for instance, continued yesterday to cast the strike as part of a broader movement for social justice and invoked the civil rights movement, as he often does in his calls to respect the dignity of his workers. ''Had Rosa Parks answered the call of the law instead of the higher call of justice, many of us who are driving buses today would instead be at the back of the bus,'' he said.
 Mr. Toussaint added that he was the one who pointed out that the authority did not honor the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The authority, in its offer on Monday night, agreed to create such a holiday, an action estimated to cost $9 million a year. Indeed, the politics of the strike are in some ways embedded in the broader demographic changes in the city. Mr. Toussaint, who is originally from Trinidad, leads a union, now dominated by blacks, Latinos and Asian-Americans, whose members were once mostly of European descent. 
 ''Clearly race is a subtext of much of what has happened in city politics, in the ethnic succession within unions and city agencies,'' said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor at the Baruch School of Public Affairs, who said he saw nothing inherently racial in the use of the term thuggish. 
 Among members of the Transport Workers Union, however, there is a real and bitter sense that city leaders speak of them differently from members of other unions, like those of police officers and firefighters, whose memberships are whiter.
 For instance, George McAnanama, a semi-retired union leader and former transit worker said transit employees have received less praise for their contributions during city emergencies like the 2001 terror attack and the 2003 blackout. ''Whenever there's praise given out we're always the stepchild if we're mentioned at all,'' he said.
 Now, that sense of injustice has more fully emerged among workers on strike and is being championed by elected officials from the City Council to Congress. Mr. Sharpton made the civil rights connection explicit, noting that when Dr. King was assassinated in 1968, he was in Memphis to support a sanitation workers' strike, a strike also held to be illegal.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for the Wealthy: Waste More, Want More

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank. 
Robert H. Frank, an economist at the Johnson School of Management at Cornell University, is the co-author, with Ben S. Bernanke, of ''Principles of Economics.'' E-mail: rhf3@cornell.edu

 BODY:
WITH President Bush's proposed tax cuts for top earners struggling to get political traction in early 2001, Representative Tom Osborne, Republican of Nebraska, rose to the White House's defense on the House floor. 
 ''The bottom line is that it's your money,'' he said, ''and you know how to spend it much better than anyone in Washington, D.C.''
In the years since, variations of this statement by the president and other government officials have kept opponents of high-end tax cuts consistently on the defensive. 
 This talk has been effective in part because it appeals to voters' common sense. After all, people have an obvious incentive to exercise care when spending their own hard-earned dollars. Why would a faceless bureaucrat in Washington, who is spending someone else's money, be nearly as careful? 
 The ''it's your money'' line is also buttressed by widely reported examples in which government paid far more than necessary to get the job done. Famously, the Pentagon once spent $640 for a single toilet seat and on another occasion paid $435 for an ordinary claw hammer. 
 But paying more than the market rate is just one form of wasteful spending. Another, often far more important, form is to pay a fair price for something that serves little purpose. This second form of waste is considerably more common in private spending than in public spending -- and made even worse as the chief beneficiaries of the tax cuts race to outdo one another. 
 A case in point is a decision on many minds at this time of year, that of how much to spend on a wristwatch. Scores of full-page ads in recent issues of The New York Times have displayed handsome watches costing several thousand dollars apiece and more. 
 The most coveted among them are elaborate mechanical marvels with multiple ''complications,'' special features that enhance their accuracy. The tourbillion movement, for example, is essentially a small gyroscope that rotates the main mechanism about once a minute, reducing errors caused by the Earth's gravitational field. The Grande Complication, by Jean Dunand, sells for more than $700,000, but lesser entries by Patek Philippe, Rolex and other manufacturers can be had for $5,000 to $100,000. 
 Unlike toilet seats and claw hammers, these watches are costly to produce, so buyers who pay high prices for them are not being ripped off. In another sense, however, their dollars go largely for naught. For despite their mechanical wizardry, none of these watches are as accurate as a battery-powered $30 Timex, whose quartz crystal mechanism is unaffected by gravity.
 Then why do people buy the expensive mechanical watches? Edward Faber of the Aaron Faber Gallery in Manhattan recently described buyers of these watches as men from 30 to 50 who want ''this 'power tool,' this instrument on their wrist that distinguishes them from the pack.'' The problem is that if a watch is to distinguish its owner, it must sell for more than the watches worn by members of the pack. So when the pack spends more, the price of distinguishing oneself also rises. And in the end, no one gains any more distinction than if all had spent less.
 Other forms of high-end private spending are driven by similar forces. To celebrate their daughter's 13th birthday, for example, Amber Ridinger's parents bought her a $27,000 Dolce & Gabbana gown and hired JaRule, Ashanti and other popular entertainers to provide live music at her party in Miami last month.
 David H. Brooks, the chief executive of a company that supplies body armor to the American military in Iraq, invited 150 of his daughter's friends to the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, where they were serenaded by 50 Cent, Don Henley, Stevie Nicks and other luminaries during a birthday party reported to have cost $10 million.
 Although these events have prompted much finger wagging by social critics, the parents involved are not behaving abnormally. They are merely spending their own money in an effort to provide a special occasion for their daughters. For a party to be special, however, it must somehow stand out from other parties that define the norm. Here, too, the problem is that expensive birthday parties have become a growth industry.
 Kevin and Danya Mondell, founders of Oogles-n-Googles, a company described as an over-the-top event planner for children's parties, recently announced their intention to license Oogles-n-Googles franchises. Yet no matter how much parents spend, the number of parties that achieve special status will be no greater than when everyone spent much less. 
 On balance, then, there is little reason to expect large tax cuts for wealthy families to have resulted in a more efficient allocation of our nation's scarce resources. 
 For one thing, not all of the dollars used to finance these tax cuts would have been spent wastefully by government. Most of the money recently cut from the food stamp program, for example, would have been spent by poor families to buy food at fair market prices. And even though government does buy some items at inflated prices -- body armor whose price includes a profit margin large enough to finance a $10 million birthday party? -- many of these items serve vital purposes. 
 In contrast, most of the tax cuts financed by recent budget cuts will go to families that already have everything they might reasonably need. This money will be deployed in the quest for ''something special.'' Yet because special is an elastic concept, the number of families that succeed in this quest will be little different from before.

HEADLINE: The Third Home Comes Within Reach

BYLINE: By MELINDA BLAU

 BODY:
WINTER in the Florida place, summer at the beach house and a red and gold autumn at the mountain retreat. What could be more logical than following the seasons to experience the best time at each of your homes? It's hardly a new idea -- families with means have followed the pattern for centuries. What's new is that this lifestyle is going mainstream.
 Edrie Ferdun, 68, and Jan Felshin, 72, former college professors and partners for 45 years, don't fit the profile of the landed gentry, but like an increasing number of modestly well-off Americans, they have acquired the requisite three homes for a season-to-season lifestyle. In the winter they enjoy a warm and urban existence in their duplex at Miami's South Beach; in the summer they retreat to their cottage on Fire Island; and in the transitional seasons they enjoy spring wildflowers and autumn leaves at their rustic cabin on a creek in the Poconos. Each place is furnished and comfortable -- they travel from one to another with their cat and minimal luggage in their 2001 Acura. ''We've had three places so long,'' Dr. Ferdun said, ''that each one of them feels like home.'' 
They began with two residences. Dr. Felshin commuted several days a week from their small mountain house in Tannersville, Pa., to East Stroudsburg State University, where she taught physical education, while Dr. Ferdun ran the graduate dance program at Temple University and stayed at their three-bedroom house in Philadelphia (which they have since sold). In 1977 they bought a two-bedroom cottage in Cherry Grove, on Fire Island. And in 1985 they paid $15,000 for a studio unit in a refurbished motel in Miami's South Beach that they have now expanded, with additional purchases, to a two-bedroom duplex. ''We didn't plan this,'' Dr. Ferdun said, ''but we always loved to run away to special places.''
 So, apparently, do plenty of other people, and more and more are finding it possible. The increasing ranks of third-home owners include many retired or semiretired couples, but also people in their working years who need only a computer and high-speed connection to make a living. Others have children at home or are tethered to a job that requires their daily presence, but manage to get to their second and third homes often, and typically plan to embrace the seasonal lifestyle fully at some point. 
 It is impossible to pinpoint the actual numbers of third-home buyers because lending institutions don't distinguish between second and third homes. Every year, however, the National Association of Realtors uses courthouse deed records to solicit information from 100,000 people who buy and sell homes. The 2004 survey, spanning mid-2003 to mid-2004 transactions, added a new question about multiple homes.
 ''This was the first time we asked about second, third and even fourth homes,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the group. Of the 8,206 subjects who responded, 14 percent had two or more homes, 4.3 percent had three or more, and 1.2 percent had four or more. The typical vacation-home buyer in the age group from the late 40's to mid-50's earns $71,000 a year and paid $190,000. 
 ''This is not just a millionaire's dream anymore,'' said Paul Bessler, vice president for strategic marketing at Centex Destination Properties, a developer in Dallas that focuses on high-end resort-like home properties. ''Depending on the community, between 8 percent and 38 percent of our buyers have three homes or more.'' The current trend, he said, is driven by baby boomers who are reaching their peak earning years. He likened third homes to other luxury lifestyle markers that have trickled down from the have-a-lots to the mere haves, like spa vacations and multiple cars.
 Zhu Xiao Di, a senior research analyst at Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, also sees the trend. ''While the inflation-adjusted average household income increased over time, the average household income of those having third homes actually decreased,'' he said. Using data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances in 1989 and 2001, he found that third-home owners in 1989 had household incomes three and a quarter times the average of all households, while in 2001, they had just two and a half times the average. ''It's still for the rich, but not that rich,'' he said.
 Many new third-home owners profited from the increased value of their first or second homes. Low interest rates have been a factor as well but ''aren't enough to explain this phenomenon entirely,'' said William Wheaton, director of research at the Center for Real Estate at M.I.T.
 Some owners have also inherited third homes or acquired them through remarriage. And some, by their own admission, were simply at the right place at the right time. 
 Paul and Ronnie Chernis, 70 and 66, started out renting a two-bedroom apartment in a high-rise in Forest Hills. He practiced law and she was a secretary to a federal judge when they bought a vacation home, a three-bedroom house in East Hampton that is now worth 10 times the $89,000 they paid for it in 1982. Then came the 90's, and ''I had good fortune in the market during the bubble,'' Mr. Chernis said. Cashing out his investments at the right time, he used part of his modest windfall to buy a $374,500 three-bedroom apartment with panoramic views of the Intracoastal Waterway near Miami and had enough left over to make a down payment a few years later on a one-bedroom condo in Forest Hills, making them homeowners there as well. 
 The Chernises paid cash for their Florida property, but easier financing has helped others buy their third places. ''The banks have lowered their standards, so you can make less and still qualify for a mortgage,'' said Suze Orman, the financial adviser and author. ''Once, the debt-to-income ratio was 25 percent, but now it can be as high as 38 percent. Add to that the new kinds of mortgages -- zero percent down, interest-only financing -- and people can buy real estate today that years ago they couldn't.''
 THREE homes, of course, means three times the bills and accounts to manage, plus everyday complications that can slide into confusion. Ronnie Chernis said she worried that one of her houses might become a money pit. ''You're always doing something -- calling contractors, overseeing workers, making sure that everything is in order,'' she said. Many homeowners also rely on hired caretakers, an added expense, though others have family and friends to help with some of their properties.
 They must depend on their own powers of organization as well. Bonnie Leff, 63, who, with her husband, Steve, 65, a retired advertising executive, migrates regularly between their homes in New Canaan, Conn.; Del Ray, Fla.; and Park City, Utah, said the logistics of each transition take 10 days to three weeks. ''I'm a big list-maker, but by now it's automatic -- the cable, the phones, the newspapers,'' she said. ''I change the address at the post office five days before I leave -- that's the magic number.''
 Dr. Felshin maintains two credit cards -- one for Tannersville (''where all our papers live'') and a second for Florida and Fire Island, on which she changes the address twice a year ''because you need a matching address for many online transactions.''
 But these people are not complaining. A little adjustment now and then seems well worthwhile to those who love getting the best of three worlds. Few grumble about needing space, and when schedules aren't in sync or tempers flare, there are lots of options.
 ''Having three homes is great for a marriage,'' Mrs. Leff said. ''It gives you something to look forward to -- a change of climate, a change of venue.'' 
 John Ottavino, 45, a makeup artist who works in television, shrugs off the difficulties. ''You have to be willing to open your closet and wear what's in there,'' he said. 
 Such insouciance comes less easily for his partner, Gilbert Rodriguez, 41, deputy chief clerk for the Bronx Family Court. The two shuttle between their high-rise apartment in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, their painstakingly restored Victorian in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and, in the summer, their house in the Fire Island Pines. ''Sometimes I just lose it when I go to get dressed for work, and a shirt I want to wear is in another house,'' Mr. Rodriguez said.
 Most house-hoppers suspect that when they get too tired of the hassles -- or too old to manage them -- they'll cut back. But Mr. Ottavino and Mr. Rodriguez are shopping for a fourth place in Miami, which they will rent out at first. Mr. Ottavino doesn't see much of a downside: ''We can always sell and make money,'' he said. ''And if I had to, I'd do it the same way over again. It makes for a fun, interesting life, and a good and early retirement.''

Previews and Openings

'CANDIDA' Opens Wednesday. George Bernard Shaw's play about ''that very immoral'' -- his words -- title character who must choose between her husband and the poet who has fallen in love with her (1:55). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery Lane, at Bond Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200.

'ALMOST, MAINE' Opens Jan. 12. A comedy featuring 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212.

'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Opens Jan. 10. If you're pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.

Broadway

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there's no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'LATINOLOGUES' Created and written by Rick Najera and directed by Cheech Marin, long since de-Chonged, this is a series of loosely linked monologues delivered in character by Mr. Najera and three other talented Latino performers. Mr. Najera and his compadres can be skillful slingers of one-liners, but the characters cooked up to transmit them are neither fresh nor fully realized. In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone, who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, but not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'APPARITION' Anne Washburn's gothic shorts are like an excellent late-night storytelling session at the Vincent Price camp for disturbed children (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jason Zinoman)

'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Zinoman)

* 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' Spirited entertainment (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Van Gelder)

'FIVE COURSE LOVE' This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)

'HIS ROYAL HIPNESS LORD BUCKLEY IN THE ZAM ZAM ROOM' Jake Broder's scrupulous (and rigid) re-creation of the influential nightclub comic Lord Buckley, an unlikely mix of English royalty and Dizzy Gillespie (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Zinoman).

'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

*'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' The joyous surprise of this Shakespeare's Globe production, directed by John Dove, is how it floods this famously dark play with continuously roaming beams of comic light. In particular Mark Rylance, the troupe's outgoing artistic director, is an endearingly clueless Duke Vincentio (3:05). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Isherwood)

'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Brantley)

'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

*'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'PETER PAN' (2:00). Entertaining without being exhilarating (2:00). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, 4 Penn Plaza, (212) 307-7171. (Van Gelder)

'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)

'TIGHT EMBRACE' Jorge Ignacio Cortinas's political hostage drama wants to show, with its dash of magic realism and flickering poetic fire, how human beings use language as a weapon to betray one another. Good acting, especially by Zabryna Guevara, helps the play toward its goal (2:00). Intar Theater at the Kirk on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Andrea Stevens)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish send-up of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village; (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman)

* 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village; (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

Last Chance

'HAYMARKET' Zayd Dohrn, son of Weather Underground members Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers, mixes documentary, fiction and memory in this play about the bomb that exploded at an 1886 worker's rally in Chicago and the anarchists who were hanged for the crime (2:05). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing today. (Miriam Horn)

* 'KLONSKY & SCHWARTZ' Romulus Linney's amusing if thin drama follows the unbalanced friendship between the poet Delmore Schwartz and his protege (1:30). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, closing today. (Zinoman)

'ROPE' The key revelation of this revival of the Patrick Hamilton play that became a Hitchcock movie: The whole darn thing was originally set in a fancy London parlor stuffed with fancy British people. David Warren's staging of this theatrical relic boasts a juicy cast, but the play just lies there, like the corpse in the chest at center stage (2:05). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing today. (Isherwood)

'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

'THREE DOLLAR BILL' Three exhaustingly clever one-acts by Kirk Wood Bromley about being gay, conservative and miserable (2:00). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Flatiron district, fourth floor; (212) 501-4528, closing today. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)

'BE HERE TO LOVE ME' (No rating, 99 minutes) Margaret Brown's documentary biography of the brilliant, deeply troubled Texan singer-songwriter Townes Van Zandt is a tender, impressionistic labor of love. (Stephen Holden)

* 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Holden)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)

'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)

'ELECTRIC SHADOWS' (No rating, 99 minutes, in Mandarin) The fanciful Chinese tear-jerker, which spans several decades from the Cultural Revolution to the present, wants to be an Asian ''Cinema Paradiso,'' but doesn't quite live up to its prototype. (Holden)

'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)

'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warmhearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)

*'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK.' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'IN THE MIX' (PG-13, 97 minutes) This predictable, one-dimensional romantic comedy is all about its star, Usher, who plays a New York D.J. beloved by one and all. Beautiful women lust after him, but when a Mafia princess (Emmanuelle Chriqui) joins their number, her mobster father (Chazz Palminteri) disapproves. Even though Darrell (Usher) once took a bullet for him. (Anita Gates)

'ISN'T THIS A TIME!: A TRIBUTE TO HAROLD LEVENTHAL' (No rating, 90 minutes) Jim Brown's touching documentary cuts between onstage musical numbers and behind-the-scenes recollections from the Weavers; Arlo Guthrie; Peter, Paul and Mary; and other folk musicians who organized and performed a Thanksgiving 2003 tribute concert to this distinguished manager and promoter, who helped establish their careers. (Laura Kern)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)

* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)

'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Boheme'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)

* 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)

GOV'T MULE (Thursday) Gov't Mule's guitarist and leader Warren Haynes brings the gravity of the blues and the rolling grooves of Southern rock together with the bleary determination of grunge.

(Sinagra)

KENNY ROGERS (Tonight) You would assume that the man famous for the countrified radio smash ''The Gambler'' knows when to fold 'em. Evidently that time has yet to come. This is a show with a holiday theme, but it will hopefully still include the singalong recrimination ''Lucille'' and the casual tale of gnarly violence ''Coward of the County.'' 8 p.m., North Fork Theater at Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800; $51.50.

ULTRAMAGNETIC MC's (Tonight) The Bronx rap group Ultramagnetic MC's, founded by the shape-shifting rapper Kool Keith with Ced Gee and DJ Moe Love, was a critical hit in the late 80's, helping to nudge old-school dozens-playing forward with imaginative grooves and space-is-the-place lyrics. 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006; $15 in advance, $20 at the door.

WHAT I LIKE ABOUT JEW (Tomorrow and Sunday) The cabaret-rock comedians Sean Altman and Rob Tannenbaum might be giants of Jewish joke-pop, but you can also hear some Beatles in their risque borscht-belting -- not to mention a reverence for tradition that always holds up to their wacky auto-critiques.

 Opera

'AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Tobias Picker's much-anticipated opera, based on Theodore Dreiser's landmark 1925 novel, a rare Metropolitan Opera commission, breaks no new ground for musical originality and dramatic inventiveness. This is an unabashedly conventional melodrama. Whole stretches of Mr. Picker's Neo-Romantic score would not be out of place on Broadway. Still, with an effective libretto by Gene Scheer that reduces the 900-page novel to its essential narrative strands, ''An American Tragedy'' has its own kind of sweep and passion. And every time Mr. Picker summons his modernist vein, the music becomes more challenging and consequently more involving. The production by Francesca Zambello, with its three-tiered set, is impressive to see and flows deftly. And the cast could not be better, with the dashing baritone Nathan Gunn as Clyde Griffiths, the ambitious social-climber, the soprano Patricia Racette as the wistful factory worker Roberta, and the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham as the moneyed and dazzling Sondra. James Conlon conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220.(Anthony Tommasini)

'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Monday, Thursday and Dec. 31) Most stagings of Strauss's ever-popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and fresh performance. And with the masterful comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailor Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act Two. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Dec. 31 at 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $250. (Tommasini)

'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Tonight) On opening night of the Met's revival of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' in late October the admirable American soprano Elizabeth Futral gave a vocally top-notch and sensitive performance of the touchstone title role. Still, determined to sing this daunting role with musicianly honesty, she seemed reticent to plumb the emotional recesses of this unstable and fascinating character. So it should be interesting to hear her Lucia now that she has gotten the jitters out and lived with the role in Nicolas Joel's production. The veteran Bel Canto tenor Ramon Vargas sings Edgardo. Edoardo Muller conducts. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $36 to $205. (Tommasini)

'THE MERRY WIDOW' (Tonight and tomorrow) The tiny Amato Opera can pick up on a holiday tradition with the best of them. For the 100th anniversary of Franz Lehar's classic operetta, it's offering the piece in a new English translation. 7:30 p.m., Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200; $30, $25 for students and 65+.(Anne Midgette)

Classical Music

BARGEMUSIC (Tomorrow) Seasonal music is in the eye, or ear, of the beholder. And to hear Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations in their entirety performed by a skilled pianist, Steven Beck, seems a wonderful holiday present. 7:30 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083; $60. (Midgette)

'A BOHEMIAN CHRISTMAS' (Sunday) The Bohemians of the title are not funky artists, but residents of medieval Prague. The ensemble Early Music New York is offering a program of 13th- to 15th-century music from Bohemia and, incongruously, Poland; it isn't all Christmas music by any means, but it's a nicely organized program. 3 and 8 p.m., St. James Chapel, Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 110th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330; $40. (Midgette)

HANDEL'S 'MESSIAH' (Tonight) Andrew Megill leads the veteran Masterwork Chorus and Orchestra in the second of its two annual ''Messiah'' performances in Carnegie Hall. Julianne Baird, Margaret Lattimore, Philippe Castagner and Brian Mulligan are the soloists. This is typically a solid competitor in a crowded ''Messiah'' field. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $20 to $100.(Jeremy Eichler)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Lorin Maazel leads the orchestra in Sibelius's Fifth Symphony along with Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto with Julia Fischer as soloist and Weber's Bassoon Concerto with Judith LeClair. 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $92. (Eichler)

NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Every year around this time, the New York String Orchestra Seminar assembles talented young players from the nation's high schools and conservatories for 10 days of intensive rehearsals and coaching capped by two performances. First up is an all-Mozart program including the Overture to ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and the Piano Concerto No. 21 with Jonathan Biss as soloist. Next, on Wednesday, comes a more eclectic program ranging from Bach to Barber with Beethoven and Spohr in between. Hilary Hahn joins as soloist and Jaime Laredo conducts both nights. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800; $17 to $47. (Eichler)

P. D. Q. BACH (Tuesday through Thursday) Believe it or not, it's been 40 years since the composer and satirist Peter Schickele first ''discovered'' the music of his own creation, P. D. Q. Bach, whom he describes as ''the last and certainly the least of Johann Sebastian Bach's interminable children.'' Mr. Schickele marks the anniversary this week with three performances of his ''40-Year Retrogressive'' program, in which he'll reprise various P. D. Q. favorites while no doubt gleefully skewering the conventions of musicology and concert life along the way. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $26 to $56. (Eichler)

Art

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.

 Museums

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'OBSESSIVE DRAWING,' through March 19. In the museum's first ''emerging talent'' show, one of the five artists selected is 83, lives in a home for the elderly in Pennsylvania and stopped painting two years ago because of failing eyesight. Over all, the work in the exhibition is abstract and spare, giving the problematic outsider category a new spin. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040. (Holland Cotter)

Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)

Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Kyoto, Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)

* THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS,' through Dec. 31. Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick Collection. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two compact rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700. (Cotter)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberge. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Smith)

'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in a exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer, who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. through Feb. 19th (Grace Glueck)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)

* JEWISH MUSEUM: 'THE JEWISH IDENTITY PROJECT: NEW AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHY,' through Jan. 29. Who's Jewish, who isn't, and, by the way, what is a Jew, anyway? These are not easy questions, as this intense who-are-we exploration makes clear. Ten projects by 13 artists try to help break the stereotype of American Jews as uniformly white, middle class and of European descent. Using photography and video, the artists have interpreted their missions broadly, from the Korean-born Nikki S. Lee's meticulous staging of a Jewish wedding with herself as the bride, to Andrea Robbins and Max Becher's look at the thriving shtetl established by Lubavitcher Hasidic Jews in rural Postville, Iowa. (See above.) (Glueck)

* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT,' through Dec. 31. Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, seance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Michael Kimmelman)

* Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS,' through Dec. 31. Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

* Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siecle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Cotter)

* Museum of Modern Art: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,' through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculpted models by 80 artists, numerous projections and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that goes into them is nonetheless something of a wonder too. (See above.) (Smith)

* The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)

neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)

* New York Public Library: 'THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORD: MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS,' through Feb. 12. Few objects encapsulate their times like the exquisite full-service concentrations of text, image and decoration that are illuminated manuscripts, and few institutions in North America have as many great ones as New York City's favorite library. Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8069. (Smith)

* Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)

The Noguchi Museum: 'The Imagery of Chess Revisited,' through March 12. In 1944, the artists Max Ernst and Marcel Duchamp and the gallery director Julien Levy organized an attention-getting New York exhibition devoted to chess, once a chic pastime for members of the artistic intelligentsia. Organizers of this historically intriguing show managed to find most of the works that were in the original exhibition, including chess sets designed by the artists Isamu Noguchi, Alexander Calder and Man Ray. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088. (Johnson)

* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)

* Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

Charles Biederman: 'Works from the Thirties' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student he was of European Surrealism and Constructivism. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Richard Pousette-Dart: 'Presences: The Imploding of Color' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Galleries: 57th Street

Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

'Structure' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman among others comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Richard Walker: 'Beacon Road Paintings' Working on compact panels in a deft, painterly style that mixes influences of Alex Katz and Neil Welliver, this Scottish artist creates vividly atmospheric views of snowy woods and other quiet nature scenes. Alexander, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, through Dec. 30. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Abetz/Drescher The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic Pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentine who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israel-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of senior citizens' oversize bald heads based on members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort-of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith).

Paula Scher: 'The Maps' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)

Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through today. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

* JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending into a kind of rabbit hole on a ladder. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

Last Chance

CHARLES BURCHFIELD: 'PAINTINGS, 1915-1964,' The best landscapes of this underappreciated American modernist, seen here in a rare, well-selected survey of his watercolors, depict a natural world that is lighted from within. D. C. Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 247-2111, closing today. (Smith)

Dave Cooper: 'pictorial ruminations on the volume and density of mostly pillowy girls' Comically weird illustration is enjoying great popularity among artists under 40. The Ottawa-based Mr. Cooper is a master of the genre. His manically surrealistic paintings and drawings of toothy, pop-eyed women in hectic situations mix attraction and repulsion with infectious verve. Jonathan Levine, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-3822, closing today. (Johnson)

GEORGE GROSZ: 'HIS VISUAL AND THEATRICAL POLITICS' This small banquet of George Grosz's drawings from 1914 to 1930 -- before he came to the United States -- shows his work in two arenas, for publication and for the stage, at the height of his wit and moral indignation. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500, closing today. (Glueck)

Hans Haacke: 'State of the Union' People say that the days of politically minded art are over. The market, that monstrous sponge, absorbs and neutralizes all. But there may be at least one resistant margin left: uncoolness. Uncool art can do and say whatever it wants, because the market doesn't care. Hans Haacke's art has been doing and saying what it wants for 40 years. Sometimes his socially engaged Conceptualism is in synch with fashion; at other times, like now, it is not. But he keeps to his course, changing the forms, adjusting the themes, renewing the commitment. In this show he carries the case for art as political argument into the post-9/11 present. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, closing today.(Cotter)

Gwen Hardie: 'Face Paintings' Each of Ms. Hardie's quietly arresting, medium-size canvases depicts a much enlarged part of someone's face -- an eye, a nose, the top of a lip -- realized in thin layers of smudgy color. Detail is suppressed, and the paintings veer toward an evocatively blurry and enigmatic generalization that verges in some cases on abstraction. Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 947-2818, closing today. (Johnson)

BYRON KIM: 'ODDLY FLOWING' In this rambling show by an artist who made a splash in the early 1990's by comparing the skin tones of different people in monochromatic canvases, most interesting are the photographic assemblages under the rubric of ''What I See.'' These impressions of important places in his life, like the one of his backyard in Park Slope, Brooklyn, have a sweet, nostalgic poignancy. Each is the result of a 360-degree sweep with a digital camera, with the images reassembled into an intensified whole. They tweak the landscape in a lively fashion. But the show needs focus; the inclusion of other, unrelated works weakens its impact. Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 633-6999, closing today. (Glueck)

* Helen Levitt: 'Slide Show: Color Photographs 1959-1984' For some artists, Ms. Levitt is one, the camera is less an expertly operated tool than a seamless extension of mind, eye and heart. Made from slides, the 21 color pictures in this show of things happening in the street are small miracles of form, story-telling and metaphor. Laurence Miller, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 397-3930, closing today.(Johnson)

* Mary Ellen Mark: 'Falkland Road' When the American photographer Mary Ellen Mark started visiting India in the 1960's, she didn't head for the Taj Mahal. She hung out on a jammed and noisy street in Bombay called Falkland Road, the city's busiest low-rent red light district. Her goal was to photograph the prostitutes -- men and women, children and adults -- who lived and worked there. The complete series of pictures, exhibited only once before in the United States in 1981, is on view in two Chelsea galleries. The images are as startling and engrossing as ever. And with the devastating spread of AIDS in India since they were made, they are something more. Marianne Boesky Gallery and Yancy Richardson Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea. Boesky: (212) 680-9889; Richardson: (646) 230-9610, closing today. (Cotter)

TIM NOBLE & SUE WEBSTER: 'THE GLORY HOLE' The latest gimmickry from this British art team consists of metal scrap assemblages that conjure up 1950's junk sculptures and, properly lighted, cast shadows of the artists' faces or bodies in profile. Briefly diverting side-show humanism. Bortolami Dayan, 510 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2050, closing today. (Smith)

* Claes Oldenburg This excellent show of works from the 60's by this seminal Pop artist includes paint-splattered objects like oversize sneakers and a slice of pie a la mode and soft, stuffed objects like a toilet and a giant house key. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, closing today. (Johnson)

Lari Pittman New, weirdly antic pictures of domestic interiors rendered in a luminous, splintery Cubist style by this Los Angeles-based painter are visually captivating and poetically mysterious. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, closing today. (Johnson)

'Traffic' As usual for its big group exhibitions, Exit Art's current Biennial, this one devoted to the theme of traffic -- vehicular and otherwise -- is messy, youthful, noisy, crowded and entertaining. Highlights include a miniature model of a sidewalk construction site walkway by Chantel Foretich; portraits of 10 New York art dealers -- i.e., art traffic controllers -- by Tom Hebert; a finely made plywood tower mimicking a mold for pouring concrete highway bridge supports, by Mike Wsol; a set of ceramic train cars by David Packer; and many variously amusing, tedious and distracting videos. Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, closing today. (Johnson)

CY TWOMBLY: 'BACCHUS' Eight paintings deliver a red-hot visual tsunami via the artist's characteristic spiraling scribbles writ large across amazing, angry, joyful enveloping surfaces that are in the grand tradition of the aging painter letting it rip. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, closing today. (Smith)

REBECCA WARREN: 'PAS DE DEUX' A young British sculptor who works in unfired, sometimes painted clay, makes an impressive debut with sculptures that roam the history of sculpture and decorative objects with juicy abandon, sprouting snoutlike breasts and frazzled roses and culminating in large figures of dancers that split the difference between Degas and de Kooning, with a little Francis Bacon thrown in for good measure. Matthew Marks Gallery, 523 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, closing today at 3 p.m. (Smith).

HEADLINE: TRANSIT STRIKE ENDS ON 3RD DAY; FRAMEWORK FOR DEAL REACHED

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and SEWELL CHAN; Reporting for this article was contributed by Thomas J. Lueck, Conrad Mulcahy, Shadi Rahimi and Matthew Sweeney.

 BODY:
Thousands of New York City transit workers put down their picket signs and streamed into bus depots and railyards last night to restart the nation's largest transit system, after leaders of their union agreed to a tentative framework for a new contract and ended a 60-hour strike that hobbled the city.
 After three frenetic and frustrating days of carpooling, biking, roller skating and trudging to work in chilly temperatures, New Yorkers reacted joyfully to the news that the city's sprawling network of subways and buses would soon be running again.
 Transit officials said they expected the system to come haltingly back to life last night but be running at nearly full capacity by this morning's rush. Shortly after midnight, buses and subway trains were still not running, with the exception of a Bx15 bus that began its route from the Bronx to Harlem around 10:40 p.m. 
 ''I'm so happy,'' said Christine Grant, 34, of Rego Park, Queens, who bought a weekly MetroCard last Monday but never got to use it to commute to her job in Greenwich Village. ''You take things for granted until something like this happens, and then you realize how much you need the subway.''
 The abrupt return -- many strikers simply laid down their placards and walked into the buildings they had been picketing -- capped a day of fast-moving developments in a labor showdown that just a day before seemed headed for an intractable and ugly stalemate.
 Despite the end of the strike, a final settlement of the dispute remains to be reached. But officials hinted that in exchange for the union's ending the strike, the authority would significantly scale back or even abandon its insistence on less-generous pensions for future workers. In return, the union would consider having its members pay more for health insurance. The negotiations will now resume under an agreement among all parties not to speak with reporters.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the union's decision, a state judge postponed a hearing that could have seen union leaders jailed, and many workers expressed relief that the strike was over.
 ''In 21 years as a transit worker, this has probably been one of the best days of my life,'' said Dennis H. Boyd, a train operator and member of the union's executive board, who voted to end the strike. ''The membership wanted to make a statement, they wanted to go to battle with the M.T.A., and we fulfilled that.''
 The strike -- the city's first transit walkout in a quarter-century -- paralyzed New York's mass transit system at the height of the holiday season, devastating sales for retailers, enraging the mayor and governor and making it hellishly difficult for New Yorkers to get to jobs, schools and doctors' appointments.
 Yesterday, Mayor Bloomberg took a more conciliatory tone toward union leaders than he had in previous days, but reserved his most voluble praise for the residents who had had to contend with major disruptions. ''This was really a very big test of our city,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It's fair to say we passed with flying colors. It wasn't easy and certainly serious economic harm was inflicted and we did what we had to do to make the city run.''
 As buses began to warm up last night and workers went about the complex task of bringing the subway system back to life -- inspecting tracks, testing brakes, restoring power -- the mood could not have been more different than it was 24 hours earlier, when many signs suggested the strike could be a long one.
 On Wednesday, Roger Toussaint, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, had traded barbs with Mayor Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki from afar as all three drew what seemed to be deeper lines in the sand. Mr. Toussaint said he would agree to talk only if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would remove the nettlesome issue of pensions from the negotiations; Governor Pataki said no talks could take place until the strike ended.
 But behind the scenes, both sides were meeting with state mediators. At 2 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Toussaint arrived at the Grand Hyatt hotel, where negotiations had been taking place, suggesting major progress was occurring.
 Three state mediators held an 11 a.m. news conference that gave subway-less New Yorkers their first reasons for hope in days. 
 The mediators said the union's leadership had indicated they would send strikers back to work after accepting the preliminary framework in which the transportation authority hinted it might take off the table the main obstacle to a settlement -- its demands that future workers pay 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions. 
 As part of that framework, the union agreed to negotiate having transit workers pay more for their health coverage to offset the money the authority would lose by relinquishing its pension proposals. 
 The mediators, led by Richard A. Curreri, director of conciliation for the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, said they expected the two sides to engage in intense negotiations to reach an overall settlement, hopefully in the next few days.
 ''An agreement remains out of the parties' reach at this time,'' the three mediators said in a statement. ''It is clear to us, however, that both parties have a genuine desire to resolve their differences. In the best interests of the public, which both parties serve, we have suggested, and they have agreed, to resume negotiations while the T.W.U. takes steps toward returning its membership to work.''
 ''The M.T.A.,'' the mediators continued, ''has informed us that it has not withdrawn its pension proposals, but nevertheless is willing to discuss whether adequate savings may be found in the area of health costs.''
 Two officials close to the talks, one on the authority's side and one on the union's, said the authority would soon take its pension demands off the table. 
 Around 2:30 p.m., the union's executive board voted 36 to 5 to end the strike. Two members abstained. A half hour later, Mr. Toussaint, low-keyed in contrast to the defiant tone he took on Wednesday, told reporters and union members gathered in the cold: ''I'm pleased to announce that the Local 100 executive board just voted overwhelmingly to direct transit workers to return to work immediately and to resume bus and subway service throughout the five boroughs of New York City, and we thank riders for their patience and forbearance.''
 As soon as Mr. Toussaint made his 3 p.m. announcement, many of the union's 33,700 members put down their picket signs and began heading to bus depots and subway yards. 
 Even though the strike violated a state law barring walkouts by public employees, many New Yorkers backed the union in its fight with the authority, even as many others cursed the union. As a result of the strike, the union faces a $3 million fine while individual strikers face loss of two days' pay for each day on strike.
 Justice Theodore T. Jones of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn had fined the union $1 million a day and originally threatened to have Mr. Toussaint jailed yesterday. Reacting to the end of the walkout, however, he adjourned hearings for a criminal contempt order and the possible jailing and set a new hearing for Jan. 20. He also has the power to alter the fine.
 ''I am pleased on behalf of the people of the City of New York, and indeed hopeful that we will be able to salvage Christmas,'' Justice Jones said.
 Mayor Bloomberg said that as of today the city would end its emergency plan that allowed taxis to carry multiple fares at flat rates, increased ferry service and barred cars with fewer than four passengers from entering Manhattan south of 96th Street during the morning rush. 
 The agreement's framework seemed carefully designed to allow everyone to save face.
 After Governor Pataki said the authority should not negotiate until the union ended its walkout, the agreement allowed him to save face because the final negotiations would not take place until the strikers returned to work.
 After Mr. Toussaint said the strikers would not return to their jobs unless the authority took its pension demands off the table, the agreement allows him to save face because the framework hints strongly that the authority will soon drop its pension demand.
 And the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, can save face because he can maintain that the authority has not entirely scuttled its pension proposal in response to the union's demand.
 While many workers seemed relieved to return to their jobs, there was at least a small undercurrent of anger directed at the strike's result.
 ''I'm very disappointed to have to come back now. I think we should have held out,'' said Larry Powell, 55, who was returning to work at the 239th Street maintenance shop in the Bronx. ''I feel bad. I don't know what we got.''
 He also said he was unhappy about being fined two days' pay for every day he was on strike, adding: ''I do not want to go back to work without a contract.''
 Governor Pataki did not soften his tone, saying that judges could not grant amnesty to erase the individual fines faced by workers. With transit workers' base pay averaging $900 a week, being fined two days' pay for each day of the strike would cost them $1,080 each on average.
 Mr. Pataki said: ''I think that there's a lesson to be learned from this: no one is above the law. You break the law and the consequences are real.''
 Before the negotiations collapsed late Monday night, the authority increased its wage offer to a 3 percent raise the first year, 4 percent the second and 3.5 percent the third year. It also dropped its demand to raise the retirement age for future workers to 62, from 55 for current workers. But it added a demand that new workers pay 6 percent of their earnings toward their pensions, up from 2 percent for current workers.
 The authority also agreed to make Martin Luther King's Birthday a holiday, and it dropped its demand that future workers pay 1 percent of their wages toward health premiums. The union's current workers do not pay premiums for their basic health plan. 
 Mr. Toussaint has said he would steadfastly oppose having workers pay health premiums.
 Jose Orjuela, 36, a preproduction manager for a cinema advertising firm in midtown, walked to work this week from his home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He celebrated the end of the strike.
 ''We were all freaking out when we heard,'' he said. ''It was huge. We were just relieved it was all over.''

HEADLINE: As Medicaid Rolls Grow, Costs Take a Local Toll

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: ELMIRA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
In the last three years, Chemung County has raised taxes and laid off workers. It has closed libraries and cut arts programs. Now, to help balance the budget, it will more than double the capacity of the landfill that everyone hoped would soon close.
 This thinly populated rural county is one of dozens that have been driven to financial desperation by the rapidly rising cost of Medicaid, the government health plan for the poor.
''Libraries aren't mandated, and Medicaid is,'' said Glenice Molter, formerly the head librarian at the Southside branch, which closed two years ago so the county could pay its Medicaid bills. ''When you have to decide where your money is going to go, it's not really a choice.''
 Medicaid is a growing burden in every state, but only New York requires local government to pay a large share of the cost. This year, counties and New York City will pay about $6.6 billion, 15 percent of the state's Medicaid budget, which is the largest in the country. The crisis is most serious in counties upstate, which lack a broad tax base but have a growing Medicaid population. 
 ''This is our single biggest headache,'' said Michael G. Breslin, the Albany County executive, ''a constant, unmanageable burden that's been absolutely and totally out of our control.''
 The counties also bear their share of the billions of Medicaid dollars lost each year to fraud and waste, increasing the frustration of local officials critical of the state for inadequate monitoring of its spending.
 Several counties have raised property taxes more than 40 percent over the last three years; Albany County's went up by more than 70 percent. Other counties have cut services: Chautauqua County has reduced the number of sheriff's deputies and bus routes. Oswego County sold its nursing home and cut its work force by 16 percent. Niagara County eliminated 96 jobs this year alone. 
 The upstate counties have become the victims of a plan that originated when Medicaid began 40 years ago but has since backfired on them. At the time, upstate lawmakers did not want to subsidize health care for the many poor people in New York City, who have long constituted two-thirds of the Medicaid rolls, so they supported a deal to transfer some of the cost from the state to local governments.
 With the greatest costs imposed on New York City, for years the price to upstate counties seemed high but tolerable. But in the last few years, the Medicaid rolls upstate and around New York have swelled sharply, as the state expanded eligibility and the number of jobs offering health insurance shrank. The Medicaid bills have grown quickly for counties that were also squeezed by a sluggish upstate economy, as family farms closed and industrial towns like Elmira lost mainstays like typewriter and picture tube factories. 
 In this small industrial city 230 miles northwest of New York City, as well as the surrounding area along the northern Pennsylvania border, the number of people on Medicaid has soared, and so has the cost of caring for them. The county's Medicaid bill this year will come to $18.5 million -- nearly equal to the total the county raises in property taxes. The program consumes almost one-fifth of the county's budget, among the highest percentages in the state.
 In the suburbs of New York City, political leaders like Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, have been among the most vocal about proclaiming a Medicaid emergency. But in fact, their counties have suffered less than the rest of the state. The downstate suburbs are affluent areas, with a smaller percentage of people on Medicaid. 
 New York City has the heaviest Medicaid enrollment and expenses, but it also has larger sources of revenue -- and many more sources over all -- to pay for it all. Medicaid costs represent less than 10 percent of the city's budget.
 The decision to share the Medicaid burden with counties and New York City has had a significant effect on which residents pay more for the system. Tapping local taxes for a share of Medicaid allows residents of the downstate suburbs and wealthy New Yorkers to pay less than they would if state taxes covered the entire bill. And it forces New York City residents, and low- and middle-income people, to pay more.
 That is because state taxes are primarily based on income, and thus require the wealthy to pay a larger share, while localities use sales and property taxes, which tend to require the middle class and the poor to pay a higher proportion of their income. 
 Forcing counties to shoulder part of the burden also insulates state lawmakers from some of the effects of their decisions. Local officials say it also reduces the incentive for Albany to rein in spending on Medicaid, for which the federal government pays half. Lawmakers can now devote more money to other programs without raising taxes, even as Medicaid starves local governments. 
 In the last year, the state has shifted some expenses away from local governments. But those measures will only slow the rate at which the counties' problem grows.
 Left with increasingly dire choices, county leaders like Thomas J. Santulli, the Chemung County executive, have tried to take matters into their own hands. They have orchestrated campaigns to pressure state legislators, publicly criticizing lawmakers they ordinarily hesitate to cross.
 And, frustrated that the state does little to combat waste and fraud, Mr. Santulli, Mr. Suozzi and others are trying to wrest some of those functions away from the state and police the program themselves.

Library Books or Medical Care?
 Elmira's Southside library branch used to teem with life, despite its location in a struggling neighborhood across the Chemung River from downtown. Elementary school students trooped in for story hours. Residents from a nearby apartment building for the elderly browsed the large-print book collection. High school students surfed the Internet and pecked out reports on computers with high-speed connections.
 But for the past two years, the library has been empty. A ''closed'' sign marks the front entrance; the parking spaces in back go unoccupied; trash is strewn in the rear courtyard.
 ''It was a community library in every sense, in the most economically depressed area of the city that needed it most, and it was taken away from the community,'' said Ms. Molter, the former head librarian. ''Literally, the saddest day of my life was when they locked the door for the last time at Southside. I cried.''
 The library, which opened in the 1940's, is one of many casualties of rising Medicaid costs, whose ripple effect has been felt in large and small ways throughout this working-class community. It was one of two libraries closed to save $250,000 to help the county pay its Medicaid bills.
 ''I get frustrated when the State Legislature imposes a program and assigns a cost to localities without fully funding those programs,'' said James Sleeth, director of Chemung County's library system. ''It's the same old story: unfunded or underfunded mandates.''
 The number of Chemung County residents on Medicaid has grown by more than half in the last five years, to 20 percent of the population, driven in part by an expansion of eligibility but also by the area's economic struggles. Many of the adults on Medicaid work, albeit in low paying jobs, Mr. Santulli said.
 ''They don't have health insurance,'' he said, ''and they need some type of help.'' 
 Chemung County's Medicaid spending has nearly doubled since 2000, to $18.5 million this year, a crushing burden on a county that has had factories and businesses leave in the droves, crippling its tax base. 
 To cover the rising costs, county officials began slashing services. In a region with few cultural offerings, the county's grants for them were nearly eliminated, including money for the local art museum, the performing arts center and the historical society, and about a tenth of county employees lost their jobs.
 The county raised property taxes 14 percent in 2003 and 6 percent last year; it also increased the sales tax to 8 percent, from 7 percent in 2002. And to raise still more revenue, county officials made perhaps their most unpopular move, voting earlier this year to privatize and significantly expand Chemung's landfill, in a rural area on the county's southern border.
 Many residents in the area had hoped the landfill would close, but county officials decided to drastically increase the amount of trash that can be brought in -- to 280,000 tons a year from about 120,000 -- and to turn it over to a private operator, in return for nearly $100 million in lease payments over the next 25 years. 
 ''We did it for an opportunity to help our revenue stream other than just taxing people,'' Mr. Santulli said. 
 Residents blame the landfill for health problems -- they believe their wells are contaminated -- and they predict that things will only get worse. 
 Candy L. Wagner, 33, stood outside her home next to the landfill recently and counted 28 trucks rumbling through the front gate in a half-hour. She no longer lets her three young children drink their tap water. Instead, she buys 30 cases of water every month. She and her husband would like to move but have despaired about finding someone willing to buy their home.
 ''Who are you going to sell it to?'' she said. 

An Old Mistrust
 The hardship that Chemung and other counties face today has its roots in the long-running wariness of New York City in the rest of the state.
 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller and the Legislature drew up the most expansive Medicaid program in the nation in 1966, with liberal standards for eligibility and coverage. Lawmakers knew that the expense could be crippling.
 They also knew, from experience with earlier programs, that most of the money would be spent in New York City. Advocates of a generous approach to Medicaid had to overcome the view in other parts of New York that the city was a sinkhole of welfare and corruption, bleeding the state of money.
 ''The legislators from the rest of the state were never going to agree to pay the entire tab for something that was disproportionately about New York City,'' said James R. Tallon Jr., president of United Hospital Fund, a bipartisan health care research group, and a former assemblyman from Binghamton.
 Albany's answer was to require New York City to help pay the bills for its own residents. The city already spent heavily on public hospitals and clinics for the poor, and state lawmakers reasoned that Medicaid would take over many of those city services. Therefore, they decided, the city could and should help pay for Medicaid. It followed that other counties with far fewer poor people would also be required to pay a share of Medicaid costs, but upstate county officials were quickly surprised by how many of their residents signed up for the program, and by the cost.
 The city and the counties pay for about 15 percent of the state's $44.5 billion program, an arrangement without parallel in any other state. More than half the states do not mandate any local contribution, and those that do demand much less than New York.
 From the start, the system benefited people in the suburban counties downstate, where there were fewer people and lower Medicaid bills than in other parts of the state, and a greater ability to pay. That remains true today: ten percent of the people in those counties are on Medicaid, compared with 15 percent upstate, 20 percent in Chemung, and 34 percent in the city. Yet even for Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, Medicaid has grown into a major burden, more than $800 million a year.
 The downstate suburbs are the most affluent region of the state, so their residents pay a disproportionately large share of state taxes. But when it comes to the Medicaid costs charged to local governments, suburbanites pay less, per person, than the state average.
 If the local Medicaid costs were paid instead by state taxes, residents of the downstate suburbs would pay about $300 a year more, per person, according to an analysis by The New York Times. New York City residents would pay about $200 less, and upstate New Yorkers would pay about $60 more. But county governments would have far more money for other programs, or they could cut taxes, or both.
 Though counties have complained about their Medicaid bills for years, they did not begin to see the matter as a crisis until the 2001 recession and its aftermath. As the number of people living in poverty and lacking health insurance grew steadily, and as the state made it easier to sign up, Medicaid enrollment around the state and in Chemung grew by 55 percent in five years. Medical expenses like prescription drug prices also rose quickly.
 This year, the 57 counties outside New York City will spend more than $2 billion on Medicaid -- twice as much as in the late 1990's, when they were in much better financial shape. The downstate suburban counties spend 12 percent of their budgets on Medicaid, while the upstate counties spend an average of 17 percent. In Chemung, it is 19 percent.
 ''For us,'' said Mr. Santulli, the Chemung County executive, ''Medicaid has gone very quickly from a problem, to a big problem, to a disaster.''
 Leaders in state government generally do not defend the cost-sharing system, which was in place long before current officeholders arrived. State Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Nassau County who is chairman of the Health Committee, acknowledged that a total state takeover of Medicaid costs would mean that his constituents would pay much more.
 But he said the current system did serve a real purpose, because the counties screen Medicaid applicants. Having them contribute to the cost, he said, ''provides an incentive to be careful as to who gets on the rolls.''

Pushing for a New Role
 Earlier this year, Mr. Santulli erected a billboard with a giant thermometer in front of his county courthouse.
 ''I wanted to put my face on top and have it explode when it reached the top,'' he said of the thermometer, which tracked Chemung County's annual Medicaid bills. 
 Mr. Santulli has also circulated petitions, held rallies and set up an information booth at the local mall, all to raise awareness of the impact of rising Medicaid costs. He tried at one point to take over management of Medicaid prescription drug costs in the county, but Albany never gave its permission. Now Mr. Santulli is trying again to solve the problem on his own, peddling a radical proposal to permit counties like his to take over the duties of managing and policing the program. 
 ''The state should be doing this, frankly, not us,'' he said. ''But since they aren't, we're going to.''
 Under pressure from county officials this year, the State Legislature finally passed a cap on local Medicaid costs. The cap holds the growth of county Medicaid to a certain set rate, but the costs will continue to be a significant burden for counties for years to come.
 Mr. Santulli's latest proposal stems from a chance meeting at the mall. Guy Amisano, a local businessman, approached Mr. Santulli and told him that his company, Salient Technologies, had a software program that he thought might be useful for discovering cost savings in Medicaid. Intrigued, Mr. Santulli agreed to pay Salient about $50,000 to adapt the software to Medicaid. 
 Salient's software allowed Chemung to see where its money was being spent, and the results were often startling. The county learned, for instance, that just three doctors accounted for 14 percent of the entire county's prescription drug spending last year, and that $1.8 million was spent last year in the county on brand-name drugs when a generic equivalent was available.
 Analysts at Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, an upstate health insurer, have told the county that cracking down on this kind of spending would save the county millions of dollars, Mr. Santulli said.
 The state has previously refused to allow county officials to scrutinize and punish doctors, pharmacies and others in their areas, even as it struggles with its own failure to combat fraud and waste. But now, in the face of rising frustration among county officials, the State Health Department has agreed to begin a pilot program in which about 10 counties would be allowed to investigate their own fraud allegations.
 The state would make all final determinations, but Robert C. Kenny, a spokesman for the department, said the county participation could expand the program's ability to prevent fraud and abuse. 
 Mr. Santulli wants Albany to go even further and make Chemung County a test case, allowing it to use a private health insurer to administer its Medicaid program, under the belief that the company would run it far more efficiently than the state. Mr. Kenny said the department would meet with Chemung officials to discuss the idea. But if drastic change is not on the way, Mr. Santulli warned, the situation will only get worse for counties. 
 ''If we don't fight for ourselves,'' he said, ''nobody's going to fight for us.''

HEADLINE: Microsoft Facing Fines In Europe 

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
The European Commission turned up the heat yesterday on Microsoft, the world's largest software company, threatening to fine it more than $2 million a day unless it agrees to share more technical information with competitors.
 The commission's warning is the latest salvo in its increasingly acrimonious dispute with Microsoft over just what the company must do to comply with a 2004 antitrust ruling by the European Union. But the move also points to the growing gap between the antitrust policies of the United States and Europe.
''Europe is taking a much more robust view of what government's role should be in restoring competition than in the United States,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University in Washington. 
 Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the Bush administration, reached in 2001, required the company to share information with competitors. The settlement, some antitrust specialists say, did little to restrain Microsoft or to foster competition.
 ''The settlement began as an effort to ban Microsoft's most anticompetitive practices but finished so laden with loopholes as to be ineffective,'' said Timothy Bresnahan, a former chief economist in the antitrust division of the Justice Department during the Clinton administration.
 The European position goes further in trying to ensure that the data-serving software made by rivals can work as easily with Microsoft's desktop operating system as Microsoft's server software does.
 The commission said Microsoft failed to live up to its agreement, and called the documentation it provided ''totally unfit at this stage for its intended purpose.''
 Neelie Kroes, the European antitrust commissioner, said in a statement, ''I have given Microsoft every opportunity to comply with its obligations. However, I have been left with no alternative,'' other than to threaten fines and send the company a fourth set of formal charges -- a record in a single case.
 Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, called the commission's move unjustified. In Microsoft's view, the commission seeks not merely to make sure that rivals can compete equally in the market for server software, but also to force Microsoft to give up its proprietary technology for Windows. Such a step, according to Microsoft, amounts to confiscation of its intellectual property, which would allow rivals to make copycat products. 
 ''Of particular concern,'' Mr. Smith said, ''is the commission's latest demand that internal workings of Windows be documented and licensed, which can open the door to the production of clones of Windows.'' 
 Some trade specialists regard the commission's tough stance on Microsoft, combined with its investigations of Intel and Qualcomm, as part of the trend in Brussels to use antitrust measures to pursue a policy of managed competition.
 Alan P. Larson, a former under secretary of state in the Bush administration who is a senior adviser to Covington & Burling, a Washington-based law firm whose clients include Microsoft, said he was concerned by what he regarded as an increasing tendency by European regulators to try ''to shape and manage outcomes in the economy.''
 Microsoft has until Jan. 25, 2006, to respond to the fresh set of charges. If its response is found insufficient, and that judgment is backed by the member states of the European Union, the daily fines of as much as 2 million euros, or $2.37 million, would be calculated starting Dec. 15.
 In March 2004, the European Commission issued an antitrust ruling that ordered Microsoft to pay a fine of more than $600 million, offer a version of Windows without its media player and share more technical information with competitors.
 Since then, the American companies that had complained to European regulators, including Sun Microsystems, a competitor in the server software market, and RealNetworks, which makes media player software, have reached antitrust settlements in their private suits against Microsoft. They are no longer active in the European case.
 After lengthy negotiations, Microsoft began offering in Europe earlier this year a version of its desktop operating system, called Windows XP N, without the software for playing music and videos on the PC. No computer makers have asked to license this version of Windows XP, Microsoft said, and retail sales of Windows XP N have been few.
 Now, the commission's focus of enforcement is on fostering competition in the market for server operating systems. The technology disclosure steps in the European order are intended to make sure Microsoft cannot use its dominant position in desktop software -- Windows holds more than 90 percent of the market -- to give it an unfair advantage and stifle competition in the server market.
 In the server market, Microsoft competes against companies like I.B.M., Sun and Hewlett-Packard, which sell versions of the Unix operating system. But more and more, Microsoft's competitor is the Linux system, which is distributed free.
 According to IDC, a research firm, Microsoft holds more than 60 percent of the server market worldwide, measured by number of programs installed. Linux is becoming increasingly popular, with 12 percent of the market, including only those copies distributed by commercial Linux vendors. If the free copies are included, the number of Linux programs in use is far higher, analysts say.
 ''The free software companies are the last competitors that have a chance to compete with Microsoft in the server software market,'' said Volker Lendecke, a co-founder of SerNet, a German company that supports free software like Linux.

HEADLINE: The Tax-Cut Zombies

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
If you want someone to play Scrooge just before Christmas, Dick Cheney is your man. On Wednesday Mr. Cheney, acting as president of the Senate, cast the tie-breaking vote in favor of legislation that increases the fees charged to Medicaid recipients, lets states cut Medicaid benefits, reduces enforcement funds for child support, and more.
 For all its cruelty, however, the legislation will make only a tiny dent in the budget deficit: the cuts total about $8 billion a year, or one-third of 1 percent of total federal spending. 
So ended 2005, the year that killed any remaining rationale for continuing tax cuts. But the hunger for tax cuts refuses to die.
 Since the 1970's, conservatives have used two theories to justify cutting taxes. One theory, supply-side economics, has always been hokum for the yokels. Conservative insiders adopted the supply-siders as mascots because they were useful to the cause, but never took them seriously.
 The insiders' theory -- what we might call the true tax-cut theory -- was memorably described by David Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget director, as ''starving the beast.'' Proponents of this theory argue that conservatives should seek tax cuts not because they won't create budget deficits, but because they will. Starve-the-beasters believe that budget deficits will lead to spending cuts that will eventually achieve their true aim: shrinking the government's role back to what it was under Calvin Coolidge.
 True to form, the insiders aren't buying the supply-siders' claim that a partial recovery in federal tax receipts from their plunge between 2000 and 2003 shows that all's well on the fiscal front. (Revenue remains lower, and the federal budget deeper in deficit, than anyone expected a few years ago.) Instead, conservative heavyweights are using the budget deficit to call for cuts in key government programs. 
 For example, in 2001 Alan Greenspan urged Congress to cut taxes to avoid running an excessively large budget surplus. Now he issues dire warnings about ''fiscal instability.'' But rather than urging Congress to reverse the tax cuts he helped sell, he talks of the need to cut future Social Security and Medicare benefits.
 Yet at this point starve-the-beast theory looks as silly as supply-side economics. Although a disciplined conservative movement has controlled Congress and the White House for five years -- and presided over record deficits -- public opposition has prevented any significant cuts in the big social-insurance programs that dominate domestic spending. 
 In fact, two years ago the Bush administration actually pushed through a major expansion in Medicare. True, the prescription drug bill clearly wasn't written by liberals. To a significant extent it's a giveaway to drug companies rather than a benefit for retirees. But all that corporate welfare makes the program more expensive, not less. 
 Conservative intellectuals had high hopes that this year President Bush would make up for this betrayal of their doctrine by dealing a death blow to Social Security as we know it. Indeed, he tried. His proposed ''reform'' would, over time, have essentially phased out the program. And he seemed to have everything going for him: momentum from an election victory, control of Congress and a highly sympathetic punditocracy. Yet the drive for privatization quickly degenerated from a juggernaut into a farce.
 Medicaid, whose recipients are less likely to vote than the average person getting Social Security or Medicare, is the softest target among major federal social-insurance programs. But even members of Congress, it seems, have consciences. (Well, some of them.) It took intense arm-twisting from the Republican leadership, and that tie-breaking vote by Mr. Cheney, to ram through even modest cuts in aid to the neediest.
 In other words, the starve-the-beast theory -- like missile defense -- has been tested under the most favorable possible circumstances, and failed. So there is no longer any coherent justification for further tax cuts. 
 Yet the cuts go on. In fact, even as Congressional leaders struggled to pass a tiny package of mean-spirited spending cuts, they pushed forward with a much larger package of tax cuts. The benefits of those cuts, as always, will go disproportionately to the wealthy.
 Here's how I see it: Republicans have turned into tax-cut zombies. They can't remember why they originally wanted to cut taxes, they can't explain how they plan to make up for the lost revenue, and they don't care. Instead, they just keep shambling forward, always hungry for more.

HEADLINE: Kuwait to Pour More Money Into China Oil

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Kuwait is planning a major investment in China's oil industry, its energy minister said Thursday, on top of a deal already being negotiated to build a $5 billion refinery and petrochemical plant in southern China. 
 ''We think we can support two major projects in China,'' the minister, Sheik Ahmad Fahd al-Sabah, said on a visit here Thursday. Kuwait is evaluating a range of proposals from possible Chinese partners.
Sheik Ahmad, who is also president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, also held that organization's first talks with Chinese leaders on Thursday. He and Adnan Shihab-Eldin, OPEC's acting secretary general, are expected to concentrate on increasing OPEC's exports to China.
 Some industry analysts say they believe that major OPEC producers, including Kuwait, will seek to use investment in China's refineries to secure market share at a time when Russia is also competing to supply China, the world's second-biggest oil importer after the United States.
 ''There is a lot of potential for China to import more crude oil from Russia,'' said Ma Shang, an analyst in Beijing with Fitch Ratings.
 China and Kuwait signed a preliminary agreement on Dec. 5 to build a $5 billion refinery and petrochemical plant in Guangdong Province. Sheik Ahmad said negotiations were continuing with PetroChina and the Guangdong provincial government on the terms of a deal.
 The refinery is expected to have a daily capacity of 200,000 barrels to 400,000 barrels, according to the Kuwaiti News Agency.
 Sheik Ahmad said OPEC and the Beijing authorities had agreed on Thursday to work together to secure energy supplies and assess Chinese demand. With OPEC supplying about 40 percent of the world's oil, soaring demand from China has become a major factor in the group's planning for production.
 China's oil imports have risen at an annual average of 24 percent in the last decade, after being a net oil exporter until 1993. Of the 6.7 million barrels of oil a day that China consumed in 2004, almost half came from imports. The United States imported about 10 million barrels a day in 2004.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Gains; Unemployment Claims Fall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22 

 BODY:
Consumers increased spending moderately in November even though the growth in their incomes slowed a bit, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
 Personal spending rose by 0.3 percent last month, slightly below the 0.4 percent gain Wall Street had been expecting. 
 Incomes rose by 0.3 percent last month, in line with expectations.
 In other economic news, a closely watched gauge of future economic activity posted a solid increase in November, helped by improving labor conditions. The Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose by 0.5 percent last month, after a 1 percent increase in October.
 Seven of the 10 indicators that make up the index showed signs of strength in November, led by declines in the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits.
 In a third report, the Labor Department reported that unemployment claims fell to 318,000 last week, down by 13,000 from the previous week.
 The total claims included 1,400 related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma, bringing total job losses from the three storms to 603,600.
 The report on incomes and spending had good news on inflation. An inflation gauge tied to personal consumption fell by 0.4 percent, the biggest one-month decline on record. Excluding food and energy, inflation was up 0.1 percent in November.
 For the last 12 months, inflation excluding food and energy has risen 1.8 percent, the best performance since March 2004, while overall inflation is up 2.7 percent.
 The personal consumption inflation index is favored by the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates 13 times since mid-2004 in an effort to make sure that rising energy prices do not spill over into more widespread inflation problems.
 The 0.3 percent rise in incomes came after a stronger 0.5 percent gain in October. Income growth last month was supported by a sharp rebound in job growth. Businesses added 215,000 workers after two weak months in which there were many job layoffs in the Gulf Coast states affected by the hurricanes.
 The 0.3 percent rise in consumer spending was an even larger 0.7 percent gain when inflation was factored out. That inflation-adjusted increase was the biggest rise since a 1.1 percent jump in July, a month when consumers spent heavily on new car purchases in response to discount offers.
 Disposable incomes, the amount Americans have to spend after paying taxes, rose by 0.3 percent in November, after a 0.4 percent increase in October.
 The savings rate, the amount left over after spending and taxes, remained in negative territory in November at minus 0.2 percent, the same as October. That meant that consumers were dipping into savings or borrowing to finance spending.
 The economy grew at a 4.1 percent rate in the July-September quarter, the best showing in 1.5 years, but economists are looking for growth to slow significantly in the final three months of this year, reflecting a slowdown in consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Saying R Word (Rebuilding) Is Step 1 for Knicks

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Greenburgh, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THIS is what 6-18 sounds like on the day after another home-court defeat, after being walloped senseless by the defending champion Spurs, in a season fast deteriorating beyond repair, on Isiah Thomas's second anniversary of being named the president of the Knicks.
 ''You want me on the wall?'' Thomas said yesterday before delivering his state of the union. 
 Ready. Aim. Explain.
 For the record, Thomas didn't back up; he stood firmly on the sideline of the practice court and by the statement he made last week on a local radio show, when he graded himself an incomplete for the work he had done to date. 
 Yes, he came to New York believing he could reinvent the Knicks in the time it took Stephon Marbury to fly home from Phoenix, and he bought into the longtime belief that burning down the mission and starting anew risked having Woody Allen and friends in the waiter-service seats go bananas.
 No, his lightning overhaul of Scott Layden's legacy didn't work, he said, primarily because Allan Houston's knee never healed, dooming an attempt to create a backcourt in the image of the Thomas-Joe Dumars-Vinnie Johnson threesome of the late 1980's Pistons. 
 Hence, the recent admission by the Knicks that they are, in their sixth season after the departure of Patrick Ewing, finally in a state of rebuilding, largely around ''two bigs,'' in Thomas-speak, meaning Eddy Curry, 23, and Channing Frye, 22.
 ''I like what we have,'' Thomas said. ''Now it's a matter of dealing with the tough times, being patient and being able to add to it.''
 Agree with his evaluation or not, the mere enunciation of the once-dreaded R word is enough for me to believe that the Knicks are at least no longer in denial and have taken Step 1 of 12 on the long road to recovery.
 Even on a team with a payroll bigger than the gross national product of some countries, what we have seen this season is what rebuilding really looks like -- a mix of overpaid veterans who are who they are, which is not very good, and a core of young players who can be expected to get better. 
 If Thomas once thought that Marbury could be for the Knicks what Allen Iverson was for Larry Brown in Philadelphia, he may have been cryptically admitting his mistake yesterday when he called New York ''not a place for the weak-minded'' on the day after a confused and sullen Marbury bore the brunt of the Madison Square Garden crowd's displeasure.
 Marbury already sounds passe when Thomas looks into the future. ''When Channing Frye and Eddy Curry are 27, five years from now, I don't know where Stephon will be,'' he said.
 The thought of a five-year plan must make Brown want to run for the hills, specifically Auburn Hills, his work address last season, outside Detroit.
 ''I just want to win one game,'' he said, pleadingly. That's doable enough, tonight against Utah at the Garden, but as for more grandiose ambitions, there are no big-picture shortcuts without a to-die-for franchise player like LeBron James or Dwyane Wade. There are no quick fixes no matter how many coaching confessionals Brown conducts, how many assistants he has (seven at last count), how many hysterical critics demand that Thomas do something, anything, to stop the bleeding now.
 Hasn't that been the problem with this franchise since Ewing grew old and infirm, the refusal to let go of an era that produced much titillation, if no titles? Wasn't it the continuous pursuit of aging names like Glen Rice and mediocrities like Clarence Weatherspoon and damaged goods like Antonio McDyess that put Layden up against the wall and got him fired for Christmas two years ago? Isn't that why some believe Thomas has already made too many moves?
 Even hardened pessimists didn't think the Knicks would be 6-18 after he landed Curry last summer, and maybe they wouldn't be if Curry had been healthy and the early schedule wasn't so daunting. 
 ''At some point in time, I think Coach is good enough to figure it out and make it happen,'' Thomas said on the subject of this season.
 An interesting choice of words and surely a back-page headline if George Steinbrenner blabbed them about his manager, Joe Torre, exiting Yankee Stadium on a losing summer night. But let's be fair here, if only to the memories of Don Chaney and Lenny Wilkens. There is no question that Curry and Frye and even Jamal Crawford are talented players, and that Trevor Ariza and Nate Robinson are intriguing athletes. Given Brown's reputation as a technician and a teacher, for the many millions he is being paid, shouldn't Thomas and Knicks fans expect no less than fundamental improvement from the young players as the months go by?
 In the grand scheme of things, how many games the Knicks win this season is largely irrelevant, and the same holds true for how many they lose. Acquiring Curry, it must be remembered, required sending their 2006 first-round pick to Chicago. There will be no lottery reward next June, which means this season is only about cultivating the kiddie corps, identifying the keepers.
 That's Step 2. And that's on Brown.

HEADLINE: Where the Money Goes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Your Dec. 16 editorial ''Breaking the Oil Curse'' rightly highlights the failure of the Chad oil experiment. But rather than heeding the lessons from its investment in the project, the World Bank continues to invest in extractive industries projects that run a great risk of failing to help the poor. 
Recently approved or planned projects in Guatemala, Congo, Ghana, Russia and elsewhere have a significant chance of increasing conflict, corruption and environmental degradation. 
 The World Bank should heed the call of an independent assessment of the sector it commissioned and work with stakeholders to establish minimum governance and human rights thresholds that must be present before approving such projects.

HEADLINE: Bonus Fever on London's Wall Street 

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 21 

 BODY:
Ebenezer Scrooge would not be happy this Christmas.
 At pubs, restaurants and office parties in the City, London's Wall Street, all the talk has been on the bonuses that are being lavished on bankers and traders.
London is at the center of an expansion in European deals, helped by inflows of cash from private equity shops, the Middle East and Russia, and a rush of foreign listings on the London exchange.
 As a result, many bankers here are hoping that this is the year when their year-end bonuses, which have traditionally lagged those of their counterparts across the Atlantic, rise to a comparable level. 
 ''London and New York have been coming closer and closer together over the last few years,'' said Carl Sjostrom, a partner in KPMG's executive compensation practice. ''New York is a bigger market, but there have been some fantastically lucrative areas in Europe as of late.''
 At Goldman Sachs, for example, fees from European mergers alone are up 102.4 percent from a year earlier, to $656.7 million, versus an 18 percent increase in merger fees in the United States, to $994.6 million, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial. At Merrill Lynch, they are up 151.7 percent in Europe, to $377.3 million, versus a 53.7 percent increase in the United States, to $510.8 million. (Banks based in New York almost always have smaller investment banking staffs in Europe -- in some cases as little as half the size.)
 The numbers do not take into account Russian or Middle Eastern deals, which are often done by London bankers, debt sales or new equity offerings on the London Stock Exchange.
 Disparity in pay between New York banks and their foreign outposts has been a longstanding source of friction. In London, banking and trading markets were once notorious for clubby relationships and liquid lunches, but they are being transformed into springboards for growth markets like Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
 ''I think there is still a perception that people work harder in New York, which is probably justified, but the gap is narrowing,'' said Mounzer Nasr, the head of European corporate investment for the private equity firm Arcapita, and a former deal maker for Bankers Trust in New York and Merrill Lynch in London. ''Depending on who you're talking about, the top M.& A. bankers in London work just as hard as their New York counterparts.''
 Investment bank managers in London say they are often looking for skills that are generally found outside New York. In particular demand are bankers with experience in the Middle East or China.
 ''There is a premium for people who are bi- and tricultural,'' said John J. Studzinski, the chief executive of HSBC's corporate and investment banking division.
 Klaus Diederichs, head of European investment banking at J. P. Morgan Chase, is also looking for specialized skills. ''Our bankers are flying as much to Kazakhstan and Istanbul as they are to Frankfurt,'' he said. ''Deals in countries such as South Africa and Kazakhstan have grown in size considerably.''
 ''The European markets now require bankers to be complete athletes,'' he said, ''as competent in mergers and acquisitions as they are in structured financing, capital raising and derivative transactions.''
 In London, expectations were high this bonus season. Nearly 60 percent of City employees expected their bonuses to be larger than last year, and one in five expected it to be at least twice as large, according to Morgan McKinley, a financial recruiting firm. In the United States, 44 percent of bankers expected their bonuses to be larger than last year's, according to a similar survey by Vault, an employment research firm.
 As in New York, estimating how many millions bankers and traders will receive holds a particular fascination.
 The London afternoon newspaper The Evening Standard started the bonus speculation early this year, with a headline on its front page in September: ''3,000 New City Millionaires: Biggest Bonuses for Five Years as Good Times Return.'' The paper attached numbers to the names of various bankers, estimating, for example, that a head of British banking at Goldman Sachs would be awarded $:5 million (about $8.7 million).
 While no banker or trader would comment on the record about bonuses, year-end pay is all the chatter. And there are signs that bankers, traders and others in the City have been out celebrating more often this year.
 Anthony Fuller, the chairman of the pub chain Fuller Smith & Turner, last month cited a 6.6 increase in sales in the financial district for the six months ended Oct. 1.
 ''It was particularly pleasing to see continued buoyant trading in the City which, up to a year ago, had been suffering the effects of a sluggish economy,'' he said.
 Sales did not necessarily increase because City pub visitors are drinking more expensive beer or wine, Tony Johnson, a spokesman for Fuller, noted. Some of the increase has come from ''more people coming to the pub,'' he said. ''When things are good, people are more comfortable being seen out having a good time than when they are bad.''

HEADLINE: Hurricane Relief Loans

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In a Dec. 15 front-page article about federal loans for the hurricane victims, a Small Business Administration official claims that criticism of the agency is purely ''political.'' The facts say otherwise: Of 322,000 applications, only about 22,000 loans have been approved. 
It's no small irony that claims of politicization come from the office of Hector V. Barreto, the agency's administrator, named by The New Republic as one of the administration's ''worst hacks.'' 
 The administration has failed America's small-business owners. Of the $62 billion President Bush requested for hurricane relief, not one dime has been appropriated for small businesses or the S.B.A.
 Twice, the administration scuttled relief for small businesses devastated by the hurricanes that passed the Senate 96 to 0. 
 President Bush has ignored calls from Congress to use some of the $37 billion sitting idle at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide immediate relief for small businesses and homeowners. That's hardly a ''heck of a job.''
 Getting the Gulf Coast's small businesses back on their feet will help local economies rebuild, and it will give the thousands of people they employ the resources to put their lives back together.

HEADLINE: Law Eases Residency Rule For City Sanitation Workers 

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
New York City sanitation workers will now have an option like that for police officers, firefighters and teachers -- to live in less costly suburban areas while still keeping their city jobs -- under a state law signed this week by Gov. George E. Pataki over opposition from the Bloomberg administration. 
 Under the new law, sanitation workers with at least five years of service will be able to live in Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Suffolk Counties. Currently, the sanitation workers are required to reside in the five boroughs, Westchester or Nassau. 
The exemptions from rules requiring city workers to live within the five boroughs have been hotly contested in the past, with critics saying that workers who move away spend their city salaries elsewhere and may have less of a stake in the city they serve. 
 But the union representing the city's 6,500 sanitation workers had lobbied for broader residency requirements, saying that the rule change would help them keep their most experienced workers from leaving as they were priced out of the city and its more affluent bedroom communities.
 Harry Nespoli, president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, said the average sanitation worker earns about $48,000 annually after five years. ''They want a piece of the American pie,'' he said. ''But real estate prices have skyrocketed to the point that my members can't afford to buy a home in the city anymore. Where do they go?''
 Mr. Nespoli added that about 4,200 sanitation workers would be eligible to relocate to surrounding counties under the new law, though he said that many of them would not because they had already settled down somewhere with their families. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had opposed the law, contending that it was not necessary and could create operational problems for the Sanitation Department when responding to emergencies like snowstorms. He also argued that allowing city workers to move away would hurt the local economy.
 In an August letter to the governor, Mr. Bloomberg wrote: ''Residency requirements are absolutely acceptable restrictions which a state or municipality may place upon its employees and, in fact, have withstood constitutional challenges seeking to invalidate them. To legislatively expand or create residency exemptions on a piecemeal basis without a compelling need to do so is simply unwise public policy.''
 In general, city employees hired after 1986 must live in the city, although both state and city laws provide for exceptions. For example, police officers and firefighters can also live in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties. And teachers have no residency requirements at all.
 Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said yesterday that the mayor remained opposed to the law. ''We think it is bad policy,'' Mr. Barowitz said.
 But in a turnaround, Mr. Pataki decided to support the sanitation workers' law after vetoing a similar measure last year at the request of the Bloomberg administration. The Democratic-led Assembly and Republican Senate had passed the bill in the spring.
 Legislative aides said yesterday that Mr. Pataki had approached Senator Vincent L. Leibell, the bill's main Senate sponsor, whose district includes Putnam, Westchester and Dutchess Counties, to try to work out a compromise between the city and its sanitation workers on the issue.
 Robert Farley, chief counsel to Mr. Leibell, said that Mr. Pataki had suggested amending the legislation to allow only sanitation workers with at least five years of experience to live elsewhere so that potential jobs would not be taken away from city residents. 
 Scott Reif, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said the governor had signed the bill to allow sanitation workers to have the same residency requirements as other city workers like the firefighters.

HEADLINE: From Back-Channel Contacts, Blueprint for a Deal

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
On Wednesday morning, Roger Toussaint's closest advisers encouraged him to face his difficult circumstances. The workers in Mr. Toussaint's union, who had brought the city's transit system to a halt, were incurring fines and public scorn with each day of the union's strike.
 What's your endgame? the advisers asked him gently.
Already, Mr. Toussaint had sent intermediaries to seek Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's aid in ending the deadlock with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, according to several people involved in the discussions. 
 But by noon, other labor leaders had become more blunt in counseling Mr. Toussaint, suggesting that his union was in real peril.
 In an early afternoon telephone conference call with 40 union leaders, according to people who participated, Mr. Toussaint showed his frustration as he sought a public showing of support.
 ''I don't need anyone standing on the sidelines holding my coat,'' one person recalled his saying. ''I need someone to take off their coats.''
 Eventually, Mr. Toussaint's back-channel communication to Mr. Bloomberg paid off, and the groundwork for a return to work was laid.
 Mr. Toussaint signaled that if the transportation authority relaxed its demands involving pensions -- the issue at the heart of the contract dispute -- he would be willing to bargain over workers' making payments toward their health benefits. Mr. Bloomberg, after initial skepticism, indicated it might be a formula for success.
 It was. Less than 24 hours after Mr. Toussaint's moments of hard reckoning, mediators announced that the union leadership felt sufficiently encouraged about progress to announce that the union was ready to call off the strike.
 The story of what happened over those 24 hours -- the role of the state mediators, the background role of the Bloomberg administration, the contrasting realities of heated public exchanges and behind-the-scenes headway -- was pieced together through interviews with government officials, labor leaders and people close to the union and the authority. The principals themselves, Mr. Toussaint and top officials of the authority, have agreed to conduct the remaining negotiations toward a final contract in secret.
 The beginning of the end of the transit strike of 2005 started innocuously, with the arrival around 3 p.m. on Tuesday of a middle-aged man with a dimpled chin and a dark gray mustache. He slipped into a Midtown hotel unnoticed, 12 hours after the city's subway and bus workers walked off the job for the first time in 25 years. 
 The man, a mediator from the state's Public Employment Relations Board who had traveled from Albany to enter what for New Yorkers was the World Series of conflict resolution, would help establish enough of a negotiating peace that millions of people who had been all but stranded in their own city could resume their normal lives. 
 The mediator, Richard A. Curreri, and two other veteran mediators practiced shuttle diplomacy inside the Grand Hyatt hotel near Grand Central Terminal. But their main accomplishment may not have been performing feats of persuasion so much as providing public cover for each side to resume negotiations, even as a war of rhetoric continued to rage at news conferences and on picket lines.
 Mr. Curreri, a lawyer who has worked for the board since 1990 and is its director of conciliation, invited two other mediators to join him on Tuesday: Martin F. Scheinman, a lawyer and veteran arbitrator and mediator who has helped settle thousands of labor contracts, and Alan R. Viani, who was the chief negotiator for District Council 37, the city's largest union of municipal workers, from 1973 to 1985. They would work through the night on Wednesday before emerging early yesterday to say an end to the strike was at hand.
 Even though Gov. George E. Pataki opposed negotiations unless the strike ended, and Mr. Toussaint opposed negotiations unless pensions were dropped from the table, all day Wednesday top negotiators for the two sides met repeatedly with the mediators -- in effect, negotiating through a third party.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Toussaint had clearly begun to appreciate the depth of the problems faced by Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. Those who were advising him said he seriously contemplated the prospect of being jailed and the economic harm to his workers.
 Around 10 a.m., Mr. Toussaint called two other labor leaders: Bruce S. Raynor, the general president of Unite Here, the union representing apparel, hotel and restaurant workers, and Mike Fishman, president of the city's giant union of building service workers, Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. Mr. Toussaint asked the two men, who had both supported Mr. Bloomberg's re-election, to call the mayor to urge him to pressure Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the authority, to drop his demands on pensions, according to Mr. Raynor.
 In its final offer, the authority demanded that future workers pay 6 percent of their wages toward their pensions, compared with 2 percent from current workers. Mr. Toussaint condemned that proposal as onerously high and as treating tomorrow's workers worse than today's.
 Mr. Raynor said he had tried to gauge the mayor's response to the idea of having the authority back off on its pension demands and instead consider higher health care contributions from workers as a way of achieving long-term savings. The mayor at first rejected the notion, but ''eventually he came around to believing that was a good idea,'' Mr. Raynor said.
 Mr. Raynor said he and Mr. Fishman had tried to serve as informal mediators. ''We both believe that you have to find a solution, the quicker the better, and we both had credibility with the mayor and with Roger,'' Mr. Raynor said. 
 The resolution of the strike picked up speed Wednesday afternoon, even after harsh public performances by the mayor and by Mr. Toussaint, as well as by Mr. Pataki, who demanded that the workers return to their jobs before negotiations could resume. When David Catalfamo, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, was asked on Wednesday whether the authority was free to bargain, he replied in an e-mail message, ''The M.T.A. can speak for themselves.'' 
 Mr. Toussaint went before television cameras on Wednesday afternoon and tried to claim the moral high ground in the dispute. He tried to place the strike in the context of social justice and likened the illegal walkout to Rosa Parks's civil disobedience. He also tried to raise the ante, by offering to resume talks immediately if the authority agreed to drop its pension demands.
 Two hours later, more than a dozen union leaders -- representing teachers, CUNY professors, police detectives and municipal workers, among other groups -- stood before the same cameras and vigorously asserted that Mr. Toussaint's demand to have pensions dropped from the talks was fair and reasonable. What they did not do was declare support for the strike.
 Privately, in the conference call on Wednesday afternoon, they had warned Mr. Toussaint that the fines, public anger and contempt citations from the strike could be disastrous.
 ''All day long there were a couple of us, that kept on trying to figure out what can settle this, what can solve this,'' said Randi Weingarten, the president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''We were very concerned that management was going to bear down and go after the union.'' 
 She and Assemblyman Brian M. McLaughlin, a Queens Democrat who is the president of the New York City Central Labor Council, spoke to both Mr. Toussaint and Mr. Kalikow. Mr. McLaughlin said yesterday he was aware that the union's position was delicate but credited Mr. Toussaint for being willing to return to the table. ''Nobody really knew where Roger was willing, or not willing, to go,'' he said. ''He said if this issue was removed from the table, we could within hours reach an agreement.'' 
 Mr. McLaughlin said the strike had been a major obstacle in getting the authority to make concessions. ''You have to work past things,'' he said. ''Once there's a strike, attitudes change. Politicians go more for blood than conflict resolution, and place the blame squarely on one side.'' 
 Bill Lynch, a former deputy mayor who has advised Mr. Toussaint, said the unions' stance and the communications with Mr. Bloomberg had been critical in persuading the transportation authority to bend. ''I think that they were hearing all that static out there and I think, with the municipal unions coming as strongly as they did, the momentum toward saving the pensions was starting to build,'' Mr. Lynch said. The transportation authority, he said, was ''losing ground on that issue.''
 Enter the mediators. Their proposal -- having the union agree to return to work with the transportation authority essentially acknowledging that pensions were all but off the table -- ultimately allowed each side to swallow something. 
 Barry L. Feinstein, a former Teamsters leader who has served on the authority's board since 1989 and is close to Mr. Pataki and Mr. Kalikow, said Mr. Kalikow deserved credit for showing resolve without foreclosing the possibility of reopening talks. He said many people had expected Mr. Kalikow to give in under the threat of a strike. 
 ''Many people thought that he wouldn't be able to take the pressure, that he would fold, that he would do whatever had to be done to prevent a strike, that the M.T.A. would avoid a strike at any cost,'' Mr. Feinstein said. ''That didn't happen.''
 Jerome Lefkowitz, a labor lawyer who helped draft a state law that provides for mediation and arbitration in contract disputes involving police, firefighters and transit workers, said he felt the law had helped people find a path of reason. 
 ''Mediators must have the facility to listen to what the negotiators are saying and to hear priorities and demands that may not be articulated explicitly,'' he said. ''When they start making progress, more tradeoffs follow pretty quickly, once you can break the ice.''

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Dropped Last Month 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell in November from a record-setting pace, and the number of homes for sale reached a high, the government reported yesterday.
 Coupled with the big increase from October, the latest report provides a seesaw view of the housing market and indicates that even as sales remain high by historical standards, they are starting to level off and slow from the rapid increases of the last four years.
Sales fell 11 percent, to an annual pace of 1.2 million, and the number of homes for sale jumped 3 percent, to 503,000. At the current sales pace, that equates to a 4.9-month supply of homes, the largest inventory since December 1996 when there was a five-month supply. Median prices for new homes -- half the homes sold for more and half for less -- was little changed from a year ago at $225,200. 
 New-home sales make up just 15 percent of the housing market; existing-home sales make up the rest. That is one reason economists caution against reading too much into the report. Another is the data's significant margin of error, which at plus or minus 8.9 percentage points is enough to erase most of the drop in sales.
 ''There is obviously a lot of concern about the state of the housing market right now,'' said David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley. ''One thing that caught a lot of people's attention was this nine-year high in unsold homes.''
 But Mr. Greenlaw noted that the new-home inventory was still smaller than the 8.5 months of supply in the early 1990's after the real estate market collapsed in some parts of the country because of the savings and loan scandals of the 1980's. ''You have a much, much different situation today,'' he said.
 For one thing, most Americans still retain a high degree of confidence in the housing market.
 In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted Dec. 2-6, 71 percent of the respondents said that they expected home prices in their communities to go up in the next five years, and 17 percent said they would stay the same. Only 9 percent said prices would drop; the rest did not answer the question.
 The telephone poll of 1,155 adults nationwide also found that Americans viewed housing as a slightly riskier investment than they did earlier this year. About 69 percent said real estate was a safer investment than stocks, compared with 80 percent of respondents who said the same in an April poll conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News. Conversely, the number of people who said stocks were a safer investment rose to 23 percent from 13 percent.
 The Times's poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 More broadly, American consumers have regained their more upbeat economic outlook from earlier this year. The University of Michigan yesterday revised its consumer confidence index for this month to 91.5 from an earlier reading of 88.7, putting the measure above where it was before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in late August.
 Also yesterday, the Commerce Department said that orders for durable goods jumped 4.4 percent last month, with most of the increase coming from a 133 percent jump in commercial planes and parts orders. Excluding the transportation sector, orders for durable goods, which last more than three years, dropped 0.6 percent.
 ''The important aerospace industry is expanding again and overall manufacturing activity is growing, but the pace of growth in manufacturing is overstated,'' said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research firm in Washington.

HEADLINE: Korean Cloning Scientist Quits Over Report He Faked Research

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and NICHOLAS WADE; Choe Sang-Hun of The International Herald Tribune reported from Seoul for this article, and Nicholas Wade from New York.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, the South Korean scientist whose research on stem cells and cloning propelled him to international stardom, resigned from his university on Friday, after an investigative panel there reported earlier in the day that he had fabricated the paper in which he claimed to have created stem cell colonies from 11 patients. 
 The South Korean government, which had vigorously promoted Dr. Hwang as the symbol of its drive to carve out a niche in biotechnology, admitted to ''crushing misery'' and said it planned to halt research funds for the 53-year-old scientist.
In both Korea and the United States, supporters of stem cell research expressed concern that the setback would damage the image of what was already a controversial field. Many critics have long worried that the high-profile tactics of famous scientists like Dr. Hwang fundamentally distort the scientific method. [News analysis, Page A6.] 
 The panel at Seoul National University pledged to impose a heavy punishment on Dr. Hwang, and said it was investigating his other claims, including his report of having cloned a dog and his announcement last year that he had achieved the first cloning of a human cell.
 As he announced his resignation, surrounded by weeping students, Dr. Hwang said, ''I apologize to the South Korean people for creating an unspeakable shock and disappointment.'' 
 But he insisted that he had invented the technology needed to clone human embryos and to produce stem cells that genetically match patients.
 ''Technology for patient-specific embryonic stem cells belongs to South Korea,'' he said before leaving his lab. ''And you will find out that this is true.''
 The nationally televised announcement by the university, which examined data from his lab and questioned members of his research team, was the first official confirmation of a series of criticisms of his work in the last month, many of them posted on Web sites used by young Korean researchers. 
 Dr. Hwang had already retracted the stem cell paper, which appeared in May in the American journal Science, after critics and associates pointed out that photographs used to support it appeared to have been faked. He cited ''human errors.'' 
 But on Friday, Roe Jung Hye, dean of research affairs at the university, said at the panel's news conference that the erroneous data ''were not accidental mistakes, but were an intentional fabrication.''
 Dr. Roe said that Dr. Hwang had created only 2 stem cell lines by March 15, when he submitted his paper to Science, but concocted DNA fingerprinting and other lab data to make it look as if he had produced 11 lines that genetically matched patients. 
 ''We determined that this is a grave misconduct that damages the foundation of science,'' she said.
 The panel has not yet determined whether the two existing embryonic cell lines were derived from a patient, as Dr. Hwang reported, or were simply generated in the usual way from fertilized human eggs.
 Dr. Roe also reported as false a principal claim by Dr. Hwang in the Science paper, that he had made human cloning far more practical by using fewer eggs to establish each cell line. He had reduced the average requirement from the 242 eggs he needed to establish the first cloned human cell line in 2004, to a mere 17 per cell line, he wrote. 
 ''We believe that the number of eggs he used was far more than he has reported,'' Dr. Roe said. 
 Another Korean scientist, Roh Sung Il, a former associate of Dr. Hwang's, has said as many as 1,100 eggs might have been used in research for the paper. 
 The breakthrough Dr. Hwang said he had achieved would have been a significant advance in therapeutic cloning, in which a wide range of degenerative diseases could be treated with tissues generated from a patient's own cells. On Friday, that potential was cited -- wistfully, angrily or with renewed determination -- by scientists and others in South Korea and in the United States.
 The Rev. Kim Je Eun, a Methodist pastor whose 10-year-old son uses a wheelchair after a car accident and was one of the 11 patients cited in the Science paper, said he vividly remembered the day in April 2004 when the boy first met Dr. Hwang. 
 ''My son asked him, 'Doctor, can you make me stand up and walk again?' '' Mr. Kim said. ''And Dr. Hwang said, 'You will walk again, I promise.' '' 
 Dr. John Gearhart, a stem cell expert at Johns Hopkins University, said Dr. Hwang's falsifications ''will produce cynicism about the stem cell field and science in general.'' He added that scientists would need to convince the public and policy makers that people commit fraud in science, just as in any profession, and that as scientists ''we must make it apparent that we do our best to prevent the corruption of the scientific process.'' 
 A critic of stem cell research, Richard Doerflinger, the deputy director of pro-life activities for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the field had been seriously damaged. 
 ''It's all very well to say one scandal shouldn't set back the field,'' he said. ''But Hwang's team was the field. If his results are false, then after seven years of attempts worldwide no one has succeeded in getting even the first step in 'therapeutic cloning' to work on a practical scale.''
 Scientists, however, argued that the damage was narrower. ''There may be some political flareback,'' said Dr. Donald Kennedy, editor of Science. ''But I hope people would consider the many exciting experiments that have worked, rather than focusing on one very embarrassing failure.''
 Dr. Zach Hall, president of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, said that it was too soon to say whether Dr. Hwang's failure would prove a political setback for stem cell research, but that it was evidently a scientific reverse. 
 ''It's a technological setback,'' he said, ''and ground we thought we had won must now be re-won.''
 A group of young scientists who helped reveal flaws in Hwang's papers through a Web site frequented by science students issued a statement saying that any leniency toward Hwang would further damage the credibility of South Korean scientists.
 Dr. Hwang's rise from peasant's son to international fame has often been attributed to South Koreans' eagerness to embrace new technology and their fiercely nationalistic desire to become No. 1 in the world, as exemplified by the South Korean computer chip and shipbuilding industries.
 But Han Jae Kak, a policy coordinator for the opposition Democratic Labor Party, said South Korea's ''overriding emphasis on quick achievements'' and its ''need for a hero who can put the country together at a time of economic uncertainty helped make Dr. Hwang what he is today.''
 Mr. Han said, ''The government depended on Hwang to justify its policy of support for cloning.'' Since 1998, the government has provided Dr. Hwang's team with an estimated $65 million in research funds.
 ''Popular support was total; people had not listened to suspicions about Hwang,'' said Mr. Han, who was among the first to question the work. ''In a way, we were all chasing an optical illusion.''

HEADLINE: Battle for Congress Looms as Parties Set Stage for Another Politically Turbulent Year 

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
With control of Congress hanging in the balance next year, neither party will take much of a holiday break. Even as this session of Congress lurched to a fractious close, both parties were planning for an intense start to the new year, as they try to seize the political agenda for the midterm elections.
 If Democrats have their way, the debate will revolve, in large part, around ethics and honesty in government, and what they assert is the Republican majority's failings in those areas. Republicans, for their part, are hoping to focus voters' attention on improvements in the economy -- and hoping to link those economic gains to the tax cuts they will be pushing next year.
 After a politically difficult year, Republicans are also hoping to minimize internal divisions, to restore some of their once-legendary discipline and to campaign as the party that gets things done. 
 ''Who knows what next year is going to look like?'' said Representative Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican and the acting majority leader. ''It certainly looks like it's going to be an election year with significant challenges, but I think on the House side we can do the work it takes to define who we are.'' 
 Democrats are heading into 2006 in a bullish mood, after beating back President Bush's Social Security proposal and several other major Republican initiatives. Senate Democrats plan to introduce a new ''investigative unit'' in January to highlight Republican scandals and what they assert is a chronic failure by the Republican-controlled Congress to exercise real oversight of the Bush administration.
 In the House, Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said an important message for the midterm campaign was simply: ''We will put a check and a balance back into the system. People know the system is out of whack.''
 Senate Democrats also plan to begin a series of ''red state tours'' -- initially to Arizona, Colorado, Idaho and Nebraska -- with the message that ''America deserves a government as good as its people.''
 Several Democratic strategists say their road map for 2006 is 2005, when they helped frame the debate by opposing, early and aggressively, Mr. Bush's proposal to put private investment accounts in Social Security. ''We took him down on Social Security,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. ''That was a charge right at our core values, and we had to win that.'' 
 Democrats are also counting on the support of Americans United, a liberal group originally formed during the Social Security fight and backed by some major unions. The group's new campaign, which will use a combination of advertising and grass-roots organizing to promote a ''progressive agenda,'' will open around the time of Mr. Bush's State of the Union Message. Karen Olick, the executive director, said the group hoped to be a liberal version of Progress for America, the group that has heavily promoted Mr. Bush's agenda.
 Republicans are aware of the political dangers facing their party and are already fighting back. They argue that ethical problems and scandals are hardly confined to their party -- a message that has considerable resonance with the voters, polls suggest -- and they accuse the Democrats of lacking a positive agenda.
 ''The people have seen that Republicans are able to get things done,'' said Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, chairwoman of the Republican Conference. ''Democrats have offered nothing in terms of a substantive agenda.''
 In contrast, said Ron Bonjean, the spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, Republicans will return in 2006 to ''develop our successful economic and national security agenda -- and finding ways to lessen regulation, taxation and litigation -- while the Democrats, without an agenda, will focus on throwing mud.''
 Tax cuts, including cuts on capital gains and dividends that will expire unless extended, are uppermost on the Republican agenda early next year.
 ''Republicans will say this economy is going really well, the last thing we need is a huge increase in taxes,'' said David Winston, a pollster who advises the Republican leadership. ''Democrats will say we don't need to give these huge tax breaks to the rich. How that debate gets formed is key.''
 But much of the political challenge facing the Republican majority is, as one strategist put it, ''avoiding problems.'' Some Republicans are clearly worried about the potential divisiveness of a leadership struggle in the House that now, to some, seems inevitable next year, given the indictment of the former majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, on a money-laundering charge. Republican unity was already frayed in recent months by internal disputes over spending cuts and the deficit.
 Republican political fortunes are also tied to conditions in Iraq. 
 ''You've got a lot of nervous Republican members on the Hill, because you've got a number of things outside their control that are affecting them,'' said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. ''The war in Iraq is something an average member of Congress can't do much about, but it's clearly driving a negative political environment.'' 
 Another important variable is President Bush's standing in the polls -- recently improved, but still low enough to be a source of anxiety for his party.
 Democrats have their own challenges -- notably, coalescing around a campaign agenda, which was widely expected to be released in January but has been delayed. ''We don't feel any rush to do it,'' Ms. Pelosi said. She insisted that the decision was tactical, not based on internal divisions in the party over Iraq and other issues. 
 Democratic strategists said they did not want to distract voters from the party's case against the Republicans in January -- especially in a month that may see more disclosures from the Justice Department's investigation of Jack Abramoff, the Republican lobbyist, and the C.I.A. leak investigation. 
 Other factors in that month's political debate, Democrats say, will be the budget cuts pushed through this week, and the rollout of the Republicans' prescription drug benefit for Medicare, already plagued by complaints. Democrats have criticized the drug program as an example of special-interest politics at its worst, putting the drug industry above the interests of older Americans. 
 Democrats say there will be few surprises in their agenda, which will focus on broad themes like security, prosperity and integrity. But leading Democrats said there would probably not be a detailed position on the war in Iraq, which has proven divisive in the party.
 ''On Iraq, our job, given that we don't control the presidency or even a house of Congress where we can hold hearings, is to hold the president's feet to the fire and make him level with the American people,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
 In the end, Mr. Bush figures large in the thinking of both parties, but especially in the new confidence of the Democrats. 
 As Mr. Schumer put it, ''It's been made clear over the past year that Mr. Bush is not the giant killer some Republicans thought he would be the day after the presidential election.''

HEADLINE: A Deal Is Reached in Libyan H.I.V. Case, Bulgaria Says

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH and NICHOLAS WOOD; Craig S. Smith reported from Paris for this article, and Nicholas Wood from Rome.

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
Libya, Bulgaria, the United States and the European Union have agreed to set up a fund to support hundreds of Libyan children who were infected with H.I.V. while in the hospital, Bulgarian officials said Friday.
 While the agreement made no mention of six Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who have been sentenced to death in Libya for infecting the children, it could pave the way for a commutation of their sentences or their release once Libya's highest court considers their final appeal on Sunday. The court's decision is not expected until January.
''It is important to address the needs and concerns of the infected children,'' said Dimitar Tsanchez, a spokesman for Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry, reached by telephone on Friday. ''We will have to see what the next development will be.'' 
 The six nurses and doctor were arrested in 1999 after H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, spread through the wards where they worked at Al Fateh children's hospital in the coastal city of Benghazi. Last year, they were sentenced to death by firing squad for deliberately spreading the virus. The case was marred by charges of torture and forced confessions, but the verdicts were widely supported by Libyans.
 Since the convictions, the seven medical workers have been caught in a political standoff between Libya and Bulgaria, with Libya demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation for the infections and Bulgaria refusing to pay ''blood money'' for a crime they say did not take place. International AIDS experts agree that the infections were probably spread inadvertently because of the hospital's poor sanitation and hygiene.
 Libya's mercurial leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, has refused to intervene, citing the independence of his country's judiciary. But his son, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, who heads a charitable foundation that has acted as intermediary in resolving the country's other international impasses, began working more than a year ago to find a politically acceptable solution to the problem. He said last December that the seven would not be executed and that Libya would like to extradite the nurses to Bulgaria.
 But Libya has continued to insist that Bulgaria pay compensation to the families of the children, more than 400 of whom were infected and at least 50 of whom have died. At one time, Libya suggested that it might link the nurses' fate to the extradition of a Libyan man serving a life sentence in Scotland for the downing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
 Since then, the United States, Britain and the European Union have joined to try to find a solution. Representatives from the three met Wednesday in Tripoli with representatives from the younger Mr. Qaddafi's charitable organization, from Libya and from Bulgaria to sign the agreement setting up the International Benghazi Families Support Fund.
 The fund will be run by a board that includes representatives of Mr. Qaddafi's foundation, Bulgaria and the European Union, and AIDS experts from Libya and the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.
 The sources and amount of money have not been disclosed, though President Georgi Parvanov of Bulgaria was quoted in a Bulgarian newspaper on Friday as saying that his country would have to pay ''a very high price'' to win the nurses' release.
 Bulgaria had rejected earlier Libyan suggestions that the country pay $10 million in compensation for each infected child, the same amount that Libya agreed to pay each of the families of the 270 people killed in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
 Bulgaria's Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying that the agreement was ''part of the international effort to find an outcome acceptable to all sides of the situation that followed the tragic spread of H.I.V./AIDS in Benghazi.'' It said the fund would ''seek, collect and coordinate the distribution of financial and material aid to the Benghazi families.''
 Mr. Tsanchez, the ministry spokesman, said he did not think a specific amount of money had been discussed. But he emphasized that the fund was not ''compensation,'' and that Bulgaria still considered the nurses innocent. ''We are convinced the Bulgarian nurses have nothing to do with this tragedy,'' he said.
 The victims' families have said that they believe that the evidence shows the nurses were responsible, whether or not the infections were deliberate, but that they did not care where the money came from as long as their children were cared for.
 They had asked a Libyan court to order the hospital to pay 15 million Libyan dinars, or about $11.7 million, in compensation for each child, but the court awarded them only about $272,600 per child -- an award that the families rejected. Since then, their hope has rested with the international negotiations.

HEADLINE: U.N. Adopts a 2-Year Budget, Averting a Financial Crisis 

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 23 

 BODY:
The United Nations averted a financial crunch on Friday night by reaching agreement on a compromise budget that guarantees financing while also meeting wealthy nations' demands for fundamental management changes next year.
 The decision on the $3.8 billion, two-year budget emerged after two days and nights of crisis meetings when the 132-nation group representing the developing nations and China, known as the Group of 77, agreed to a proposal put forward by the United States, Japan, the European Union and their allies.
 The plan, ratified later in the evening by the General Assembly, sets a $950 million spending cap on the first half of 2006 and ties additional spending requests to the fulfillment of management changes. 
 ''This evening the United States obtained something it had been striving for the last three months, which is a clear linkage between management reform and the budget process of the United Nations,'' said John R. Bolton, the American ambassador. 
 The budget process was particularly critical because of the emphasis that the large donor nations and the Secretariat put on making management more accountable in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal, which had exposed weaknesses in how the United Nations is run.
 The poorer nations feared the changes would dilute the authority of the 191-nation General Assembly, where they each have a vote, while strengthening the Secretariat, which they perceive as beholden to the great powers, and the Security Council, whose actions are subject to vetoes from the five permanent members, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.
 Mr. Bolton argued that approving a normal budget without anticipating the changes needed would send a ''business as usual'' message, and he hinted that the United States might block acceptance. The hints were dropped with reminders that members of Congress who favored reducing American dues, which represent 22 percent of the United Nations budget, would take notice.
 Secretary General Kofi Annan is to recommend changes in the rules and regulations and reviews of outdated committees and missions in February, and the United States argued that no budget could be finally approved before the dimensions of his suggestions were known.
 An American proposal last month to replace the biennial budget with a three-month interim budget failed to attract any support, and a showdown atmosphere took hold. A spending cap put forward Wednesday by Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand and supported by Russia produced the framework for Friday night's accord.
 The Group of 77 initially rejected the plan, asking instead for a cap of $1.35 billion. This amount was unacceptable to the wealthy nations because it would have delayed a reckoning on the management changes until this summer.
 Emyr Jones Parry, the ambassador of Britain, said the European Union then succeeded in bridging the gap. ''What the European Union has done tonight,'' Sir Emyr said, ''is produce an outcome which has required those parties to come to where the European Union wanted them to be -- that is, a budget which is sufficient for the U.N., which recognized the compelling need to maintain the pressure for reform of the United Nations, especially its management, but that we should do that in a cooperative fashion with all our colleagues.''
 The French ambassador, Jean-Marc de la Sabliere, said, ''We have avoided passing a 'business as usual' budget or adopting a solution that would have led to chaos.''
 Stafford Neil of Jamaica, the head of the Group of 77, said he had accepted the settlement only on the grounds that it was ''an exceptional measure not to be repeated or used in the future.'' He said there was much in the deal that his group did not like but that in the end, no one wanted to block budget approval.
 ''We find it unpalatable the fact that there is this ax hanging over our heads in terms of the spending limitation, but we will still go forward,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 27, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about the resolution of the United Nations budget impasse omitted at one point a country among the five that put forward the spending cap that provides the framework for the accord. In addition to Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, the group included the United States.

HEADLINE: Message in a Bottle

BYLINE: By Tom Standage. 
Tom Standage, the technology editor of The Economist, is the author of ''A History of the World in Six Glasses.''

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
THE question is simple enough: which wine will you serve on Christmas Day? But the answer is far from straightforward, for your choice of wine is laden with meaning. Is it from the Old or New World? Does it emphasize fruit over terroir? Did you have to put your name down on a boutique winery's exclusive waiting list to get hold of it? And, of greatest importance to many wine buffs, what score did Robert Parker, the world's most influential wine critic, give your chosen bottle on his famed 100-point scale?
 Most of us don't worry like this about our choice of beer or coffee. But wine is the king of drinks and the drink of kings, unique in its association with status. A wine's rank is expected to correspond to both drinker and occasion: an inappropriate choice of wine reflects badly upon the host, and an apparently straightforward choice thus becomes a social minefield. 
But do not blame Robert Parker; blame the Romans. The contemporary obsession with obscure California cabernets, arcane vocabulary and suspiciously precise numerical scales is merely the latest incarnation of a tradition with deep historical roots. Millenniums ago, in beer-drinking Egypt and Mesopotamia, scarcity and high cost limited the consumption of wine to the elite and made it a status symbol. But by the Roman period, production of wine had so increased that even slaves could drink it. That meant that simply drinking wine was no longer a sign of status, so distinctions among wines became far more important. 
 The Romans were the first to use of wine as a finely calibrated social yardstick -- and thus inaugurated centuries of wine snobbery. Drinkers at a Roman banquet might be served different wines depending on their positions in society. Pliny the Younger, writing in the late first century A.D., described a dinner at which the host and his friends were served fine wine, second-rate wine was served to other guests, and third-rate wine was served to former slaves. 
 Falernian, a wine grown in the Italian region of Campania, was generally agreed to be the finest wine of the Roman period. Mr. Parker's Roman predecessors decreed that its best vintage was that of 121 B.C.; it was served to the emperor Caligula in A.D. 39, though by then it was probably undrinkable. In the second century A.D., Galen of Pergamum, personal doctor to Emperor Marcus Aurelius, prescribed Falernian for medicinal use, on the ground that the finer the wine, the greater its curative properties. Descending into the imperial cellars, Galen tasted dozens of vintages to find the best. Which vintage he chose, and whether he rated the wines using a 100-point scale are, alas, not recorded. 
 Just how seriously the Romans took the business of wine classification can be seen from the story of Marcus Antonius, a Roman politician who in 87 B.C. found himself on the wrong side of a power struggle. He sought refuge in the house of an ally of much lower social rank. But his host unwittingly gave him away by sending his servant out to buy wine worthy of such a distinguished guest. When the servant asked for a far more expensive wine than usual, the wine merchant became suspicious and informed the authorities. Marcus Antonius was discovered and beheaded.
 The close association between wine and sophistication in the ancient world contributed to its rejection by Muslims. With the rise of Islam in the seventh century, Mohammed's followers expressed their disdain for the previous ruling elites by replacing wheeled vehicles with camels, chairs and tables with cushions and by banning the consumption of wine. Being devout, they signaled, was more important than seeming sophisticated.
 In Europe, however, the idea of a hierarchy of wines survived into the medieval period. In the ''Battle of the Wines,'' a fictitious wine-tasting competition described in poems written in the 13th and 14th centuries, European wines were ranked by a priest. The top wine, from Cyprus, was declared the pope of wines; the second best was made a cardinal; lesser wines were declared kings, counts and peers. (Eight wines were deemed so bad that they were excommunicated.) It is but a small step to the five categories of the Bordeaux classification of 1855, and ultimately to the 100-point scale of today.
 Yet the idea that wines can be ranked with scientific precision is absurd. Wine is not consumed in a vacuum. Try to recall your most memorable bottles, and you may find, as my wife and I did, that they were the humble bottles drunk while cooking on lazy holiday evenings, or the reliable glugging wines shared with friends and food. Wines brought back from vacation frequently taste revolting out of context; blockbuster wines put aside for a special occasion can fail to live up to expectations. Context matters just as much as the contents of the bottle.
 So put not your faith in wine rankings imposed from on high by god-like critics. There are no right or wrong answers when it comes to wine; the only score that matters is your own taste. And the best bottles are often those served in a convivial atmosphere among family and friends -- something that no ranking system, ancient or modern, can quantify.

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Three-Day Strike 

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Transit Strike Ends on 3rd Day; Framework for Deal Reached'' (front page, Dec. 23): 
Like most New Yorkers, I am glad that the transit strike is over. No reason or cause can justify the stalling of public services, and the strike by the Transport Workers Union was no exception.
 It's a shame that New Yorkers depending on Metropolitan Transportation Authority subways and buses had to pay an unfair and involuntary cost in the form of an uncertain and horrendous commute to the city and in lost wages.
 On a positive note, New Yorkers have once again proved their resolve by not being intimidated by the strike, which virtually treated them as hostages and bargaining chips.
 I hope that the loss to the city's economy amounting to millions of dollars is compensated by a renewed holiday shopping spree of fellow New Yorkers and our tourist guests spending their holidays in the city.
 And I hope that socially responsible companies and businesses show due understanding and respect toward their employees who have braved the logistical and weather odds in trying to report to work.

HEADLINE: You Think Your Train Is Crowded? 

 BODY:
Riders who flooded the subways yesterday after a 60-hour strike ended were, perhaps unknown to them, helping celebrate a special anniversary underground. In the annals of New York City transit history, Dec. 23 holds a special place. 
 On that Monday in 1946, 59 years ago yesterday, all the straphangers who took the subway set a record that has never been broken: 8,872,244 nickels clinked into turnstiles -- more rides recorded by the city's system of subways and elevated trains than on any other day.
The system was providing about eight million rides a day in the 1940's. With the postwar population booming, it would register an annual record in 1947 of 2.05 billion passengers. 
 On July 1, 1948, the fare was raised to a dime, but ridership had already begun to decline as private cars proliferated, wartime shortages of gasoline ended and the economy slowed. By 1982, the annual number dipped below one billion for the first time since World War I. With the city's population growing again and billions of dollars invested in subway improvements, ridership began to rebound. Today, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, with MetroCards replacing coins or tokens, subway ridership averages 4.5 million on weekdays and about 1.4 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Keeping Her Son Going, Through Music and Love

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Sprightly Christmas music was playing in the bright, blue-walled bedroom of the Bronx apartment, and Emmanuel Rodriguez, 21, was enjoying it, according to his mother, Eligia Borbon. She knew that he was, she said, because ''if you play music he doesn't like, he screams.'' 
 Emmanuel could not confirm her assessment. Aside from being bedridden and unable to eat -- liquid nourishment is delivered through a tube in his abdomen -- he cannot speak. He is also blind and profoundly retarded.
But he can hear, and he loves music, especially soft rock, Ms. Borbon told a visitor on a recent afternoon. At times, she said, he moves his hands to the music, in contrast to his often spastic thrusts. 
 Before he was a year old, two neurologists came up with different diagnoses for him. He had ''started shaking like a rabbit'' with a seizure, Ms. Borbon said, two days after he was born in the Dominican Republic, his parents' native country.
 A neurologist in Miami diagnosed a severe case of congenital toxoplasmosis, an infection that is caused by a parasite and can result in blindness, seizures and mental retardation. A neurologist in New York said that Emmanuel had a severe case of cerebral palsy, a condition that results from faulty development of or damage to the brain and includes impaired mobility, spasticity and, in many cases, seizures, hindered mental development and difficulty swallowing.
 Either way, ''They said he would be like a baby all his life,'' Ms. Borbon said. 
 Physically, though, Emmanuel grew into a man, and his grunts and cries are carried in a man's voice as he makes his pleasure and displeasure known.
 Ms. Borbon, 51, who went through college while working as a schoolteacher in the Dominican Republic, gave birth to Emmanuel in 1984, two years after she and her husband had their first child, Jose. Jose, now 23, lives in the Bronx and works for a printing company.
 Speaking of Emmanuel, Ms. Borbon said, ''I don't care what I have to do to take care of him.'' She referred to him as Peque -- the Little One -- his nickname in the family. 
 Ms. Borbon's life would have been difficult in any case, but was even tougher because she and her husband divorced when Emmanuel was 2, and he has not contributed to the boys' support since, she said.
 That year, 1986, she moved with the children to New York, where they first stayed with her cousin but left when the cousin's boyfriend moved in. Ms. Borbon found a furnished room in Upper Manhattan -- but not before what she called an ''awful two weeks'' in a hotel for homeless families where she and the boys were placed by the city.
 To pay for the furnished room, she cleaned apartments and ''picked up cans in the park,'' with her earnings supplemented by contributions from friends, she said. But then her situation improved; while taking Emmanuel to Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan for physical therapy in a program for children with severe disabilities, she was hired to be the program's parent coordinator.
 The job, which enabled her to move into an apartment, lasted eight years, until financing for it ended. A year and a half of struggle followed, of trying to get along on unemployment insurance, welfare checks and help from a nonprofit group, Sinergia, which helps disabled people, she said. Finally, she got a job with Sinergia as a Medicaid service coordinator, and is now similarly employed by another organization.
 Though she earns $21,000 a year and Medicaid pays for Emmanuel's medical needs and home care attendants, Ms. Borbon still lives on the financial edge. In October, she was hit by a car, and her injuries kept her out of work and without income for six weeks, leaving her unable to pay a month's rent of $844, she said. 
 New Alternatives for Children, a group that helps disabled or chronically ill children and their parents, paid the rent with money from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. New Alternatives is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven charities that the fund supports. 
 Last summer, New Alternatives provided $130 to replace the broken air-conditioner in Emmanuel's room so he could avoid the high temperatures that are so threatening to him because his lungs are compromised, said Stephanie Knox, a program coordinator with the group. Ms. Borbon said the money from the fund had been vital because it enabled her to ''keep the apartment and keep my son from having a heat stroke.''
 Amid Ms. Borbon's challenges, her life took a distinctly happy turn last year. She married Victor Apolinar, who was a doctor in the Dominican Republic but recently began a $300-a-week factory job in New York, his new home, while he studies English.
 ''He was my boyfriend in college,'' she said, ''but then we went our separate ways.'' After his marriage ended in divorce in the Dominican Republic several years ago, she said, ''he looked me up.''

HEADLINE: Box-Office Shortfall Forces Cuts At the Met

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
The tourists are back. New York's economy is humming along, despite the transit-strike blip. Wall Street bonuses are running strong for the third year in a row.
 But the Metropolitan Opera's fortunes have failed to keep pace, a result of falling subscription rates and stagnant ticket sales. For a third straight year, the Met has been forced to make midyear budget cuts -- 5 percent this time, reflecting an expected shortfall in box-office proceeds of $4.3 million.
In an interview, Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Met, refused to rule out the possibility of layoffs, although he suggested they were unlikely, and he vowed that artistic quality would not be compromised. ''There are many areas where people can save money,'' he said. ''This puts pressure on them, and is a reminder that they have to look at everything again.'' He characterized the cuts, mentioned in an internal memorandum first reported by The Associated Press, as part of a routine review. ''We have a very strong spring,'' he said, ''and it could very well be we're going to make up some of this.'' 
 With their heavy dependence on tourists, many cultural institutions in New York were hard hit in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. Now, while tourism has returned to pre-attack levels, Mr. Volpe said, ''some of our heavy subscribers have been going out less.'' 
 ''We find that a lot of the standard works -- 'Aida,' 'Carmen,' 'Boheme' -- are doing better than we expected,'' Mr. Volpe added. ''But what's also happening is, patrons from Manhattan, the tristate area -- there's a falloff in that category.''
 As the flagship of grand opera in the United States, the Met attracts close scrutiny, and its difficulties over the last five years have been the source of much talk in the classical music world. 
 By one widely used measure -- the number of seats filled -- the Met is not faring so badly. The opera house expects to sell 85 percent of its available tickets, compared with 87.8 percent last year and 85 percent the year before. By comparison, the San Francisco Opera sold 82 percent of its available seats last season and 80 percent the season before. 
 But at the Met, an increasing number of tickets are being sold at cut-rate prices, bought by students and through employers, and thus bring in less money -- much the way General Motors and Ford sell large numbers of cars to rental car and business fleets at lower markups.
 The memo that Mr. Volpe circulated to his staff said that instead of reaping an expected 80 percent of total possible ticket revenues, the Met now projects this year to earn only 76 percent. The percentage is far off the level of the 1990's, when it hovered around 92 percent. It is worse, too, than the performance in 2002 and 2003, a two-year period when the Met registered a combined deficit of $20 million, when budgets were about $200 million. Despite the continuing weakness in ticket sales, unaudited figures from the Met say the house recorded a deficit of less than a half percent, or under $1 million, on a budget of $210 million last season.
 The Met has stepped up its promotion of student tickets, which sell for $25 or $35 instead of $80 to $150. It expects to sell 48,000 of them this season, more than eight times the number in 2001, said Stewart Pearce, a longtime Met official recently appointed as assistant manager for operations. 
 Mr. Pearce said the student and corporate sales programs were an investment in building future audiences, but acknowledged many of the tickets simply could not find other buyers. ''Part of it is we have more unused capacity,'' he said. ''Part of it is more proactive marketing to students and younger audiences.'' 
 The Met, like many orchestras and concert halls, is increasingly dependent on selling individual tickets because of a drop-off in subscriptions, an easier way of guaranteeing sales. The New York Philharmonic, too, has offset declining subscription ticket sales with an increase in single ticket sales; it expects to sell 81 percent of capacity this season, compared to 78 percent and 74 percent for the previous two years. Like the Met and other classical music institutions, the Philharmonic also has increased the number of student and other discount ticket sales in recent years.
 A 2003 survey of Met patrons cited lack of subscription flexibility, overfamiliarity with the repertory, cost and the difficulty in making it for all performances as major reasons for a falloff in subscriptions.
 It also painted a demographic portrait of the Met audience: average age, 62; average income, $120,000; over 90 percent college-educated. Providing better service, the survey said, could improve attendance. ''The operagoer who comes to the Met also shops at Nordstrom's, dines at fine restaurants and goes to high-end spas, where they are used to and expect a high degree of service and flexibility,'' the study concluded.
 The situation will soon land in the lap of Peter Gelb, the former record company executive who is taking over as general manager next year. 
 Along with Mr. Pearce's promotion to chief of operations, at least two other members of his team have recently been put in place. Thomas Michel was hired from the Public Theater as marketing director, bringing along a background in television; Elena Park, WNYC's executive producer of music, will join the Met as director of communications.

HEADLINE: Businesses Tally Losses From Strike

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Businesses did business, workers worked and consumers consumed yesterday, as New York City's circulatory system of subways and buses started pumping again. But it was also a day for tallying the vast costs of three days lost to a transit strike.
 ''I would say we lost $150,000 or so, and we got off easy compared to a lot of places,'' said Michael S. Desiderio, general manager of Tavern on the Green in Central Park, which employs more than 500 people. ''Reservations got canceled, we didn't get our walk-in business -- all told, we were off 15 to 18 percent on Thursday -- and we gave a $15 transportation fee, per day, to each employee to help them get to work.'' 
City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated that the strike cost the city's economy about $1 billion. There were people who could not work and so did not get paid, businesses that got little done because of absent staff members, high costs for alternative commuting arrangements, and dollars not spent by the missing mass of shoppers who usually flow through the city.
 Experts said that retail businesses -- stores, restaurants, beauty salons -- were hit hardest, losing perhaps half a billion dollars. Any business suffered if it relied on perishable goods or on delivery trucks, which had trouble getting into and around the city; florists were hit hard.
 ''This was a big injury for us because our customers didn't come in to work in the city,'' said Thomas Barbagianis, a co-owner of Ariston Florist, at Fifth Avenue and 14th Street. ''On the first day, we were down about 80 percent, and over all, it was 40 or 50 percent. Corporate events we would normally have sent flowers to, those were almost all cancelled. It was very hard to do deliveries, because our truck couldn't get around.''
 The strike interrupted what is ordinarily one of the busiest times of the year for the florist; Ariston makes 20 to 25 percent of the year's sales in December, Mr. Barbagianis said.
 ''We've survived worse,'' he said, ''but not much worse.''
 For two of the three strike days, Pablo Ventura stayed home, rather than try to get from his home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to his job as a chef at the New Leaf Cafe in Fort Tryon Park, near the northern tip of Manhattan. Yesterday, he was among the legions of New Yorkers reveling in a service they ordinarily gripe about or simply ignore.
 At 29 minutes past midnight, he was the first passenger to board an A train where that line begins, at 207th Street, and he celebrated with an illegal smoke. ''It's a wonderful thing, being the first person on the train,'' Mr. Ventura, 31, said. ''I'm having this cigarette because I'm the first and there's nobody here to catch me.''
 Nijazi Ahmeti, 46, did not miss any work because of the strike -- but that meant sleeping in the basement of the Chelsea building where he works as a doorman, rather than making his way home to the Bronx. Riding the D train yesterday, he was looking forward to returning to his family and to taking a hot shower.
 Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business alliance, said that about 20 percent of its members' employees were absent the first day of the strike, and a somewhat fewer the next two days.
 ''Our members, across the board, reported more than 50 percent of their workforce being late for work, and there was a lot of pressure to leave early because of the unpredictability of the commute home,'' she said.
 But while there was no dispute that the economic pain was widespread, there was also agreement among economists and business analysts that any attempt to measure the cost of the strike was just guesswork. The actual figures, they said, will trickle in slowly, over weeks and months.
 ''For a lot of sectors, like financial firms and law firms, the big economic losses were in the general area of productivity, which are hard to measure,'' Ms. Wylde said.
 The National Retail Federation and the International Council of Shopping Centers said there was no way to guess at the loss of retail business -- in part because there are varying anecdotal reports, from 20 percent to 50 percent or more.
 Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, noted that the heavy use of store gift cards, could somewhat blunt the effect on chain stores. And he said stores in the suburbs probably absorbed some of the business lost by those in the city.
 ''It's still hard to tell the net effect,'' he said. ''It depends a lot on how much of a rebound you get today and tomorrow. But the damage can't all be undone.''

HEADLINE: Home Builders and Energy Shares Put Damper on Rally 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
A year-end rally fizzled yesterday as declines in home builders and oil and gas companies left the market little changed.
 D. R. Horton led the retreat among builders after a government report showed the biggest monthly drop in new-home sales in almost 12 years.
Energy producers, including Anadarko Petroleum, fell as natural gas prices tumbled. 
 The two industries account for some of this year's biggest gains.
 ''It's not terribly surprising that we're ending the year with a whimper,'' said Robert Morris, chief investment officer at Lord Abbett & Company, which oversees $101 billion in Jersey City. ''If you look at the market this year, only a couple of groups really performed.''
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.54 point, to 1,268.66, as retailers including Kohl's rallied on a report that consumer confidence rose this month. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 6.17 points, to 10,883.27, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 2.93 points, to 2,249.42.
 For the week, the S.& P. 500 and the Dow Jones industrials added 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq dropped 0.1 percent for its third weekly decline.
 Trading was the slowest this year for a full session as some investors started the holiday early. Some 943 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Crude oil for February delivery fell 1.1 percent this week to $58.43 a barrel in New York amid forecasts for rising temperatures in the northern United States. Prices have slid 18 percent from a record $70.85 in August.
 Natural gas for January delivery fell 64 cents, to $12.283 for a million British thermal units, extending the two-day drop to 14 percent, the biggest since March 2003.
 ''When it's 35 degrees in Chicago,'' it may be a good time to sell energy stocks, said Jerry Castellini, who helps manage $2 billion for CastleArk Management in Chicago. ''We'll call this a warm-up sell-off.''
 Anadarko, an oil and natural gas producer, declined $1.05, to $94.65. Valero Energy, a refiner, lost 55 cents, to $52.83. Valero shares have surged 133 percent this year, the steepest rise in the S.& P. 500.
 An S.& P. 500 gauge of home builders lost 1.4 percent after a report showed new-home sales slid in November as rising mortgage rates and high prices left a record number of homes on the market. The drop trimmed the group's advance for the year to 28 percent.
 New-home purchases fell 11.3 percent, to a 1.245 million annual rate, the Commerce Department said. The decline was the biggest since January 1994.
 D. R. Horton, the largest U.S. homebuilder, lost 64 cents, to $36.21. KB Home slid $1.05, to $74.50.
 A separate report indicated that consumer confidence rose in December to the highest since July. The University of Michigan's final index of consumer sentiment rose to 91.5 from 81.6 in November. The increase was the most since January 2004.
 The consumer confidence report and the drop in fuel prices helped send a gauge of retailers up 0.7 percent, the biggest gain among 24 industry groups in the S.& P. 500. Kohl's rose $2.10, to $48.70. 
 A Credit Suisse First Boston analyst, Michael Exstein, added the discount department store to its focus list and wrote in a note to clients that Kohl's is his top stock pick for 2006. He cited the company's potential for increased sales through branding and advertising.
 The department store operator Dillard's climbed 53 cents, to $24.94, and Federated Department Stores, the owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, gained 62 cents, to $66.25.
 Not all consumer-related stocks advanced. Albertson's dropped $2.74, or 12 percent, to $20.54, for the biggest decline in the S.& P. 500, as it ended negotiations to sell itself. Talks with a group of investors, including CVS, concluded because ''we did not get a bid we could accept,'' a spokeswoman said.
 The drop in fuel costs also supported the Dow Jones transportation average, made up of shipping and trucking companies, railroads and airlines; it posted a 0.4 percent gain. CSX, the railroad, added 46 cents, to $51.04. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, gained 25 cents, to $22.45. Norfolk Southern rose 85 cents, to $45.20.
 A report that showed an increase in durable goods orders failed to lift stocks.
 Orders for items made to last at least several years jumped 4.4 percent in November, the most since May, to $223 billion, the Commerce Department said. Economists had expected orders to increase 1.2 percent.
 Excluding transportation equipment, orders dropped 0.6 percent, while economists estimated a gain of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Biotech Company Closes After Running Out of Cash 

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
In a setback for a controversial area of biotechnology, the company that led the way in trying to produce pharmaceuticals in genetically modified crops ran out of money and shut its doors yesterday. 
 The company, the Large Scale Biology Corporation, based in Vacaville, Calif., said in a statement Thursday that all of its approximately 70 employees had been let go.
Large Scale was founded in 1987 as Biosource Genetics and was apparently the first company to try to produce protein-based drugs and industrial chemicals in genetically engineered plants. 
 Such production, it argued, would be faster and far less expensive than using genetically engineered bacteria or animal cells, which is the usual method of producing pharmaceutical proteins like insulin and growth hormone. 
 But environmental groups and food companies have expressed opposition to pharmaceutical-producing crops, saying that drugs might accidentally end up in the food supply, causing health problems and forcing costly product recalls. 
 Large Scale used tobacco, a nonfood crop, so its technology was somewhat less controversial than that of companies using corn or rice. And under the method used by the company, the genes put into the tobacco plant could not be spread by pollen. 
 Still, controversy over agricultural biotechnology in general has made it difficult for small companies in that business to raise money.
 Robert L. Erwin, a founder and the chairman of Large Scale, said the bigger problem for his company was the reluctance of drug companies to have their products developed in crops. 
 Since there are no crop-produced pharmaceuticals on the market yet, he said, drug companies do not know how easy it will be to win approval for such drugs from the Food and Drug Administration. 
 ''Everybody wants to be the second one out,'' Mr. Erwin said. ''There are very few corporate executives willing to bet on an unproven process.'' 
 Moreover, he said, pharmaceutical crop developers are wrong in assuming that lower production costs are an important consideration for drug companies. 
 With high prices for their drugs, Mr. Erwin said, ''cost is not really an issue for them.'' 
 Large Scale's demise is a blow to Owensboro, Ky., in the heart of tobacco country, where Large Scale has a factory to extract drugs from the tobacco. 
 Some civic leaders in Owensboro had been hoping that pharmaceutical production would be a source of income for tobacco farmers and the basis for a local biotechnology industry. 
 A recent study by Robert Wisner, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, said that benefits to farmers and rural economies from pharmaceutical crops were likely to be modest. The report was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is critical of agricultural biotechnology. 
 Large Scale was selling one tobacco-produced protein for use by research laboratories and industry. It was working on producing enzymes to treat rare diseases, a cancer treatment and vaccines.
 In the company's statement, the chief executive, Kevin J. Ryan, said that Large Scale was ''taking steps to preserve our assets for the benefit of our creditors and stockholders.'' 
 The company said it was still in talks with potential collaborators on deals that could raise money and is also talking with potential acquirers.
 The company went public at $17 a share in 2000, the year of a biotech investing frenzy in which dozens of companies issued stock. 
 Even after a recent reverse split aimed at building up the price per share by reducing the number of shares, the stock closed at 19 cents on Friday. That will be its last day of trading on a Nasdaq market because the company said it would not appeal a decision by Nasdaq to delist it.

HEADLINE: House Prices: The State Of the Bubble 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Richard A. Smith figured out how to make to make money in the real estate business early in his adult life. He bought his first home for $39,000 in the Atlanta area in 1979, selling it a year later for $43,000, the first of several transactions that he said made him ''nothing more than a good student of the industry.''
 ''I learned it early on that if you live in it, you improve it and you sell it,'' said Mr. Smith, chairman and chief executive of the soon-to-be-independent real estate services division of the Cendant Corporation. Cendant plans to split itself into four independent units by next summer. 
It was apt training for someone who heads two of the biggest brands in real estate -- Coldwell Banker and Century 21 -- at a time when it has become a national sport to predict whether real estate prices are justified or poised for a fall.
 Mr. Smith, who now lives in northern New Jersey in a home he and his wife moved into two years ago, discussed recently why he thinks -- like most other real estate industry executives -- that there is no national housing bubble.

Q. The question on everyone's mind is whether the housing market is slowing. What do you think?

A. Every year for the past five years we have forecasts about this time that there will be a slowing next year. Everyone from Fannie Mae to us has forecast that. There are very early indications that there is a slowing of a very, very strong market.

Q. What do you say to people who contend home prices in many markets are unjustified and will fall drastically?

A. It's an interesting topic for people that like to think that there is a new lion coming over the hill -- that there is a new thing to be worried about. It's an interesting thought but it's not supported by fact.
 There have always been year-over-year increases in prices. There have been unit declines in recessions, but not year-over-year price depreciation. There has always been price appreciation. The facts don't support a national bubble.
 Are there local bubbles? Absolutely, there have always been. Look at the savings and loan bubble in Texas -- property values plunged. Looking at California, Southern California had some very, very tough times.

Q. What is the primary driver of the soaring home prices in the last few years?

A. It's driven by population growth, per capita income growth, the supply-and-demand issues and job growth. If you factor those into any marketplace, as those numbers are moving in the right direction it's very, very unlikely that you have a property value issue. Where you don't have those favorable trends, you are susceptible to a decline in property values.

Q. Can you describe some of the trends that support your views on the long-term growth prospects of the housing market?

A. In the old days, the typical 50-year-old homeowner would downsize, sell the family home and buy something smaller. What is occurring now is that they are keeping the family home and buying the second and third home.
 The typical immigrant buys a home much faster than his or her historical counterpart. Thirty-five percent of the household formations forecasted for the next 10 years will be driven by Hispanics.

Q. The Justice Department's antitrust division has been looking into the practices of the real estate industry, specifically whether the industry is stifling competition. What do you think will come of the inquiry?

A. The barrier to entry in this industry is, in my view, virtually nonexistent. We think competition is incredibly robust and that's in part driven by the attractiveness of the industry.

Q. Some states are passing laws that require real estate brokers to provide a minimum level of service and that protect Realtors from discount brokers. What is your view?

A. We don't think minimum-service laws are necessary. The marketplace should determine that. A customer should be able to determine what he or she wants.

Q. How will being an independent, publicly traded company change your strategy?

A. Not much. Our business strategy has proven to be quite effective and I wouldn't characterize change to our business strategy as being specific or particular to the spinoff. From the very beginning, real estate has been self-contained. Our business units deliver business to one another.

HEADLINE: A Different Latin America

 BODY:
Bolivia's recent presidential election was almost as history making as Iraq's parliamentary vote. The winner, Evo Morales, will be the first member of the indigenous majority to run Bolivia since the conquistadors arrived nearly five centuries ago. His victory was one of the most decisive since the return of democracy more than two decades ago, ending an era of weak, unstable and ineffective governments. 
 But do not expect any toasts from the Bush administration. During the campaign, Mr. Morales advertised himself as Washington's ''nightmare.'' He opposes almost everything the Bush team stands for in Latin America, from combating coca leaf production to privatizing natural resources and liberalizing trade. His favorite Latin leaders are Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Fidel Castro of Cuba. And the political popularity of these anti-Washington positions is part of a growing regional trend.
 The political balance in Latin America has clearly been shifting to the left. Nearly 300 million of South America's 365 million people live under left-wing governments. While many of these governments, like Brazil's and Chile's, have worked hard to cooperate with the United States, others, like Venezuela's, have gone out of their way to bait Washington. Mr. Morales gives every indication of following the Chavez approach. And there could be similar lurches to the demagogic left in the numerous Latin American elections that are soon coming up in places like Peru, Mexico and Nicaragua.
 One explanation is that nearly two decades of Washington-recommended economic and trade policies have not done much for millions of urban and rural poor. Another is that the Bush administration has not shown much interest in addressing Latin American social problems. And Mr. Bush has done a terrible job of cultivating personal relationships with Latin American leaders. 
 Few countries adopted Washington's economic prescriptions more eagerly than Bolivia did in the 1980's and 90's. Yet despite considerable mineral and energy resources, it remains South America's poorest country, with 60 percent of its people living in poverty. The left-behind and angry poor voted for Mr. Morales in large numbers, as they have voted repeatedly for Mr. Chavez in Venezuela. 
 When denunciations of Yanqui imperialism in Latin America start coming from the presidential palaces as well as from the streets and opposition benches, Washington needs to change its ways. The friendship of neighbors is a terrible thing to lose.

HEADLINE: The Rebirth of Sri Lanka

BYLINE: By JOSHUA KURLANTZICK. 
JOSHUA KURLANTZICK is a special correspondent for The New Republic.

 BODY:
AT the opening of a boutique hotel and yoga retreat named Talalla Retreat Center, near a long stretch of white beach, an international crowd of stylish guests sips red wine and snacks on canapes. As evening wears into early morning, conversation shifts effortlessly from comparisons of the latest restaurants in London and Sydney to mutual friends burned out working for big investment banks, to high-end yoga teachers who charge $600 a lesson. One man says he's just returned from his 57th trip to Bali. 
 Only the subtle undertone of the conversation hints that residents of this area haven't had much to celebrate this year. Late in the night, a Talalla guest mentions the manager of a hotel, now on another part of the island, far from the beach. ''He moved because he lost his wife and child to the tsunami,'' another guest says softly.
Just a couple of years ago, this kind of upscale gathering would not have been uncommon in Sri Lanka. After a cease-fire that halted civil war between the ethnic Sinhalese-dominated government and ethnic Tamil insurgents in 2002, the lush, gorgeous island -- Sri Lankans compare their country to the Garden of Eden -- seemed poised for mass tourism. 
 Vacationers began arriving from abroad; small luxury hotels were opening in towns and along untouched coastlines. ''In 2003 and 2004, you couldn't get a hotel room,'' said Varini de Silva, owner of Ceylon Express International, a California-based Sri Lanka tour operator. 
 But one year ago, some 30,000 Sri Lankans died in the tsunami, villages were devastated, and weeks of news coverage showed the island's coast in ruins. ''After the cease-fire, there was this buzz here, because it was like a destination opened again -- like Sri Lanka had been found,'' says Gehan de Silva Wijeyeratne, who owns a travel company there. ''After the tsunami, people focused elsewhere. And now, to say, 'Well, we're open again ' Perhaps you can't get back that same excitement.'' 
 Or maybe you can. I've come to the Garden of Eden to see the ruins of palaces and shrines of one of the world's first Buddhist kingdoms, the stunning mix of mountain, jungle and beach. I've come wondering how Sri Lanka had been reborn in the past three years, as the brutal civil war seemed near its end and the country was opened to tourism again, revealing new details of its lost ruins and untrammeled beaches. And I've come to discover what happens to the next hot destination after disaster, whether the tsunami has brought together the island's population or driven it apart--and whether the tourists will ever be drawn to return. 
 Colombo, Sri Lanka's sprawling capital, had never really caught the buzz. The streets are choked with traffic; in fact, the narrowness of roads across Sri Lanka contributed to my decision to hire a driver and guide, Lalajith Manawadu. The pollution is an Oil of Olay executive's dream. Rather than waking from jet lag, I rose with a moisturizer emergency, my face raw.
 But as we drive out of Colombo toward Kandy, the precolonial royal capital and center of Buddhist heritage, and the beginning of Sri Lanka's hill country, I begin to understand why the teardrop-shaped island could be mistaken for Eden.
 The air becomes crisp, and the road climbs through thickly forested hills, past jungles crowded with so many jackfruit and teak trees that the plants create a canopy over the road. Sri Lanka has a long history of preservation -- the ancient King Devampiya reputedly created a wildlife park more than two thousand years ago -- and an enormous array of animals, plants and terrain for a country the size of Ireland. Often, it seemed I would be entering a new ecosystem just around a bend. 
 About four miles outside Kandy, at the Peradeniya Botanic Gardens, I strolled past a giant Javanese fig tree covered in roots that look like writhing snakes. As it rained, I took shelter in a greenhouse containing orchids in a bewildering array of colors: red, white, purple, purple with polka dots. 
 Compared with Colombo, Kandy seems like a village. The line to enter Temple of the Tooth, an ancient shrine reputedly containing a tooth of the Buddha, is short, though Lalajith told me that on important festival days, it can stretch for three miles. We arrive in time for the morning puja, a ceremony in which men in sarongs and turbans pound drums to welcome offerings. As the drums sound, pilgrims, some in white robes, others in Armani Exchange T-shirts, prostrate themselves. 
 Sri Lanka's colorful festivals, which drew both Sinhalese and Tamils after the 2002 cease-fire, are helping in the island's recovery. Last August, when Kandy held the Esala Perahera festival, celebrating the tooth relic, local hotels were unexpectedly packed. 
 The first high-end boutique hotel in the area, the Kandy House, opened only in August. Former manor of a minister to Kandyan kings, the house has been restored to its glory. After sleeping in a four-poster canopy bed, I sat on the back veranda in the morning, recovering from a swim in the large pool. 
 The Kandy House is not so unusual: Sri Lanka features a new crop of stylish luxury hotels that keep it on the international travel map. There is a precedent. Geoffrey Bawa, a Sri Lankan architect who died in 2003, was one of the fathers of Asian modernism, which incorporates local motifs to create buildings that reflect traditional Asian architecture. Today, many high-end hotels are refashioned Bawa creations. 
 Somewhat surprising to me, neither the tsunami nor this fall's violence in northern Sri Lanka, in which suspected Tamil insurgents killed police officers and other officials, has halted the hotel openings. ''Hotel owners in Sri Lanka think we're all sitting on a gold mine,'' because of the undiscovered scenery and English-speaking work force, said Miguel Cunat of Sri Lanka In Style, a new organization designed to promote luxurious sites and services. 
 Politics seem far away as we climb away from Kandy and into Sri Lanka's traditional tea-growing area, near the town of Nuwara Eliya, in the Hill Country 50 miles from Kandy. Created by British colonists, Nuwara Eliya still has gabled cottages that look as if they were airlifted from Dover. The winding road snakes past waterfalls and terraced plantations of tea and vegetables, which look like layered wedding cakes. The intense moisture has made the area the greenest, mossiest place I've ever seen. 
 When I open the window, the smell of tea wafts into the car, and I spy women plucking leaves into baskets on their backs. We stop at the Labookellie tea estate, where a guide, Christa, lets me watch the entire process, from plucking to drying to fermenting to tasting. I ask if America contributed to the tea industry. ''They invented the tea bag,'' she says, wrinkling her nose. ''No taste. But it does go quickly.'' 
 Though Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, being inland, were not struck by the tsunami, their tourist industries seem to have suffered from it. The beach areas apparently are drawing foreigners this year who came for tsunami relief, fell in love with the coast, and are returning for a holiday. 
 There is no crowd at the Hill Club, a British institution in Nuwara Eliya kept alive by upper-crust Sri Lankans. When I arrive in the early evening, the only person there is an elderly man in a white safari suit. I move from the long bar, which still has a men-only section, to the reading room, stuffed with books on World War I naval operations, to the formal dining hall. No nouvelle cuisine here: Waiters in crisp white suits serve heavy dishes like vegetable timbal. 
 As we descend from Nuwara Eliya to the southern coast, the scope of tsunami damage becomes clearer. Like the grim reaper's accountant, Lalajith reads off the number of people who died in each beach town. 
 We reach the south coast, where we will drive between the towns of Galle and Tangalle. In contrast to Thailand, where I'd been during the tsunami, and where reconstruction has gone relatively smoothly, here, a year after the disaster, many villagers are still living in blue tents. We pass gutted buildings like Milton's, an old hotel that was demolished, leaving only a line of toilets like a bizarre Duchamp sculpture. Even the sea turtles who come to the south coast, unflappable survivors, were affected, their egg-laying grounds destroyed. 
 Yet the south coast is also where the pre-tsunami buzz has come back strongest. The south coast tourist infrastructure has been rebuilt, and foreign residents have founded reconstruction projects like AdoptSriLanka, an aid organization started by Geoffrey Dobbs, proprietor of luxury hotels. 
 In Galle, the elite-hotel operator Aman Resorts has turned the 17th-century buildings that made up the New Oriental Hotel into a masterpiece called Amangalla, all high ceilings and deep, rich teak floors; Amangalla plugged on despite opening just before the tsunami. One block away, two Australians have revamped a Dutch merchant's villa into the Galle Fort Hotel, with rooms set around a courtyard pool surrounded by colonnades. The inspiration is catching: Around the corner, an 18th-century mansion has been restored into an even more intimate property, the Fort Printers, a five-room boutique hotel. ''A lot of people who want to try high-end boutique establishments still probably haven't been to Sri Lanka,'' says Karl Steinberg, co-owner of the Galle Fort Hotel. ''And there's nowhere in the world that's completely safe.''
 At the coast, I establish a routine of T.B.F.E.: temple, beach, fort, eat. I spend mornings at fanciful shrines, which reflect all the hues of the island, as well as its demons, and which became truly safe only as violence across the island subsided.
 One day, we drive to Mulkirigala, where Buddhists carved shrines out of a steep rock face. Inside the caverns, scenes from the Buddha's past come to life in raw colors. Another morning, we head to Kataluwa, where four artists depicted the hells faced by Buddhists who stray from the path, surreal visions of sinners with axes cleaving their skulls apart.
 Middays, I head to the ocean. On crescent-shaped Mirissa beach, south of Galle, the sand resembles fine dust. I share the beach only with men perched above the shallow water on stilts, a traditional Sri Lankan fishing style. In the afternoons, I always wind up inside the old fort in Galle, a Unesco World Heritage Site. First built by the Portuguese, the walled city was expanded by Dutch and British colonists and now is the center of boutique hotels, home to the Amangalla, Galle Fort and Printers. The tsunami spared those inside the 90-acre walled city. 
 Today, Galle is a warren of narrow streets reflecting the cosmopolitan heritage -- Marco Polo supposedly landed here, and for centuries the town was a trading capital. Jumbled together are austere Anglican churches painted blinding white, Dutch merchant houses, Buddhist shrines and pastel Iberian mansions topped with orange terra cotta tiles, which give Galle the feel of an Asian Riviera. 
 The walled city is not a museum in amber. In Courthouse Square, a cluster of colonial buildings, I stumble across Sri Lankan lawyers poring over piles of papers in the hot sun. Later that day, I am nearly overrun by local children, in matching purple and white outfits, singing hymns in unison. 
 That cosmopolitanism is turning Galle into a nascent Ubud, on Bali, the type of place that draws artsy foreigners who work with locals to create a design community. Down the street from the Galle Fort Hotel, transplants and locals are opening stores like Suthuvili, where a young Sri Lankan artist takes traditional mask styles and updates them, creating long, narrow figures that resemble Asian versions of Modigliani portraits. 
 Each day I search for curries. Sri Lankan food is not well known, but it resembles South Indian, the curries hotter and coconuttier, the ingredients fresher tasting. At Wijaya Beach Cottage, southeast of Galle, I sample simple fare -- grilled local seer fish. At the Sun House, a boutique hotel in the former home of a Galle spice merchant, I gorge on a curry feast. I down piles of string hoppers, the Sri Lankan version of dosa, wafer-thin sweet pancakes. Over the hoppers, I spoon mango chutneys, tamarind curries and pol sambol, grated coconut with a touch of lime and dried fish. 
 At the Sun House, reading a journal of reflections on the tsunami, I am convinced that Sri Lanka has an almost inexhaustible capacity to handle misfortune. For centuries, the small island survived waves of foreign conquerors. When blight destroyed the island's coffee plantations in the late 19th century, planters desperately switched to tea, which turned out to be a gold mine. A rich international crowd is once again building homes along the south coast.
 Better, despite rancor the Tamils and Sinhalese have cooperated on numerous rebuilding projects, an unprecedented change. Even the turtles are coming back; one villager near Tangalle proudly showed me flags marking where the massive reptiles recently laid eggs. Not for nothing does the island's name mean ''Lanka the Blessed.'' 
 No, I decide, the buzz about Sri Lanka can return -- but it will be a more intimate buzz, of a destination appealing to a small number of devotees, who will come back again and again. After all, memories of the tsunami may still turn off many travelers. People who want a stress-free sun holiday will worry about the tenuous political situation, and will head for less exotic destinations in the Caribbean or elsewhere. ''We'll get people who come here because they want to come to Sri Lanka, not just any beach,'' says Christopher Ong, co-owner of the Galle Fort Hotel. 
 Can Sri Lanka adapt to being an intimate destination, rather than a place for broader tourism, which many locals saw as economic salvation? I don't know. The day after the party at Talalla, Lalajith and I walk to the beach at Tangalle. To me, Tangalle's beach seemed an idyll -- we are alone, the kind of solitude virtually impossible to find in Thailand or the Caribbean. ''There's no one here,'' I mutter in bliss. 
 I glance over at Lalajith. ''Yes, no one here,'' he mutters, frowning. ''No one at all.'' He tosses a rock into the sea and walks back to the car.

MARCO POLO, AND NOW YOU

When to Go
 Late December and January is high season, with raised prices to match. The hill country tends to be relatively dry from November to late March, with the west and south coasts generally monsoon-free from December to early April. In July or August (the dates vary), the Esala Perahera festival in Kandy brings together acrobats, traditional dancers, drum players and jewel-covered elephants for processions honoring the Buddha's tooth. 
 Check the State Department's consular information sheet (travel.state.gov), which lists the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a terrorist organization and advises travelers to avoid political rallies but also notes that a cease fire has been in place, or news about Sri Lanka on the BBC's Web site, news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south--asia/default.stm, for information on the current political climate. 

How to Get There
 Emirates operates a code-share flights with Sri Lankan Airlines from New York to Colombo, via Dubai; this is generally the quickest route, though Emirates' flights tend to be booked well ahead. When I went in early November, I paid roughly $1,400 round trip. You can also connect to Colombo through Singapore on Singapore Airlines, and on British Airways, which flies to Colombo via London. Sri Lankan Airlines runs intermittent air taxi shuttles between Sri Lankan cities. 
 Because the standard of English in Sri Lanka is high, it's relatively easy to arrange trips yourself. And since many of Sri Lanka's boutique hotels are new, tour operators, who generally favor large hotels, may not be familiar with these smaller places. But some travel agents know them as well. Jetwing, (94-11) 2381201, www.jetwing.net, a local Sri Lankan operator, California-based Ceylon Express, 714-964-6896, www.ceylonexpress.com, and Carolanka, (44-1822) 810230, www.carolanka.co.uk, in Britain, are good choices. Jetwing also specializes in ecotourism. Sri Lanka In Style, (94-11) 2396666, www.srilankainstyle.com, also specializes in the boutique properties
 American vacationers are issued a 30-day tourist visa when they arrive in Sri Lanka. 

Where to Stay
 Some of these hotels set rates in U.S. dollars.
 In Colombo, I stayed at the Holiday Inn, 30 Sir Mohamed Macan Markar Mawatha, (94-11) 2422001, www.lanka.net/holiday, a middle-range hotel near the sea. The rooms have satellite television, and there is a pool and health club; I paid 6,084 rupees (about $60 at 104 rupees to the dollar) for a single, without breakfast. 
 Roughly four miles north of Kandy, I stayed at the Kandy House, (94-81) 4921394, anya--rowlands@hotmail.com. The finest hotel around, it's for people who want to stay in a place that feels like someone's home -- you'll wind up meeting the other guests, whether you like it or not. Through next month, rooms start at $110 a night, and are lower after that. Breakfast is included. 
 In Nuwara Eliya, I stayed at St. Andrews, (94-52) 2222445, 10 St. Andrew's Drive, hotels@jetwing.lk, set in the center of town with plenty of colonial ambience but threadbare rooms. Singles start at $100, except for the period around the holidays, when they start at $125. Breakfast is not included. Other options in the area include Tea Trails, (94-11) 2303888, www.teatrails.com, a new boutique hotel in old bungalows of British tea managers, roughly 90 minutes from Nuwara Eliya. Rooms start at $330 a night for two, all meals included.
 Along the south coast, between Tangalle and Galle, there are numerous new hotels, and it makes sense to bargain, even if only for a modest discount. In Tangalle, I stayed at the Eva Lanka, (94-47) 2240940, www.eva.lk, where small bungalows have gorgeous views over the sea. I was able to knock down the price of a bungalow from $100 per night to $70, without breakfast. Talalla Retreat Center, (94-41) 2259171, www.talallaretreatcentre.com, primarily aimed at yoga enthusiasts, is north of Tangalle. Rooms start at $70 a night. 
 Near Galle, I stayed 1.2 miles west of town on the Galle-Colombo Road at the Lighthouse Hotel and Spa, (94-9) 12224017, www.slh.com/sri--lanka/dadella/hotel--dadlig.html, a Geoffrey Bawa creation perched atop a rocky beach, allowing for sundowners on a gorgeous veranda. Rooms start at $250.
 If you prefer a more intimate experience, try the boutique hotels in Galle. Inside the Fort, the Fort Printers, 39 Pedlar Street, (94-9) 12247977, www.thefortprinters.com, offers five suites. Rates start at $100 in low season and $125 in high season, including breakfast. Down the street are the Galle Fort Hotel, 28 Church Street, (94-91) 2232870, www.galleforthotel.com, with rooms from $150, and the stately Amangalla, 10 Church Street, (94-91) 2233388, www.amanresorts.com/galla/home.htm, which offers rooms starting at $450 a night. 
 For a Galle boutique hotel outside the fort, the Sun House, 18 Upper Dickson Road, (94-91) 4380275, sunhouse@sri.lanka.net, has rooms from $150. 

Where to Eat
 Outside Colombo, Sri Lanka's restaurant scene is just beginning to develop. In the capital, the buffet dinner at Curry Leaf, at the Colombo Hilton, 2 Sir Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mawatha, (94-1) 12492492 , offers a good introduction to the range of Sri Lankan cuisine, from mild, coconutty fish curries to fiery stews of exotic bitter gourds. Dinner for one cost me roughly 1,500 rupees. The Mango Tree, 82 Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo, (94-11) 5379790, a chic bar and bistro, serves up some of the best Indian food in town. Lunch for one cost about 1,110 rupees.
 In the Hill Country, 8.5 miles east of Nuwara Eliya, the Tea Factory, (94-52) 2229526, www.aitkenspencehotels.com/teafactory, serves up solid curries. Dinner for one, with drinks, cost 1,015 rupees. The colonial ambience of the Hill Club, 29 Grand Hotel Road, (94-52) 2222653, hillclub@sltnet.lk, compensates for its food -- British rations from an age long before London's culinary revolution. Dinner for one costs about 1,500 rupees; jacket and tie required for men. 
 Traveling from the highlands to the south coast, be sure to stop at roadside vendors for coconut juice and wood apple, a tasty fruit that resembles a sweet-and-sour custard inside a hard shell. 
 Galle has the best range of restaurants on the south coast. Dinner at the Sun House, with drinks, cost me 2,700 rupees; upon request, the Sun House will pick you up in one of its classic cars. Wijaya Beach Cottage, Unawatuna beach, south of Galle, (94-777) 903431, does simple grilled seafood, like crabs, lobster and seer fish. A crab and fish feast, with drinks, cost about 1,600 rupees.

Information
 The Rough Guide is one of the best English-language guides to Sri Lanka, while the Luxe City Guide booklet offers a sassy, funny take on the country, particularly on luxury hotels and shopping. Since Sri Lanka has a large English-speaking population, it possesses several English-language newspapers. The Island and The Daily Mirror are considered more independent than the others. The small country also has produced a wealth of talented writers. Michael Ondaatje's ''Running in the Family'' is a memoir of his Sri Lankan family, while his novel ''Anil's Ghost'' is a somber chronicle of the effects of the civil war. JOSHUA KURLANTZICK

HEADLINE: Goodbye, Elevator Operator

 BODY:

Q -- I have lived in a rent-controlled apartment in a co-op building for more than 40 years. We have an elevator operator who also opens the front door for tenants and guests. Management plans to install a self-service elevator, and the elevator operator will become simply the doorman. One of the reasons I originally moved into the building was that the building had an elevator operator. Is this grounds for a reduction in rent under the rubric of reduced services under the rent-control regulations? Tom Connor, Manhattan.

A -- David Ng, a Manhattan lawyer who frequently represents tenants, said that for a rent-controlled tenant to get a rent reduction for elimination of a service, it must be considered an ''essential service'' -- one that has been provided, in most cases, since the tenancy began. 
And, Mr. Ng said, the issue of whether an essential service has been eliminated depends on the circumstances. 
 For example, he said, if all that the elevator operator does is press buttons to activate the elevator, it is not likely that the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, which makes decisions in these cases, would consider the elimination of the operator as grounds for a rent reduction. 
 On the other hand, he said, if it can be shown that the elevator operator enhances the security in the building, as opposed to just operating the elevator, then the state agency would probably grant a reduction.
 In fact, Mr. Ng said, a number of courts have ruled that under the rent regulations, elimination of attended-elevator service is considered a reduction of an essential service only if security is compromised. ''The courts,'' he said, ''have held that it is not a question of whether the conversion 'will result in a decrease in vertical transportation,' but whether it will result in a material decrease in security.'' 
 So, Mr. Ng said, since the elevator operator is to continue as a doorman -- arguably providing a security function -- the elimination of his role as an elevator operator is not likely to be considered elimination of an essential service.

A Certificate of Occupancy In a 1919 Building

Q -- I am an owner of an apartment in an eight-unit building that was recently converted to a condo. Although the units were renovated, the original layout and number of units did not change. Seven of the eight units were sold, and there is a tenant in the eighth unit owned by the sponsor. The building was built in 1919 and there is no certificate of occupancy. Do we need one now, and, if so, how were the apartments sold without one? R. Factor, Brooklyn.

A -- Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Buildings, said that buildings constructed before 1938, when the requirement for a certificate of occupancy was established, do not require a certificate unless the building has been significantly altered, the use of the building has changed or the total number of apartments has increased. So, she said, it would appear that the letter writer's building does not require a certificate of occupancy.

HEADLINE: Professors' Politics Draw Lawmakers Into the Fray

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
While attending a Pennsylvania Republican Party picnic, Jennie Mae Brown bumped into her state representative and started venting.
 ''How could this happen?'' Ms. Brown asked Representative Gibson C. Armstrong two summers ago, complaining about a physics professor at the York campus of Pennsylvania State University who she said routinely used class time to belittle President Bush and the war in Iraq. As an Air Force veteran, Ms. Brown said she felt the teacher's comments were inappropriate for the classroom.
The encounter has blossomed into an official legislative inquiry, putting Pennsylvania in the middle of a national debate spurred by conservatives over whether public universities are promoting largely liberal positions and discriminating against students who disagree with them. 
 A committee held two hearings last month in Pittsburgh and has scheduled another for Jan. 9 in Philadelphia. A final report with any recommendations for legislative remedy is due in June.
 The investigation comes at a time when David Horowitz, a conservative commentator and president of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture, has been lobbying more than a dozen state legislatures to pass an ''Academic Bill of Rights'' that he says would encourage free debate and protect students against discrimination for expressing their political beliefs.
 While Mr. Horowitz insists his campaign for intellectual diversity is nonpartisan, it is fueled, in large measure, by studies that show the number of Democratic professors is generally much larger than the number of Republicans. A survey in 2003 by researchers at Santa Clara University found the ratio of Democrats to Republicans on college faculties ranged from 3 to 1 in economics to 30 to 1 in anthropology. 
 Mr. Horowitz said he was pushing for legislation only because schools across the country were ignoring their own academic freedom regulations and a founding principle of the American Association of University Professors, which says schools are better equipped to regulate themselves without government intervention.
 ''It became apparent to me that universities have a problem,'' he said in an interview. ''And nothing was being done about it.''
 Mr. Horowitz and his allies are meeting forceful resistance wherever they go, by university officials and the professors association, which argues that conservatives are overstating the problem and, by seeking government action, are forcing their ideology into the classroom. 
 ''Mechanisms exist to address these glitches and to fix them,'' said Joan Wallach Scott, a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and former chairwoman of the professors association committee on academic freedom, in testimony at the Pennsylvania Legislature's first hearing. ''There is no need for interference from outside legislative or judicial agencies.''
 In a debate with Mr. Horowitz last summer, Russell Jacoby, a history professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, portrayed Mr. Horowitz's approach as heavy-handed. ''It calls for committees or prosecutors to monitor the lectures and assignments of teachers,'' he said. ''This is a sure-fire way to kill free inquiry and whatever abuses come with it.''
 So far, the campaign has produced more debate than action. Colorado and Ohio agreed to suspend legislative efforts to impose an academic bill of rights in favor of pledges by their state schools to uphold standards already in place. Georgia passed a resolution discouraging ''political or ideological indoctrination'' by teachers, encouraging them to create ''an environment conducive to the civil exchange of ideas.''
 While comparable efforts failed in three other states, measures are pending in 11 others. In Congress, House and Senate committees passed a general resolution this year encouraging American colleges to promote ''a free and open exchange of ideas'' in their classrooms and to treat students ''equally and fairly.'' It awaits floor action next year. 
 Mr. Horowitz's center has spawned a national group called Students for Academic Freedom that uses its Web site to collect stories from students who say they have been affected by political bias in the classroom. The group says it has chapters on more than 150 campuses.
 The student group has fielded concerns from people like Nathaniel Nelson, a former student at the University of Rhode Island and a conservative, who said a philosophy teacher he had during his junior year referred often to his own homosexuality and made clear his dislike for Mr. Bush.
 Mr. Nelson, now a graduate student at the University of Connecticut, said in an interview that the teacher frequently called on him to defend his conservative values while making it clear he did not care for Republicans.
 ''On the first day of class, he said, 'If you don't like me, get out of my class,' '' Mr. Nelson said. ''But it was the only time that fall the course was being offered, and I wanted to take it.''
 Marissa Freimanis said she encountered a similar situation in her freshman English class at California State University, Long Beach, last year. Ms. Freimanis said the professor's liberal bias was clear in the class syllabus, which suggested topics for members of the class to write about. One was, ''Should Justice Sandra Day O'Connor be impeached for her partisan political actions in the Bush v. Gore case?''
 ''Of course, I felt very uncomfortable,'' Ms. Freimanis, who is a Republican, said in an interview. 
 In Pennsylvania, lawmakers are examining whether the political climate at 18 state-run schools requires legislation to ban bias. Mr. Armstrong said he discussed the issue in several conversations with Mr. Horowitz ''as an expert in the field'' before calling for the creation of a committee.
 ''But I don't know if his Academic Bill of Rights is necessary in Pennsylvania,'' Mr. Armstrong said in an interview. ''Before we have legislation to change a problem, we first have to determine whether the problem exists. If it does exist, the next question is, 'Is it significant enough to require legislation?' ''
 ''So the question I'm asking,'' he added, ''is, 'Do we have a problem in Pennsylvania?' ''
 For now, the answer is unclear. While Mr. Armstrong said he had received complaints from ''about 50 students'' who said they were intimidated by professors expressing strong political views, Democratic members of the committee have called the endeavor a waste of time, and the Republican chairman, Representative Thomas L. Stevenson, seemed to agree.
 ''If our report were issued today,'' Mr. Stevenson said, ''I'd say our institutions of higher education are doing a fine job.''

 BODY:
IN the Middle Ages, monks argued over how many angels could dance on the head of a pin. In 21st-century New York, real estate wonks bring a similarly recondite intensity to the debate over who owns the most expensive apartment. 
 As everyone who has been paying attention knows by now, the top Manhattan sale of 2005 was the top sale of all time in the borough: Rupert Murdoch's co-op penthouse at 834 Fifth Avenue, at 64th Street, for which he paid $44 million. The media baron went to contract on the triplex last year and closed this year, on May 12.
Another notable closing in 2005 involved the British financier David Martinez, who set the pre-Murdochian record for an apartment when he paid $42.25 million in August 2003, for the 76th floor and part of the 77th floor of the south tower of the Time Warner Center. Not to be outdone, Mr. Martinez added to his sky-high spread in July, paying $12.51 million for the rest of the 77th floor, bringing his total investment, before the cost of building out the raw space, to $54.76 million. 
 Purists, however, will argue that Mr. Murdoch's purchase represents the highest price for a single sale. No one ever cared how many angels danced on the heads of two pins, they might say. Either way, both men are spending lavishly to turn their humble abodes into something they can call home -- Mr. Murdoch, because his new apartment hadn't been renovated in years, and Mr. Martinez, because he bought raw space that needed to be completely built out. That includes millions to rip out part of the floor of the upper unit to make a double-height ceiling for the living room. Once everything is added up, Mr. Martinez will have shelled out far more than his rival across the park.
 In any case, Mr. Murdoch's single-sale record apparently has already been eclipsed by a recent transaction at 15 Central Park West, where a penthouse is reportedly in contract for about $45 million. The building is under construction, and that deal is not likely to close before mid-2007. 
 Meanwhile, the highest price for a Manhattan condo closing this year -- based on deeds filed so far with the city -- was $29 million, for the top floor of Time Warner's north tower, according to Gregory J. Heym, the director of research and chief economist for Brown Harris Stevens. The buyer was Sandra N. Tillotson, a senior vice president of the Nu Skin cosmetics company.
 The highest price paid for a Manhattan town house this year was $30 million, for Gianni Versace's former home at 5 East 64th Street, according to Mr. Heym. City records identify the buyer as Thomas Sandell, a hedge fund manager.
 The highest price in Brooklyn was recorded in Brooklyn Heights. A book agent, Nina Collins, and her husband, Marek Fludzinski, a hedge fund executive, paid $8.5 million for a 25-foot wide, five-story brownstone in need of renovation.

On this morning of all mornings, the story of Christianity can seem smooth, straightforward, even sweet. With its angels and shepherds and luminous star in the sky, Christmas understandably tends to the cheerful; the faithful ponder the creche, not the cross. Amid all this, it is unsettling to recall that Christianity is a confounding, often paradoxical faith. A father who sacrifices his son? A king who dies a criminal's death? A God whose weakness is his strength? Even St. Paul admitted that faith in Jesus required, if not what Samuel Taylor Coleridge later called a ''willing suspension of disbelief,'' then at least an honest acknowledgment that much about the new religion surpassed understanding. There were often as many questions as answers. When the angel Gabriel tells Mary that she is to bear Jesus, her first, shaky words are: ''How can this be, since I know not a man?'' On the morning of the Resurrection, terrified by the empty tomb, Mary Magdalene runs to Peter and John to say: ''They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.'' We do not know. And so it was that the faith now confessed by two billion people was born in fear and confusion.
 Christianity is difficult, both in practice and in theory. Following in the Judaic tradition of valuing human reason, Christians treasure the mind as a gift of God, and the faithful are called to use his gifts to the fullest; to fail to do so is a sin. Every believer, says the author of the First Epistle of St. Peter, should ''be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.'' The admonition is a good one, for it encourages the faithful to ask questions, and in asking questions, one enters the debate about God and man that began with the ancient pagans. 
 The suggestion that Christianity is a matter of both intellect and imagination, however, has fallen from popular favor. Many secularists see the whole business as fanciful, or, at best, as a comforting tale impossible to square with empirical truths. To literalist believers, imagination is beside the point: in their eyes, inerrant Scripture teaches humankind all it really needs to know.
 The current clash between secularism and religion in America is not new, but it is fierce. From Salem in the 17th century, to the Scopes trial in the 20th, to abortion rights, stem-cell research and ''intelligent design'' in the 21st, it appears that such conflicts will, as Jesus said of the poor, be always with us. Now as in the past, it is fashionable for many on the left to caricature the faithful as superstitious and stiff-necked; on the right, conservatives attack the skeptical with anything but Christian charity. Yet whether one believes or disbelieves, many of us would like to see a calmer, more measured conversation about faith and reason than we have had in recent years. We might well begin with those on each extreme acknowledging that life is essentially mysterious: the world does not lend itself to simple explanation. ''O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!'' Paul wrote. ''How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!'' For the secular, there is Hamlet: ''There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.''
 In my view, allowing for the existence of a transcendent order seems sounder than flatly denying the possibility altogether. ''Reason itself is a matter of faith,'' G. K. Chesterton wrote. ''It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all.'' Light can neither enter into nor emanate from a closed mind, and intellectual humility -- acknowledging what we do not, and cannot, know -- is often the beginning of wisdom.
 There is not much humility to be found in the pages of Rodney Stark's provocative new book, ''The Victory of Reason.'' If one had been asked to choose in the ninth century A.D. which part of the world would dominate the others for much of the coming millennium, one would almost certainly have put money on the world of Islam -- not on Western Europe. Why Europe and its New World colonies rose to pre-eminence after the close of the Middle Ages is arguably the single greatest puzzle of modern history. Stark, however, is not puzzled. His answers are crisp, certain and to the point. Four decades ago the historian William McNeill credited Europe's ascent to its taste for war, its navigational techniques and its resistance to disease; more recently -- and more vividly -- Jared Diamond argued that guns, germs and steel decided the fate of the world. Now comes Stark, a prolific sociologist of religion, with a different argument. ''Christianity,'' he writes, ''created Western Civilization.'' He believes that the Christian emphasis on reason was the motive force in the West's rise to global dominance: ''While the other world religions emphasized mystery and intuition, Christianity alone embraced reason and logic as the primary guide to religious truth.''
 Stark is right to argue that the idea that Christianity is incompatible with reason, a line of thought running from Celsus in the late second century to the philosophes of the Enlightenment, does not withstand historical scrutiny. In many ways, Christianity was a force for good in the West -- though as the Inquisition, pogroms and centuries of intolerance show, it could also be a force for evil, a fact believers ought to confront, confess and guard against.
 Stark is apparently not one for such confrontation and confession, and therein lies a problem with his argument: he is offering an absolutist answer to one of history's most complex questions. Intent on demolishing the familiar secular thesis that religion impeded progress in economics, science and politics, Stark gets carried away. Crediting Christianity with the good things of life while neglecting the faith's shortcomings, he takes only the most fleeting account of the cultural, philosophical and religious tributaries that helped create the West's mighty river. ''Had the followers of Jesus remained an obscure Jewish sect, most of you would not have learned to read and the rest of you would be reading from hand-copied scrolls,'' he writes. ''Without a theology committed to reason, progress and moral equality'' -- all of which could describe faiths other than Christianity -- ''today the entire world would be about where non-European societies were in, say, 1800: a world with many astrologers and alchemists but no scientists. A world of despots, lacking universities, banks, factories, eyeglasses, chimneys and pianos. . . . A world truly living in 'dark ages.' '' For Stark, Christianity was the only thing standing between us and such a gloomy fate, for, he writes, the Christian love of reason helped create the whole idea of progress in all fields of human endeavor. 
 Christianity was unquestionably an enormous factor in the story of Western progress. But there were others. Geography (Islam coveted Byzantium, not Europe), economics (Europe was less dependent on the vagaries of agriculture than other parts of the world) and tradition (in the form of the contributions of other cultures) were essential, too. China created gunpowder and paper and the compass; before the monks could preserve the manuscripts of the classics, Islam rescued the works of Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, laid strong foundations in science and medicine and helped create a global market linking Europe with the East through the Islamic world. History did not begin with Augustine or Aquinas. To return to Chesterton, a view like Stark's overlooks the role of tradition -- the handing on of the work of previous generations. 
 Tradition, Chesterton wrote during the Edwardian Age, ''means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be walking about. . . . We will have the dead at our councils.'' Stark declines to acknowledge the debt Christians owe their Islamic, Jewish, Greek, Roman, Hindu, Buddhist, Confucian and Taoist fathers. He fails to count all the ballots of the dead and does not really care to: in his eyes, the future not only belonged to Christianity --Christianity basically created the future. In the early years of the faith, he writes, ''the church fathers taught that reason was the supreme gift from God and the means to progressively increase their understanding of Scripture and revelation. Consequently, Christianity was oriented to the future, while the other major religions asserted the superiority of the past.''
 Yet Christianity has never had a monopoly on rational theology or on a concern for the future. Greece and Rome came first, and without the classical principle of ''noncontradiction'' -- the idea that a faith could assert, for example, that ''Jesus is Lord'' and no one else is -- it would have been much more difficult, if not impossible, for Christianity to express its faith in doctrine. Judaism and Islam, meanwhile, have long histories of approaching scripture allegorically and critically. Stark quotes the Koran as evidence of Islam's supposed innate emphasis on fundamentalism: the text, the verse says, is ''the Scripture whereof there is no doubt.'' Many Christians, though, have taken the words of II Timothy -- ''all Scripture is inspired by God'' -- to mean that the Bible is inerrant. The fact that Jesus himself spoke so often in parables signals the nature and richness of the Jewish approach to theology and philosophy. Philo of Alexandria, a Hellenistic Jew, was a seminal interpreter of Scripture and tradition. His application of classical thought, logical rigor and literary criticism to Jewish texts foreshadowed and shaped the rationality Stark attributes to Christian thinkers. (Philo is not mentioned in the book.) Talmudic and Rabbinic Judaism are built on argument and reflection. Maimonides, who flourished under Islamic rulers, argued that the discoveries of science and philosophy could not be incompatible with the truths ordained by God (Maimonides is not mentioned either). In Islam, every verse of the Koran, meanwhile, is an ''ayah,'' or a ''sign,'' to ponder in order to recognize and understand the divine. One of the four basic ''roots'' in Islamic jurisprudence is reasoning. 
 ''The Victory of Reason'' is more polemic than history, which is too bad, for Stark is on to something important. The author of many books, including the brilliant ''Rise of Christianity,'' he is a consistently interesting writer, and provocation is not necessarily a bad thing. Big debates sometimes need to be shaken up, and intellectual life would be much the poorer without writers advancing bracing, if incomplete, arguments. In this case, Stark is most likely being deliberately contrarian in the hope that his argument will penetrate minds long fortified by Mencken-like snobbery about the Christian intellectual tradition. To me, however, the most relevant lesson of the book is not how much Christianity has done for the world through reason, but how much reason has done, and still must do, for Christianity. 
 From Paul to Origen of Alexandria and beyond, the faith has fueled much intellectual good. In 1925, Alfred North Whitehead, whom Stark cites, argued that Christianity helped make Western science possible. It was the Christian idea of God, ''conceived as with the personal energy of Jehovah and with the rationality of a Greek philosopher,'' Whitehead wrote, that rewarded reasoned thinking and exploration.
 Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism and Taoism, it is true, are not monotheistic -- there is, to use Whitehead's imagery, no single philosophical Jehovah. Yet each culture has made its share of contributions to the rising tide of civilization, from developments in mathematics, the sciences and rational philosophy in India to philosophical thought and early inventions in China to the flowering of thought, high culture, economic systems and scientific achievement in medieval Islamic societies.
 Christianity has also had its share of dark intellectual hours. Stark mentions Galileo only twice, both times in passing, which is unfortunate, for there were voices in the Galileo affair arguing for a more reasoned reaction to the new science than condemnation and house arrest. It was Galileo who understood, better than his persecutors, how to reconcile apparent contradictions between faith and science. If reason leads humankind to discover a truth that seems to be incompatible with the Bible, Galileo argued, then the interpretation of Scripture, not the rational conclusion, should give way. In this he was echoing Augustine, who wrote: ''If it happens that the authority of sacred Scripture is set in opposition to clear and certain reasoning, this must mean that the person who interprets Scripture does not understand it correctly.'' Such is the intellectual footwork of a believer who is unprepared to allow the possibility that the Bible might be fallible, but Augustine's work enables Christians to take advantage of scientific and social advances without surrendering the ultimate authority of revelation. Guided by these lights, despite its sins and shortcomings, the church has ultimately removed the biblical support for the ideas that the earth, not the sun, is the physical center of the universe, that slavery is divinely ordained or that women are property. 
 In the West, a combination of curiosity and courage, one with roots in both classical and monotheistic thinking, enabled Europeans to set out, learn from other cultures and put that borrowed knowledge to work, often on a grand scale. As Bernard Lewis and others have pointed out, Europe had more reason to be interested in Islam than Islam did in Europe. Christianity's holiest places were under Muslim control after earlier, short-lived crusader kingdoms in Jerusalem. Islam was also a military threat to Europe; on two occasions, one in the 16th century, the other in the 17th, the Turks nearly conquered Vienna. The Western hunger for information and invention was not intrinsically Christian. It was, rather, intrinsically human. That the questing Europeans were Christian was not insignificant, but their faith in Jesus was hardly their sole motive. 
 Stark is to be commended for celebrating the rational element of Christian religion and culture -- a part that deserves celebration and needs to be recovered. To paraphrase John Donne, though, Christian Europe was not an island. To act as if it were amounts to a sin of pride -- and, as the Book of Proverbs says, ''Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.''
 Pride is fueling an unhappy trend toward Christian self-satisfaction in the United States. Though roughly 80 percent of Americans identify themselves as Christians, conservative evangelicals have long felt themselves under siege, particularly since the 1962 Supreme Court decision banning government-written prayer in public schools. In reaction they have spent the ensuing four decades becoming a major political force. Instead of reading Stark as an amicus brief for the faith, though, believers might be best off taking his case for an intellectually curious Christianity to heart. 
 Such a faith might profitably begin with a consideration of Augustine, who argued for the significance not only of reason but of free will -- the idea that people have it within their power to choose to accept God and follow his commandments in the hope of attaining everlasting life. We are also free to choose another course, one leading, in religious terms, away from God. This is not esoteric theology, for free will is linked to a question central to American life: religious liberty. If the prevailing culture can coerce the reluctant to say prayers they do not wish to say, then faith is no longer a matter of free will. To render religion compulsory cheapens it and turns the entire enterprise into a sinful one, for the majority is making an idol of itself by compelling obedience -- something God himself refuses to do. 
 An important new book, ''Taking Religious Pluralism Seriously,'' edited by Barbara A. McGraw and Jo Renee Formicola, lays out the history of tolerance in the United States while urgently reminding us what is at stake when we speak, as we so often do, of ''church and state'' or ''moral values'' or ''the culture wars.'' A series of essays by various contributors, the volume discusses religion in America's public square from the perspective of different traditions and recovers early American thought on the connection between God and politics. Exploring John Locke's influence on the founders, McGraw writes that, contrary to prevailing academic sentiment, Locke was not a ''secular'' philosopher. ''Locke did not reject religion,'' she writes. ''Instead, he shifted to a different religious idea based on a very simple theology: there is God, and God communicates with the people.'' Hence the centrality of religious liberty. ''This is why freedom of conscience must be preserved: so that the people can listen for and hear the voice of God and participate in society according to that call,'' McGraw says. By ''God,'' the founders meant many things. They referred to a supernatural presence by the following terms: ''Supreme Governor of the Universe,'' ''Governor of the Universe,'' ''the Universal Sovereign,'' ''Nature's God,'' ''Creator,'' ''Supreme Judge of the World'' and ''Divine Providence.'' McGraw coined the term ''America's Sacred Ground'' a few years ago, a social science construct with subsidiary parts called the ''Civic Public Forum'' and the ''Conscientious Public Forum,'' about which the contributors speak as though these were geographical places (for example, such and such issue should be debated on ''America's Sacred Ground'' in the same way one would say something should be debated in, say, Boston or Atlanta). The technical terms are distracting, but distraction is a small price to pay for the book's valuable insights and welcome spirit of moderation.
 The politics of what is called, depending on where you stand, the ''religious right'' or ''the faith-based community'' are put in devastating historical context. In the volume's best essay, Derek H. Davis examines what he calls ''The Baptist Tradition of Religious Liberty,'' invoking the denomination's history of insisting that the church follow Jesus' lead in rendering to God those things which are God's, and to Caesar those things which are Caesar's. ''According to traditional Baptist belief, a government that gives preferential treatment to certain religious beliefs breaches the eternal and inalienable rights of each individual,'' Davis writes, ''and disobeys the will of God'' -- a message that will probably surprise some in the pews and pulpits of politically active congregations. John Leland, an 18th-century Baptist evangelist who worked with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to secure religious freedom in Virginia, wrote: ''Let every man speak freely without fear, maintain the principles that he believes, worship according to his own faith, either one God, three Gods, no God, or twenty Gods; and let government protect him in doing so.'' 
 Leland's image of the free man going about his business, answerable only to himself and his conscience so long as he does no harm to others, turns our attention away from theology and politics to what religion actually is for most people: the prayers they say, the emotions they feel, the questions they ask. In a lovely, interesting new book, ''Prayer: A History,'' Philip and Carol Zaleski explore this most personal of religious practices in an ecumenical spirit. Defining prayer as an ''action that communicates between human and divine realms,'' the authors trace its long and rich history, from evidence of Neanderthal prayers for the dead to Franny's ''Jesus Prayer'' in J. D. Salinger's ''Franny and Zooey.'' Thomas Merton called the exercise ''a raid on the unspeakable''; Solomon beseeched the Lord to grant ''whatever prayer, whatever supplication is made by any man or by all thy people Israel''; Ramakrishna sought ''God-Consciousness'' through spiritual rapture.
 The beginning of tragedy, it has been said, came when a suffering mortal first raised his hands to the heavens and cried, ''Why?'' This, too, is a prayer, a manifestation of the longing to make sense of the insensible. For many, the answer has led them to become one of the children of Abraham. For many others, the answer lies with the Buddha's Dharma (or Teaching), or with Brahman, or with the Tao, or with Confucius. For many others, the answer comes from the sciences or from secular philosophy. The common thread is the search for comfort and order in a world that inevitably falls short of our expectations. The common hope is that perhaps one day, as St. John the Divine said in an echo of Isaiah, ''there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.''
 On Christmas morning 1825, John Henry Newman, a young man of ferocious intellect and intense faith who had just been ordained an Anglican priest (he would die a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church), preached a sermon while a curate of St. Clement's Church, Oxford. ''It is a day of joy: it is good to be joyful -- it is wrong to be otherwise,'' Newman said. ''Let us seek the grace of a cheerful heart, an even temper, sweetness, gentleness and brightness of mind, as walking in His light and by His grace.'' Such was the view of a questing and committed Christian, a view not so different from that of Robert Ingersoll, the 19th-century American agnostic. ''Christmas is a good day to forgive and forget -- a good day to throw away prejudices and hatreds -- a good day to fill your heart and your house, and the hearts and houses of others, with sunshine.'' Newman thought the brightness came from the Christ child; Ingersoll from simple human kindness. The important thing is that both detected light and each cherished it according to the dictates of his own mind and his own heart -- an encouraging sign that there is more than one way to overcome the darkness.

TAB HUNTER CONFIDENTIAL: The Making of a Movie Star. By Tab Hunter with Eddie Muller. (Algonquin, $24.95.) The interesting thing about Hunter has never been his soporific movies, like ''Island of Desire'' or ''Lust in the Dust,'' or even his treacly 1957 hit single, ''Young Love.'' It's himself. In his memoir, Hunter provides a mesmerizing account of his Candide-like journey through Hollywood. Never a gifted actor, Hunter, who grew up in Southern California, rode his all-American looks to a seven-year studio contract with Warner Brothers, which signed him up at age 23 and transformed him almost overnight into a teeny-bopper idol. 
The twist, of course, was that Hunter, like any number of Hollywood leading men, was gay. He soon chafed under a rigid studio system that seemed designed to wring any lingering vestiges of spontaneity out of filmmakers and actors, though it had some advantages. It offered not only a steady salary, but protection from scurrilous rags like Confidential magazine, which sought to out the stars of the day. Hunter offers shrewd assessments of the studio moguls Jack Warner and Harry Cohn, as well as hilarious anecdotes about working with Natalie Wood, Rita Hayworth and Lana Turner. After Warner Brothers cut him loose, Hunter's career stalled, but how sorry can you feel for someone who was whizzing around Capri and hanging out with Ingrid Bergman in his mid-20's? His foray into Tinseltown's past should help revive his name, but not, one suspects, his films.
THE SOLITUDE OF SELF: Thinking About Elizabeth Cady Stanton. By Vivian Gornick. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $17.) Gornick has sandwiched an insightful biography of the leading 19th-century suffragist, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, between introductory and concluding remarks about the state of contemporary feminism. Stanton, a fiery orator (Gornick often quotes her to good effect), was instrumental in organizing the first women's rights convention, which was held in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848. According to Gornick, today's movement continues to face the same problems within its ranks that infuriated Stanton -- timidity and the refusal to acknowledge that women and men ''are isolated within themselves through a sense of shame that is native to humanity.'' Stanton, Gornick writes, ''also saw the sadness and pathos of that isolation mirrored in the rooted resistance to social change.'' But, she continues, ''I do not think she saw that in America that humiliated loneliness . . . would be put to great and good use in service to liberation movements in general, and the cause of women's rights in particular.'' It would? Gornick is far more persuasive on Stanton's life than when psychologizing about the beneficent effects of loneliness.
 ILLICIT: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats Are Hijacking the Global Economy. By Moises Naim. (Doubleday, $26.) Naim, the editor of Foreign Policy magazine, contends that the Bush administration's focus on traditional nation-states as the sources of terrorism and other maladies is a costly illusion. Instead, he concentrates on the modern-day buccaneers who are fleecing and menacing governments in rich and poor countries, whether by pirating movies or by smuggling weapons of mass destruction. The one thing uniting this disparate group of desperadoes, terrorists and unscrupulous officials, Naim says, goes back to Adam Smith: All it takes to get involved is an interest in the profit motive. Well-organized and informative, Naim's book includes portraits of everyone from A. Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear program, to Ronald K. Noble, the head of Interpol -- and a mass of supporting detail that at times will excite only the most wonkish nerds. So eager is Naim to buttress his thesis that he probably underestimates the durability of nation-states. Still, he provides a valuable antidote to the notion that they are all that counts.
 A WORLD OF LIGHT. By Floyd Skloot. (University of Nebraska, $24.95.) Skloot, the author of ''In the Shadow of Memory,'' is an accomplished writer. In this collection of polished essays, he excavates his own past, contrasting his battles with a declining memory, brought on by a virus he contracted years ago, with his aged mother's descent into Alzheimer's disease. He explains that he ignored her for much of his life, only to reunite with her in what he sees as a delayed reconciliation once her powers had faded. But what is missing beneath the perfectly chiseled diamonds that he holds up for inspection is a sense of passion and emotional engagement. These essays, while laudably free of false sentimentality, inadvertently commit the opposite sin of becoming almost wholly antiseptic. Skloot gives us no real reason to care much about the fate of his mother. Instead, he writes most effectively when he recounts how he wooed the daughter of a landscape contractor, who views ''college boy'' with something less than fervent admiration and makes his life working on the crew a living hell. ''I wouldn't go so far as to say the Summer of Love taught me to understand who I was,'' Skloot recollects. ''More likely, it taught me who I wasn't.''
 ELEPHANT'S EDGE: The Republicans as a Ruling Party. By Andrew J. Taylor. Foreword by Norman J. Ornstein. (Praeger, $44.95.) This book is the latest entry in a growing field devoted to deciphering the success of the Republican Party in national politics. Taylor provides few new insights, but then so much has already been written about Rove & Company that any fresh arguments would most likely seem bogus. What Taylor provides instead is a sturdy survey of the far-ranging efforts of the Republican Party, whether in rigging the tax code or exploiting the Terri Schiavo case, to cement its majority status. The most Taylor himself is willing to argue is that the Republicans have obtained not a majority but a ''perceptible edge'' of electoral support. The party's current difficulties would come as no surprise to Taylor, who points to a number of potential infirmities, not least the peril of corruption scandals.
 LEGENDS OF MODERNITY: Essays and Letters From Occupied Poland, 1942-1943. By Czeslaw Milosz. Translated by Madeline G. Levine. Introduction by Jaroslaw Anders. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) The young Milosz lived in Warsaw during the German occupation, writing for Polish underground publications and translating T. S. Eliot's ''Waste Land.'' This volume, ably translated for the first time into English by Madeline G. Levine, includes essays from that period as well as fascinating epistolary exchanges between Milosz and the writer Jerzy Andrzejewski, who went on to become a member of the postwar Communist Party but broke with it in the 1960's, almost 20 years after Milosz had written ''The Captive Mind,'' about Communism and intellectuals. Milosz opens this volume with an essay linking Robinson Crusoe to original sin and Protestantism; like Thomas Mann's analysis of Goethe's Faust, it contains profound insights about evil so lucidly explained that they appear blindingly obvious. In discussing Stendhal, Gide and nihilism, Milosz condemns Nietzsche, probably excessively, as not simply the expression of his age but a progenitor of totalitarianism who subordinated truth to action. Nietzsche, Milosz says, ''cast a spell that explains nearly the entire intellectual ferment of the past century . . . an era when truth was chained to the heavy, armor-plated mass of the deed. Then everything that is useful, everything that whips people and rouses them to do battle, that enrages and multiplies power, is called truth.'' These early reflections by Milosz, written in the midst of unspeakable horror, form a remarkable testament to an uncaptive mind consecrated to living in truth.

 her designs include maps, crossword puzzles and floor plans. ''I am sure,'' she writes in a preface, ''that the patience of many postmen has been severely tested.''

HEADLINE: What Makes a Nation More Productive? It's Not Just Technology

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
IN 2001, the stock market meltdown and a brief recession threw cold water on the widely held belief that the United States economy, juiced by a technological revolution, had entered a new era of limitless, inflation-free growth. But today, as bubble-era books like ''Dow 36,000'' collect dust on library shelves, evidence is mounting that there may be a new economy after all.
 In the late 1990's, growth in labor productivity -- the amount of output per hour per worker -- kicked into a higher gear. From 1996 through 1999, it grew at a blistering annual rate of 2.5 percent, compared with 1.4 percent from 1972 to 1995. Economists generally believed that the higher rate was a byproduct of the new economy. Much of the growth was spurred by the highly productive businesses that made information technology products -- companies like Dell, Intel and Microsoft -- and by their customers, who spent heavily to deploy productivity-enhancing PC's and software. 
''About half of the growth resurgence from 1995 to 2000 was due to I.T.,'' said Dale Jorgenson, university professor at Harvard and a co-author of the recently published ''Information Technology and the American Growth Resurgence.'' 
 As the technology investment boom of the 1990's gave way to bust in 2000, many analysts feared that the productivity gains would dissipate. Instead, productivity since 2000 has grown at a substantially higher pace than it did in the late 1990's. And productivity growth is still strong. This month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that productivity in the third quarter was up 3.1 percent from the same quarter last year. 
 A new report by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, found that sectors other than technology have been driving the growth in the post-bust years. ''The I.T.-producing industry itself, with its extraordinarily rapid pace of change, certainly has contributed to overall productivity growth,'' said Martin Baily, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, based in Washington. ''But now we're getting a bigger share from the rest of the economy.'' Mr. Baily, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration, was co-author of the McKinsey report with Diana Farrell, the director of McKinsey Global.
 In the late 1990's, McKinsey found that six of the economy's 59 sectors accounted for virtually all productivity growth. Among the biggest contributors were new-economy industries like telecommunications, computer manufacturing and semiconductors. But from 2000 to 2003, the top seven sectors accounted for only 75 percent of the productivity increase. And five of the top contributors were service industries, including retail trade, wholesale trade and financial services. That is surprising, since economists have generally believed that it is much harder for service industries to reap sharp productivity gains than it is for manufacturers.
 To be sure, service industries have become more productive in recent years by continuing to invest in information technology. Yet there are also other factors at work. ''I.T. is a particularly effective enabling tool,'' Ms. Farrell said. ''But without the competitive intensity that drives people to adopt innovation, we wouldn't see these kinds of gains.'' 
 To compete with Wal-Mart, for example, retailers of all stripes have been working furiously to gain scale, to manage supply chains and logistics more effectively, and to negotiate better terms with suppliers and workers. 
 A similar dynamic has played out in the finance sector, where there has also been a huge gain in productivity. It is likely that competition and structural changes are responsible for those gains -- both in the late 1990's and in recent years. Commissions for stock trades have fallen sharply amid relentless competition; spreads in stock trading have narrowed, thanks to rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission; and trading volume has risen, thanks to the proliferation of investors. Add it up, and you have more volume at lower cost to the customer. And when the stock market cooled after the Internet bubble, companies in the once-hot financial sector began to focus on cutting costs and eliminating unprofitable operations. Those moves further bolstered productivity.
 One mystery of recent years has been the enduring gap in productivity growth between the United States and Europe. In this case, another structural force -- regulation -- may be at work. ''In economies with less regulation, companies can use information communications technology that link sectors to one another in ways that create joint productivity,'' said Gail Fosler, executive vice president and chief economist at the Conference Board.
 Because domestic retailers don't face the same sorts of restrictions on working hours and road use that European retailers do, for example, the Americans have been better able to use technology to manage trucking fleets, deliveries and inventory. 
 The encouraging news, some economists say, is that a major breakthrough in information technology is not required to fuel further productivity growth. ''It's not research and development that cause the big gains in productivity,'' Professor Jorgenson said. ''The real drivers are things like competition, deregulation, the opening of markets and globalization.'' 
 AS the gospel of increased productivity spreads to a wider range of sectors, more companies keep trying to figure out how to do more with the same amount of labor -- or with less. For macroeconomists, that is good news. But there is a downside. In the past few years, payroll job growth has been far less robust than usual for post-recessionary periods. And because high productivity means that the economy can grow smartly without the addition of new jobs, some job seekers might wish that companies were a tad less efficient.
 Mr. Baily says that there does not have to be a trade-off between productivity and job creation. ''Historically, in the U.S. and in other countries, periods of rapid productivity growth have been periods of strong employment growth,'' he said. That was certainly the case in the late 1990's. 
 Why has the experience been different in the last several years? ''The loss of manufacturing jobs after 2000 was just huge, and those jobs haven't come back,'' Mr. Baily said. The Big Three automakers have shed tens of thousands of jobs since 2000 because of competitive pressures and a drop in demand for their products. And it is likely that General Motors and Ford would be retrenching even if productivity in the service sector was growing at a much slower rate. 
 ''It's hard to blame productivity growth for a lot of manufacturing job losses,'' Mr. Baily said.

 Was this a good year for the movies or what?
While industry reporters have been busy filing doom-and-gloom analyses, reports about a disputed box-office slump and prognostications about the narrowing gap between a movie hitting your local multiplex and your local home-video store, a lot of filmgoers have been enjoying an exceptional year of movies. I don't know any film critic who had an easy time whittling this year's offerings down to a neat 10 titles, which is why so many critics have instead trotted out a baker's dozen of favorites, sometimes more. And while the doom and gloom suggests that something major is happening in the American movie industry, it is also clear that those who spend too much time in the dark, including most industry watchers, have no idea what the future bodes for the movies. 
 Steven Soderbergh, for one, believes that we are in the middle of a paradigm shift. ''The economics don't work,'' he said last September, while promoting his most recent film, ''Bubble,'' at the Toronto International Film Festival. ''Everybody on both sides, from top to bottom, needs to rethink the issue of compensation and participation. It just has to be redesigned. Movies cost too much. People are getting paid too much. And a dollar should be a dollar, in my view, no matter where it comes from. It just needs to be rethought. It's already starting to happen. There are already deals being made that acknowledge the fact that it's broken. But whether you're going to see that change in a broad sense prior to the digital changeover, I don't know.'' 
 That digital changeover will certainly be part of this paradigm shift, encompassing how movies are produced -- the new technologies, the complex financial deals -- and how they are consumed. In November, Jeff Robinov, president of production at Warner Brothers Pictures, which bankrolled one of Mr. Soderbergh's frothier entertainments (''Ocean's Twelve''), told Laura M. Holson of The New York Times: ''Something is changing in the movie experience. Is it piracy? Is it commercials? Is it the availability of movies? Or are we not creating enough things to drive people out of the home? My biggest fear is having a movie that deserves to be seen, but is not.''
 Whatever you think of the state of the art and the health of the industry, there is no denying that the experience of moviegoing has changed as radically as our perception of what the movies mean to our lives. Entertainment news now assumes an increasingly prominent place in the culture, notably in the mainstream press, even as the movies themselves seem less and less relevant to the culture, no matter how hard filmmakers try. It's hard to know what to make of this state of affairs, though given that the movies have survived previous threats like the introduction of sound, television and the government-enforced breakup of the studio system, there is hope that they will survive all this old- and new-media attention, much of which, as it happens, has little to do with whether the films are any good.
 For some, Hollywood remains a catchall for all that's wrong with American movies, but the same company, NBC Universal, that bankrolled ''King Kong'' is also behind ''Brokeback Mountain.'' Ang Lee's film found studio backing partly because the time was right for this story and partly because the independent-film movement of the 1990's, while short-lived, provided Hollywood fresh blood. ''Batman Begins,'' after all, was directed by Christopher Nolan, who also made the indie cult film ''Memento,'' while the love interest in ''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'' is Catherine Keener, an indie film goddess. Genuine independent filmmakers like Andrew Bujalski (''Funny Ha Ha'') face a brutal time in today's market, but the D.I.Y. ethos that spurred filmmakers to edit on Macs now finds them self-distributing: you can buy Mr. Bujalski's latest, ''Mutual Appreciation,'' online at www.mutualappreciation.com.
 The brutality of this market also means that today's film lovers, especially those living outside the major movie markets, often have to work harder and wait longer than they might like to see the good stuff, but the good stuff is out there -- if not necessarily at the local multiplex, then in film festivals, video stores, mail-order rental outfits and those online companies that sell movies from around the world. The committed moviegoer has more and arguably better choices than at any time in history. That's especially true if you live in New York or most other big cities. And if you do, don't blame Hollywood if you haven't yet seen ''A History of Violence'' or any of the year's best films. Nobody put a gun to your head and forced you to see ''King Kong.'' 
 Here, in no particular order, are my best films of the year: 
 The first time I saw ''A History of Violence'' from the great Canadian director David Cronenberg was at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown in competition. During its first press screening, an outraged European cinephile angrily chastised audience members who were laughing during the film, wrongly believing that they weren't giving proper respect to this story about a small-town paterfamilias, brilliantly played by Viggo Mortensen, whose violent past comes down on him with a vengeance. That many of those laughing the loudest were American spoke to the fact that we recognized that the Midwestern pastoral Mr. Cronenberg had created was at once a movie-made fantasy and horribly real. Our laughter was as much that of the appalled citizen as the appreciative movie lover. 
 If Heath Ledger has attracted so much attention for his performance in ''Brokeback Mountain'' it's partly because he has finally made good on his early overhyped promise and partly because his character in Ang Lee's romantic tragedy, Ennis Del Mar, represents a kind of impacted masculinity that a lot of us recognize: I don't know a single straight woman who hasn't been involved with a man as emotionally thwarted as Ennis, the man who can't tell you how he feels because he may not honestly know. And because the film is, in many respects, about how difficult it is to live in a culture that punishes men who give the appearance of being too soft, too weak and too feminine, I imagine that a lot of men, gay and straight, recognize Ennis, too.
 Unlike Ennis, Jake Gyllenhaal's doe-eyed Jack Twist wears desire as openly as pain. Without his sensitive performance, without his ache and yearning, ''Brokeback Mountain'' wouldn't work half as well as it does. The beauty of the performance is fully evident in the scene in which the older Jack remembers when Ennis gently wrapped his arms around him during the men's first summer together. It's a devastating moment both because it juxtaposes the men's idyllic past with their difficult present, and because it reminds us of how memories live inside us as promises, rebukes and ghosts. When the scene returns to the present, you see in this man's face a lifetime of hope blur together with a lifetime of disappointment, as well as the beginning of the lovers' end. 
 In the movie theater of my dreams, I would put two of the gutsiest films of the year, Michael Haneke's ''Cache'' and Steven Spielberg's ''Munich,'' on a double bill. (In this same dream theater, you could also buy a bottle of beer, which you would really need while watching these two.) Both films are explorations of this year's most fascinating smart-movie theme: the return of the repressed. ''Cache'' explores the personal cost of France's involvement in Algeria; ''Munich'' tracks Israel's response to the slaughter of its athletes at the 1972 Olympics. The French director Philippe Garrel tackles this same theme in ''Regular Lovers'' by returning to May 1968. This tender, beautifully made film, which played at the New York Film Festival, ends on a note of piercing political despair that is offset by Mr. Garrel's artistry. 
 Among the year's greatest surprises is Terrence Malick's compromised triumph, ''The New World,'' which while overly long and burdened by too much Colin Farrell is a work of astonishing ambition and beauty. Arnaud Desplechin's ''Kings and Queen'' offers further proof that this French director is one of the most interesting filmmakers working today; Wong Kar-wai's ''2046'' proves, yet again, that this Hong Kong filmmaker ranks among the greatest. Gus Van Sant's elegiac ''Last Days'' verifies that the director is enjoying a terrific second act. The outrageously entertaining ''Princess Raccoon,'' from the Japanese master Seijun Suzuki, afforded me two of my happiest movie hours of the year. This trippy genre hybrid about an adventurous royal raccoon (a delightful Ziyi Zhang) cleared half the theater at Cannes, but its craziness is pure joy.

HEADLINE: Take It From Japan: Bubbles Hurt

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: KASHIWA, Japan 

 BODY:
FOURTEEN years ago, Yoshihisa Nakashima looked at this sleepy suburb an hour and 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo and saw all the trappings of middle-class Japanese bliss: cherry-tree-lined roads, a cozy community where neighbors greeted one another in the morning and schools within easy walking distance for his two daughters.
 So Mr. Nakashima, a Tokyo city government employee who was then 36, took out a loan for almost the entire $400,000 price of a cramped four-bedroom apartment. With property values rising at double-digit rates, he would easily earn back the loan and then some when he decided to sell.
Or so he thought. Not long after he bought the apartment, Japan's property market collapsed. Today, the apartment is worth half what he paid. He said he would like to move closer to the city but cannot: the sale price would not cover the $300,000 he still owes the bank. 
 With housing prices in the United States looking wobbly after years of spectacular gains, it may be helpful to look at the last major economy to have a real estate bubble pop: Japan. What Americans see may scare them, but they may also learn ways to ease the pain.
 To be sure, there are several major differences between Japan in the 1980's and the United States today. One is the fact that property prices rose much faster and more steeply in Japan, partly because speculators used paper profits from a booming stock market to invest in property, insupportably leveraging the prices of both higher and higher. 
 Another difference is that the biggest speculators in Japan's frenzy were deep-pocketed corporations, and they pumped up the commercial property market at the same time that home prices were inflating.
 Still, for anyone wondering why even the possibility of a housing bubble in the United States preoccupies so many economists, it is worth looking at how the property crash in Japan helped to flatten that economy, which is second only to that of the United States, and to keep it on the canvas for more than a decade. 
 And as American homeowners contemplate what might happen if their property values fell --particularly if they fell hard -- there are lessons in the bitter experiences of their Japanese counterparts like Mr. Nakashima.
 JAPAN suffered one of the biggest property market collapses in modern history. At the market's peak in 1991, all the land in Japan, a country the size of California, was worth about $18 trillion, or almost four times the value of all property in the United States at the time. 
 Then came the crashes in both stocks and property, after the Japanese central bank moved too aggressively to raise interest rates. Both markets spiraled downward as investors sold stocks to cover losses in the land market, and vice versa, plunging prices into a 14-year trough, from which they are only now starting to recover. 
 Now the land in Japan is worth less than half its 1991 peak, while property in the United States has more than tripled in value, to about $17 trillion.
 Homeowners were among the biggest victims of the Japanese real estate bubble. In Japan's six largest cities, residential prices dropped 64 percent from 1991 to last year. By most estimates, millions of homebuyers took substantial losses on the largest purchase of their lives.
 Their experiences contain many warnings. One is to shun the sort of temptations that appear in red-hot real estate markets, particularly the use of risky or exotic loans to borrow beyond one's means. Another is to avoid property that may be hard to unload when the market cools.
 Economists say Japan also contains lessons for United States policy makers, like Ben S. Bernanke, who is expected to become chairman of the Federal Reserve at the end of January. At the top of the list is to learn from the failure of Japan's central bank to slow the rise of the country's real estate and stock bubbles, and then its failure to soften their collapse. Only recently did Japan finally find ways to revive the real estate market, by using deregulation to spur new development.
 Most of all, economists say, Japan's experience teaches the need to be skeptical of that fundamental myth behind all asset bubbles: that prices will keep rising forever. Like their United States counterparts today, too many Japanese homebuyers overextended their debt, buying property that cost more than they could rationally afford because they assumed that values would only rise. When prices dropped, many buyers were financially battered or even wiped out.
 ''The biggest lesson from Japan is not to fall into the same state of denial that existed here,'' said Yukio Noguchi, a finance professor at Waseda University in Tokyo who is perhaps the leading authority on the Japanese bubble.
 ''During a bubble, people don't believe that prices will fall,'' he said. ''This has been proven wrong so many times in the past. But there's something in human nature that makes us unable to learn from history.''
 In the 1980's, Professor Noguchi said, the frenzy in Japan reached such extremes that companies tried to outbid one another even for land of little or no use. At the peak, an empty three-square-meter parcel (about 32 square feet) in a corner of the Ginza shopping district in Tokyo sold for $600,000, even though it was too small to build on. 
 Plots only slightly larger gave birth to bizarre structures known as pencil buildings: tall, thin structures that often had just one small room per floor.
 As a result, Japan's property market in the 1980's was much more fragile than America's today, Professor Noguchi said. And when the market fell, it fell hard. Because of all the corporate speculation, the collapse wiped out company balance sheets, crippled the nation's banks and gave the overall economy a blow to the chin. 
 Since 1991, Japan has spent 11 years sliding in and out of recession. It is only now showing meaningful signs of recovering, with the World Bank forecasting that Japan's economy will grow by a solid 2.2 percent this year
 Despite the differences, Professor Noguchi said he also saw parallels between Japan then and America now. Last year, as a visiting professor at Stanford, he said he read real estate articles in local newspapers that sounded eerily familiar. Houses were routinely selling for $10 million or more, he said, with buyers saying they felt that they had no choice but to buy now, before prices rose even further.
 ''It was deja vu,'' Professor Noguchi said. ''People were in a rush to buy, and at extraordinary prices. I saw this same haste psychology in Japan'' in the 1980's. ''The classic definition of a bubble,'' he added, ''is people buying on false expectations about future prices, and buying with the hope of selling in the future.'' 
 Economists and real estate experts see other parallels as well. In the 1980's, the expectation of rising real estate prices made many Japanese homebuyers feel comfortable about taking on huge debt. And they did so by using exotic loans that required little money upfront and that promised low monthly payments, at least for a short time.
 A similar pattern is found today in the United States, where the methods include interest-only mortgages, which allow homebuyers to repay no principal for a few years. Japan had its own versions of these loans, including the so-called three-generation loan, a 90- or even 100-year mortgage that permitted buyers to spread payments out over their lifetimes and those of their children and grandchildren.
 But when property prices dropped in Japan, homeowners found themselves saddled with loans far larger than the value of their real estate. Many fell into bankruptcy, especially those who lost their jobs or took pay cuts as declining property prices helped to incite a broader recession. From 1994 to 2003, the number of personal bankruptcies rose sixfold, to a record high of 242,357, according to the Japanese Supreme Court, which tracks such data.
 Even many of those who avoided financial collapse found themselves marooned in homes that they never intended as lifelong residences. For many Japanese homebuyers in the 1980's, land prices had risen so high that the only places they could afford were far from central Tokyo. Many went deep into debt to buy tiny or shoddily built homes that were two hours away from their offices.
 Now, after years of tumbling land prices have made Tokyo more affordable again, few people are shopping for homes in the distant suburbs. That has led to severe declines in property values in these outlying areas, leaving many people with homes that are worth less than the balance on their mortgages from a decade or more ago. 
 Mr. Nakashima, who bought the apartment here in Kashiwa, said it would take him at least another decade to whittle down his loan to the point that he could pay it off by selling his home. And this assumes that the apartment does not drop further in value -- a real possibility, because lower prices in Tokyo have led to a recent boom in construction of newer apartments in neighborhoods closer to downtown.
 ''We can't sell and get something better because we'll take such a huge loss,'' said Mr. Nakashima, a serious man who recounts his story with careful precision, sometimes pausing to check dates. ''The collapse of the bubble robbed us of our freedom to choose where we can live.''
 He rues the idea that homes came to be seen as just another investment. ''Homes should be different from stocks,'' he said. ''They shouldn't be the object of speculative investing. If home prices move too much, they can ruin your life.''
 Mr. Nakashima says he is resigned to spending the rest of his days in Kashiwa. It is peaceful here, after all, he said. There is also a bit of history: he pointed to two tree-covered mounds in a corner of the apartment complex that are said to contain the severed heads of samurai killed in a battle here five centuries ago.
 Some economists say that there are probably millions of people like Mr. Nakashima, trying to make the best of life in homes that are distant from work and for which they grossly overpaid. ''There is a whole generation of homebuyers stuck out in far suburbs,'' said Atsushi Nakajima, chief economist at the research arm of the Mizuho Financial Group in Tokyo. ''It's sad, but Japan has basically forgotten about them, and is moving on. They are just left out there.''
 Mr. Nakajima said he had barely missed being stuck out there himself. In 1991, he was looking at a 100-square-meter apartment (1,080 square feet) for about $600,000 about two hours outside Tokyo. He said his wife stopped him. Six years later, he spent the same amount to buy a more spacious house in a downtown neighborhood. ''Maybe my wife should be the economist,'' he said.
 Now that Japan's real estate market is finally showing signs of recovering from the 1991 collapse, economists say it offers a lesson for Americans in how to end -- and not to end -- a long slide in property prices.
 For years after the real estate bubble burst, the Japanese government tried to resuscitate the market and other parts of the economy with expensive public works projects, but they were so poorly planned that they succeeded only in inflating the national debt.
 NOT until the late 1990's did the government try a new tack: deregulation. To kick-start the economy, Tokyo started loosening restrictions on the financial industry. While most of this effort was aimed at reviving the banking industry, it also allowed investors to create real estate investment trusts, essentially mutual funds that invest in commercial property. A few years later, the government also eased building codes, such as height limits, and cut approval times for building permits.
 Economists and real estate executives credit these changes with bringing new money into the market, and with making redevelopment easier. The results are visible in a boom that is dotting the Tokyo skyline with cranes and new high-rises. 
 They are also visible in statistics. Residential home prices in Tokyo rose 0.5 percent in the 12 months through July, the first gain in 15 years, the government said in September. Nationwide, land prices are still down, but the pace of decline has slowed to a crawl, the government said.
 ''Deregulation revived the Tokyo land market,'' said Toshio Nagashima, executive vice president at Mitsubishi Estate, one of Japan's largest real estate companies. He said the changes were one reason that his company committed to spend $4.5 billion by 2007 to build six skyscrapers in the central Marunouchi financial district.
 Japanese economists say the United States is not likely to suffer a decline that is as severe or long-lasting as Japan's, because they see a more skilled hand at the tiller of the American economy: the Federal Reserve. Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, failed to curb the stock and real estate bubbles until mid-1989, when it was too late and prices were sky-high, they said. 
 When it did take action, it moved faster and more drastically than Japan's overinflated land and stock markets could handle, raising its benchmark interest rate to 6 percent from 2.5 percent over 15 months. Economists say that this pulled the rug out from under both markets at the same time.
 Akio Makabe, a finance professor at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, says the Fed has been more deft in handling the rise in America's property market, which he believes is definitely in a bubble. He praised the Fed for apparently learning from Japan's mistakes, tightening more gradually and taking the economy's pulse as it does so.
 ''Japan shows the importance of avoiding a hard landing,'' Professor Makabe said. ''Avoid big shocks. That is the biggest lesson of Japan's bubble.''

HEADLINE: Too Big? Too Small? Midsize Seems Just Right for Stocks

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
SMALL-CAP stocks dished out supersized returns in recent years. But in 2005, shares of midsize companies have been serving up the best results -- a trend that some market strategists predict will continue. 
 Small-cap stocks, those of companies with market capitalization of less than $2 billion, tend to shine when stocks in general are emerging from a bear market. But by this stage in the economic recovery, strategists say that midcap stocks -- those of companies with market caps of roughly $2 billion to $15 billion -- have many advantages over smaller stocks.
''I'm concerned about small caps, which have begun to lag,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Fleming, the asset management arm of J. P. Morgan Chase. Small caps can be very sensitive to changes in interest rates, he said, while midcaps are more insulated from such movements. Some analysts expect that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates at least through next spring. 
 Midcaps certainly sprinted ahead of small caps this year. The Russell 2000 index -- a common proxy for small-cap stocks -- is up 5.35 percent, compared with a 13.9 percent gain in the Russell Midcap index. And many investors are betting that midcaps will keep outperforming the small fry next year. In the first three quarters of 2005, investors put more than $21 billion into midcap mutual funds, while putting less than $3 billion into small-cap funds, according to Lipper. 
 Although midcaps are more liquid than small caps, Mr. Schweitzer said the stocks were still small enough that if money kept flowing into midcap funds at that pace, midcap stocks could be pushed sharply higher.
 Opinion is more divided over how large caps will fare in 2006. This year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which includes many such stocks, is up 4.68 percent, and investors took more than $50 billion out of large-cap funds in the first three quarters. Mr. Schweitzer said he thought that large stocks in general -- those in the S.& P. 500, but not necessarily the biggest -- might outperform midcap stocks. But he predicted that the performance gap between large and midsize stocks would be modest when compared with that between large and small stocks.
 Some strategists say the heavyweights are undervalued. The 25 largest companies in the S.& P. 500 account for 43 percent of the earnings. At the end of 2003, they were also 43 percent of its market capitalization. But that figure has fallen steadily, to around 40 percent, said Henry McVey, chief United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley.
 Although Mr. McVey said he thought that money would eventually move back into megacap companies -- as the largest are often called -- he said that many of these companies would need to restructure before they could lure investors back. Meanwhile, he is advising investors to lean toward midcaps.
 But Satya Pradhuman, the chief small-cap strategist at Merrill Lynch, who analyzes trends for companies valued below $8 billion, says he sees a fundamental shift away from domestic megacap stocks and toward a host of asset classes that include small-cap and midcap stocks, but also emerging-market debt and equities, high-yield bonds and private equity funds. ''This is a bigger trade,'' he said. ''Investors are looking at these other asset classes because they aren't confident in earnings growth.'' 
 Mr. Pradhuman said he thought that Wall Street earnings estimates were pegged too high in general, and that there was very little room for positive surprises over the next two to three quarters. ''I don't see an ugly equity market,'' he said. '' I just think the earnings hurdles are too high.''
 Within the midcap category, many strategists say, growth stocks could stand out next year. Although midcaps are often more stable than small caps, ''they aren't sprawling enterprises yet,'' Mr. McVey said. So they can grow at a faster clip than many large-cap companies. 
 Some managers of midcap funds predict that sector selection will be less important next year than it has been in 2005 -- a year when energy and utilities stocks have trounced the broader stock market and when the managers have had to avoid some troubled industries, like automobiles, to keep from lagging behind their peer group.
 For instance, the opportunities could shift next year within the energy and technology sectors, said William D'Alonzo, who manages the Brandywine fund, which invests in companies of all sizes; the average market capitalization of its portfolio companies is around $9 billion.
 Mr. D'Alonzo said he thought that many technology companies had been chasing consumer dollars in recent years because corporations and governments had reined in their own spending. But he predicted that consumer spending would start to lag, while corporate and government spending on information technology would pick up.
 The Harris Corporation, a $6 billion company based in Melbourne, Fla., is among the fund's holdings that could benefit if Mr. D'Alonzo is correct about this trend. Harris sells communications equipment, primarily to government and the American space and military industries. The company's earnings grew 62 percent in the third quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter that they exceeded analysts' estimates, Mr. D'Alonzo said.
 Within energy, he has limited the fund's exposure to the big energy suppliers, like Exxon Mobil, while emphasizing smaller oil and gas services companies. He said he likes Weatherford, one of the fund's 10 largest holdings, because he thinks that its drilling business would be largely insulated from oil price swings. Although the mean estimate from analysts for Weatherford's 2006 earnings has risen to $3.99 a share, from $3.14 in May, Mr. D'Alonzo said he thought that the company's earnings could exceed even that higher estimate next year.
 Christopher McHugh, the lead manager of the Turner Midcap Growth fund, tries to match the sector weightings in the Russell Midcap Growth index, though he will emphasize certain industries. He is currently favoring semiconductor and networking companies, while limiting software stocks to just 2 percent of the portfolio. He also likes some specialty retailers.
 Urban Outfitters, a $5 billion company based in Philadelphia, is among the retail stocks in the portfolio. Mr. McHugh said he thought that the company could increase its earnings -- regardless of the general direction of consumer spending -- by opening new stores, because the chain is relatively small as compared with other specialty retailers like the Gap. He said he thought that Urban Outfitters could increase its stores' total square feet by 20 percent next year. 
 Mr. McHugh likes smaller technology companies, where he also sees room for earnings growth. He points to one of the fund's holdings, F5 Networks, a $2 billion company based in Seattle that helps companies manage their Internet traffic. Mr. McHugh said he thought it could increase earnings in 2006 by 20 percent, which would beat Wall Street analysts' estimates.
 Although midcaps may be the flavor of the moment, Mr. Pradhuman, the Merrill Lynch strategist, warns risk-adverse investors to think twice before jumping in with both feet. He also advises all types of investors not to venture into midcaps if they will need the money back soon. While these stocks tend to be more stable than small caps, they are often more volatile than shares of larger companies. ''As much as we like this asset class, it's not for everyone,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Great News! It's the Dawning Of the Atomic Age

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
IT'S easy to fault the major institutions in classical music for being stodgy and averse to risk. Yet music lovers count on the leading opera companies and orchestras to be custodians of the repertory. Take the Metropolitan Opera. Recalling the first half of this season, among many rewarding nights, I'll remember James Levine's buoyant and insightful performance of Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' with a splendid youngish cast that gave you hope for the future of Mozart singing. 
 Still, if classical music is to build on its storied history and have a future, the major institutions have a special responsibility to champion new and recent works. To keep the focus on opera for a moment, several companies gave significant premieres that told much about how they view their mission in economically challenging times. 
The October premiere of John Adams's ''Doctor Atomic'' at the San Francisco Opera must surely be considered the musical event of the year in America. Here was a musically mesmerizing and courageous work on a topic more grimly relevant than ever. Whatever one's reaction to the opera, how could you not salute the company for putting its faith in this creative team, which included the bold director Peter Sellars, and for promoting the premiere throughout the city with lectures, panels and exhibits? Opera buffs in the Bay Area and from around the world made it a point to be there, and the run played to nearly full houses. 
 For a model of how to open an opera house, look to Copenhagen, which inaugurated its excitingly modern $441 million home for the Royal Danish Opera in March with ''Kafka's Trial,'' a new work by Denmark's most important and original living composer, Poul Ruders. Well, officially, the house opened in January with an ostentatious production of Verdi's ''Aida,'' that being a stipulation of the Danish donor who footed the bill for the place. But the de facto opening of the house was the premiere of Mr. Ruders's audacious opera, which, as might be expected, drew mixed reactions but, most important, played to sold-out houses. 
 At the Met, of course, there was the recent premiere of Tobias Picker's ''American Tragedy.'' In commissioning a neo-Romantic composer like Mr. Picker to write an opera based on the touchstone Dreiser novel, the Met played it safe. Though an essentially effective and often skilled work, the opera breaks no new ground and embraces tried-and-true conventions. Still, you could not imagine a more compelling cast or a more striking production. At least the Met took a chance on something new. Tan Dun's new opera, due next season, is sure to be a major departure for the company. 
 Looking back this year at the work of individual artists, the musicians who particularly affected me shared a quality that might be called, for want of a better word, authenticity. Artistic authenticity is hard to define. But you know it when you encounter it. 
 Take Christopher Taylor. This prodigiously gifted and keenly intelligent American pianist could probably have an international touring career. Instead, he is content to base his artistic life at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he teaches. Fortunately, the Miller Theater in New York has become one of his regular concert stops. In October he drew a capacity crowd to the hall for a program devoted to the complete etudes of Gyorgy Ligeti, incandescent and ferociously difficult pieces. The bookish and gangly Mr. Taylor gave an exhilarating performance of these works. His sheer effort was something to behold. The only performer I have ever seen perspire more profusely is the tap dancer Savion Glover.
 Yet many renowned artists who move in major institutional circles also exude authenticity, none more than the mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. She had been absent from the concert and opera stage for most of the last year because of illness. So it was a relief to hear this incomparable artist perform the ''Neruda Songs,'' a new 30-minute work for voice and orchestra by her husband, Peter Lieberson, with James Levine conducting the Boston Symphony, first in Boston and then at Carnegie Hall. Like a love letter to his wife, this alluring score showed the elegantly cerebral Mr. Lieberson in a new, generous and lushly lyrical vein. 
 And speaking of major institutions, Mr. Levine, though in his 60's and hobbled with physical ailments, has thrillingly reinvigorated the venerable Boston Symphony Orchestra. His success there should be a lesson to all major institutions, including that other one he runs.

HEADLINE: What Santa Rally? The Market Barely Budges 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
Hopes for a year-end rise in the broad stock market -- the so-called Santa Claus rally -- were dashed as flagging home sales and falling energy prices hit the stocks of companies in those industries. That offset gains in retailing shares, which were bolstered by signs of consumer optimism. 
 Housing stocks were hit especially hard on Friday after the Commerce Department said that sales of new single-family homes fell by 11.3 percent in November to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.245 million units a year, the biggest one-month drop in almost 12 years.
If consumers felt any pain from the housing market, they have not shown it yet. The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index rose to 91.5 in December from 81.6 last month.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 7.68 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to close at 10,883.27. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose only 1.34 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,268.66. The Nasdaq composite index lost 3.06 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,249.42. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped to 4.38 percent from 4.43 percent a week earlier. MARK A. STEIN

HEADLINE: Over the Top? Let's Count the Ways

 BODY:
NOT only is the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 the quickest, fastest and most expensive production car ever, it comes with a long list of standard superlatives, including these:

HOW MUCH? -- For the $1.2 million price of a single Veyron, one could buy a Maybach, a Rolls-Royce Phantom and a Lamborghini Murcielago with enough left over for a Corvette for every day of the week. Or a Toyota Prius every week for more than a year. A $356,000 deposit is required with your order. 


IS THAT TAXABLE? -- For a New York City buyer (someone, say, who is crazy rich), sales tax alone would be about $100,000. The projected gas guzzler tax is $7,700.

HOW POWERFUL? -- The Veyron's 1,001 horsepower is hundreds more than that of any other car in production. Its 922 pound-feet of torque is nearly twice that of the McLaren F1, which until now was considered the ultimate street car.

HOW FAST IS FAST? -- As quick off the line as a Formula One racecar, the Veyron reaches 60 m.p.h. in 2.5 seconds. It can hit 250 m.p.h. in less than a minute -- then brake to a complete stop in less than 10 seconds.

IS THAT ALL? -- It is unclear how fast the Bugatti could actually go. Top speed is electronically limited to 253 m.p.h. because of the tires.

HOW'S THE MILEAGE? -- Preliminary E.P.A. fuel economy estimates are 9 miles a gallon in the city and 18 on the highway. At full throttle, it would gulp down the entire 26-gallon tank in about 12 minutes.

WHAT DOES THE NAME MEAN? -- Pierre Veyron, a race driver for Bugatti, won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1939.

EXCESSES -- The car has 10 radiators, a horsepower gauge and a titanium exhaust system. Its audio system costs about $30,000.

WILL THE JONESES HAVE ONE? -- Unlikely, with annual sales of just 50 worldwide. Ferraris (4,900 sold last year) are common by comparison.

WHO'S GETTING RICH OFF THIS? -- Bugatti's beleaguered parent, Volkswagen, could use the money. Yet even with its high price, the Veyron is not expected ever to recoup VW's investment.

HEADLINE: Trying to Catch The Wind

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
ED McDONALD, a low roller at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, was waiting for a jitney when he paused to gawk at what may turn out to be yet another of this city's tourist attractions -- the nation's first coastal wind farm, whose sleek 380-foot-high turbines stand like immense kinetic sculptures at the entrance to this seaside resort. 
 ''It's clean energy, it's futuristic, it doesn't block the view,'' said Mr. McDonald, 52, an unemployed warehouse worker who had just quit the blackjack tables after four hours and enough losing hands for one day. ''Offshore, out in the water, then I would say they'd be a problem, then you're taking away from the seashore itself, the view and everything.''
 Federal and state officials are betting on wind power as an environmentally friendly and economically viable way to help reduce the ever-growing dependence on fossil fuels for generating electricity, particularly along New Jersey's rapidly growing Shore communities. 
 The Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm will be operated here by a Pennsylvania company known as Community Energy. It will be on the grounds of the Atlantic County Utility Authority's water treatment plant. Once they begin operating early next year, the farm's five wind turbines, built by GE Wind Energy, a division of General Electric, will spin out a total of 7.5 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply 60 percent of the treatment plant's power needs and electrify 2,500 households. 
 Thousands of private and commercial turbines already harvest gusts along ridgelines, farm fields and windswept plains in 30 states, according to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group in Washington. But the Atlantic City project, which state and industry officials say will be the first coastal wind farm in the United States, is perhaps most important because of its role as a demonstration project at a crucial moment in the development of wind power in New Jersey and the nation.
 ''I think our project will give people a sense of what is being discussed,'' said Richard Dovey, executive director of the utility authority.
 But government and industry officials say New Jersey's real wind power potential lies offshore, where the strength and regularity of the wind far exceeds overland breezes. And in windmill circles, much of the discussion these days is on an ambitious proposal to plant a total of 1,019 turbines like those in Atlantic City in the seabed a few miles off that hallowed source of state pride and tourism dollars known as the Jersey Shore. 
 Fueling doubts, speculation and controversy over the proposal is the fact that there have never been offshore windmills in United States waters, though Winergy is just one of several companies that have applied for permits to erect them in at least a half-dozen states. The issue is particularly sensitive in New Jersey, where residents take special pride in the state's 127-mile coastline, and much of the state's huge tourism industry depends on it. 
 Opponents of offshore windmills can be assured that Winergy's plans, which call for five distinct wind farms from Seaside Heights to Cape May, are not likely to be realized soon. The Department of the Interiors Minerals Management Service, an agency that was given permitting and regulatory authority over offshore windmills by federal legislation in August, has tabled all but two proposals, one off Long Island and the other in Nantucket Sound, while it drafts permitting and operating guidelines for the nascent offshore wind power industry.

A Moratorium and a Final Report
 Gary Strasburg, a spokesman for the minerals service, which also regulates natural gas and oil extraction on the continental shelf, said the wind regulations should be complete by May, when the agency will resume reviewing permit applications. The minerals service inherited the wind jurisdiction from the Army Corps of Engineers, which will continue to be involved in the permit process. 
 Apart from any delays in approval resulting from the regulatory handoff, there is currently a moratorium in place on state financing or permitting of offshore wind projects that was imposed by Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey last December, when he also appointed a panel to study the issue. Even outside state waters, the federal Coastal Zone Management Act gives states a say in projects likely to have an effect on their coastlines. 
 Last month, the nine-member panel appointed by Mr. Codey, formally known as the Blue Ribbon Panel on Development of Wind Turbine Facilities in Coastal Waters issued an interim report laying out the environmental, aesthetic and economic pros and cons of offshore windmills. In March, when the moratorium is scheduled to be lifted, the panel is to present a final report, with recommendations, to the new governor, Jon S. Corzine.
 The panel, which is being headed by Mayor Edward J. McKenna Jr. of Red Bank, includes leaders and officials from the environmental, tourism and energy fields. One member, Jeanne M. Fox, who is president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, seemed to be leaning in favor of offshore wind power in remarks she made after a Dec. 12 dedication ceremony for Atlantic City's project, the state's first utility-level wind farm.
 ''It's a small step in reducing fossil-fuel carbon emissions, but it's important in that millions of people who come to Atlantic City every year will be seeing these wind turbines,'' Ms. Fox said. ''Even though they are not offshore, they are about as close to offshore as you can get.'' 
 She and others are counting on wind to play a major role in the state's plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. In 1999, the Legislature approved a law requiring energy companies to include renewable energy sources like the sun, wind and wood-burning furnaces, in their power portfolios. Standards developed by the utilities board call for 6.5 percent of the electricity used in New Jersey be from renewable sources. In September, the Board of Public Utilities proposed increasing the number to 20 percent by 2020. 

Nothing New in Europe
 Europe -- where windmills compete with tulips as national symbols and Cervantes tilted his quixotic hero at them 400 years ago -- is far ahead of the United States in the use of wind power, with more than 34,000 megawatts of capacity in 2004, or nearly two thirds of the world's wind energy supply, according to the European Wind Energy Association. Denmark, for example, derives about 20 percent of its electricity from the wind.
 The United States, by comparison, had a total wind power capacity of just 6,740 megawatts in 2004, providing less than one percent of the country's power, said Christine Real de Azua, a spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association, an affiliate of the European group under the Global Wind Energy Council.
 So far, Europe accounts for all of the world's offshore wind power, Ms. Azua said. The largest offshore facility is at Nysted, Denmark, where 72 light-gray turbines rise 360 feet above the North Sea, generating up to 165 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power 145,000 homes. But even in Europe, offshore wind power is still uncommon, accounting for only 600 megawatts in 2004. 
 Right now, virtually none of New Jersey's electricity is generated by wind turbines. Rather, the state gets about half its power from its four nuclear reactors (the national average is 20 percent), while 30 percent is generated by natural gas, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. The state's third leading energy source, at 18 percent in 2004, is coal. 
 The wind panel noted in its interim report that New Jersey consumes more electricity than it produces, forcing the state's power companies to import electricity from other plants within the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) power grid, including upwind coal-burning plants that emit deadly sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide particles.
 ''Many of these out-of-state facilities use fossil fuels and are upwind of New Jersey, adding to the state's air quality problems,'' the report says. ''All are beyond the state's regulatory authority to control air pollutants.'' 
 The report also notes the state's demand for energy is increasing at about 1.4 percent a year, much of that fueled by the growth of New Jersey's Shore communities.
 Other advantages to developing wind power cited in the report include reduced dependence on often-volatile foreign oil supplies, and potential cost savings; unlike oil prices, the cost of wind does not fluctuate.
 The disadvantages of wind power listed in the report include the hazards that turbine blades and poles pose to birds, boaters, fisherman and the shipping industry; disruption of the ocean floor and marine life during construction; potential contamination from lubricating oil; and their aesthetic impact and any resulting decline in tourism, which generates $32 billion a year in economic activity and accounts for 430,000 jobs, 40 percent of which are in the state's four oceanfront counties -- Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic and Cape May. 
 ''Anybody who cares about New Jersey cares about the tourism industry,'' said Ms. Fox.
 Beyond New Jersey, federal permits have been sought for offshore farms in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia and elsewhere. The Long Island Power Authority and a Florida company, FPL Energy, are jointly seeking a permit for a wind farm off Jones Beach. 
 ''We are in a bit of a race,'' said Bert Cunningham, a spokesman for the Long Island Power Authority. 

Controversy in Nantucket Sound
 But the most visible and most controversial proposal so far is one by a Massachusetts company known as Cape Wind Associates, which wants to erect 130 turbines in Nantucket Sound. A final decision on the project is scheduled for January 2007, following public hearings this summer, said Mr. Strasburg, the spokesman for the minerals service. 
 The project has been vigorously opposed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and his nephew, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., senior counsel to the Environmental Defense Fund, who has said he supports offshore wind power -- particularly once deep-water technology is developed -- but that he opposes the Cape Wind project on the ground that it would spoil a marine wilderness and recreation area, and because a study suggests it would cost the local economy over a billion dollars a year and more than 2,500 tourism jobs. 
 ''Cape Wind's proposal involves construction of 130 giant turbines whose windmill arms will reach 417 feet above the water and be visible for up to 26 miles,'' Mr. Kennedy wrote this month in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times. ''These turbines are less than six miles from shore and would be seen from Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. Hundreds of flashing lights to warn airplanes away from the turbines will steal the stars and nighttime views.''
 An amendment to a federal Coast Guard financing bill, now pending before a House-Senate conference committee, would bar wind farms within 1.5 miles of shipping lanes, and effectively kill the Cape Wind project. Mark Rogers, a spokesman for Cape Wind, noted that the project would be in view of the famous Kennedy family compound in Hyannisport, and he said that Mr. Kennedy was taking an all-too-common position on offshore windmills: they sound like a good idea, but not in my backyard -- or in this case, not off my beach.
 ''I don't know what it means, frankly, to say you're in favor of wind energy as an abstract concept, but then to oppose real-world, practical projects that can be achieved soon and start delivering the benefits of wind energy to your community,'' Mr. Rogers said. 
 Likewise, Mr. Cunningham said that Long Islanders were initially supportive of wind power, but that the reaction to the Jones Beach proposal was decidedly mixed once its location became clear.
 Specifics of Winergy's plans have not been subject to public hearings and the attendant news media coverage, and so far, the battle over offshore wind power in New Jersey has not been nearly as pitched as in Massachusetts. But once the debate begins, it seems likely to be intense, considering the scale of the project and the importance of the Shore in New Jersey's very identity.

A Plan for 5 Farms Offshore
 According to the company's Web site (www.winergyllc.com), the New Jersey plans call for five farms set between 3.5 and 6.4 miles offshore, in 48 to 60 feet of water, spread over an area of 234 square miles. In all, the five farms would have a generating capacity of 3,648 megawatts of electricity, more than half the total generating capacity of all existing windmills in the entire United States.
 The largest of the five farms, known as Five Fathom Bank 1, would include 335 turbines spread over 88 square miles and be situated 3.5 miles off Cape May Point. The northernmost site, off the coast of Asbury Park, calls for 98 turbines set 3.5 miles off the beach. There is no cost estimate for the proposal, said Dennis Quaranta, the president of Winergy. 
 Winergy originally applied for permits in 2002. There is no anticipated time frame for a response, said Mr. Strasburg, the spokesman for the Minerals Management Service. In the meantime, Mr. Quaranta said the controversy swirling about the Cape Wind and Jones Beach proposals has prompted him to consider locations much farther off the Jersey Shore than his current proposals, and he is following developments in deep-water turbine technology.
 ''We know there's a problem that people aren't happy about seeing these turbines,'' said Mr. Quaranta, known in the industry as a ''wind prospector,'' a 55-year-old former restaurant owner whose experience applying for a federal fish-farm permit led to his interest in developing offshore wind power. ''The permitting is basically the same as a fish farm.''
 To face inland from the boardwalk at Asbury Park is, for all the talk of redevelopment, to look upon a bleak panorama of decaying amusements, crumbling hotels and unfinished apartments. But turn around to face the ocean, and the view is as rich and pristine as in Deal or Loch Arbor, Asbury Park's wealthy neighbors to the north. Even so, the prospect of dozens of wind turbines on the distant horizon was welcomed by Harold Rohrs, who was on the boardwalk recently, braving the December chill for a midday stroll from his home in neighboring Ocean Grove. 
 Mr. Rohrs, a 65-year-old retired biology professor who has traveled widely and seen windmills in Europe and Australia, said that they ''certainly were not ugly.''
 ''I didn't find them at all disruptive to the environment, to the aesthetics of the environment,'' he said. ''I guess, in truth, I was thinking how marvelous it was that they were using the wind as a renewable source of energy, without adding to the C02 in the environment.''
 The professor is not alone. The wind panel's interim report cites a survey taken in Vermont, which found that people's aesthetic judgment of windmills seemed to be influenced by their attitude toward renewable energy. Essentially, the more people like wind power, the better-looking windmills are to them. 
 ''Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,'' Mr. Quaranta said of wind turbines. ''People are going to look at them and say they're beautiful. Other people are going to look at them as say, 'Ugh, it's commercializing the ocean.' ''

HEADLINE: Rules of Engagement for the Holiday Season 

BYLINE: By CATE DOTY

 BODY:
LIKE ''white Christmas,'' ''happy holidays'' and ''guaranteed delivery before Dec. 25,'' the phrase, ''Will you marry me?'' is becoming a familiar refrain this time of year. 
 December, traditionally a slow month for weddings, is by far the most popular month for engagements. While only about 7 percent of American couples choose to marry in December, 19 percent of couples become engaged during the holidays, a 2004 study from the Conde Nast Bridal Group reported. That is more than November and January combined, and it far surpasses February, when marriage proposals are often tied to Valentine's Day. 
Kalshelia Brown's fiance, Malcolm Lloyd, had planned on giving her the solitaire he designed for her on Valentine's Day. But because last Christmas was her first holiday away from her family in Florida, he decided to boost her spirits. He created a scavenger hunt around their house in Rahway, N.J., which ended with his getting down on one knee.
 ''I think it was a way to cheer me up,'' said Ms. Brown, who is a financial director at an advertising agency in Manhattan. ''The holidays are special, and it made it more special for us.''
 The harmony of jingle bells, wedding bells and the insistent jangle of change in one's pocket rings clearly. Engagement ploys often have an over-the-top quality to them. And many would-be bridegrooms view the already crammed holiday season as a ready-made opportunity to stage a memorable event with plenty of witnesses. The parties are already planned, and the Christmas tree and a blazing fire provide the perfect setting for a proposal. 
 This month, Tony Beebe proposed to Joyce Tung, his girlfriend of six years, first having secured permission from her parents as well as a 1.6-carat diamond solitaire, which was, he said, priced ''in the low teens.'' The two, who live in Houston, were visiting New York for the first time. Mr. Beebe said that although it wasn't the spirit of the holiday that moved him to act, he did wish to take advantage of New York's holiday flair.
 For his big moment he chose a quiet corner of Central Park over the tourist traps of the Empire State Building and Times Square. ''New York dresses up pretty well at Christmas,'' Mr. Beebe said. 
 Also fueling the propensity to splurge is the year-end bonus, which men of a certain economic stratum can count on to pay for their romantic gesture. 
 Nick Fox, an environmental engineer in Raleigh, N.C., used his bonus to help pay for the 1-carat diamond and amethyst ring he gave to his high school sweetheart and fiancee, Mary Christine Brown.
 ''It just seemed like a good time,'' he said of the proposal, which took place this month during a trip to Charleston, S.C. 
 Moved in part by the spirit of the season, some men are willing to spend even more than they normally would on a diamond, said Mark Vadon, the chief executive and a founder of Bluenile.com, the online jewelry retailer in Seattle. 
 Mr. Vadon cited a Blue Nile client, a man whom a company representative would only describe as ''a professional, a resident of Massachusetts'' and someone who had the means to pay in full. The client bought a 5-carat solitaire for $170,000 in late November for an intended proposal in December. (''While a certain percentage do finance those purchases,'' said John Baird, a Blue Nile spokesman, any online purchase of that dimension ''is typically paid by bank wire and delivered by armored car.'') 
 ''Christmas is by far the No. 1 day for engagements,'' Mr. Vadon said. ''It is a season when you're thinking about other people who are meaningful in your life. People are emotional. And an engagement is an important event you want to share with others, especially your family. 
 ''Think about it. You're about to spend the holidays with your in-laws. There's a little pressure there to step up and propose.''
 The New Year's holiday offers many of the same advantages, said Mr. Vadon, who noted that its popularity for marriage proposals is only slightly less than that of Christmas and Valentine's Day. 
 ''Historically, diamonds have accrued an emotional halo,'' said Sally Morrison, a spokeswoman for the Diamond Information Center, an industry group that has followed in the glittering footsteps of De Beers, the diamond mining and marketing company, whose advertising campaigns helped establish the diamond ring as the engagement present of choice. ''They associate it with warm feelings. If they're going to make an emotional commitment to another human being, they probably feel more moved to make a grand gesture.''
 The wedding industry, not surprisingly, has put its full weight behind the notion of the December proposals. Bridal magazines publish special holiday issues. Web sites devoted to weddings list ways to propose during the holidays. (Among them: surprising your girlfriend by dressing up as Santa Claus. Or attaching plastic antlers to your dog and placing the ring on a ribbon around Fido's neck before sending him to wake your beloved.)
 And to be frank, a diamond ring is also a fine present. With an eye on Christmas sales figures and a nose for big spenders, retailers push luxury items this time of year -- cars, home theater systems, fur coats. Sales of diamonds, with their emotional weight and obvious significance, receive a huge boost during the holidays. About 25 percent of all diamond purchases in a year come during the holiday season, Ms. Morrison said. 
 Some wonder if men plan to give engagement rings during the holidays so they do not have to buy their girlfriends other gifts. Mr. Beebe, the manager of an oil rig in Houston, discounted the thought and also confirmed that, well yes, he's still going to buy Ms. Tung, a doctoral student in economics at Rice University, a Christmas present. 
 Ms. Morrison agreed with Mr. Beebe, saying the idea that one is a substitute for the other was a little silly. ''It's a hugely expensive way to avoid traipsing around the store for another gift,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Tackling a Major Health Hazard: No Insurance

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
LINDA SURPRENANT cannot lift her right arm over her shoulder. Physical therapy could have solved that problem after surgery to repair a rotator cuff, but physical therapy is the kind of treatment people receive when they have health insurance.
 For most of the last decade, Ms. Surprenant, 58, of North Branford, who lost her last steady job as a driver for a delivery company in 1996, has not been one of those people. And for most of the decade, as she skipped from temporary job to temporary job, she has neglected her health.
''I put off medical care I needed,'' Ms. Surprenant said in an interview last week, lifting her arm tentatively to show how weak it was. 
 For most of her life, Ms. Surprenant belonged solidly to America's middle class, at times ''even more well off than that,'' she said. She has managed offices and even helped start a company that found workers for major oil companies. 
 Until she was about 50, Ms. Surprenant said, she had never gone without health insurance. It wasn't even something she thought about. But like a growing number of Connecticut residents, she is learning what it is like to navigate the health care system without insurance, and is suffering for it.
 Connecticut does not track the number of people without health insurance, as it tracks the unemployed, but surveys done by the state show that the uninsured do not fall into neat categories. In general, they earn less than the state average, but are not destitute. Most of them work, but their employers either don't offer health insurance or ask them to pay such high premiums that they decide to opt out. A disproportionate number are Hispanic, and of that group many are undocumented workers. There are also children whose parents haven't signed them up for state-subsidized medical care even though they qualify. 
 ''This is a very basic need and people shouldn't be going without it,'' said Gretchen Vivier, the director of the Health Care for All Coalition, a consortium of Connecticut groups pushing for universal health care.
 To deal with the problem, the state has developed a patchwork of programs that aim to insure children and their parents foremost. But the programs are regularly cut or expanded depending on who holds power in the state and how the economy is doing. Meanwhile, more and more people have joined the ranks of the uninsured.
 Increasingly, people are depending on crowded community health clinics to receive care, or are simply not going to the doctor, experts and health providers said.
 Gary F. Spinner, the chief operating officer of the Hill Health Center, which serves low-income people in 19 locations in the New Haven area, said the center was treating a growing number of uninsured patients. Ten years ago, he said, about 15 percent of patients at the center were uninsured. Today, it is about 25 percent. Even as more uninsured people come to the center, Mr. Spinner said, the state has cut reimbursements for some of the services the center offers.
 ''That's a whole other strain on the safety net,'' he said.
 The extent of the problem depends on how the uninsured are counted. A report released in August by the federal Census Bureau found that, on average, 10.9 percent of Connecticut residents, or about 370,000 people, were uninsured from 2002 to 2004. Ten states had a smaller percentage of people without insurance over that period.
 A 2004 survey by the State Office of Health Care Access found that 5.8 percent of respondents said that they did not have health insurance at the time of the survey, though 9.4 percent said they lacked insurance at some point during the previous year.
 The difference between the numbers points to a fundamental problem for those trying to figure out how to insure the uninsured. Many people in Connecticut are uninsured temporarily or shuttle on and off insurance. They may be uninsured because they are in between jobs, or because they have started a job and their health insurance hasn't kicked in yet, said Ellen Andrews, the executive director of the Connecticut Health Policy Project, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization. 
 Increasingly, businesses and other employers have stopped sponsoring health insurance for their workers. A report issued in November by the Office of Health Care Access showed that 65 percent of Connecticut employers offered health insurance as of 2003, compared with 67 percent of employers in 2001. 
 In addition, the premiums workers were being asked to pay were about 10 percent higher than the national average. For example, the Office of Health Care Access survey showed that a Connecticut family paid an average of $10,119 in 2003, compared with the national average of $9,249.
 The report also showed that businesses with more than 10 employees were much more likely to offer insurance than smaller businesses, a majority of which did not offer insurance. Elliott Johnson, the president of the Greater Waterbury Black Business Association and the owner of a small computer sales and repair business, said his association and others in Connecticut had been working on ways to insure employees. Mr. Johnson said he could not afford to insure the one employee who works for him. His inability to offer insurance, which he estimated would cost $1,000 a month, has led to his losing promising employees to larger companies, he said. 
 ''If I want a good technician, a good network guy and he has a family, he's going to a large company that can offer health insurance,'' he said. 
 Mr. Johnson said many of the business owners he knows simply don't know what options are available and don't understand why the health care system is so expensive. He said he was working with other business associations to find a way for small businesses to offer insurance cheaply, but they were still far from a solution. 
 Workers who rely on temporary employment also have trouble finding health insurance because they often shift among several companies. Ralph Charlton, 24, a construction worker from Wallingford, said he has not had insurance since he turned 18 and was no longer covered under his father's plan.
 His work is always temporary, and his annual income, just under $20,000, puts him out of range for state-subsidized care for the poor, but it leaves him with little discretionary income. 
 ''It's not even enough to do anything with,'' Mr. Charlton said.
 Similar problems face Hispanic workers, particularly those who are undocumented. Hispanics were more than five times as likely to be uninsured as people in all other ethnic groups, according to the 2004 Office of Health Care Access survey. Among other reasons, the survey found that Hispanics were more likely to work in temporary jobs and less likely to work for employers who sponsored health insurance plans. 
 Others without insurance sometimes don't apply for programs that can help them or their children. For instance, a report from the State Office of Legislative Research released in December 2004 showed that 21.4 percent of children whose parents' income put them below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or $36,800 for a family of four, did not have health insurance. Many of those children would have qualified for free health insurance under the state's HUSKY program, which covers about 300,000 people. 
 And it is not only parents who are daunted by the system. James Pearson, a self-employed home remodeling contractor from New Haven, said he has not had health insurance since he left a job at Pratt & Whitney in the 1970's. Mr. Pearson said he did not know what options were available to him. 
 ''I haven't even checked out insurance,'' he said in an interview after a checkup at the Hill Health Center in New Haven, where he pays on a sliding fee scale based on his income. ''You get discouraged every time you talk to somebody about insurance.'' 
 The state is working to reduce that information gap. Information on health care is scattered on the state Web site, but a law passed this year directed the Insurance Department to create a Web page explaining all of the different health care options. The site, which includes public and private insurance options, will be up by Jan. 1, said Susan Cogswell, the commissioner of the department.
 Information will not solve all the state's health care problems. But some problems, such as insuring children, are getting more attention than others. State Representative James Amann, the speaker of the House, has convened a group of doctors, public officials, child advocates and business leaders to learn how to help the approximately 71,000 children still without health insurance.
 But adults who do not have children face more daunting obstacles and have less of a voice in the state.
 ''HUSKY provides good coverage for children, but adults don't do nearly as well,'' said Stan Dorn, a senior policy analyst with the Economic and Social Research Institute in Washington, which is conducting a study of Connecticut's health care system for the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut, a nonprofit group that studies health insurance and finances other health advocates and research organizations. 
 For people deemed unemployable or those who haven't been able to work regularly and have extremely low incomes, the state offers medical assistance through State-Administered General Assistance. Its medical program, however, covers fewer than 30,000 people.
 Uninsured adults without children who do not fall into the correct income or disability categories have other options, both in the private and public health care markets. If they are self-employed, they can buy into the Municipal Employees Health Insurance Program, which offers them the same benefits as many municipal employees, or they can purchase private health care plans that have low premiums but high deductibles. Some advocates, however, said the available options simply do not address the real needs of the uninsured.
 ''The average uninsured person is making $20,000 and those options are still unaffordable or frankly aren't worth buying,'' said Ms. Andrews of the Connecticut Health Policy Project. ''There really aren't affordable options for low-income people who are childless.''

HEADLINE: For Workers, It's Face Time Over PC Time

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
IN the early hours last Tuesday, before most New Yorkers woke to learn that a transit strike had halted their subway and bus service, Judy Breck was at her computer, getting ready to work. 
 ''Sitting in my home studio on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, I am remembering the last New York City transit strike 25 years ago,'' Ms. Breck, the author of several books on the digital age, wrote at the Web log SmartMobs.com. ''For 11 days in the morning I had to make my way the seven miles downtown to Wall Street, where I worked for a few hours before making my way the seven miles back home.''
 Ms. Breck, then a secretary at a law firm, had few options. ''Working at home was limited mainly to invalids and wealthy executives,'' she wrote.
 ''Now, with mobile digital connectivity,'' she elaborated later in an e-mail message, ''you have an office wherever you are.'' In theory, this is true. For millions of New Yorkers, and millions more Americans -- business executives and managers, analysts, researchers, consultants and an unidentifiable number of others whose jobs require little more than a phone and a computer with an Internet connection -- working from home is a real option. 
 But as the world saw last week, telecommuting does not appear to be a mass phenomenon in New York. Along with the thousands of restaurant, retail and service industry personnel, construction workers, street sweepers, teachers and other employees for whom connectivity has little to do with making a living, there were plenty of desk jockeys turning their white collars to the wind and making their way to offices, when they could presumably have worked from home. 
 Why has telecommuting never really been embraced in the way futurists once said it would? The answer has little to do with logistics and more to do with tribal phenomena like status, power, fear and ritual. It's also a function of the fact that even in the digital age, people in cities from New York to San Francisco just like to lay eyes on one another. 
 ''If telecommuting were such a great idea, why do the Internet experts concentrate in a few small geographical areas?'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history and social sciences at Columbia University and the author of ''The Encyclopedia of New York City.'' 
 ''They, too, need the stimulation of other humans who are present in the flesh, not on a screen,'' he said. 
 As did, presumably, many of those New Yorkers who trudged across the bridges linking Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan last week. 
 Just how many of them were as well prepared to work at home as in the office is not known. Data from WorldatWork, a telework industry consortium, suggest that after flatlining at about 7.6 million for the last four years, the number of regular employees working at home at least one day a month jumped to 9.9 million in 2005. Tens of millions more workers -- self-employed types, contract employees -- swell the number who ''do some type of work from home'' at least one day a month to 26.1 million, although what exactly was meant by ''work'' was unclear. 
 Some big companies have embraced telecommuting. About 30 percent of AT&T's managers, for example, were working outside the traditional office as of last year. 
 But one need look no further than the annual Urban Mobility Study, from Texas A.&M. University, to see a countertrend as well. ''Traffic congestion levels have increased in every area since 1982,'' this year's report states. And near the top of miserably congested cities are those hotbeds of high tech: San Francisco, Dallas, San Diego, Seattle, Denver, Austin. 
 ''Even in a world of casual instant-messaging and near-free phone calling,'' said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of Internet governance at Oxford University, ''a shout down the hall still matters.'' 
 This is immensely frustrating to Representative Frank Wolf, a Republican of Virginia, who has spent the better part of a decade promoting telecommuting. He helped pass a 2001 bill requiring that all federal agencies make telecommuting available to eligible employees by the end of this year -- a goal that will not be reached.
 The benefits of telecommuting, Mr. Wolf noted in an interview, include easing traffic congestion, reducing fuel consumption and pollution, cost savings for employers and even maintaining continuity of government and the economy in the event of disaster or attack -- or a labor walkout. 
 ''So what's the magic of driving in a metal box to get to an office just to sit in front of a computer?'' he asked in exasperation.
 Some hurdles to telecommuting have persisted for almost 20 years. Employers, for instance, like to keep an eye on employees. Employees often fear that rewards will accrue to those dedicated stars who show up at work most often, and certainly to those who, unlike the lazy, wily telecommuter, brave the elements even during a transit strike.
 But daily journeys to and from work are more than just physical. For many workers they are necessary cognitive commutes. 
 ''It's in some ways an incredibly functional period for people getting into a work frame of mind or a home frame of mind,'' said Christina Nippert-Eng, a professor of sociology at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. 
 ''For people who really make a big distinction between work or home, they really need a bridging routine,'' she said. ''If they don't figure out how to do that, telecommuting won't work.''
 Just how many New Yorkers sought out their home-to-work bridges last week on a literal span of steel and concrete, and how many found them in a bowl of Haagen-Dazs and an hour of ''People's Court'' is not known, but what seems certain is that for all of the promise of telecommuting, the lure of the group -- of the center -- persists. 
 That's as true in New York as anywhere. 
 ''In an era when so much of our communication is electronic, the value of a face-to-face meeting has actually intensified,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University, ''since the phone and e-mail have become routine while a meeting reflects the importance of the person or topic.'' 
 And, Professor Moss added, ''the reason Manhattan rents are as high as they are is because people want to be near people -- there is an enormous productivity gain when people have access to people.''

HEADLINE: Silent Nights on the Gulf Coast

BYLINE: By John Grisham. 
John Grisham is the author, most recently, of ''The Broker.''

DATELINE: Charlottesville, Va. 

 BODY:
IN the harrowing days after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, the shellshocked and homeless survivors strung up tents and tarps wherever they could find standing shelter, anything to hide from the sun. Now, four months later, many of the tents remain: in the front lawns of once fine houses now gutted and unlivable, in small clearings between mountains of rubble, beside camping trailers too cramped for entire families, on concrete slabs wiped clean by the storm surge, even in the living rooms of houses with few walls but intact roofs. The sun is no longer the problem: instead, the most desperate of the hurricane's victims have stuffed tents of every imaginable make and model with Salvation Army blankets and mattresses to try to stay dry and warm. 
 There is the dismal feeling that some of these tents may not be so temporary. One tent city built by the Army, dubbed ''the Village,'' sits in the center of the small town of Pass Christian, some 30 miles west of Biloxi and at ground zero for Hurricane Katrina and its assault on the Gulf Coast. 
The Village is a gloomy grid of 70 tents, 10 numbered rows of seven each, housing about 150 people -- old, young, black, white, poor, middle-class, some so ill that their tents are marked ''Oxygen in Use.'' After four months, some of the shock of loss has worn off and the people go quietly about the daily challenges of securing a warm, private shower, washing whatever clothing they have left, and hoping that their children do not fall ill. 
 They are grateful for the dry bed and the free food. Everyone knows someone who is worse off, or dead. With tens of thousands of Mississippians displaced and living with families or friends around the country, the residents of the Village at least have their children with them and they are close to home. 
 A handful of tents are decorated for the holidays, but it seems almost cruel to ask a young mother what she's planning for Christmas.
 ''We're leaving,'' she says without hesitation. ''Getting out of here for a day or two.''
 All who are able plan to leave and find a relative. Last year, they were stringing lights and wrapping gifts and waiting for Santa. This year, the great Christmas wish in the Village is to finally get a trailer from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
 Indeed, one reason the place exists is the backlog of homeless people who need trailers. When FEMA closed the shelters and stopped paying for motel rooms, something had to be done. Thus, the tent cities. 
 Don't ask why it's taking so long to get a trailer because there is no answer. More than 24,000 temporary housing units have been delivered, but 10,000 more are needed. The delays are maddening. A woman in the nearby town of Necaise went to the FEMA office on Aug. 30, the day after the storm, and requested a trailer. She did the paperwork, answered all the questions. She is epileptic; her daughter is diabetic; her husband needs back surgery; their situation is urgent, and she has explained all this to FEMA many times. Four months later she's still waiting. Her story is not unusual. 
 A FEMA trailer is 8 feet wide, 30 feet long and 7 feet high. It has a bedroom, a kitchen/living area and a bathroom. It is equipped with a refrigerator, stove, heater, toilet and shower. A set of bunk beds can also be used as a storage area or pantry. The residents are required to furnish their own television, and the best place to put it is on the kitchen table. 
 There is no washer, dryer, bathtub or microwave. The trailer sleeps eight, supposedly, but the eight need to be very small and very fond of one another. That's why it's not unusual to see a pup tent or two pitched beside the trailer, probably occupied by the mom or the dad or both, regardless of how chilly the night might be. 
 The first one I examined was in Waveland, a small town hit so hard that there's virtually nothing left. A woman was inspecting her new trailer, thrilled that it has finally arrived. She and her family had been waiting for weeks, living with friends, counting the days. I confessed that I had never been inside a FEMA trailer, and she eagerly showed me around. It didn't take long. The two of us created a crowd. 
 We talked about the holidays. She said she certainly planned to put up a tree. ''Not sure where,'' she said as she looked around the claustrophobic living room. 
 A FEMA trailer is too small for a Christmas tree, so those who can muster enough spirit set them outside, either under an awning or tied to the trailer hitch. Driving around in the evening, I found it heartening to see a few tiny trees and some colorful lights. They illuminated the trailers and threw dim shadows on the ubiquitous rubble. Otherwise, the nights are very dark and quiet along the Coast. 
 Late one evening in Biloxi, on a desolate street two blocks from the beach, I saw a trailer with a small Christmas tree beside it. I stopped and said hello to the man inside. He gave me a very brief tour of his new quarters -- home to him, his wife and their dog. Outside, he showed me the ruins of the house they owned for 32 years. It was built on land 20 feet above sea level. Pointing to his friend's badly damaged house across the street, he described how the flood's water mark could be seen on the second floor, 22 feet higher. 
 ''What will you do for Christmas?'' I asked. 
 ''We won't stay here,'' he said. They planned to visit a relative a few miles away and try their best to celebrate. 
 I asked him how long he expected to live in the trailer. His answer was vaguely tied to an insurance dispute, and maybe litigation. I asked about the quality of the trailers. ''Not bad,'' he said. 
 There are mixed reviews about the reliability of the trailers, with some complaints about leaky roofs and cheap door hinges. Frankly, though, the people are so happy to have them that they're willing to overlook the flaws. 
 You see the trailers everywhere. They sit in the driveways of destroyed suburban homes, jacked up on blocks with sewer pipes running out and water hoses running in, power cords dangling from makeshift poles. They dot the countryside, sitting sadly where real houses once were. They're packed together by the hundreds in overnight settlements, newly flattened areas carved from pastures that were quickly leased by farmers to the government. In these FEMA towns, with so many highly stressed people living on top of each other, officials worry about tension and crime. 
 As with the tents in the Village, you look at the FEMA trailers and wonder how temporary they really are. No houses are being built. Many of those damaged will remain untouched while the great debate with insurance companies over wind damage versus water damage is played out in court. Many months will pass before there is significant new construction. 
 Unlike New Orleans, where the floods were heaviest in the poorer neighborhoods, the Gulf Coast experienced damage that cut across social and economic lines. Hurricane Katrina did not discriminate here. Wealthy people now dwell in FEMA trailers that are exactly the same size as the ones handed out to those who were living in subsidized apartments. 
 When it's warm enough, the trailer people spend as much as time as possible outside. Porch sitting, a way of life, is still carried on, though radically modified. Tarps and awnings are affixed to the trailers and provide cover. The families and neighbors gather in folding lawn chairs and chat deep into the night about their lives before the storm and about the struggle to get through another day and find some measure of normality. There is guarded talk of the future. 
 The defiance that came so naturally in the aftershocks of Hurricane Katrina has gradually yielded to weary determination. Four months have passed with little improvement, and the challenges ahead are forbidding. 
 Mississippi's governor, Haley Barbour, has said his state needs $34 billion to rebuild. The state's annual budget is about a 10th of that, with virtually nothing set aside for such emergencies. The bold promises made in the heat of the moment after the storm have so far been pathetically empty. Congress has so far authorized nearly $100 billion for emergency relief and cleanup, but only a third of that has hit the ground. 
 Not lost on the people here was the recent rush to pass more tax cuts for the rich. And a question often heard is, ''Why are we spending billions to rebuild Iraq and not a dime down here?''
 There is a fear of being forgotten by the government. Washington is preoccupied with a war and its glut of messy side issues, and attention will soon turn to the midterm elections. There is also the very real fear of being forgotten by the press. The satellite trucks and cameras have long since gone. If the news media forget, then so will the people with the money in Washington. Pollsters are already noting the rapid decline in the disaster's importance on the national radar screen.
 THE fear of being forgotten is soothed somewhat by the seemingly inexhaustible waves of church folks, students, retirees and private relief workers who've dug in and done the dirty work. Tons of food, clothing and supplies continue to pour into the region. Countless hours have been spent hauling debris, cutting trees and patching roofs. The volunteer spirit of the American and Canadian people lifted the Gulf Coast from its knees and continues to sustain it. 
 But volunteers cannot build bridges, ports and highways. New infrastructure will require lots of federal aid, and Congress has been slow to respond. 
 Americans have short memories. Life moves so fast and one catastrophe shoves away the last one. The horrible images from New Orleans and the Gulf Coast are fading. A year ago we watched in disbelief when a tsunami hit Southeast Asia and killed more than 150,000. We sent checks and food and two months later we'd practically forgotten about it. 
 The tragedy of Katrina will worsen if the Gulf Coast is forgotten. People can't survive in tents. And FEMA trailers aren't meant to be longtime homes. 
 If there is a common Christmas wish from this torn land, it is simply this: Please don't forget us.

HEADLINE: Trade, Oppression, Revenge

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The N.S.A. spying story garnered most of the headlines, but surely the Bolivian election was the most important thing that happened last week. That election illustrated many of the combustible phenomena we'll be dealing with for the rest of our lives. It demonstrated that economic modernization can inflame ethnic animosity, that democracy can be the enemy of capitalism and that globalization, far from bringing groups closer together, can send them off in wild and hostile directions. 
 In Bolivia, 3 percent of the people -- who tend to be white -- control almost all of the economic resources, and 65 percent of the people -- who tend to be Indian -- control almost nothing. 
 Over the past 20 years, international institutions have advised Bolivians to adopt the standard set of macroeconomic reforms that worked well in Southeast Asia, India and Chile: balance your budgets, control inflation, open your economy to export-led growth and privatize state industries. 
 But given the ethnic divisions in Bolivia, and in much of Latin America, these policies haven't worked. Or to be precise, they've worked for the elites, but not everybody else. Investment opened up, but foreign investors naturally made deals with the Bolivian whites, who had the right manners, skills and political connections -- and control of the resources. Meanwhile, poor Indians saw only meager benefits. And, to add insult to stagnation, privatization meant that they found themselves paying more for rice, water and gasoline. 
 Most important, the elites made sure that the macroeconomic reforms, which helped the crony capitalists, were not accompanied by microeconomic reforms, which would have added to Indian social mobility. According to a new World Bank report, ''Doing Business in 2006,'' it takes 15 bureaucratic steps to start a small business in Bolivia (presumably with corruption all along the way). It takes 187 days to get a commercial license and costs over two and a half times the average Bolivian's annual income.
 Because of discrimination, over-regulation and corruption, it is hard for people not in the elite to rise and succeed, even if they have the skills.
 What happened next was perfectly predicted by a Yale Law professor, Amy Chua, in her 2003 book, ''World on Fire.'' Chua noticed that many developing nations have ''market-dominant minorities'' that disproportionately benefit from globalization. They also have impoverished majorities that are empowered by democratization. Americans think democracy and capitalism go together, Chua noted, but increasingly developing-world majorities are using their voting power to lash out against rich minorities and against capitalism. These revolts, she observed, fuse legitimate class resentments with nasty ethnic hatreds.
 The first stirrings of the Bolivian revolt were led by Felipe Quispe, who threatened to throw all the whites out of the country. Last week's election was won by Evo Morales, who was backed by Hugo Chavez and inspired by Che Guevara and Fidel Castro (though it's not clear how radical he'll be in practice).
 The larger point is that the two big trends sweeping the globe -- market-based globalization and democratization -- are not putting us on the glide path to a sort of worldwide Switzerland. Instead, we could see a rash of Hugo Chavez-like demagogues or Robert Mugabe-like tyrants. As Chua notes, we've already seen ethnically based confiscation in Indonesia, and genocidal violence against the market-dominant Tutsis in Rwanda. 
 And things get ugly when the demagogues start scapegoating market-dominant minorities that have risen not via colonialism but through hard work and entrepreneurial skill. There is already resentment against affluent Jews in Latin America, the ethnic Chinese in the Philippines and Eritreans in Ethiopia. 
 The blunt truth is that whether their success is deserved or not, different ethnic groups prosper at different rates as markets open up, and these inequalities will produce ever-growing resentments and flare-ups. 
 These resentments have helped fuel the socialist revival in Latin America. Across Asia, which seems to be prospering, there are signs of ethno-nationalist reversals. 
 Even in the age of global trade and wireless communications, there is still the tribe. And where ethnic divisions are inflamed, or where tribal cultures strangle economic or political growth, tribes will lash out, if only for their own self-respect. 
 That's why development economists must be cultural geographers. Economic policies can't work where culture is ailing.

HEADLINE: Rethinking the Nation's First Suburb

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
WHAT is the future of suburbia in America -- especially on Long Island, where it all began?
 Is the future more of the white picket fence, multicar garage and backyard barbecue, replicated in subdivisions across Nassau and Suffolk, gobbling up the remaining vacant land?
 Is it the towering 60-story Great Lighthouse proposed as the beacon of a new urban hub at the Nassau Coliseum -- and the tallest building outside Manhattan in the New York metropolitan area?
 Or will suburbia be reinvented as something else?
 One thing is certain: Long Island is going through a midlife crisis, groaning under crushing local taxes and exorbitant housing prices. Among leaders and everyday residents alike, pressure is rising for change. 
 ''Long Island is where we invented the modern suburb, and whether Long Island will remake itself for the 21st century, that's the challenge,'' said Bruce Katz, a vice president at the nonprofit Brookings Institution, which is analyzing major policy issues in the nation's oldest suburbs.
 Post-World War II suburbia sprouted on Long Island, starting in Levittown, to meet the demand for housing for returning military veterans. The new communities evolved as the antithesis to big cities and sought to counter their urban ills. Suburbs blossomed as America's dominant way of life.
 But now, after more than half a century, the suburbs face their own set of problems.
 The debate over how to revamp the suburbs -- even over the very definition of suburbia -- is nowhere more intense than in their Long Island birthplace. The Island is once again a social laboratory, as academics and policymakers grapple with suburbia's future amid changing public opinion.
 The debate reverberated in the recent election campaign. Republican opponents accused County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi of turning Nassau into the sixth borough of New York City with his plans for a hub around the Coliseum. He in turn accused Republican officials in Hempstead of allowing illegal rentals that critics have called the Queensification of Long Island.
 Suburbia claims many successes, especially on the Island, where 2.8 million people make their home. Nassau and Suffolk Counties have a $120 billion annual economy -- bigger than in many states and some nations. Property values are at historic highs, personal incomes run 20 to 60 percent above the national average, crime is at recorded lows and schools churn out top-scoring students. 
 But the Island, like many other suburbs, is also suffering a housing crisis, with eye-popping costs and scarce vacancies. Illegal dwellings abound, in basements and attics. Aging baby boomers fear they can't afford to retire here. Their grown children are often priced out of the market as well. Employers complain that the lack of housing is causing them to lose workers and is stunting business. Population growth has stalled in Nassau, once one of the nation's fastest-expanding areas but now down to 1.34 million in the 2000 census, about 95,000 below its peak in 1970.
 ''The older people are moving to Florida and the younger ones to Dallas,'' said Dr. Kenneth T. Jackson of Columbia University, author of the 1987 book ''Crabgrass Frontier: The Suburbanization of the United States.'' An anonymous respondent to a Northrop Grumman survey on housing was succinct: ''You don't pay me enough to live here.''
 Other issues include local taxes that are among the nation's highest, gangs, traffic jams, pockets of poverty and decay, dwindling open space, insufficient mass transit, segregation, blighted strip malls, an influx of immigrants, sprawl and a lack of focal points for community life.

Lawns and Picket Fences
 So what to do?
 ''In the 70's there was the death of the cities, and we're 20 years away from the death of the suburbs,'' Mr. Suozzi said. ''But we can avert that, we can fix the problems and have a renaissance. We want to preserve the best of suburbia, the single-family home with the lawn and white picket fence and the baseball field down the block.''
 Mr. Suozzi is pushing a New Suburbia that revitalizes older downtowns, cleans up polluted brownfields for development, adds housing that is more diverse in type, size and cost, recruits tax-paying business and upgrades struggling minority neighborhoods. He also is promoting ambitious plans for a central Nassau hub with offices, retail, entertainment, its own transit system and even a zoo.
 ''We need to rethink suburbia,'' said Richard V. Guardino, dean of Hofstra University's Center for Suburban Studies, which earlier this year sponsored a conference called New Visions for Suburban Life. 
 Some officials are seeking government aid for the reinvention of suburbia. At a conference sponsored by the Long Island Housing Partnership this year titled ''Suburban Evolution: Seeking Solutions,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat, and Representative Peter King of Nassau, a Republican, proposed a federal law to aid troubled suburbs. Their plan -- echoing decades of remolding and reviving cities through urban renewal -- amounts to a call for a kind of suburban renewal.
 Some call for radical transformation, even a startling new look. A couple of miles from Levittown, in Uniondale, Charles B. Wang proposed something never before contemplated on Long Island: the Great Lighthouse, with a luxury hotel and condominiums, topped by an observation deck and a large shiny ball visible for miles.
 Whether that tower will be built, and at its proposed 60-story height, is uncertain. During his re-election campaign, Mr. Suozzi, who had endorsed Mr. Wang as the developer for the site, backed away from the concept of a soaring skyscraper, saying it might be better as two 30-story towers, three 20-story towers or some other configuration.
 But the serious consideration of the lighthouse, including endorsements by the head of the region's leading business group, Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, symbolizes a sea change for Long Island, where residents at public hearings have regularly protested proposed three- or four-story garden apartments as high-rise monstrosities.

The Opposite of the City
 Long Island has been parodied as that quirky place where people park on driveways and drive on parkways, the butt of jokes for its Longuyland accent and the paradoxically named Long Island Expressway.
 But kidding aside, the Island became ''the embodiment of the American ideal of a single-family house surrounded by grass,'' said Dr. Jackson, the Columbia professor. 
 Long Island defined itself as the opposite of New York City: sprawl and elbow room instead of density and congestion, the mall instead of Midtown, low rise instead of skyscrapers, single-family houses instead of apartments, greenery instead of pavement, cars instead of mass transit, home rule instead of centralized municipal government, Republicans instead of Democrats, white middle class instead of economic and racial diversity.
 For better and for worse, that model, with the commuter dad and stay-at-home mom, set the national pattern. Lee E. Koppelman, director of the Long Island Planning Board, a bicounty agency, said, ''Nassau and Suffolk have been a microcosm of the entire U.S. suburban experience.''
 As the first postwar suburb, Mr. Crosson said, ''we are experiencing now what every suburb in the country will experience. We are ahead of the curve.''
 Yet Long Island is also behind the times. ''Many other regions are ahead of us in the solutions,'' said Eric Alexander, director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit planning group. He pointed to innovations that improved suburbs around Chicago and Portland, Ore., and in Florida. The Island still has ''a second chance to make things work,'' he said.
 Some newer suburbs have avoided the mistakes of the pioneers. On the outskirts of Washington, some counties have carefully coordinated housing and business development with a new commuter rail system. Long Island, meanwhile, is stuck with roads that Robert Moses designed to carry city residents to beaches and antiquated east-west railroad lines with large gaps in service. Even today, Levittown has no train station.
 Elsewhere, planners have fostered mini-communities where people can walk to work and shopping, forgoing cars and traffic. Such projects may now be coming to Long Island; the plan for the Heartland Town Square includes thousands of apartments, office buildings, stores and entertainment at the site of the old Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood.
 Older suburbs like Long Island face hurdles in fixing past mistakes. ''It's a midcourse correction,'' said Pearl Kamer, an economist for the Long Island Association, ''but the retrofit is very difficult.''
 The predominance of two suburban icons, the single-family home and the private automobile, is at the root of housing and traffic problems, experts say.
 ''Old housing stock built around Ozzie and Harriet and the kids just doesn't do it anymore,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the nonprofit Regional Plan Association, which recommends policies for the New York City region.
 Census figures show that traditional couples with children under 18 now make up fewer than half of the Island's households. The rest are singles, couples without children and single parents. ''Our demography has changed dramatically since Levittown,'' Dr. Kamer said, ''but we have not kept pace in our mix of housing types.''
 The transportation quandary, says Lisa Tyson, director of the Long Island Progressive Coalition, a liberal civic group, is that ''we've created a self-fulfilling prophecy that guarantees we'll be stuck in traffic.'' The lack of population density limits the ridership needed to pay for mass transit and to generate frequent service to make it convenient.

Tired of Traffic
 Public attitudes, which for decades fended off tampering with the suburban way of life, are changing, some polls show. ''There's a general psychology shift for suburban residents,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of planning and public policy at Rutgers University. ''They're tired of development, tired about traffic and congestion'' and even are showing ''mall fatigue.''
 Freezing development and preserving vacant land have become politically popular, but that limits residential construction and business expansion.
 Despite rising dissatisfaction, many residents remain wary of change. 
 ''It looks to many people like you're trying to urbanize suburbia,'' Senator Clinton said at her conference. A speaker from the Regional Plan Association, Jeffrey Zupan, agreed that suburbanites ''don't want to replicate what they fled'' in New York City. Yet he said the Island has little choice but to ''grow up instead of out.''
 In a recent poll of residents by the Rauch Foundation's Long Island Index, 74 percent called the housing shortage very or extremely serious. Majorities were open to more apartments and moderately priced homes. But residents also worried that such steps would worsen traffic, schools and taxes, hurt property values and bring ''the wrong kind of people.''
 Solutions can be simple and old-fashioned, like adding a couple floors of apartments over shops in small downtowns near train stations, as is being done above a CVS store in Port Jefferson. Such ''smart growth'' developments expand the apartment supply, generate village activity and link dwellings to mass transportation.
 Other plans are bold, like the call by Steve Levy, the county executive in Suffolk, for companies to sponsor 1,000 new homes on sod farms in Yaphank for their employees. Some proposals are grand, if not grandiose: Mr. Suozzi says that mass transit for the Nassau hub, perhaps a monorail, light rail or special buses, could cost $1 billion.
 A major obstacle is the Island's balkanized government of 2 counties, 13 towns, 2 cities, 95 villages and hundreds of school, fire, library, sewer, water and other special districts. 
 One answer is to impose solutions from above, like a bill in the State Legislature that would require parts of new developments to be denser. Other planners work from the bottom up, gathering residents and groups in sessions to create a plan for their community, as was done for a renewal of New Cassel.

Victims of Success
 What exactly is suburbia, anyway? Apart from a vague notion of low-density development near an urban center, ''there's no real accepted definition,'' said Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor and demographer at Queens College.
 Levittown -- and with it the social phenomenon of suburbia -- was born almost overnight as assembly-line construction crews transformed potato fields into rows of identical Cape Cod houses. They were snatched up by young couples, who stood in long lines to become first-time homeowners.
 The boxy little houses with their cookie-cutter uniformity, originally selling for $7,000, have been expanded, remodeled and redecorated beyond recognition and now sell for 50 to 60 times the initial price. The original affordable community for young families has ceased being that.
 ''Property values are going through the roof because people want to be here,'' Mr. Suozzi said. Dr. Koppelman, the planner, said, ''The average citizen is perfectly happy.''
 Long Island is a victim of its own success. The median house price has soared past $400,000, more in Nassau and a bit less in Suffolk. That is nearly 5 times the average income; housing experts recommend 2.5 times as the limit for affordability.
 ''The average family on Long Island can't afford to buy a new home -- they are trapped where they are, and that's never happened before,'' said Mr. Crosson of the Long Island Association.
 Long Island faces an unexpected rival in a reinvigorated New York City, with its reduced crime, reviving economy and growing population. Even some of the Island's retired political and business leaders have left, said Michael Dawidziak, a political consultant. Housing costs and the salaries needed to pay them have forced him to pare his staff and have affected his own family, he said.
 ''My daughter moved off Long Island to Wyoming with my grandchildren because they couldn't afford to live here,'' Mr. Dawidziak said. His son stayed, but in an illegal apartment that costs $700 a month nonetheless. 
 In Sag Harbor, Lauren A. Fortmiller ran for village mayor pledging to tackle the housing shortage -- but left office in 2003 when she could no longer afford to live there herself.
 Long Island especially lags in rentals, which are 19 percent of the housing stock in Nassau and 18 percent in Suffolk. By comparison, the percentages are 24 in Monmouth and 32 in Bergen Counties in New Jersey, 28 in Rockland and 38 in Westchester, and 29 in Fairfield County in Connecticut. 
 Housing is not the only problem, critics say.
 ''Long Island characterizes the best things and worst things about suburbia,'' said Sarah Lansdale, executive director of Sustainable Long Island, a nonprofit group fostering socially and environmentally responsible development.
 For decades the Island has been a national leader in preserving open space, Ms. Lansdale said. Last year voters approved measures in four town and county referendums to buy more land, even though that also curbs space for new housing.
 ''Long Island is also known for great schools,'' Ms. Lansdale said, yet the failing Roosevelt district became the first taken over by New York State education officials. Several other districts are also struggling.
 The Island takes pride in its environment, parks, beaches and golf courses, and it has nurtured museums, galleries, concert halls, theaters and sports teams. Still, leaders lament that it lacks focal centers and a clear image. Suburban highways lined by Home Depot, McDonald's, Blockbuster and Staples could be -- and are -- anyplace.
 While other suburbs have pushed the boundaries farther out for new development, Long Island faces a real physical limit, its coastline.
 A study by the Long Island Index says than only 10 percent of the Island's space remains to be developed. Mr. Levy said, ''To continue with haphazard sprawl -- you can't do it, because we're running out of land.''
 Once a symbol of youthful vibrancy, suburbia is aging. In Levittown, Gov. George E. Pataki visited a place last year that the original suburbanites probably never contemplated: a senior center. In Lynbrook, youngsters flocked to the Tanglewood camp over the years as their summer playground. Now it has been demolished to make way for a four-story assisted-living residence for the elderly.
 Demand was instantaneous for the new WCI Communities retirement complex in Eastport, called Encore Atlantic Shores. The plan calls for 240 homes and a clubhouse with exercise rooms, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis and boccie courts and a putting green. When a model unit opened last year, 1,200 people signed up to see it.
 There are other issues. The Rauch Foundation's president, Dr. Nancy Rauch Douzinas, talks about the ''separation of people, by race, by income, by age.''
 The Island is also one of the nation's most segregated suburbs, Ms. Lansdale said. That legacy began in Levittown with federal housing policies that encouraged segregation and deeds that forbade selling to nonwhites.
 Similarly, the novelist Chang-Rae Lee speaks of social isolation. ''People go from their bedroom to the garage to the office and back,'' he said. Instead of interacting the way city people do, ''everybody has their own private subway'' -- their cars.
 Mr. Lee, a self-described ''product of the suburbs,'' grew up in Westchester, married a Suffolk woman and now lives in Princeton, N.J. ''Long Island has been the great laboratory of the American dream,'' he said. ''I am so curious to see what will happen. There are all these problems no one expected. Is it too late for Long Island, or for any established suburb? That's the question I have. Or do you have to go out and build a new suburb?''

HEADLINE: Businesses Ponder Pluses and Minuses As Christmas and Hanukkah Converge 

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
IN the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, business at the Wright Music shop in Port Washington typically runs backward: a lot of returns, and very few new sales. But the quirks of the holiday calendar this year have Jonathan W. Watkins, the owner of the store, looking forward to the week.
 ''I expect to be busier than last year, because a lot of family members get money as their Hanukkah gift,'' Mr. Watkins said. ''Some of them will use that money to buy a guitar, a saxophone.''
Businesses all over the Island have been sizing up what it will mean for them that the eight-day Jewish festival of Hanukkah, which usually falls earlier in the month, is starting on the evening of Christmas Day this year. 
 Some see potential headaches in the confluence of holidays, which last happened in 1959. Others see it breathing life into the usual late-December lull, as consumers and businesses alike stretch their holiday shopping and entertaining past Dec. 25. 
 ''Normally it gets quiet after Christmas, and we get ready for New Year's Eve,'' said John A. Kowalenko, who owns the Art of Eating Catering in Amagansett. ''But there are a number of events happening between Christmas and New Year's, including some office parties that we are catering. I think a lot of people are resolved to the fact that it is going to be a very social time, and not much business will be done.''
 The money people will be spending after Christmas is money they did not spend before Christmas. Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist of the Long Island Association, the Island's largest business organization, said she expected retailers to cut prices sharply to clear shelves of merchandise because sales had tapered off from the usual rush starting on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.
 ''With the inflation rate in the New York region over 4 percent, consumer spending has not kept pace with inflation,'' she said, noting that sales tax revenues on Long Island were only 3.8 percent higher in November than they were a year earlier.
 Janine Nebons, general manager of the 170-store Tanger Outlet Center in Riverhead, said he expected Dec. 26 ''to start to look like Black Friday, because of all the people armed with gift cards, and all the stores that will run huge after-Christmas sales.'' 
 ''If Hanukkah had been at the beginning of the month, those who received a gift card for Hanukkah would have been tempted to spend it before Christmas, and ride the promotional sales,'' Ms. Nebons said. ''But because the holiday is so late, they will buy the after-Christmas sales, and that's why sales could be huge -- bigger than Christmas Eve.''
 Ms. Nebons said that many stores would cut their prices because ''with the two holidays coming together and the pent-up gift-card float, they have to compete to get them into their store.''
 But post-Christmas sales are not universal. Steve Giannousis, who owns Laurette Furs in Woodmere, said he does not generally run a sale until the end of January. He said the weather had more influence on his business than the timing of the holidays: ''Business is better the colder it is.'' 
 Jerry Marlow, one of the owners of Collins & Main, a restaurant in Sayville, said the confluence of holidays was an ideal situation from a business standpoint.
 ''When Hanukkah falls earlier,'' Mr. Marlow said, ''some people are not able to make the office party because they want to be home for their family's Hanukkah celebration.'' 
 But some other business people saw trouble in the calendar. Mathew Kakis owns Mormile Florists in Rockville Centre, which usually does a brisk business in gift baskets of fancy kosher foods at this time of year. But many of the orders come in at the last minute, in the hours before Hanukkah begins at sundown. This year, though, the shop will not be open to take the orders, because Mr. Kakis closes on Christmas Day.
 Frances DAlisa has a similar problem. She and her husband, Tony, own DAlisa Pizza in Deer Park. 
 Mrs. DAlisa said that 60 percent of the pizzeria's customers are Jewish, and many of them order dinner in for the first night of Hanukkah; this year she told those who placed advance orders that they could be picked up on Christmas Eve, but the store would be closed Christmas Day. Even so, she said last week, ''I think we are going to do more business this year than last, because with the holidays coming at the same time, it's one big holiday for all.'' 
 David Dalsimer, who owns Dalsimer Florists in Cedarhurst, an affluent, heavily Jewish community, saw a different threat to local merchants in the coincidence of timing -- not just Hanukkah lining up with Christmas, but also with the week that public schools are closed. Many families, he said, may go away on vacation for the week, and tell the children that the trip is ''present enough for you.''
 On the other hand, in communities with many second and vacation homes, like the Hamptons, those vacationers may increase sales. Edward R. Dressler, manager of London Jewelers in East Hampton, said he expected the last week of the year to be busier than usual because it was also Hanukkah.
 At Aura Hair and Color Emporium in Bellmore, Christopher Guardino, the owner, said that the bunched-up holidays were bunching up his business. ''Clients are coming in at the same time now, whereas if Hanukkah was at the beginning of the month, our appointments would be more spread out,'' he said. 
 To handle the rush, Mr. Guardino said, he had to add two to three employees to his usual staff of six and has also added Sunday hours. 
 Gift and clothing retailers also reported some time-shifting in their business patterns. ''People typically buy pretty close to the holiday, so you just have to hustle a little bit more,'' said Warren H. Cohn, who owns the Amityville Men's Shop. ''It will increase my December sales instead of November sales. But as long as it increases sales, I don't care.''
 Florie Robinson, who owns Florie's Finales, a kosher pastry and gift-basket business in Nesconset, said the late start for Hanukkah had an opposite effect, easing the pressure by spreading out her holiday business over the whole of December. She was able to spend the first few weeks of the month filling her usual corporate orders and still have time for individual orders closer to the holiday.
 Christmas Day is always a big one for movie theaters, and this year promises to be no exception, according to Dylan Skolnick, associate director of the Cinema Arts Centre in Huntington. ''The fact that Christmas coincides with Hanukkah shouldn't be a problem, because Hanukkah is an eight-day holiday, giving you time to get out and watch a movie,'' he said.
 Jeff Dunetz of Dix Hills, who is Jewish, said he had been going to the movies every Dec. 25 for years, and he planned to do the same on Christmas morning this year. ''We're thinking of seeing 'King Kong,' '' he said. ''I think it will be a hot movie, and there won't be any lines at that time.'' 
 Would a trip to the movies interfere with preparations for Hanukkah in the evening? No problem, Mr. Dunetz said. Since Hanukkah is a relatively minor event in religious terms, with no big traditional meal to be prepared, as there would be on some other holidays, he and his wife will simply sing Hanukkah songs with their children, eat some latkes, light the menorah and exchange a few gifts. 
 Evan Mayerhoff, chairman of the Christmas Day volunteer program at Temple Beth El in Great Neck, said the coincidence of Christmas and the start of Hanukkah would not deter the 35 to 40 members of his synagogue who take the places of Christian volunteers at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset on Christmas Day.
 ''We start at 9 a.m. doing different things,'' he said. ''Some of us work at the nurse's station, visit the patients, run errands for the nurses, fill water pitchers or bring patients in wheelchairs to Christmas Mass. We finish in the early afternoon, around 2 or 2:30.''
 In fact, Mr. Mayerhoff said, the coincidence is especially appropriate for his program, which has been operating for more than 30 years.
 ''Hanukkah is a way to celebrate religious freedom,'' he said. ''We are respecting other people's religion by helping them out.''

HEADLINE: Court Fight Overshadows Yonkers Project

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
FOR years, development of Ridge Hill, off the New England Thruway not far from Stew Leonard's, was billed as just the thing that could pull this city out of an economic depression and raise its spirits. The project, a $660 million complex of stores and apartments, would provide desperately needed money and visitors, backers said. 
 The 1,000 high-rise apartment and condominiums would draw new residents and their taxes. The 1.3 million square feet of retail space would bring in new shoppers and their taxes. The developer, Forest City Ratner, billed the complex as the first ''lifestyle center'' in the region and promised that it would put Yonkers on the map in a way the city had only fantasized about. 
But in recent weeks, even as the final deal was beginning to fall into place, the plan generated acrimonious debate in language familiar in Yonkers. There were accusations of backroom arrangements and ethical violations, complete with shouting matches at City Council meetings. 
 Earlier this month the council voted, 4-3, to give the project the initial go-ahead, changing the zoning from office space to retail and residential. But groundbreaking is still a long way off; the three council members opposed to it have filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court, claiming that a procedural change enacted to win support for the project violated more than a dozen city rules.
 ''What is now being played out is people's best hopes and worst fears,'' said Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester County legislator who represents Yonkers and joined the lawsuit against the city. ''You might have a much-needed revenue boost, but on the other hand there is extraordinary scrutiny because of the way Yonkers does, has done, business. It's a place plagued by questionable practices.''
 The Ridge Hill project has come under attack almost since the moment it was proposed nearly three years ago. Much of the criticism focused on the Ridge Hill Development Corporation, a private nonprofit group -- which owned the land and would have received millions of dollars in lease payments from the developer. Some residents and state officials voiced complaints about this, pointing out that the corporation was not answerable to voters or elected officials. Last summer, in response to the criticism, the entity agreed to sell the land to the developer, turn over the proceeds to the city and disband.
 At that point, Mayor Philip A. Amicone and other supporters believed that the most formidable hurdle had been cleared. The next would come in gathering enough council backers; there were already three. 
 By the end of October, Mayor Amicone had a fourth -- one short of the five needed to change the zoning and advance the project. But he was anxious to resolve the issue quickly, because a key supporter, Richard Martinelli, the council president, was in danger of losing his seat to a Democratic challenger. 
 After Mr. Martinelli lost to Chuck Lesnick, the council members supporting the project and Mayor Amicone formed a Plan B: Rather than lobby for the fifth vote, they would change the requirement to four votes. The change would put Yonkers in line with most other municipalities in the county. 
 The council members supporting the project, whom opponents derisively refer to as ''the gang of four,'' approved the rule change in mid-November. Earlier this month, after the lifting of a court injunction that had blocked the procedural change, the four approved the zoning change. (Mr. Martinelli does not leave office until Jan. 1.) As part of an agreement with Ratner, the city received a written guarantee that the developer would annually pay Yonkers $9.5 million in property taxes and an estimated $20 million in sales taxes. Ratner is expected to buy the lease from the Ridge Hill Development Corporation; the estimated $60 million profit will go directly to the city. 
 Although the deal is far more profitable for the city than the $1.2 million annual payment initially proposed by Ratner, critics say that it still does not go far enough and that Yonkers has given up whatever power it had left in the bargaining process. 
 ''They get the green light to go and we lose whatever control and assurances we have,'' said Councilwoman Dee Barbato, whose district encompasses the project site. Ms. Barbato still considers the expected increase in traffic on Tuckahoe Road, adjacent to the site, a major concern. 
 Only the four supportive council members took part in the most recent negotiations with Ratner; the remaining three then said they had been locked out of the process. 
 Mr. Martinelli and Mr. Amicone have said the city had no choice and kept talks going to secure the best deal it could. Both expressed worries that to let the project stall would spell doom for the city. 
 ''If we have one of the best and most experienced developers in the city come in here and have trouble,'' the mayor said in an interview before the approval, ''what kind of message are we sending to the rest of the business world who is thinking of coming into Yonkers? We might as well hang up a sign that says, 'Don't come, we don't want your money,' and hang a noose around our necks.'' 
 Mr. Amicone has long viewed the project as the best hope to cover a projected $40 million budget gap over the next several years. Both supporters and opponents have also said it could mean a lasting legacy for Mr. Amicone, who has struggled to remake the image of city government. 
 Since the 81-acre project was first floated, powerful Westchester insiders including Al Pirro, former Mayor John Spencer and former State Assemblyman Michael Spano have fought to move it forward.
 ''When this thing is finally built,'' said Bruce Bender, a Ratner executive, ''everyone is going to want to come in and shop and give this city money. We know that, but we have to get started to prove that.'' 
 During a special city council meeting called to vote on the zoning change, members of the public were not permitted to speak. Less than two weeks earlier, a crowd had shown up to plead with the council not to make the change. A few had tears in their eyes. The council's chamber was filled to capacity, and dozens crowded just outside. 
 As Ratner executives made plans to break ground in the spring, the protesters vowed to keep up their fight in court.

HEADLINE: Shoppers in a Parallel Paradise

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

DATELINE: SLEEPY HOLLOW 

 BODY:
WHEN Pedro Urgiles started his accounting business here more than a decade ago, there were only a handful of Spanish-speaking store owners along Beekman Avenue. The village's Ecuadorean immigrants, like Mr. Urgiles, patronized few stores. But as soon as he opened up shop, the customers began filing in. 
 They weren't necessarily there for accounting help.
''They said, 'Pedro, tomorrow it is supposed to rain, I need an umbrella,' so I brought in umbrellas,'' Mr. Urgiles said. ''They said 'Pedro, I would like to get some socks,' so I brought in socks. They said, 'Pedro, I like this music,' so I started selling this music.'' 
 Mr. Urgiles's business eventually branched out even further -- after he noticed how much help his customers needed at income-tax deadline time. They arrived carrying receipts and pay stubs bundled together with rubber bands; they had done almost nothing to stay organized throughout the year. 
 Most were Ecuadorean immigrants like himself, and they needed phone cards. They needed documents to be notarized, and a place to buy photo identification cards. Mr. Urgiles began selling it all.
 These days Canario Express is brimming with enough merchandise to make a five-and-dime look limited. And it has company: Dozens of signs in Spanish crowd the storefront windows that line these blocks. In fact, the bustling immigrant businesses and the larger shopping district that surrounds them, uninvolved, seem to exist in parallel economic universes.
 Nearly all of the hundreds of customers Mr. Urgiles sees regularly are immigrants from Latin America; he estimates that more than 90 percent are from Ecuador. The vast majority live in or around Sleepy Hollow (though a few come from places like Peekskill or Mount Kisco because the store is one of only a few places that sell Ecuadorean newspapers and magazines).
 Beyond Sleepy Hollow, in places like Ossining, Tarrytown, New Rochelle and Port Chester, the immigrant-owned stores are changing the character of central business districts -- and changing the way business is done. They are thriving from the cash of Latino customers who once existed under the radar of local governments and business owners. They rely on an ever-growing customer base of new immigrants, and on devotion to the business model that Mr. Urgiles has found so successful: if you provide it, they will buy it.
 On Main Street in Port Chester, for example, storefront mannequins wear sparkling dresses for sale, in the same stores that offer school backpacks and men's work boots. Few items cost more than $40 to $50. 
 For shoppers used to carefully pruned department and specialty stores, the hodgepodge can be bewildering. But immigrant customers remain loyal, for reasons of both economic necessity and simple convenience. 
 ''I know that I can find everything I need without problems, without worrying about a special sale, and from someone I can speak to easily,'' said Carmen Morales, a 38-year-old Port Chester resident who immigrated from Colombia. She often buys presents for baptisms or weddings from the stores here. ''If I want something they don't have, they will order it for me and call me as soon as it comes.'' 
 When a large new shopping mall opened in the village last spring, Ms. Morales said, she made a couple of trips to Marshalls and the Designer Shoe Warehouse, but she grew tired of the crowds. All of the Christmas gifts for her two young daughters and several nieces and nephews came from locally owned stores this year, she said.
 Such customers ''have to be taken seriously because of the amount of money they are spending,'' said Linda Rey, president of the Sleepy Hollow Chamber of Commerce, adding that her father built Rey Insurance Company through the 1970's and 80's in part by catering to Spanish-speaking recent arrivals. ''People have catered to their own since Ellis Island -- that's why you have little pockets of ethnic businesses everywhere.'' 
 In Ossining, the Chamber of Commerce estimates that nearly one-third of the businesses are owned by Latino immigrants, but only a handful of the owners are members of the chamber. 
 ''We have tried to dig them out, but it is difficult, either because they don't see the benefit of it or because there is a language barrier,'' said Jerry Gershner, vice president of the Greater Ossining Chamber of Commerce. ''To the extent that a store holds itself out to be a Latino store, with signs in Spanish or whatever, probably the Americans, the Caucasians, won't go there.'' 
 There are now so many Hispanic-owned businesses that competition is becoming a problem. More than 2,500 Latino-owned businesses have opened in the county in the last 10 years, said John Samalot, a Tuckahoe-based business consultant -- so many that some newer owners feel some hostility from better established businesses. Mr. Samalot conducted a study in 2000 for the Westchester Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
 Mr. Samalot pointed to the proliferation of stores like Mr. Urgiles's, side by side with recuerdos, shops that sell knickknacks for baptisms and Sweet 16 celebrations.
 ''The surge in growth proves that wherever there is a Hispanic community, there is Hispanic business,'' he said. ''Now, the concern is that the market could get overcrowded if they create the same kinds of businesses. There's a certain point at which you max out to what you can sell and what they will buy. '' 
 Which is why Mr. Samalot encourages merchants to find their own particular niche. For the last several years, in a course he has taught for aspiring business owners, he has emphasized this approach as key to attracting shoppers from their own home communities as well as customers from the outside. 
 He singles out Alida Yougez, the owner of Union Avenue Liquors in New Rochelle, as an example of how to succeed. Ms. Yougez says her husband bought the store eight years ago, as a sort of surprise gift for her. 
 ''I didn't have a plan for the business and I knew absolutely nothing,'' she said. ''I had never been to a bar. I didn't know a thing about wine. I had no idea how much it would cost to buy stock.''
 The shelves were so empty that she strategically placed plants to cover up the bare spots. But within weeks, she had a solution: She would order hard-to-find tequilas, the kind she knew people drank in her native state of Jalisco, Mexico. 
 ''The only thing I could tell you about rum was the name Bacardi,'' she said, ''but I knew people here wanted what they knew, too.'' 
 Now Ms. Yougez sells 185 kinds of tequila. Though she speaks almost impeccable English and offers plenty of other types of alcohol, she estimates that 90 percent of her customers are Mexicans living in New Rochelle, mostly from the Union Avenue neighborhood.
 Even if the market is limited, it is strong enough for Ms. Yougez to make a comfortable profit, she said. When her regular customers come in, they discuss more than their purchases. They exchange news about their native villages and their children's teachers. Ms. Yougez always dispenses the latest news along with the latest tequila shipment.

HEADLINE: Late Start Doesn't Stop The Dodgers' Rebuilding

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THE Los Angeles Dodgers' new general manager, Ned Colletti, put the team's bizarre off-season into perspective. ''It's never a good sign when you're interviewing managerial candidates and you're running from airport to airport, the music is Christmas carols,'' he said. ''It's the wrong time to be looking for a manager.''
 Colletti was not complaining. He said he loved his new job and would not have it under different circumstances. ''A position like this rarely comes open when it's an easy situation,'' he said. ''I'm tremendously grateful for the opportunity.''
Once a sportswriter who entered baseball via public relations with the Chicago Cubs nearly a quarter of a century ago, Colletti was given the responsibility of cleaning up the Dodgers' mess -- and what a mess it was. 
 The Dodgers captured the National League West in 2004 with a record of 93-69. But they imploded last season, going 71-91, after Paul DePodesta, in his second year as the general manager, made a series of puzzling player moves. Frank McCourt, in his second year as the club owner, made his own bizarre moves, hiring and firing executives, discarding them as if they were broken bats.
 But McCourt's most confusing move came when he fired DePodesta four weeks after the season. Usually, if an owner is going to fire a general manager, he acts immediately after the season. But with McCourt giving no indication of DePodesta's impending dismissal, Manager Jim Tracy quit by mutual agreement with DePodesta even though he had a year left on his contract.
 ''We obviously came to a point where there was a difference of opinion between Paul and I as far as how players are evaluated,'' Tracy said. ''It was basically how you look at and evaluate players, the process in which you go about determining how they fit in. When you get to that point, you're at an impasse.'' 
 Tracy, now the Pittsburgh Pirates' manager, declined to go into details.
 ''Going back into the dugout as a lame-duck manager didn't appeal to me,'' he said. ''I know the market and the expectation level. I didn't think it was a healthy situation to be sitting in the dugout as a lame-duck manager, not for me, not for the ball club.''
 Tracy resigned the day after the season. McCourt did not fire DePodesta for another 26 days. He hired Colletti 18 days after that, Nov. 16, and Colletti hired a manager, Grady Little, on Dec. 6.
 Hiring a manager, though, was not the only thing Colletti had to do. He had to restock the dugout with players he thought could make the team a contender again. In rapid-fire order, in less than three weeks, Colletti signed six free agents: the shortstop and leadoff batter Rafael Furcal, the backup catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., third baseman Bill Mueller, the shortstop-turned-first baseman Nomar Garciaparra, center fielder Kenny Lofton and starter Brett Tomko.
 ''I was used to the pace,'' Colletti said, alluding to his nine years as an assistant to General Manager Brian Sabean in San Francisco. ''I'm used to working fast, thinking things through. Brian and I were together 11 years. It seemed like one long season. We were always retooling and rebuilding and reloading. One of the greatest things we accomplished was playing only 14 games in 9 years where we were out of the race.''
 Speaking the day before he signed Tomko, Colletti said he was not finished with his restocking plan.
 ''I feel if I can add a couple more starters, guys who can throw 180 to 200 innings, it will help preserve the bullpen, which is a strength,'' he said. 
 Tomko, whom he knew from San Francisco, was one of those pitchers. Also on Colletti's list of possible pitchers were Shawn Estes, Jeff Weaver, Jason Johnson and Kevin Millwood, though Scott Boras's asking price for Millwood, $48 million for four years, is far more than the Dodgers want to spend. Including Tomko, they have committed $67.7 million to the six free agents. 
 Although anyone who is an assistant general manager wants to take the next step, Colletti said he was prepared to pass up the Dodgers' opportunity.
 ''People in San Francisco had treated me really well,'' he said. ''I was not looking to move. I was able to ask a lot of questions and get answers I was comfortable with. I would never take a job just for the title. Having the opportunity to win is the most important thing. Having people with integrity is equally important. I was more than satisfied. Everything I was told has come to be.''
 Although it is early, Colletti said he liked what he had seen in a front office that seems to be stabilizing.
 ''I was told that they knew there needed to be some changes on the club and I was free to do what I thought we needed to do; just let them know,'' he said. ''That's exactly what we've done.'' 
 Now he will see how fans in the northern half of the heated West Coast rivalry treat him.
 ''Luckily, I didn't grow up in San Francisco, so I don't have any relatives to disown me,'' he said.

A Little Traveling Music
 Kenny Lofton has not played for the same team for a second year in a row since 2001, Rudy Seanez since 2000 and Chris Hammond since 1996. 
 Lofton, Seanez and Hammond chose the same day last week to extend their streaks. Free agents all, they signed with new teams once again: Lofton with the Dodgers, Seanez with Boston and Hammond with Cincinnati. 
 The Dodgers will be the eighth team for Lofton in six seasons. Seanez pitched for the Red Sox once before. But in seven successive seasons, counting 2006, he will have played for nine teams, three twice each, but none two seasons in a row.
 The Reds will be Hammond's eighth team in 11 seasons. He missed two of those other three seasons with injuries and played in the minors the third.

The Karsay Conundrum
 With all of the inflated contracts being tossed at relief pitchers this off-season, Steve Karsay did not get one of them. But Karsay started it all four years ago when the Yankees signed him to a four-year, $22 million contract, a huge package for a relief pitcher who was not a closer.
 But injury and ineffectiveness made the contract a warning sign for teams seeking relievers. While many clubs have ignored the warning, Karsay has been a victim of his economic success. Cleveland signed him last week to a minor league contract that provides a $600,000 salary if he gets a spot with the Indians. 

A Tribute to Hendricks
 No records exist to prove this statement, but it is likely that Elrod Hendricks caught more 20-game winners than any other catcher. Hendricks caught six Baltimore pitchers who won 20 games a total of 18 times, and he briefly caught Ferguson Jenkins when he and Jenkins were Cubs teammates in 1972. 
 Hendricks was the Orioles' primary catcher in 1971 when Dave McNally, Mike Cuellar, Jim Palmer and Pat Dobson gave the team four 20-game winners, the first time that had happened in the major leagues since 1920.
 Hendricks, a native of the Virgin Islands, was not the best of the 10 players the Yankees and the Orioles swapped at the trading deadline (then June 15) in 1976, but he was one of only two who continued working in baseball. Rick Dempsey, the catcher who went to the Orioles, was the other.
 Unfortunately, Hendricks's 46-year baseball career ended last Wednesday when he had a heart attack and died one day short of his 65th birthday. 
 Hendricks was immensely popular among teammates, coaching colleagues, fans and reporters, including this one. At least once a year, we compared the number of grandchildren we each had. He was ahead by one. His 12 grandchildren, among many others, will miss him.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Bets On Gambling On the Web

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Internet casinos are outlaw operations in the eyes of the federal government, but they look like solid investments to many of Wall Street's largest firms. 
 Blue-chip investment houses like Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity now hold hundreds of millions of dollars in shares of online casinos and betting parlors, which are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange and headquartered in places like Costa Rica or Gibraltar.
The growing participation by American investors underscores a striking gap between the federal law-enforcement position on online gambling and the realities behind what has emerged as a booming business.
 It also highlights the difficulty of policing cross-border activity in the Internet age at the same time that electronic commerce and a global economy are creating fast economic partners across national boundaries. 
 Legal experts are divided over whether American investors and the investment houses that operate mutual funds could themselves be seen as criminally liable for their actions by providing financial backing for offshore casinos. To be sure, it is not uncommon for Americans to invest in overseas companies whose operations may be considered illegal or unacceptable here, from sweatshop manufacturers to European energy producers that do business in Iran. 
 The difference with Internet gambling is that the activity takes place on domestic shores -- with Americans placing bets online using their home computers -- and the Justice Department has stated clearly that the operators are violating American law. 
 Jaclyn Lesch, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said that the agency considered online gambling illegal but declined to ''comment on the liability or hypothetical liability of a company or an individual.''
 But Internet gambling analysts and company executives said that the investments highlight how widely the federal policy is, in essence, being ignored. 
 Millions of Americans use the Internet to play games like poker, blackjack and roulette, or to place wagers on sporting events. Online casinos advertise in magazines and on cable television while filling big billboards in Times Square and other places where crowds congregate. Celebrities like Jesse Ventura, the former governor of Minnesota, hawk their wares. 
 Representative Bob Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, an opponent of gambling, said that the federal government had essentially given up enforcing laws against offshore casinos. He noted, for example, that casino operators now travel freely within the United States, gathering at trade conventions even though, he said, prosecutors would be within their rights to arrest and bring charges against them.
 He said that the involvement of investment firms could be part of a pattern of laws being flouted.
 ''It's very bad, and the Congress ought to investigate it,'' Mr. Goodlatte said, adding that it may turn out that the investment houses are knowingly supporting and promoting illegal enterprises.
 For their part, the investment houses have taken the position that they indeed know there are legal risks involved in investing in offshore casinos, but that the risks are outweighed by the benefits of owning shares in growing, highly profitable businesses. Those shares can give a lift to mutual funds and other types of investments sold by the investment houses, meaning bigger returns for clients. 
 ''Our analysis shows the gain from these stocks outweighs the very small risk'' of owning them, said a spokesman for one major investment house. The spokesman would not agree to be identified by name or to have his firm identified, citing regulatory policy that could restrict the company's ability to buy and sell individual securities if he commented upon them.
 The ownership rolls of offshore casinos read like a Who's Who of America's top investment firms. For example, public filings show that tens of millions of shares of SportingBet, a company listed on the London Stock Exchange that allows people to place bets on sporting events, are owned by Fidelity, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs. 
 Fidelity Management holds shares worth about $363 million, or 14.1 percent of the outstanding shares. Those shares are largely held in mutual funds. Merrill Lynch Asset Management has $164 million in holdings, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has $137 million.
 Similarly, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Securities hold big positions in BetOnSports, another publicly traded firm in London that facilitates sports betting, according to public filings. Morgan Stanley has one of the biggest stakes -- worth around $25.6 million -- but the company said that the position is held on behalf of one large investor, whose identity it withheld. 
 It is hard to discern how many of the shares are owned by mutual funds available to American investors. Many of the funds, including some that exclude American investors, are operated out of London. 
 For instance, Goldman Sachs's International Growth Opportunities Fund, which is open to American investors, owns around 175,000 shares of SportingBet, worth around $960,000, according to a recent public filing by the company. 
 Goldman Sachs also wrote in a report on Nov. 30 that over the next three months it ''expects to receive or intends to seek compensation'' for investment banking services provided to SportingBet and PartyGaming, two companies that operate gambling sites.
 Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Fidelity all declined to comment.
 George Hudson, a spokesman for SportingBet, said that there had been growing interest from the investment houses, and not just their European arms.
 ''It's not just London, it's New York,'' Mr. Hudson said, noting that the interest represents a change from two years ago when ''the big banks wouldn't touch the industry with a barge pole.''
 According to Mr. Hudson and several other industry executives and analysts, a watershed event took place on June 30 when PartyGaming began trading on the London Stock Exchange. It was not the first Internet casino to go public in Britain, but it drew a great deal of attention because of the popularity of the company's sites. The ensuing demand for its shares put it among the exchange's top 100 companies in its market capitalization, currently around $9.6 billion.
 At the time, I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif., who has written extensively on gambling law, was flown to London to advise a number of large investment houses -- both American and European -- on the risks involved in owning shares. Mr. Rose declined to specify the companies for which he consulted, but said that he had told them there was at least some risk of owning shares in the casinos.
 Today, Mr. Rose said he believed there was only a 10 percent chance that the federal government would take action against the investment houses under the Wire Act, which covers online gambling, or federal statutes that permit the government to charge the partners of illegal operations with aiding and abetting their activities. But he said that if prosecutors did so, they could make a decent case. 
 The companies are shareowners ''in an illegal enterprise,'' Mr. Rose said. ''Therefore they are liable.'' Potential penalties could range from small fines to prison terms.
 But Lawrence G. Walters, a Florida lawyer who specializes in investment law and who has consulted for some prospective American investors, said that the government would have difficulty finding a theory of liability given that the investors do not control the offshore casinos or direct their activities. They are ''passive investors,'' Mr. Walters said.
 ''Nobody takes them seriously when they say this is a serious crime,'' he said of the government and anti-gambling laws. ''But there is stuff still on the books, and somebody could go down heavily if government decides to turn its attention to them.''
 The bottom line, according to casino industry executives and some financial analysts, is that the opportunity for profit may be too good for the investment houses to pass up. Over all, Internet gambling is projected to reach almost $12 billion in business this year, up from $8.3 billion in 2004, according to Sebastian Sinclair, a gambling industry analyst with Christiansen Capital Advisors. 
 Individual companies are enjoying strong growth and big profit margins. Morgan Stanley on Dec. 1 published an analysis of SportingBet that noted that the company had acquired 700,000 new customers in a recent quarter, almost equal to the number of people it signed up all of last year. The Morgan Stanley report said that the company was taking in $530,000 a day just from its poker business.
 ''There is no other leisure business in the world with the same potential for growth and shareholder returns as online gaming,'' said David Carruthers, the chief executive of BetOnSports, noting that the major casinos each project 20 percent annual sales growth. ''We're in our embryonic stages.''
 Mr. Carruthers said that the investments from American financial institutions have provided the stability and legitimacy needed to helped the casinos grow. ''It says we're running a business legitimately and responsibly,'' he said, ''and we're seen as a worldwide leisure product -- similar to KFC, Ford, Coca-Cola, I.B.M. or any other global brand.''

HEADLINE: Why Investors Don't Live by Currency Bets Alone

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
HEADING into 2005, conventional wisdom said that Americans should invest aggressively overseas because the dollar was expected to weaken further against foreign currencies.
 That seemed straightforward enough. When the dollar loses value, it's a boon to American investors abroad because each share of foreign stock they hold becomes worth that many more dollars, even if it doesn't appreciate in its local currency.
As it has turned out, of course, the dollar hasn't weakened; it has appreciated. In fact, it has risen about 13 percent against the euro and the Japanese yen, reducing the gains of American investors overseas. Even when facing this headwind, however, Americans owning foreign stocks have done just fine in 2005, demonstrating the folly of making investment decisions based solely on currency bets. 
 Indeed, some foreign equities, particularly those in the emerging markets, have gone on a tear. The average Latin American stock fund, for example, has soared around 58 percent. The average Japanese stock fund has rallied by nearly 37 percent. 
 ''If you told me going into the year that the dollar was going to appreciate so significantly, I'd never have thought that these types of gains would have been possible,'' said Ernest M. Ankrim, chief investment strategist at the Russell Investment Group in Tacoma, Wash.
 Now, as 2006 approaches, currency analysts again predict dollar weakness. A recent survey by Merrill Lynch found that money managers think the dollar will depreciate the most among major currencies next year. 
 But the reason for Americans to continue investing abroad -- after shoveling an estimated $149 billion into overseas equity funds this year -- isn't that the dollar is expected to weaken. Instead, investors should focus on why the dollar could fall in 2006.
 Consider that overseas economies, with the exception of Western Europe's, are expected to grow much faster than that of the United States. That worries the dollar bears. Morgan Stanley forecasts that the gross domestic product of the United States will expand by 3.8 percent in 2006. By contrast, economies in Latin America are expected to grow by 4.1 percent, and the emerging economies of Central and Eastern Europe by 5.3 percent. And Asia, excluding Japan, could soar 6.2 percent. 
 What's more, currency experts think that the focus of the market will shift from the surprising strength of the domestic economy to simmering concerns here at home. Merrill Lynch calculated what it called a global misery index -- a gauge that factored in, among other things, a nation's inflation and unemployment rates, economic growth, budget balance and current account balance. Based on recent data, it showed that the United States' misery index was worse than those of all other Group of 7 industrialized nations. 
 That, of course, is a knock on the dollar, but there are plenty of others. 
 Consider that this year, the dollar benefited from the Homeland Investment Act, which gave corporations a one-time tax break in 2005 for returning to the United States profits generated from overseas operations. 
 David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J., estimates that $300 billion to $500 billion in foreign profits have been repatriated this year. Of that, $100 billion to $150 billion may have been converted from euros to dollars, bolstering the dollar, he said. ''Whether that's half the reason for the strengthening of the dollar or a third, I don't know,'' Mr. Kotok said. ''But I do know that it's a one-time event,'' as this tax break will go away in 2006.
 Another big reason that the dollar appreciated last year was that the Federal Reserve methodically lifted short-term interest rates throughout the year. The so-called federal funds rate, which banks charge one another on overnight loans, is now at 4.25 percent, up from 2.25 percent at the end of 2004. The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, kept its rates steady all year, while the European Central Bank lifted them once, on Dec. 1, for its first increase in five years. 
 As a result, said Robert C. Doll, president and chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, ''the U.S. became a more attractive place to park capital.''
 Yet this catalyst for dollar strength is expected to weaken in the first half of 2006, says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. 
 The Fed is likely to stop raising rates sometime after the end of January -- when Ben S. Bernanke is expected to succeed Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman -- and the gap between in global rates should start to close, giving investors less reason to buy dollars.
 But investors banking on a weak dollar should keep things in perspective.
 For starters, William P. King, chief investment officer for currencies at Putnam Investments in Boston, notes that, in historical terms, ''dollar strength persists for a period of time after a tightening cycle is over.'' 
 What's more, neither the European Central Bank nor the Bank of Japan is likely to raise rates sharply in the near term. Japan is still climbing out of a deflationary funk. As for Europe, real economic growth in the region is expected to come in below 2 percent for 2006, and any aggressive moves by its central bank could stall an already sluggish economy. 
 This is why even the bears expect the dollar to remain relatively strong throughout the first half of next year. ''Though we are bearish on the dollar, we don't see a catalyst for the euro or yen to rally until late in 2006,'' said Alec B. Young, equity market strategist at Standard & Poor's. 
 And keep in the mind that the dollar could again surprise investors. Jeffrey D. Young, head of currency research at Citigroup, says that one of the biggest risks to his bearish view of the dollar is that an end to Fed tightening could lead to a shift back into United States equities by global investors. That, in turn, could prop up the dollar.
 FOR all of these reasons, Mr. Kotok said he thought that investors would be wise to focus less on the dollar and more on growth in making their decisions on global asset allocation. Currently, he recommends a significant allocation to foreign stocks because of the higher economic and profit growth rates he expects abroad -- again, with the exception of Western Europe.
 He is recommending that half of investors' equity portfolios go to foreign holdings. Last year at this time, he was recommending a 35 percent to 40 percent weighting overseas.
 ''Stick with growth rates and fundamentals,'' Mr. Kotok said. And if it turns out that the tailwind of dollar weakness ends up propelling American investors to even greater gains, all the better.

HEADLINE: FROTHY

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN has earned a reputation in his 18 years as Federal Reserve chairman as a master of the 50-word sentence whose meaning is nearly impossible to untangle. Once in a while, though, he turns a phrase that seems to capture the country's economic anxieties. 
 In response to a question after a speech in May, Mr. Greenspan said that ''at a minimum, there's a little froth'' in the housing market. He was not the first person to use the word, but after it passed his lips, it quickly became part of the national conversation.
 Part of its allure is simple: it's a fun word to say, one that conjures the image of a baby's bath or a hot cappuccino. But ''froth'' -- like ''frothy,'' which has become more common since May -- has the added virtue of describing the nation's real estate obsession in a more nuanced way than ''bubble'' does.
 Froth, the dictionaries say, refers to a bunch of bubbles rather than a single big one. In May, Mr. Greenspan emphasized that there was no nationwide housing bubble, a position shared by most economists. If you have owned a home in Indiana or upstate New York over the last two decades and watched its value rise little faster than inflation, you understand this notion better than many big-city residents do.
 But the rapid increases in house values in much of the rest of the country cannot continue long, Mr. Greenspan added. ''It's hard not to see that there are a lot of local bubbles,'' he said.
 When prices continued rising in the weeks that followed, Mr. Greenspan looked as if he could be repeating his flirtation with bubble-ology almost a decade ago. In 1996, he asked whether ''irrational exuberance'' had consumed stock-market investors, and equity prices around the world briefly tumbled before resuming their ascent.
 Mr. Greenspan then backed off, saying that bubbles usually could not be detected until after they popped. 
 This year, however, he continued his gentle warnings, and the housing market had already begun cooling by the start of summer. Houses now take longer to sell on average, and prices have stopped rising in some areas.
 What happens from here is not clear, but soon it will not be Mr. Greenspan's problem. He will retire Jan. 31, to be replaced by Ben S. Bernanke, a White House adviser and former Princeton economist who can become the nation's new economic phrasemaker. DAVID LEONHARDT

HEADLINE: Digital Altruism and New York Goes Country

 BODY:

BEST REASON JENNIFER LOPEZ GOT RADIO PLAY -- First Sony BMG (J. Lo's label), then Warner Music Group paid multimillion-dollar settlements after investigations by the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, found significant use of payola. Who needs request lines? JON PARELES

BEST PAINLESS ALTRUISM -- The summer Live 8 concerts, held on the eve of the G-8 economic summit to urge more aid for Africa, asked for no money, no volunteering, no commitment: just a name on an online petition or a cellphone text message. 
Those without technology weren't to change the world. PARELES

BEST SELF-INFLICTED WOUND -- Sony BMG music put software on discs to prevent customers from copying them, but it also made computers vulnerable to viruses. Sony briefly offered a fix that made things worse, then ended up recalling more than four million CD's. Fans got one more incentive to download music free instead of buying it. PARELES

BEST SNUB -- For months, fans and critics across the country have been celebrating the music and musicians of New Orleans. Yet rappers were usually left out of these tributes, even though hip-hop is by far the city's best-selling musical export. Maybe next year, hip-hop can be written back into the city's musical history: not just current stars like Juvenile, Mannie Fresh and Lil Wayne, but also pioneers like DJ Jubilee, DJ Jimi, Master P and UNLV. KELEFA SANNEH

BEST SOUTHERN DISCOMFORT -- The Country Music Awards left Nashville for New York City, holding events everywhere from Joe's Pub to Carnegie Hall. The city, which doesn't even have a country radio station, shrugged. PARELES

BEST EXAMPLE OF MISSING THE BOAT -- By now, everyone knows about the huge and growing popularity of reggaeton, the Latino genre descended from hip-hop and dancehall reggae. So why have the Latin Grammy awards been so slow to embrace the genre? At this year's ceremony, Daddy Yankee's smash album ''Barrio Fino'' (VI/Universal) was crowned best urban music album, bringing reggaeton's all-time Latin Grammy Awards total to one. SANNEH

BEST ATTEMPT TO BUILD A WALL IN THE OCEAN -- The Supreme Court ruled that the file-sharing company Grokster was liable for copyright infringement, giving copyright holders a new way to intimidate software developers. Actual file-sharing, particularly via the decentralized Bittorrent, dropped by approximately zero. PARELES

BEST NEW FRONTIER OF JAZZ SCHOLARSHIP -- At the largest-ever auction of jazz memorabilia in New York in February, an anonymous bidder paid $60,000 for some of Thelonious Monk's high-school notebooks, including essays on ''A Tale of Two Cities'' and the excellence of ''Boys' Life'' magazine. The essays are O.K., and the handwriting almost as sprawling, ornate and self-possessed as John Hancock's. BEN RATLIFF

BEST PYRRHIC VICTORY: Michael Jackson was acquitted on child molestation charges. His career was not immediately rehabilitated. PARELES

BEST POP-PUNK ALLIANCE -- Wait a second, the clean-cut young actress Hilary Duff is dating one of the guys from the mall-punk band Good Charlotte? And she has recorded three songs written by him and his partners for ''Most Wanted'' (Hollywood), her greatest-hits album? And they're tidy, spiky little new-wave songs? And they're really good?

HEADLINE: A Vision of a Mobile Society Rolls Off the Assembly Line

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
LET'S be optimistic. Some spectacular buildings were completed this year -- and what matters more to an architecture lover? 
 The London-based architect Zaha Hadid, a precocious talent who is only now winning the kinds of mainstream commissions she richly deserves, wrapped up two stunning buildings, both potent examples of how Modernism is being reimagined for the 21st century. And Rem Koolhaas's 1,300-seat concert hall in Porto, Portugal, should finally establish him as one of the world's great designers as well as the profession's mightiest thinker.
Ms. Hadid's boomerang-shaped BMW plant in Leipzig, Germany, with its sensual curves and purring assembly lines, did for the computerized auto plant what Giacomo Matte-Trucco's Lingotto Factory in Turin, Italy, did for the old labor-based model in the 1920's: project a powerful vision of a mobile society. At the same time, she has rejected the regimented order that gave the machine age a dehumanizing quality. 
 Ms. Hadid's science center in Wolfsburg, Germany, also comes to terms with Modernism's authoritarian strain. Built in the shadow of a Nazi-era auto plant, its dynamic concrete form, evoking the prow of a ship sailing through space, sits on gigantic inhabitable cones that allow the surrounding street life to flow directly underneath. It celebrates her knack for fluid, seamless spaces that blur the boundary between interior and public realms.
 But for me the biggest sensation was Mr. Koolhaas's concert hall, Casa da Musica, packed with urban energy as if in response to Porto's sleepy atmosphere. The building's chiseled concrete form, resting on a carpet of polished stone, suggests a bomb about to explode. 
 None of these buildings are in major global cities. All three are designed by ''star architects,'' a term that elicits eye-rolling or outright contempt in some circles today, as if popular success is indistinguishable from selling out. Flush with new projects, a widely respected architect told me recently that he felt nostalgic for the days when there was little work for anyone, as if unemployment were better for the creative soul.
 It may be true that talents like Ms. Hadid and Mr. Koolhaas have sucked some of the oxygen from members of a younger generation struggling to find their footing in a celebrity-driven profession. The jury is still out on that one. But either way, these buildings prove that architecture is in the midst of a renaissance. Whatever one imagines about the egos of their architects, these projects exude a social dynamism and freedom -- a thriving democratic ideal. 
 What's more, such buildings force us to re-examine corners of Modernist history that once seemed relegated to the scrapheap. Their architects are clearly influenced by talents as far ranging as Kevin Roche, Hans Scharoun and Oswald Mathias Ungers, whose tough, sometimes brutal forms were once excluded from the Modernist canon.
 The problem is how few people seem capable of such a generous view of history. Recent landmark preservation battles in New York suggest that the civic powers-that-be insist on defending a narrow view of the past and of Modernism in particular. That became apparent during the crusade to preserve Edward Durell Stone's so-called lollipop building at 2 Columbus Circle, a landmark of late Modernism, when the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission refused to schedule a public hearing to consider its designation. As a result, the facade is being utterly revamped. 
 This was an atrocious betrayal of the public trust. A similar debate is unfolding in Berlin, where the German government plans to demolish the 1970's Palast der Republik. The former home of the East German Parliament, it played host to cultural events and festivals as well as political conferences during the Communist years. 
 Both 2 Columbus Circle and the Berlin building represent important moments in their cities collective memories. The pressure to remake or raze them is arguably a form of censorship, a drive to cleanse history of anything but a strictly prescribed view of the past.
 The most heartbreaking example of this attitude can be found in New Orleans, which had essentially been reduced to a theme park long before Hurricane Katrina hit in August. A conventional formula of convention center, casinos and themed historic neighborhoods was embraced to attract tourist dollars. That transformation, which went hand in hand with the neglect of the local infrastructure, was as responsible for suppressing the city's textured character as the ensuing storm and breached levees were. Now those same profit-minded forces, with their insistence on a touristy image of New Orleans, are circling the city again. They may well succeed in draining the city of what little life it has left.
 We should be clearer about who the enemy is. Narrow visions, not big egos, are the problem.

HEADLINE: Swagger-Free, but Still Kicking and So Very French

BYLINE: By RICHARD SIKLOS

 BODY:
AS Jean-Bernard Levy tells it, the lure of being the chief executive of Vivendi Universal is quite simply the opportunity to revive a French industrial legend with a history going back some 150 years. But reminders of the latter-day Vivendi saga -- more sorry than storied -- have a way of popping up every now and then. 
 This month, for instance, at the Paris premiere of ''King Kong,'' the Universal Studios picture, Mr. Levy said he was struck by a scene in which Kong slides across a frozen pond in Central Park. ''It reminded me of past Vivendi C.E.O.'s,'' Mr. Levy said. He named no names, but didn't really need to: the image clearly evoked memories of a magazine spread about Jean-Marie Messier that included a photograph of him skating in the park.
Vivendi, of course, nearly took a Kong-sized sidewalk splat on Mr. Messier's deal-crazed watch. He was fired in the summer of 2002, and both he and the company were later fined by French market regulators for publishing misleading statements about the company's finances. 
 But a recent breakfast with Mr. Levy in New York served as a reminder that Vivendi is alive and kicking as a media conglomerate, even if it no longer has Mr. Messier's swagger -- let alone the Park Avenue floor-through apartment and company Airbus for the C.E.O.'s use -- and has a fairly low corporate presence in the United States. 
 Many Americans know Vivendi primarily for its ownership of Universal Music Group, the world's top music company by market share, and for its 20 percent interest in NBC Universal, the film and television arm of General Electric. According to Merrill Lynch, the music business will account for roughly one-quarter of the 19.1 billion euros ($22.8 billion) in revenue that Vivendi Universal is expected to generate in 2005, though the largest share, about 45 percent, comes from Vivendi's majority interest in SFR, France's second-largest mobile telephone operator. The rest of the revenue is divided among the Canal Plus pay-television business in France, Vivendi Universal Games and a Moroccan telephone business. 
 In demeanor, Mr. Levy, who became C.E.O. last April, fits the mold of some other 21st-century post-mogul media bosses, exemplified by the likes of Sir Howard Stringer at Sony and Robert A. Iger at Disney: pragmatic, genial and whip smart, but reluctant to offer a grand vision of how the digital world they yearn to dominate is about to unfold. 
 Still, Mr. Levy said, ''I have no poster of anybody in my room.'' 
 Before joining Vivendi in 2002 as its chief operating officer, Mr. Levy was as an investment banker -- as Mr. Messier was. Before that, he worked in the French government and the communications industry. Jean-Rene Fortou, who as the interim C.E.O. was given the task of cleaning up the Messier mess, handpicked Mr. Levy as his successor. 
 A trim, bespectacled man whose gray hair gives him gravitas beyond his 50 years, Mr. Levy says his game plan is to generate and acquire content that Vivendi can sell to broadband consumers, whether they are music fans, game players or subscribers to his mobile networks in Europe. '' 'Vision' is a word,'' he said. ''The key is: Where is the growth?''
 If there is a surprising element to Mr. Levy's corporate message, it is that Vivendi is now in shape to make a go of it in an uneasy media world, using the cards it has kept. Despite the company's heavy exposure to two wildly changing businesses -- telecommunications and music -- and a huge passive and illiquid asset in its NBC Universal stake, Mr. Levy believes that he has a winner on his hands. ''If I had 35 billion euros I would probably not acquire the businesses I run,'' he said between bites of white toast and sips of tea. ''But considering where we came from, we're, I think, streamlined and focused and exactly where we want to be.''
 Mr. Levy's recent moves have included a deal announced on Dec. 16 to combine its CanalSat pay-television business with a rival, TPS, essentially consolidating the industry in France and paving the way for two rivals to share in the spoils of a single service controlled by Mr. Levy's company. The last year has included other important corporate milestones: the games business climbed into the black, and a troubled land-line telephone unit was successfully combined with a French competitor. 
 The company also resolved the last vestiges of the Messier hangover by settling longstanding legal disputes with Barry Diller and his IAC/InterActiveCorp stemming from the creation of NBC Universal in 2004.
 Vivendi Universal, meanwhile, has recently posted fairly strong operating results. Revenue rose 8 percent in the first nine months of the year, to 14 billion euros ($16.7 billion), and earnings from operations were up 24 percent, to 3 billion euros ($3.6 billion). Because of its heavy telecom component, Vivendi pays a higher dividend than most media companies. 
 All of this apparent progress has not moved Vivendi's stock much in the last year -- a fate shared by many big media stocks in the United States. But if one took the charitable view of tracking the stock's rebound from its post-bubble, post-Messier nadir of $9.50 a share in August 2002, it has come back mightily. 
 At its current price of $31.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, it has more than tripled since its darkest days, and the company is now worth about $33.5 billion. The stocks of American media heavyweights like Time Warner, Disney and the News Corporation charted gains of roughly 40 to 60 percent during the same period. 
 To advance further -- the stock nudged $80 five years ago -- Mr. Levy will undoubtedly have to persuade the market that Vivendi is not only committed to the businesses it is in, but that it knows what it's doing. 
 ''I think they're completely serious about it,'' said Doug Morris, the Universal Music Group chairman who has been through several regimes since Edgar Bronfman Jr. put him in charge of the company when it was owned by Seagram. ''People expected our company to be sold a half a dozen times. They told me several years ago that was not their intention, and it's worked out.''
 There are now even glimpses of the kinds of synergy -- gasp! -- that Mr. Messier once promoted. A Vivendi video game based on 50 Cent, Universal's popular rapper, was a big seller, and the music company is working with SFR, the cellphone business, on ventures for selling music on the fly. 
 Mr. Levy said he is ''fully committed'' to the music business. ''It's a central asset within Vivendi because it is global and it's leading,'' he said. ''We need to have more content distributed globally that can be leveraged over all kinds of platforms, because you don't know what the winning platform will be.'' That last bit sounds much like the mantra of Bob Wright, the longtime chairman of NBC Universal, and maybe not by coincidence: Mr. Levy and Mr. Fortou are on the NBC Universal board and have a big stake in its fortunes over the next four years. 
 VIVENDI gained no veto powers with its 20 percent economic interest in NBC Universal -- a holding currently valued at $8.6 billion. But it does have the right every year, beginning in January 2007, to sell the stake back to G.E. or to take its share public. Similarly, G.E. has a call on the Vivendi Universal interest in 2010. By design, this does not appear to be a partnership meant to last. 
 Even without its stake in the United States entertainment giant, Mr. Levy presides over a set of assets uniquely positioned to tackle the decade-old and increasingly relevant question of whether owning telephone and media companies underthe same corporate roof make sense. One thing that has no appeal to Mr. Levy is the kind of corporate carve-ups that are in the works for companies like Viacom and Liberty Media. ''I am not benchmarking against anybody else, because all the media companies are different,'' he said. 
 Of course, instead of media companies, he might just as easily have been speaking about the recent line of Vivendi Universal C.E.O.'s.

HEADLINE: Whose Economy Is It, Anyway?

 BODY:
As polls registered public discontent with the economy earlier this month, back-to-back government reports showed strong economic growth and respectable job creation. To explain the discrepancy, Allan Hubbard, one of President Bush's top economic advisers, said that hurricanes and high gas prices had temporarily darkened Americans' collective mood, but that the president was pleased with the economy. ''He's more concerned with results than he is about polls,'' Mr. Hubbard said. 
 No wonder the president seems out of touch. Headline statistics -- the ''results'' Mr. Hubbard referred to -- can mask as much as they reveal.
Take, for instance, the solid 4.1 percent economic expansion in this year's third quarter and the 215,000 jobs created last month. In the past four years, similar jolts of positive data have never lasted long enough to result in consistently strong hiring and rising wages. There is little reason to believe things will be different this time. Already, analysts are slashing their fourth-quarter growth estimates to reflect the drag of America's huge trade deficit. 
 Administration officials also love to cite the economy's low unemployment rate, recently 5 percent. But more than one million people have left the work force since 2001 and are not counted as unemployed, although a big reason for leaving is a lack of good jobs. Add to that the 4.2 million part-timers who want full-time jobs, and employment is weaker than the administration would have you believe. 
 The administration also wants you to think that wages are on an upswing. But during the current recovery, wages have lagged inflation by 0.3 percent for 80 percent of the work force, generally defined as nonmanagers. To add insult to injury, the decline has occurred even as Americans have set records for productivity. That means Americans are working harder, but taking home less. 
 And yet, Treasury Secretary John Snow recently lauded the wage picture in a message of ''good cheer in this holiday season.'' He noted that wages were up 1.1 percent from the previous business cycle peak in 2001. At the same point in the cycle of the 1990's, he noted, wages were down 2.1 percent. 
 That's all true -- as far as it goes. But by choosing to measure from the peak of the last cycle, Mr. Snow takes credit for the tail end of a wage boom that developed circa 1995. And he fails to mention that at this point in the 1990's, falling wages were about to turn up sharply. 
 No one believes that is about to happen now. Corporate profits have been phenomenal during the recovery, but are mostly being used to enrich shareholders, not to create jobs and pay higher wages -- or to lay the foundation for robust employment by investing in plants and equipment. 
 Mr. Hubbard, the president's adviser, is partly right when he says that people are gloomy about high gas prices. But more to the point, would they be so gloomy if they were making some real money?

HEADLINE: Three Tyrants, One Test

BYLINE: By Thomas Carothers. 
Thomas Carothers, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is the author, most recently, of ''Promoting the Rule of Law Abroad: The Search for Knowledge.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S ''freedom agenda'' rests on the idea that promoting democracy abroad is crucial to fighting terrorism. In his view, if democracy can spread to stagnant authoritarian states in the Middle East and elsewhere, it will undercut the roots of Islamic jihadism and other forms of violent political radicalism.
 This is a bold proposition, as appealing as it is unproved. American presidents of the last several decades embraced democracy promotion in principle but usually deferred it in practice when it came to friendly tyrants who supplied America with oil, sites for military bases and other economic and security benefits. President Bush's agenda implies a fundamental change in that pattern. Such relationships will have to change, not for the sake of mushy ideals, but in pursuit of a deeper, post-Sept. 11 security interest. 
So, is the Bush administration serious about this? A convergence in recent months of political events in three countries -- Azerbaijan, Egypt and Kazakhstan -- has presented the administration with a crucial triple test. The presidents of these nations are strong-armed autocrats adept at locking in American support by providing tangible goodies. Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan provide oil and natural gas, while Hosni Mubarak of Egypt offers help with the Palestinians and security cooperation in the Middle East.
 All three men stifle opposition at home, often waving the red (or green) flag of a domestic Islamist threat. All apparently intend to be presidents for life. In short, they are following the precise path of high-level political stagnation that President Bush has warned of. And this sort of stagnation is especially troublesome in countries where the stymied opposition forces accurately see the United States as the regime's best friend.
 All three of these leaders faced national elections this fall. Commendably, the Bush administration put all three governments on notice that it wanted them to ensure free and fair elections. In the case of Egypt, for example, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice set out a clear list of expectations on fair procedures and conditions when she visited Cairo in June.
 Yet all three leaders reacted to American pressure by behaving according to the familiar friendly-tyrant script. They made some minor improvements in the lead-up to the elections, correcting various procedural bottlenecks, allowing greater freedom for political debate and gravely declaring an unshakeable commitment to democratic elections. 
 In the crucial later stages of the campaign and during the voting, however, they lowered the boom. Their security forces harassed, intimidated and arrested scores of opposition advocates, stuffed ballot boxes and tampered with vote counts. In all three countries, credible neutral monitors highlighted many serious abuses and concluded that none of the elections were free and fair.
 What has been the Bush administration's reaction? So far it, too, has followed the familiar script, accenting the underwhelming positives and playing down the overwhelming negatives. As Egyptian security forces brutalized peaceful opposition groups during the final two rounds of the parliamentary elections, a State Department spokesman blandly stated that ''we have not received at this point any indication that the Egyptian government isn't interested in having peaceful, free and fair elections.'' 
 After the Kazakh government fell back on the same heavy-handed repressive techniques that it has used to undermine every election since the early 1990's, the State Department, with breathtaking understatement, grudgingly acknowledged that ''the system is not yet flawless.'' 
 The big question now is this: Will these leaders pay any real price in their relationships with the Bush administration for having defied it on democracy? The administration has a rich selection of tools for expressing serious displeasure: delaying new trade agreements or interrupting existing ones, refusing White House visits and other diplomatic rewards, reducing economic aid, modifying military cooperation and, perhaps of greatest potential weight, issuing frank, critical words from the presidential bully pulpit.
 The administration has not yet made clear which way it will go, but as each day passes the sense of business as usual solidifies. Iraq may be the most visible battleground of the President Bush's pro-democracy ambitions. But it is an exceptional case. The many autocratic allies used to getting free passes on democracy are the real proving ground for a policy that must show consistency, seriousness and results. 
 The administration's next steps on Azerbaijan, Egypt and Kazakhstan will do much to determine whether the ''freedom agenda'' will achieve genuine credibility in the face of widespread skepticism or simply be jettisoned at the first hard turn in the road.

MARKET DEVOTEES LOOK EAST-- Today is the day after Christmas; markets, businesses and government offices are all closed, and economy-watchers have nowhere to turn -- except east to Japan. Tokyo will oblige them by releasing the latest statistics on Japanese store sales, consumer prices, the jobless rate and auto production today and construction orders, housing starts, retail sales and industrial production tomorrow. The avalanche of numbers matters: the world's No. 2 economy is apparently emerging from years of stagnation and deflation and is set to become an engine of world growth once again. 


BRAGGING RIGHTS? -- As the economic picture in the United States continues to brighten, the Bush administration is trumpeting the gains as evidence of the soundness of its economic policies. The latest news has mostly been good: 215,000 jobs created in November, third-quarter growth the highest since early 2004 and, late last week, reports of continuing low inflation, increased consumer buying power and an unexpectedly sharp drop in unemployment claims. But can the run continue? If the figures being released on Wednesday on stores sales and consumer confidence and on Thursday on jobless claims are good, expect more boasting from the White House. If there are any unpleasant surprises, expect the Democrats to weigh in.

SO WHICH IS IT? -- Harry S. Truman once said he wished he could find a one-armed economist, because the ones he knew were forever saying, ''On the one hand, this; on the other hand, that.'' On the one hand, housing starts increased more than expected in November, and permits for future construction also rose, indicating continued robustness in the market. On the other hand, sales of new homes fell and the number of houses on the market grew in the same month, even as more builders were offering incentives to buyers, suggesting an incipient real estate slowdown. The latest fuel for the debate comes Thursday, with the release of existing-home sales numbers.

SHOWING MUSCLE -- HealthSouth, the embattled health care giant based in Birmingham, Ala., will hold its first shareholder meeting since 2002. Richard M. Scrushy, the former chairman and chief executive who was fired in 2003 after the revelation of a $2.7 billion accounting fraud, has sued the company for $70 million for breach of contract. According to a report in The Birmingham News, Mr. Scrushy may vote against current members of HealthSouth's board and may try to get his own candidates elected in the future.

ALSO THIS WEEK -- Nielsen Media Research says it will start to measure the viewing of digital video recorders. The mediator in contract talks between the United Parcel Service and its 2,700 pilots promises to discuss ''the next steps'' with them as their dispute over wages and retirement benefits threatens to turn into a strike.

As Split of Viacom Nears Completion, Investors Ponder Its Founder's Next Move
On Jan. 3, Sumner M. Redstone will get his wish when Viacom, the sprawling media company he built, is split into two separate entities. Now investors are asking whether the split is a prelude to a buying spree -- that is, does Mr. Redstone plan to build up two new companies? A bigger question is whether Mr. Redstone will decide to sell off assets if the split fails to bolster the share price of either company. [Page C1.]

New Technology May Outrace DVD Formats
The war for control of the next-generation DVD is approaching a critical juncture, but there are growing signs that the battle for supremacy in this multibillion-dollar market may yield a hollow victory. As electronics makers, technology companies and Hollywood studios haggle over the fine points of their formats, consumers are quickly finding alternatives to buying and renting packaged DVD's, high-definition or otherwise. [C1.]

Internet Sites Tie Web Searches to Charity
Like many other Web sites, the online newcomers Blingo and GoodSearch license search technology from Google and Yahoo and earn a commission from search companies for any ads visitors click on when they are on Blingo.com or GoodSearch.com. Unlike other sites, both Blingo and GoodSearch give away portions of their revenue -- as prizes or as donations to the users' favorite charities. ''The beauty of this is obvious,'' said Ken Ramberg, above, chief executive of GoodSearch. ''This money is being raised by people who are doing something they do every day: search the Internet.'' Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C4.]

High-Technology Industry Blossoms in Israel
Israel's high-tech sector is having its best year since the dot-com implosion in 2000. From large manufacturers like Intel to start-ups financed by venture capital firms, the industry appears to have largely recovered. Israel now has more than 70 companies listed on the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, more than any other country outside of the United States. With high technology playing a significant role, Israel's economy is expected to grow about 5 percent this year, after growing around 4 percent last year. [C3.]

Activist Group Protests Tribune Newspaper Cuts
Cuts by the Tribune Company, the Chicago-based owner of several of the country's major daily newspapers, have caught the attention of MoveOn Media Action, an offshoot of MoveOn.org, a liberal activist group. Its campaign has included public demonstrations as well as petition drives in Tribune cities to gather signatures protesting the job cuts. [C5.]

Plan For Chinese River Raises Hard Questions
The struggle over law touches every part of China. Now with a proposal for a series of dams that will produce more electricity than even the mighty Three Gorges Dam but would also threaten a region considered an ecological treasure, the Chinese government is faced with a dilemma of whether it will abide by its own laws. A1

Sudanese Refugees in Cairo 

About 3,000 Sudanese men, women and children have been squatting in a central square in Cairo, Egypt for the last three months, requesting the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees declare them refugees and relocate them to a better place to live. These people see themselves as refugees, fleeing a country that offered little hope for a better life, and yet the law does not consider them refugees. A3

Selling U.S. Policy to the World
This past week, at a senior staff meeting, Karen P. Hughes, the under secretary of state for public diplomacy, outlined the limits of her team's success in promoting Iraq's elections to the world's news media. Ms. Hughes said her job, which is to improve the image of the United States and expand support for its policies abroad, is an uphill battle. A6

Libyan Court Orders Retrial
The Libyan Supreme Court overturned the convictions of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor who had been sentenced to death on charges of infecting hundreds of Libyan children with H.I.V. The politically charged case was sent back to a lower court for a retrial. The action raised hopes that the medical workers might eventually be freed. A6

Pope's Christmas Speech
In his first Christmas address, Pope Benedict XVI prayed for peace in poorer, war-torn parts of the world as he warned the more comfortable that they ''risk becoming victims of their own intellectual and technical achievements.'' His message was received warmly and cheers seemed most enthusiastic when he continued a tradition started by his predecessor, John Paul II, sending Christmas greetings in 32 languages. A8

Oppostition Split in Zimbabwe
Leaders of Zimbabwe's sole democratic opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, decided to expel their president, Morgan Tsvangirai, over the weekend, deepening an internal split that has brought the party to the brink of insignificance. It seemed unclear whether the expulsion would stick. A9

Sunnis Denied 10 More Seats
Sunni Arab political leaders asked the main Shiite political bloc on to give them 10 Shiite seats in the new Parliament in an early attempt to defuse tensions over the election, but the Shiites refused. It was not clear whether Iraqi election rules would permit the change, even if the Shiites had agreed. A12

Immigration Judges Criticized for Rulings
Federal appeals court judges around the nation have repeatedly excoriated immigration judges this year for what they call a pattern of biased and incoherent decisions in asylum cases. A1

Problems With Storm Cleanup
There are many reasons for the difference between the lack of progress in Pascagoula, Miss., and the quick cleanup in the Biloxi area. But local officials in Mississippi point the finger at what they consider the No. 1 culprit: the federal government and, in particular, the Army Corps of Engineers. A1

Powell on Eavesdropping
Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that it would not have been ''that hard'' for President Bush to obtain warrants for eavesdropping on domestic telephone and Internet activity, but that he saw ''nothing wrong'' with the decision not to do so. A22

1,500 Catholics Support Priest
Despite warnings, at least 1,500 people attended Christmas Eve Mass in St. Louis with the Rev. Marek Bozek presiding. Father Bozek is an excommunicated Roman Catholic priest, and the archbishop warned parishioners that participating in the Mass would be a mortal sin. A24

'Largest Laundry' Returns
Destroyed by a four alarm blaze in 2004, the World's Largest Laundromat reopens this week. Located in the working class neighborhood of Berwyn, Ill., just west of Chicago, the neighborhood business will have 301 washing machines and free wireless Internet access, coffee and doughnuts. A22

Whoopies Go Nationwide
Just over a decade ago, Amy Bouchard of Richmond, Me., drew on her love for baking to create a business in her kitchen making whoopie pies. In those days, she would crank out three at a time. Now, Ms. Bouchard churns out 5,000 to 7,000 of the sweet Wicked Whoopies each day, shipping the cream-filled cake sandwiches nationwide and beyond. A23

Hockey Picks Up Speed
Olympic speedskating champion Dan Jansen, who retired from the sport after winning a gold medal in 1994, joined the Chicago Blackhawks this season as their skating coach. Changes to the N.H.L. rules have altered officiating that rewarded physicality over speed. D7

Retiree Health Care Costs Are Likely to Skyrocket
The cost of health care promised to retired New York State and city workers is likely to rise substantially under new accounting rules scheduled to go into effect at the end of 2006, experts say. New York City's expense could quintuple, and most other cities and states, which offer the same benefits to their retirees, will also be affected. A1

A Dry Town, and Proud Of It
This month, voters in rural Eastford, Conn., approved the sale of beer and wine in restaurants that seat 35 or more, leaving Bridgewater, on the opposite side of the state, as Connecticut's last dry town. Residents seem to prefer it that way. B4

Questions on Prison Health

HEADLINE: Picturing Some Shocks That Flesh Is Heir To

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
With war photographs confronting us daily, do we need an exhibition to remind us of the body's vulnerability? But the havoc caused by war is only one aspect of it. There is disease, domestic violence, environmental pollution, the enfeeblement of old age, starvation, drug addiction and more -- much more. It's a gloomy picture and ''The Body at Risk: Photography of Disorder, Illness and Healing'' at the International Center of Photography is not for the squeamish. But the show is not all downbeat. 
 ''The Body at Risk'' is a collaboration between the photography center and the Milbank Memorial Fund, a New York-based foundation that since 1905 has sought to improve public health through research and advocacy. The show was assembled by Carol Squiers, a curator at the center, from the work of 16 documentary photographers, among them Lewis Hine, W. Eugene Smith, Dorothea Lange, Donna Ferrato, Sebastiao Salgado and Marion Post Wolcott. Ms. Squiers has also written a substantial catalog. 
The show takes in a lot of pictorial territory, from the now-familiar shots of maltreated child laborers by Hine, the early 20th-century reformer, to victims of the AIDS rampage in Africa by the South African photographer Gideon Mendel. A section on the Farm Security Administration, a New Deal health initiative from the mid-1930's to the early 1940's, details the plight of tenant farmers and migrant laborers during the Depression, and some of the federal programs assisting them. Environmental pollution is addressed by David Hanson, whose photographs of affected sites, and their monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency, come with maps and written descriptions.
 One of the sections that is most painful in its immediacy -- and the only one in color -- presents images from Lori Grinker's long-running project about war veterans. Addressing the lasting effects of war on the surviving wounded, it doesn't stint in its depiction of maimed bodies. A 2003 photograph of a 28-year-old Marine, Sgt. Jose Torres, who was wounded in Iraq by both enemy and friendly fire, shows him aboard a hospital ship, being prepped for his ninth operation.
 The psychological residue of combat is seen on the face of Henry Green, a British veteran of the Korean War, who survived the brutal Battle of the Imjin River in 1951. Almost half a century later, he still suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, as his worn, anxious face, a tear starting from his eye, suggests in a 1998 close-up that Ms. Grinker took during a monthly group therapy session for war veterans.
 On a more upbeat note, we can witness the ministrations of a healer made famous by Smith (who suffered severe shrapnel wounds as a photographer in World War II). In 1951, while on the staff of Life magazine, he followed a remarkable certified nurse-midwife, Maude Callen, as she made her rounds in rural South Carolina, not only helping women to deliver their babies but also attending to the general health-care needs of an impoverished population. Her profession, more akin to that of a physician than of a simple midwife, was created in the early 20th century by public health doctors and nurses. 
 In Smith's impassioned pictures (he was of the old-fashioned activist breed), we see Callen delivering a baby; teaching a class of midwife trainees; vaccinating children; comforting a paralyzed man in a wheelchair who weeps at her soothing touch; and racing to a distant hospital in the vain hope of saving a dying infant. In one incident, photographed in a segregated hospital, Smith himself gave blood for transfusion to a moribund infant. Callen, an African-American, helplessly stood by as a white doctor botched the procedure and nurses complained about a white man giving blood to a black child.
 A hair-raising series by Donna Ferrato explores domestic violence in the United States, cited as a ''health care issue of epidemic proportions'' in 2004 by the Third National Conference on Health Care and Domestic Violence. Bleeding, bruised and battered women make graphic appearances in these photographs, which demonstrate that abuse cuts across racial and economic lines. One sequence, accidentally caught by Ms. Ferrato in 1981 as she was photographing an upscale married couple, shows the husband, in a frantic search for a cocaine pipe hidden by his wife, slamming her in the face as he fails to find it.
 Those pictures, Ms. Squiers notes, were the start of a decade-long journey by Ms. Ferrato ''to make the first and most comprehensive record of battered women in the United States.''
 Old age, often considered a disease in the United States, is tackled by Ed Kashi. His perspective is broad, taking in the active elderly as well as those too incapacitated to be left alone. One surprise is his image of two elderly men in a prison hospital, which acknowledges that the fastest-growing segment of the prison population in America is inmates older than 50.
 In one 2000 shot, Mr. Kashi shows a happy couple in their 80's celebrating their wedding in a north Miami synagogue; in another, from 2001, pole-vaulters 75 and older wait their turn in the Summer National Senior Games competition in Baton Rouge, La. Other pictures show the poor and helpless, dependent on wheelchairs and the help of friends and government agencies.
 ''The Body at Risk'' is a show where straightforward, documentary photography serves its subjects best. But art sometimes creeps into journalism (and vice versa). Among the examples are Smith's shots of Maude Callen when he used his favorite device of making dark, shadowy pictures subtly illuminated by light. In another key are Eugene Richards's raw, chilling emergency room scenes, which include a devastating view of a woman's body abandoned on a table after surgeons failed to revive her bullet-riddled heart.
 The show's most poignant shot was made in 2000 by Mr. Mendel. It shows a Tanzanian mother, Dorika Gabriel, as she lovingly carries the skeletal body of her 30-year-old son, Joseph, dying of AIDS, to a spot outside their hovel where he can sit in the shade. 

''The Body at Risk: Photography of Disorder, Illness and Healing'' is on view at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Feb. 26.

HEADLINE: Where Pragmatism Begets Beauty and a Subtle Spirituality

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
The first thing you notice about the 80 works included in ''Marks of Distinction: Two Hundred Years of American Drawings and Watercolors From the Hood Museum of Art'' at the National Academy Museum is how beautifully made many of them are. Organized to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Hood Museum at Dartmouth College, the exhibition is a good reminder of what a pleasure it can be to behold fine technique in visual or any other art.
 Then you may begin to notice what is missing. There are no images of crucifixions, angels, Greek gods or kings and queens; no soft-core erotica, visionary fantasies, rococo froufrou or studies for overblown history paintings. (Well, there is an angel by Benjamin West and a homoerotic image by Paul Cadmus, but they are exceptions.) 
 In other words, much that animates traditional European art is missing. What's left is something distinctively American: a plain-spoken pragmatism and a belief in the value of a job well done. 
 In this sense, John James Audubon, the ornithological draftsman, may be the great American artist. Here he is represented by a near life-size portrait of a red-tailed hawk drawn in graphite and pastel with exquisite precision and without a single unnecessary mark. 
 This imperative to do what is necessary but no more cuts across styles. You see it in the schematic, straight-lined pencil drawing of a steamboat by the 19th-century folk artist James Bard; in a watercolor view of Lake Winnipesaukee, N.H., realized with intense attention to detail by the American pre-Raphaelite John Henry Hill; and in the zanily buoyant drawing of hyper-energetic people and animals by the 20th-century self-taught artist Bill Traylor. It is in a drawing of two women in the light of a reading lamp rendered with exacting charcoal hatch marks by Mary Cassatt, the expatriate adopted by the French Impressionists, and in a finely drawn abstract grid by the Minimalist Agnes Martin. 
 In many of the most arresting pictures, that pragmatic economy of means is matched by an alertness to the real world that is both visually acute and subtly spiritual. In a watercolor the size of an elongated postcard by Winslow Homer that shows boys swimming and boats floating in placidly rippled water, the vivid sense of light, space and time pierces the soul. And the luminous, precisionist-style drawing of an empty courtyard between apartment buildings by George Ault evokes a haunting combination of urban ennui and poetic immanence. A looser, rural parallel to Ault's quietly transcendentalist vision can be seen in Andrew Wyeth's watercolor of winter light raking into the interior of an empty barn. 
 That the works from the last 50 years are less exciting, despite the inclusion of important figures like David Smith and Eva Hesse, is something to think about. Ours is a time when being able to draw well, never mind beautifully, is not required of artists; mechanical means of representation are rendering handmade methods increasingly obsolete.
 There are still artists who can draw quite nicely. Examples in this show are Joan Mitchell, the Abstract Expressionist; Larry Rivers, who worked close to the field of Pop Art; and Lee Bontecou, whose page of studies for sculptures looks like the work of a science-fiction illustrator. But the kind of deeply felt skill that you see in works as various as Thomas Sully's illustration of a shipwrecked sailor, William Trost Richards's small, intensely atmospheric seascapes and Charles Demuth's deft watercolor of three people at the beach is mostly missing from this exhibition's later 20th-century selections.
 That could be rectified by adding more and better works to the collection, but it won't change the fact that drawing is not what it used to be.

''Marks of Distinction: Two Hundred Years of American Drawings and Watercolors From the Hood Museum of Art'' remains on view at the National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, through Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: Trading Status For a Raise

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
Ricardo Stefano spends 11 hours a day, five days a week brushing the scuffed oxfords and dusty loafers of businessmen near Grand Central Terminal, something he has been doing since arriving from Brazil 15 years ago.
 Shining shoes was a step down from fixing glasses in his father's eyeglass shop, particularly for someone with a year of college under his belt. But trailblazing compatriots told him he could make far more money shining shoes in New York than he could fixing glasses in Brazil, and the rumors turned out to be true. At age 43, he makes $500 a week, half of which he sends back to his estranged wife and three children in the state of Minas Gerais. He has not seen his children since he left. But Mr. Stefano does not regret his decision.
''When you come to this country, you know what kind of job you will find -- because you don't have language, you don't have papers,'' he said. ''That's the price you pay.'' 
 Brazilian immigrants in the New York area are emerging as one of the city's faster growing ethnic groups, but unlike most Latin Americans who come here poor, ill-educated and willing to spirit across borders, Brazilians more often tend to come from a range of middle-class backgrounds, are well-schooled and can afford to fly here legally. Experts on these immigrants, like Maxine L. Margolis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida in Gainesville, say that Brazilians qualify for tourist visas, which require proof of jobs and savings accounts, then often intentionally overstay them. 
 Once in the United States, even those with college degrees are willing to work as housekeepers, limousine drivers and go-go dancers because menial work in America pays much more than white-collar jobs do in the oft-troubled Brazilian economy.
 ''In Brazil you have quality of life, but here you have financial security,'' said Jamiel Ramalho de Almeida, a hairdresser who came from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state in southeastern Brazil, after graduating from the College of Philosophy, Science and Language with a teaching degree. Mr. Almeida, a neatly bearded man of flawless diction, owns the Ipanema Beauty Salon in Astoria, Queens. ''When you get a taste of the good life, it's hard to go back to what you had before.'' 
 So many Brazilians have streamed here that they have transformed neighborhoods like Astoria and Ironbound in Newark. Together those neighborhoods are home to two dozen Brazilian restaurants, three nightclubs, several bikini-waxing parlors and supermarkets that stock the smoked pork parts used for feijoada, a fatty bean stew so heavy that it is typically followed by a nap. 
 In Ironbound, Brazilians have fit right in with their former colonizers, the Portuguese, though Brazilians may soon outnumber them. There are also large concentrations of Brazilians in Mineola, Port Chester and Mount Vernon in New York, in Long Branch, N.J., and in Danbury, Conn.
 At least since Carmen Miranda, with a fruit bowl for a hat, chica-chica-boomed audiences out of some of their stodginess, Brazil has had a distinct mystique among Americans. 
 Samba and bossa nova rhythms have shaped the music of Frank Sinatra and Manhattan's dance clubs, and movies like ''Black Orpheus'' and ''Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands'' have mixed magic, lust and a Brazilian love of revelry to relax American restraints. Pele ignited a romance with soccer that, in its children's version, has become a ritual of suburban autumn weekends.
 But the mystique has always been felt at arm's length. Very few Brazilians actually moved here. That has been changing as a result of Brazil's sometimes inflationary economy and high unemployment, which has been hovering near 10 percent. Although the 2000 Census counted 13,000 New Yorkers of Brazilian ancestry, with 3,372 of them in Astoria, the Brazilian Consulate thinks those are gross undercounts.
 Jose Alfredo Graca Lima, the consul general in New York, said a 2004 Census estimate put the number in New York State at 42,000, in New Jersey at 51,000, and in Connecticut at 18,000, but based on subscribers to Brazilian satellite TV, he thinks those numbers should be more than doubled.
 The immigrants include an uncommon proportion of well-educated people. The 2000 Census revealed that 30.8 percent of the city's Brazilians had degrees from colleges or graduate schools, triple the number for some other nationalities from Latin America like Mexicans, at 8.6 percent, or Ecuadorians, at 9.4 percent. 
 The educated expatriates include Marcia Duarte, 45, who has an exuberant laugh and a degree in psychology. Like a lopsided proportion of Brazilians here, she too hails from Minas Gerais, where she worked in human resources for a firm in Belo Horizonte, a city of both soaring buildings and hovels unconnected to the sewage grid. Here she has worked mostly as a baby sitter, with her first employers assuming she came from a penniless background.
 ''The families teach us how to cut the ends of flowers to put them in a vase, how to set the table, how to use the remote control,'' she said. ''We know that already!'' 
 But American pay coupled with a multiracial society similar to Brazil's have been irresistible. She now works as a personal assistant to an executive and makes $47,000 a year, five times what she estimates that she might have made back home. ''To make money in Brazil is always a problem,'' she said. With her salary, she can afford to take two trips home a year.
 Still, Miss Duarte plans to return to Brazil in four years to live on her national pension. According to Dr. Margolis, most Brazilians come to the United States as sojourners, not settlers, for they seem to have a case of saudades, the longing for home. 
 Eloah Teixeira, 60, who once managed a light-fixtures shop in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil, has cleaned houses for many of her 20 years in America. She lives in a ground-floor apartment in Astoria and exults in being able to afford tickets for musicals like ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,'' and sampling restaurants like Astoria's Malagueta. But housecleaning, she adds, ''is a hard job, especially when you're 60.''
 The owner of Malagueta, Herbet Gomes, has a two-year degree from a technical college and in Brazil was a skilled mechanic who repaired mining machines. But he earned just $700 a month in 1990 and dreaded losing a finger to a machine. He took a chance on migrating and found work as a dishwasher in Manhattan.
 ''It was a shame for me considering what I did in Brazil,'' he said. ''All these years I work to be a dishwasher? Wow, what have I done wrong? After two weeks, I loosen up.'' 
 He worked his way up to the position of cook at other restaurants, and, in 1999, he married another Brazilian, Alda Teixeira, who worked as a housekeeper. Four years ago, they opened Malagueta, a 14-table spot serving shrimp stew and pudim de leite (flan). It was one of 13 restaurants in Queens to earn a mention in the first Michelin restaurant guide for New York. One waitress, Monica Araujo, has a bachelor's degree in international relations from Pontificia Universidade Catolica in Rio de Janeiro. 
 The neighborhood surrounding Malagueta has overshadowed the area of 46th Street between Fifth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan as the city's center of Brazilian life. The two Midtown blocks once had 100 Brazilian shops that sold electronic goods that Brazilian tourists found to be cheaper here than they were at home. 
 When import taxes were reduced, the shops went out of business. Joao de Matos, who organizes the annual Brazilian Day that draws hundreds of thousands, said the street is down to three restaurants, his travel agency, a money remitter and a shop that sells the string bikinis that Brazilians call fio dental (dental floss).
 Tatiana Pacheco, a 28-year-old college-educated counselor at Immigration Advocacy Services in Astoria who came here to work as an au pair, said that there are so many Brazilians in her neighborhood, ''I feel like I'm in a different town instead of 10,000 miles away.''
 She loves New York's ''big boiling machine.'' Still, she said, Americans do not acknowledge how hard it is for immigrants to do well here. Her compatriots struggle with crowded quarters shared among newcomers. Others like Ms. Araujo, the Malagueta waitress, pine for the Brazilian zest for life.
 ''Here, you just think about your job, about making money,'' she said. ''You don't think about life.''

HEADLINE: A New Civil Rights Movement

BYLINE: By Bob Herbert

 BODY:
One of the cruelest aspects of slavery was the way it wrenched apart black families, separating husbands from wives and children from their parents.
 It is ironic, to say the least, that now, nearly a century and a half after the Emancipation Proclamation, much of the most devastating damage to black families, and especially black children, is self-inflicted.
You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know that some of the most serious problems facing blacks in the United States -- from poverty to incarceration rates to death at an early age -- are linked in varying degrees to behavioral issues and the corrosion of black family life, especially the absence of fathers. 
 Another devastating aspect of slavery was the numbing ignorance that often resulted from the prohibition against the education of slaves. It was against the law in most instances for slaves to even learn to read. Now, with education widely (though imperfectly) available, we have entire legions of black youngsters turning their backs on school, choosing instead to wallow in a self-imposed ignorance that in the long run is as destructive as a bullet to the brain.
 I remember interviewing a 17-year-old dropout in Brooklyn who had already fathered two children by two different girls. He wasn't working and he wasn't helping to support either child. I asked if he had considered going back to school. He looked at me, puzzled. ''For what?'' he said.
 Most black people are not poor. Most are not criminals. Most are leading productive lives. The black middle class is larger and more successful than ever. But there are millions who are still out in the cold, caught in a cycle of poverty, ignorance, illness and violence that is taking a horrendous toll.
 Nearly a third of black men in their 20's have criminal records, and 8 percent of all black men between the ages of 25 and 29 are behind bars.
 H.I.V. and AIDS have literally become the black plague. Although blacks are just 13 percent of the overall population, they account for more than half of all new H.I.V. infections. Black women account for an astonishing 72 percent of all new cases among women.
 This is frightening. 
 Black children routinely get a rough start in life. Two-thirds of them are born out of wedlock, and nearly half of all black children brought up in a single-parent household are poor. Those kids are much more likely to drop out of school, struggle economically, be initiators or victims of violence, and endure a variety of serious health problems.
 We can pretend that these terrible things are not happening, but they are. There's a crisis in the black community, and it won't do to place all of the blame on society and government.
 I've spent years writing about unfairness and appalling injustices. Society is unfair and racism is still a rampant evil. But much of the suffering in black America could be alleviated by changes in behavior. What's more, those behavioral changes would empower the community in ways that would make it easier to successfully confront opponents in government and push the society in a more equitable direction.
 The problems facing black people today are comparable in magnitude to those of the Jim Crow era of the 20th century. There were leaders in those days who were equal to the challenge.
 I believe that nothing short of a new movement, comparable in scope and dedication to that of the civil rights era, is required to bring about the changes in values and behavior needed to halt the self-destruction that is consuming so many black lives. The crucial question is whether the leadership exists to mount such an effort.
 A good first step would be a summit meeting of wise and dedicated men and women willing to think about creative new ways to approach such problems as crime and violence, out-of-wedlock births, drug and alcohol abuse, irresponsible sexual behavior, misogyny, and so on.
 Addressing issues of values and behavior within the black community should not in any way imply a lessening of the pressure on the broader society to meet its legal and ethical obligations. It should be seen as an essential counterpoint to that pressure.
 Most important, it should be seen as a crucial component of the obligation that black adults have to create a broadly nurturing environment in which succeeding generations of black children can survive and thrive.
 Despite the sometimes valiant efforts of individuals and organizations across the country, we are not meeting that obligation now. And that's because there's a vacuum where our leadership should be.

HEADLINE: Letting the Poor Rebuild

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Poor Need Not Apply'' (editorial, Dec. 21): 
 As you reported, thousands of families seeking to rebuild homes destroyed by Hurricane Katrina have been unable to qualify for rebuilding loans through the Small Business Administration. In addition to credit problems, many displaced families cannot afford to service a new mortgage, even at reduced interest rates.
A promising alternative would be to use ''silent mortgages,'' in which no payments are due until the homes are resold. Silent mortgages would allow families to rebuild their homes immediately, with the government's costs recovered upon resale. Many affordable home ownership programs are structured similarly elsewhere in the country.

HEADLINE: Indians Find They Can, Indeed, Go Home Again

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
Standing amid the rolling lawns outside his four-bedroom villa, Ajay Kela pondered his street in the community of Palm Meadows. One of his neighbors recently returned to India from Cupertino, Calif., to run a technology start-up funded by the venture capital firm Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers. 
 Across the street from Mr. Kela is another Indian executive, this one from Fremont, Calif., who works with the outsourcing firm Infosys Technologies. On the other side is the top executive of Cisco Systems in India, who returned here after decades in the Bay Area and New York.
Also on the block is a returnee from the United Kingdom, who heads the technology operations of Deutsche Bank. 
 Mr. Kela's neighborhood is just a small sample of a reverse brain drain benefiting India. The gated community of Palm Meadows in the Whitefield suburbs, and many others in the vicinity, with names like Ozone and Lake Vista, are full of Indians who were educated in and worked in the United States and Europe, but who have been lured home by the surging Indian economy and its buoyant technology industry.
 ''Nothing unusual about this lane at all,'' said Mr. Kela, 48, who moved from Foster City, Calif., to Palm Meadows last year and is president of the outsourcing firm Symphony Services, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif. 
 Nasscom, a trade group of Indian outsourcing companies, estimates that 30,000 technology professionals have moved back in the last 18 months. Bangalore, Hyderabad and the suburbs of Delhi are becoming magnets for an influx of Indians, who are the top-earning ethnic group in the United States. These cities, with their Western-style work environment, generous paychecks and quick career jumps, offer the returnees what, until now, they could only get in places like Palo Alto and Boston.
 And now they offer something else: a housing boom. Homes have tripled in value in Palm Meadows over the last 12 months, and rents have quadrupled. ''Expatriates are returning because India is hot,'' said Nandan Nilekani, chief executive of Infosys Technologies, India's second-largest outsourcing firm, which recruited 25 returnees from top American schools for its 100-seat summer internship this year. ''There is an increasing feeling that significant action in the technology industry is moving to India,'' he said. 
 While most returnees are first-generation expatriates, second-generation Indians living in the United States are also returning, said Lori Blackman, a recruitment consultant in Dallas. ''Among them I sense an altruistic pull to return to India to help build their home country to a greater power than the country had ever hoped to achieve,'' she said. 
 But the trend is raising fears among American specialists that it could deplete the United States of scientific talent and blunt its edge in innovation. ''The United States will miss the talents of people of Indian origin who return to India,'' said Brink Lindsey, vice president for research at the Cato Institute in Washington, adding, that the moves could create greater possibilities for trade between the two countries. 
 For many returnees, the newly challenging work environment in India has tied in neatly with personal reasons for returning, such as raising their children in Indian culture and caring for aging parents.
 ''When I left India 25 years ago, everybody was headed to the United States,'' said Mr. Kela, who pursued a Ph.D. at the University of Rochester and stayed two decades, working for companies like General Electric and AutoDesk. For India's best and brightest, a technology or engineering career was an irresistible draw to the United States, even until four or five years ago.
 ''But now they all want to get on the plane home,'' said Mr. Kela, who returned with his wife and two children. 
 Once a regular at Silicon Valley job fairs, trying to woo Indians back home, Mr. Kela no longer needs to sell India. He receives 10 resumes a month from people with decades of work experience in the United States yearning to relocate.
 With globalization, many Americans of Indian origin in the high-technology industry are looking at India as a ''career-enhancing move,'' said Anuradha Parthasarathy, the chief executive of Global Executive Talent, a search firm in Menlo Park, Calif., who is swamped by such job-seekers. Many technology companies -- multinationals and Indian outsourcing firms as well as start-ups -- are eager to hire returnees with Western managerial experience or technology specialization.
 Companies based in the United States, like ipValue, a company in Palo Alto that commercializes intellectual assets for large technology companies like British Telecom and the Xerox Corporation, are helping accelerate the trend. When ipValue recently decided to expand its operations, it chose to do so in India. 
 ''We are really betting on the Indian diaspora returning home,'' said Vincent Pluvinage, its chief executive. The firm just hired a top executive from Oracle to head its Indian operations and expects a third of its 20-member team in India to consist of returnees by January 2006.
 The passage back is no longer an ordeal, because much has changed in India. Whereas watching a movie in a dingy hall was once a weekend high point, now fancy multiplexes, bowling alleys and shopping malls offer entertainment, and pizzerias and cafes are ubiquitous at street corners. Indians who once could choose between only two car models and fly a single airline find they have returned to a profusion of choices.
 Even as the lifestyle gaps between India and the West have narrowed rapidly, salary differences at top executive levels have virtually disappeared. Annual pay packages of a half-million dollars are common in Bangalore, but even for those taking a pay cut to return home, the lower cost of living balances smaller paychecks. Starting salaries for engineers are about $12,000 in India, versus $60,000 in Silicon Valley.
 But relocating is not without its challenges, as Venki Sundaresan, 38, discovered a year ago when, after 15 years abroad, he moved to India with his wife and twin daughters to be the information technology director of Cypress Semiconductor.
 In atypical fashion, Mr. Sundaresan scorned the ''soft landing'' that many returning Indians seek by living in gated communities. Instead, to have the ''true Indian experience,'' the family opted to live in the teeming Indiranagar neighborhood. For his 5-year-old twins, he spurned upmarket international schools popular with other returnees and enrolled them in a neighborhood school. Mr. Sundaresan owns an Indian-made car, a Maruti Baleno. 
 ''We've already driven the Mercedes and the BMW in the United States,'' he said. ''What is the point of dodging around Bangalore's potholes in a limo?'' 
 Living in Palm Meadows, Mr. Kela and his neighbor Sanjay Swamy, 41, who heads the Indian operations of Ketera Technologies, face very little transition anxiety. Mr. Swamy bought and moved into a Palm Meadows villa with his wife, Tulsi, a financial consultant, and 8-year-old son, Ashwin. 
 The communities buffer returnees from Bangalore's bumper-to-bumper traffic, unpaved sidewalks and swarming neighborhoods. Mr. Kela; his 9-year-old daughter, Payal; and 6-year-old son, Ankur, enjoy riding bikes on weekends, and they often play cricket, which Mr. Kela is passionate about. His daughter is learning the classical Indian dances of Kathak and Bharatanatyam. For Halloween this year, Mr. Kela led his children on a trick-or-treat walk.
 Mr. Kela says he misses the freedom to drive anywhere or go on long hikes. Yet, life is comfortable, with two live-in maids, a full-time driver and another on call, all of whom are ''outrageously affordable.'' 
 His neighbor Mr. Swamy is immersed in building a Silicon Valley-style team in Bangalore, but with some local adjustments. When he learned that the company routinely received calls from prospective fathers-in-law of employees, asking to verify their ages, titles and salary details, Mr. Swamy wrote a memo titled ''HR Policy on Disclosing Employee Information to Prospective Fathers-in-Law.'' 
 ''While I want to be entirely supportive of ensuring that our confidentiality agreement does not result in your missing out on the spouse of your dreams,'' Mr. Swamy said, ''I don't want competitors to use this as a ploy to get at sensitive information.''

HEADLINE: High-Tech Industry in Israel Goes from Bust to Boom

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: KIRYAT GAT, Israel, Dec. 19 

 BODY:
Israel's high-tech sector is having its best year since the dot-com implosion in 2000, and the evidence includes this working-class town, where bulldozers are rapidly clearing acres of land for a huge, state-of-the-art chip-making plant.
 The Intel Corporation, the world's largest chip maker, announced this month that it would invest $3.5 billion to build a new plant, adjacent to an existing one that makes Pentium 4 chips, at an industrial park in this town in southern Israel, which has long struggled economically despite the money poured into it. 
Intel already has six design and production facilities scattered across Israel and more than 6,000 workers, making it one of the country's largest private employers. It will be adding at least 2,000 jobs at the new plant, which will produce 12-inch chip wafers, the company says.
 ''Intel has a long history of high-tech manufacturing in Israel, and this is a natural continuation of that,'' said Alex Kornhauser, the general manger of Intel's operations in Israel. ''When the manufacturing requires highly skilled people, we believe we have a competitive advantage here.''
 The Intel project is a leading example of the overall resurgence of the high-tech sector, which generates more than $13 billion of annual exports, or about 40 percent of Israel's total exports, according to government figures.
 From large manufacturers such as Intel to start-ups financed by venture capital firms in the Tel Aviv suburb of Herzliya, the industry appears to have largely recovered after taking a pounding five years ago. Israel now has more than 70 companies listed on the Nasdaq, more than any other country outside of the United States.
 With high-tech playing a significant role, Israel's economy is expected to grow about 5 percent this year, after growing around 4 percent last year. This follows three years of economic turbulence during which the country suffered one of its worst recessions.
 Throughout the 1990's, the technology industry modernized and reshaped an economy with socialist roots and many large, state-run companies. The sector established a reputation for producing innovative start-up firms that are often incorporated in the United States. But in 2000, Israel was hit not only by the dot-com collapse, but also by the Palestinian uprising, which drove away foreign players who had been crucial to high-tech development here.
 ''Before the crash, money was just flowing here, madly,'' said Joseph Morgenstern, a business consultant who has published The Israel High-Tech and Investment Report for 21 years. ''Venture capitalists were investing in start-ups that had no chance of showing black on their balance sheets. A lot of people lost money and jobs.''
 The number of high-technology workers in Israel peaked at more than 66,000 in the year 2000, then fell to around 53,000 in the years 2001-2003, and has rebounded to reach 61,000 this year, according to the government's Central Bureau of Statistics.
 For several years, Israeli venture capital firms did not even hold their annual meetings here because so few foreigners were willing to attend, said Yossi Sela, a managing partner at Gemini Israel Funds, a leading venture capital firm.
 ''Things have changed dramatically in the past couple years,'' said Mr. Sela. ''Investors are again flocking to this country.''
 Pointing to a recent success, he cited Saifun Semiconductors, which makes flash memory systems used in digital cameras, mobile phones and other consumer electronics. In 1998, Mr. Sela's firm began investing in Saifun in its early stages. Last month, the company was listed on Nasdaq and raised $121 million in its initial public offering.
 Israelis point to several factors in the nation's high-tech success.
 Israel's military has been a leader in adopting new technology, and it works closely with civilian companies. One example is Elbit Systems, which makes night-vision equipment and has customers that include the United States military.
 Also, Israeli men and women are required to perform military service after high school. Many gain experience in a variety of high-tech systems, which leads directly to future careers.
 And Israel's close ties with the United States have made it a natural choice for young companies searching for investors, stock listings and marketing guidance.
 The Israeli government, meanwhile, has sought to tap the high-tech sector to develop isolated areas such as Kiryat Gat.
 Kiryat Gat is a development town, one of many established by the government over the years with the intention of directing immigrants to more sparsely populated areas. Such towns have usually fared poorly.
 The Israeli government provided substantial subsidies for Intel to build its first plant here, which opened in 1999. This time, the government's benefits package is even larger, with incentives totaling $525 million.
 Kiryat Gat lacks enough engineers, technicians and other skilled workers to meet Intel's needs. Fewer than half of the more than 3,000 workers at the existing plant live in the town, according to Mr. Kornhauser. He is among those who commute an hour each way to homes in Jerusalem.
 But the company has been able to recruit from the cities where the high-tech industry is clustered, including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa.
 While most Intel factories are in the United States, Intel's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, said earlier this year that federal corporate taxes had led the company to consider new plants in countries with lower tax burdens.
 Israel has long been regarded as a high-tax country, but the Israeli government offered Intel a 10 percent tax rate, compared with 35 percent in the United States, Mr. Otellini said.
 ''The benefit package put forth by the Israeli government was part of the equation,'' said Mr. Kornhauser. ''This is a good investment for Intel and for the state of Israel.''

HEADLINE: Ballet Theater's Director of Turnaround

BYLINE: By ROSLYN SULCAS

 BODY:
Rachel Moore's mother cried all the way to the airport when her 18-year-old daughter left her hometown of Davis, Calif., to join American Ballet Theater's junior company in New York. ''My parents were both economists and very upset that I wasn't going to college,'' said Ms. Moore, who is now the executive director of Ballet Theater. 
 Her family can relax. Since her appointment in April 2004, this former dancer, now 41, has taken firm hold of an unwieldy, creaky organization that is also a great one, constantly beset by financial problems, yet somehow managing to produce the spectacular productions and dancers for which it is famous. Since Ms. Moore took over, Ballet Theater's endowment has risen from $8 million to $15 million; its City Center season this fall showed box office gains of 30 percent over the previous year; and for the first time in six years, an operating deficit has disappeared and a modest surplus is projected when audit results are released next week. 
To put these achievements in perspective, it should be noted that when Ms. Moore was hired, she was Ballet Theater's fourth executive director in four years, following Elizabeth Harpel Kehler, Wallace Chapell and Louis G. Spisto. Unlike her predecessors, Ms. Moore had firsthand experience of the other side of the administrative-artistic divide that exists in every performing arts organization, having graduated from the junior company to the Ballet Theater corps in 1984 and danced there until she was sidelined by a foot injury four years later.
 ''I knew I was coming in to a place that had been very unsettled,'' said Ms. Moore, who has reddish gamine-cut hair and retains a dancer's ramrod-straight back. ''But I understand the Ballet Theater context, what its traditions and needs are. And I never forgot what it's like to be a dancer. This can be a heartbreaking career.''
 Ms. Moore's Ballet Theater background was, in fact, a deciding factor for both the artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, and the chairman, Lewis Ranieri, who had stepped into the breach when Ms. Kehler left after less than a year on the job. ''Rachel was in many ways at a disadvantage,'' Mr. Ranieri said. ''She is young, and so she didn't have the kind of resume that some of the other candidates had. But she had an inside grasp of things that they didn't. And I think she actually did much more homework. We were able to have extremely detailed conversations about the company, and so we had a very clear idea who we would be hiring.''
 Ms. Moore's resume is, in fact, not at all shabby. After leaving Ballet Theater, she graduated from Brown University with honors in ethics and political philosophy, and then studied arts administration at Columbia. After working for an arts advocacy group in Washington, she moved to Boston with her husband, Robert Ryan, and held senior administrative positions at Ballet Theater of Boston and Project Step, a classical music school for minority students. Then she moved to the Boston Ballet as director of its Center for Dance Education, the largest professional ballet school in the United States, with 2,000 students and 75 employees. When the Ballet Theater position opened up, she decided to apply even though, she said, she thought she had little chance of actually getting the job. ''My goal was simply not to embarrass myself,'' she said. 
 This mixture of ambition and realism appears characteristic of Ms. Moore, whose pragmatic focus on matters at hand runs side by side with a broader grasp of the company's needs. ''When I arrived, it was clear that I would have to make changes,'' she said. ''We restructured the senior staff -- eliminating the chief operating officer position and dividing up those duties -- and we made significant budget cuts by laying off staff for a week, not giving raises and changing touring plans. If I hadn't taken a tough stance, Ballet Theater might not have survived. But I understand the artistic issues, and I strongly believe that we must have a real identity and vision. I'm never going to quibble about the expense of rehearsal time or whether a particular ballet needs to be done.''
 All of this, Mr. McKenzie said, has made his life considerably easier. ''The problem with trying to run a ballet company is that every artistic idea is a lousy business decision,'' he said. ''But Rachel comes from within and knows the culture: we do big operatic ballets with big stars, and we also try to honor our origins as choreographic theater. It's an enormous juggling act, and when the fit is right between the executive and the artistic director, that takes a whole step out of the planning process. Now it's, 'Trust us,' as opposed to, 'Trust me.' ''
 However great Ms. Moore's insider grasp of affairs and rapport with Mr. McKenzie, she nonetheless still faces the problems that have vexed Ballet Theater's directors since the company's inception in 1940. The troupe has never had a permanent home, as New York City Ballet does at the State Theater, and it has always toured extensively, with the attendant costs of transporting large numbers of dancers and supporting staff -- to say nothing of the costumes and scenery needed for its repertory of full-length classical ballets.
 Ms. Moore's approach is to consider these circumstances as a spur to a bold vision. ''We think of ourselves as a national company,'' she said, ''and that's how American Ballet Theater can differentiate itself from every other ballet company, and find new forms of funding and new audiences. This means more than touring. It also means that we are working toward being the standard bearer of excellence in the art form -- not just performing, but also fostering new works, raising the standard of dance training, and bringing dance to people from all walks of life. It's not just about doing 'Swan Lake' every year; it's about what impact we can have on the art form.''
 These are elevated goals, but Ms. Moore, who attends almost every performance by the company, is a convincing advocate. 
 ''I plan to be in this job for a long time,'' Ms. Moore said. 
 Mr. Ranieri seems to agree. ''She and her husband have just bought a house,'' he said. ''I'm very pleased about that.''

HEADLINE: The Day After Christmas, Shoppers Take a Holiday

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO; Michael Falcone, in Walnut Creek, Calif; Brenda Goodman, in Atlanta; and Kyle Whitmire, in Birmingham, Ala., contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Better luck later this week.
 Many retailers hoping for a big finish to the holiday season instead had lighter-than-expected crowds over the long Christmas weekend, according to anecdotal reports, leaving stores to rely heavily on the next few days to pump up December sales.
Explanations for the lackluster finish varied: an unusually warm winter hurt cold-weather clothing sales, greater gift card use delayed purchases and higher energy costs discouraged splurges. 
 C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, dispatched researchers to stores in five cities yesterday -- Boston, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas and Orlando, Fla. -- where they found relatively few shoppers, considering that it was a federal holiday. 
 ''All of us thought that these stores would be packed early and often but it never materialized,'' he said. 
 Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at the market research firm NPD Group, said that after a strong start the day after Thanksgiving, when many stores aggressively offered discounts, retailers ''never regained the momentum.'' 
 Though final results for the holidays will not be available for several weeks, analysts and retail executives are projecting a respectable but not stunning season. November and December sales are estimated to grow 6 percent over a year earlier, compared with 6.7 percent in 2004. 
 In what many viewed as an encouraging sign, the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, stood by its sales forecast for December, projecting a gain of 2 percent to 4 percent. 
 The chain, which stumbled last holiday, has performed strongly this year, in part, analysts said, because higher energy prices have shoppers looking for bargains.
 Yesterday, Amazon.com reported a record holiday season, with 108 million orders, capping a strong holiday for Web retailers. 
 Millions of unspent gift cards could prove to be another boon to retailers, and stores rushed out new merchandise yesterday to entice those shoppers, because most retailers do not count the money on the cards as sales until it is spent. 
 ''Redemption days are going to be very important this year,'' said Michael P. Niemira, head economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, who described the season so far as ''O.K.''
 But crowds remained relatively thin at many stores yesterday -- an employee at a Lowe's in Atlanta called it ''a normal day'' -- and analysts agreed that, to a greater degree than any year in recent memory, the fate of the season would rest on the post-holiday spending of shoppers like Robert Ragusano, who was shopping yesterday in Walnut Creek, Calif., 25 miles east of San Francisco. Mr. Ragusano bought a sports jacket, spending all of a $300 Nordstrom gift card from his wife, Penny. 
 In anticipation of discounts, the couple arrived at the store before 8 a.m., also buying a $150 shirt (for Penny) and $400 suit and jacket (for their son). 
 ''We don't shop for some things before Christmas,'' Mr. Ragusano, 38, said. ''We get up the next morning and go spend.''
 Procrastination was to be expected this season. Compared with 2004, there were extra days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and Hanukkah fell two weeks later than last year. 
 At 5 p.m. on Christmas Eve, the parking lot outside a Wal-Mart in Hamden, Conn., was full. Inside, a traffic jam of another sort formed in the toy department, where parents grabbed at mini-Cadillac Escalades and Dora the Explorer inflatable puppet theaters. 
 ''I guess everyone forgot it was Christmas until today,'' said Sylvia Barnes, 31, who held a shopping list with 17 names on it. The last entry: herself.
 Wayne and Linda Woodruff, residents of Washington who traveled to New York for the holidays, waited until Christmas Eve to buy their grandchildren a stuffed Elmo doll and two Fisher-Price toy trucks at the Toys ''R'' Us in Times Square. ''This is really last minute,'' Mrs. Woodruff, 54, confessed. 
 Theresa Burkhart, 31, cut it even closer, buying her boyfriend a $300 DVD burner at a Best Buy in Midtown Manhattan at noon on Saturday. 
 The size of the gift, she said, made up for the tardiness. ''It's better to get one big gift than lots of little ones,'' she said. 
 In something of a reversal, discount retailers appeared headed for one of their strongest holidays in years, while upscale retailers, which have seemed invulnerable for the last two seasons, appeared to falter, if only slightly.
 Nordstrom and Saks missed forecasts for November, with analysts speculating that the wealthy had found little to excite them and therefore opted for expensive trips over expensive fashions. 
 The New York transit strike lasted three days last week, with full service resuming on Friday. That only deepened worries for Saks, which relies on its Fifth Avenue store for 10 percent of its annual sales. By Saturday afternoon, the Manhattan store appeared to be in post-Christmas clearance mode, with $850 Jimmy Choo handbags marked down 40 percent.
 Mason Sexton, a 58-year-old investment banker, did his part for the luxury retailer, filling four of the store's black-and-white shopping bags with a silk bathrobe, a designer belt, a polo shirt and cashmere sweater on Dec. 24. 
 He did this all, he boasted, in under three hours, allowing him to ''get home in time for the Giants-Redskins game.''
 Gail Lavielle, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said the chain had seen a surge of business on Friday and Saturday, as men circled the perfume and jewelry counters. A consumer survey, performed by Wal-Mart, found that a third of shoppers had ''left spouses until the end,'' Ms. Lavielle said. 
 Despite the disappointing crowds yesterday, retailers and their trade groups noted that the season was not quite over. 
 ''I am not buying into ho-hum theory yet,'' Scott Krugman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, said. ''This week is going to be very telling.''

HEADLINE: Below a Mountain of Wealth, a River of Waste

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and RAYMOND BONNER; Evelyn Rusli contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
The closest most people will ever get to remote Papua, or the operations of Freeport-McMoRan, is a computer tour using Google Earth to swoop down over the rain forests and glacier-capped mountains where the American company mines the world's largest gold reserve. 
 With a few taps on a keyboard, satellite images quickly reveal the deepening spiral that Freeport has bored out of its Grasberg mine as it pursues a virtually bottomless store of gold hidden inside. They also show a spreading soot-colored bruise of almost a billion tons of mine waste that the New Orleans-based company has dumped directly into a jungle river of what had been one of the world's last untouched landscapes.
What is far harder to discern is the intricate web of political and military ties that have helped shield Freeport from the rising pressures that other gold miners have faced to clean up their practices. Only lightly touched by a scant regulatory regime, and cloaked in the protection of the military, Freeport has managed to maintain a nearly impenetrable redoubt on the easternmost Indonesian province as it taps one of the country's richest assets. 
 Months of investigation by The New York Times revealed a level of contacts and financial support to the military not fully disclosed by Freeport, despite years of requests by shareholders concerned about potential violations of American laws and the company's relations with a military whose human rights record is so blighted that the United States severed ties for a dozen years until November.
 Company records obtained by The Times show that from 1998 through 2004, Freeport gave military and police generals, colonels, majors and captains, and military units, nearly $20 million. Individual commanders received tens of thousands of dollars, in one case up to $150,000, according to the documents. They were provided by an individual close to Freeport and confirmed as authentic by current and former employees. 
 Freeport said in a written response to The Times that it had ''taken appropriate steps'' in accordance with American and Indonesian laws to provide a secure working environment for its more than 18,000 employees and contract workers. 
 ''There is no alternative to our reliance on the Indonesian military and police in this regard,'' the company said. ''The need for this security, the support provided for such security, and the procedures governing such support, as well as decisions regarding our relationships with the Indonesian government and its security institutions, are ordinary business activities.''
 While mining and natural resource companies sometimes contribute to the costs to foreign governments in securing their operations, payments to individual officers raise questions of bribes, said several people interviewed by The Times, including a former Indonesian attorney general, who said it was illegal under Indonesian law for officers to accept direct payments. 
 The Times's investigation also found that, according to one current and two former company officials who helped set up a covert program, Freeport intercepted e-mail messages to spy on its environmental opponents. Freeport declined to comment.
 More than 30 current and former Freeport employees and consultants were interviewed over the past several months for this article. Very few would speak for attribution, saying they feared the company's retribution. 
 Freeport's support of the military is one measure of its extraordinary working environment. In the 1960's, when Freeport entered Papua, its explorers were among the very first outsiders ever encountered by local tribesmen swathed only in penis gourds and armed with bows and arrows.
 Since then, Freeport has built what amounts to an entirely new society and economy, all of its own making. Where nary a road existed, Freeport, with the help of the San Francisco-based construction company Bechtel, built virtually every stitch of infrastructure over impossible terrain in engineering feats that it boasts are unparalleled on the planet. 
 That history, Papua's extreme remoteness and the company's long ties to the Indonesian government have given Freeport exceptional sway over a 21st-century version of the old company town, built on a scale unique even by the standards of modern mega-mining. 
 ''If any operation like this was put forward now, it wouldn't be allowed,'' said Witoro Soelarno, a senior investigator at the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, who has visited the mine many times. ''But now the operation exists, and many people depend on it.'' 
 For years, to secure Freeport's domain, James R. Moffett, a Louisiana-born geologist who is the company chairman, assiduously courted Indonesia's longtime dictator, President Suharto, and his cronies, having Freeport pay for their vacations and some of their children's college education, and cutting them in on deals that made them rich, current and former employees said. 
 It was a marriage of mutual convenience. As Freeport prospered into a company with $2.3 billion in revenues, it also became among the biggest -- in some years the biggest -- source of revenue for the government. It remains so. 
 Freeport says that it provided Indonesia with $33 billion in direct and indirect benefits from 1992 to 2004, almost 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product. With gold prices hitting a 25-year high of $540 an ounce this month, the company estimates it will pay the government $1 billion this year. 
 With Suharto's ouster in 1998, after 30 years of unchallenged power, Freeport's special place was left vulnerable. But its importance to Indonesia's treasury and its carefully cultivated cocoon of support have helped secure it against challenges from local people, environmental groups, and even the country's own Environment Ministry. 
 Letters and other documents provided to The Times by government officials showed that the Environment Ministry repeatedly warned the company since 1997 that Freeport was breaching environmental laws. They also reveal the ministry's deep frustration.
 At one point last year, a ministry scientist wrote that the mine's production was so huge, and regulatory tools so weak, that it was like ''painting on clouds'' to persuade Freeport to comply with the ministry's requests to reduce environmental damage.
 That frustration stems from an operation that, by Freeport's own estimates, will generate an estimated six billion tons of waste before it is through -- more than twice as much earth as was excavated for the Panama Canal. 
 Much of that waste has already been dumped in the mountains surrounding the mine or down a system of rivers that descends steeply onto the island's low-lying wetlands, close to Lorentz National Park, a pristine rain forest that has been granted special status by the United Nations. 
 A multimillion-dollar 2002 study by an American consulting company, Parametrix, paid for by Freeport and its joint venture partner, Rio Tinto, and not previously made public, noted that the rivers upstream and the wetlands inundated with waste were now ''unsuitable for aquatic life.'' The report was made available to The Times by the Environment Ministry.
 Freeport says it strives to mitigate the environmental effect of its mine, while also maximizing the benefits to its shareholders. The Times made repeated requests to Freeport and to the Indonesian government to visit the mine and its surrounding area, which requires special permission for journalists. All were turned down. 
 Freeport refused to make any official available for an interview and would respond to questions only in writing. A cover letter signed by its legal counsel, Stanley S. Arkin, said that Grasberg is a copper mine, with the gold retrieved as a byproduct, and that many journalists had visited the mine before the government tightened its rules in the 1990's. ''Freeport has nothing to hide,'' Mr. Arkin wrote. 
 Indeed, at Grasberg, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold mines the world's third-largest copper deposit. The mine also has proven reserves of 46 million ounces of gold, according to the company's 2004 annual report. This year, Mining International, a trade journal, called Freeport's gold mine the biggest in the world.

Social Tensions Erupt
 Since Suharto's ouster, Freeport employees say, Mr. Moffett's motto has been ''no tall trees,'' a call to keep as low a profile as possible, for a company that operates on an almost unimaginable scale. 
 But even before then, the new world that Freeport created was growing smaller. By the mid-1990's, with production in full swing, and the expanding impact of Grasberg's operations ever more apparent, Freeport was beset on all sides. 
 Environmental groups, able to coordinate more effectively with the Internet, made Freeport a target. Local tribes were more and more restless at seeing little benefit for themselves as vast riches were extracted from their lands. And some military commanders in Papua saw Grasberg's increasing value as ripe for the plucking. 
 To fortify itself, Freeport, working hand in hand with Indonesian military intelligence officers, began monitoring the e-mail messages and telephone conversations of its environmental opponents, said an employee who worked on the program and read the e-mail messages. 
 The company also set up its own system to intercept e-mail messages, according to former and current employees, by establishing a bogus environmental group of its own, which asked people to register online with a password. As is often the case, many who registered used the same password for their own messages, which then allowed the company to tap in. 
 Freeport's lawyers were nervous, a person who was at the company at the time said, but decided that nothing prohibited the company legally from reading e-mail messages abroad.
 Social tensions around the mine, meanwhile, were fast growing, as was Papua's population. Papua, mostly animist and Christian after long years of missionary work, is distinct in many ways from the rest of Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country. 
 Almost from Indonesia's independence, the province had rumblings of a separatist movement. Throughout Indonesia the military, a deeply nationalist institution, finances itself by setting up legal enterprises like shopping centers and hotels, or illicit ones, like logging. In Papua, the Grasberg mine became a chance for the military not only to profit but also to deepen its presence in a province where it had barely a toehold before Freeport arrived. 
 For many years Freeport maintained its own security force, while the Indonesian military battled a weak, low-level insurgency. But slowly their security needs became entwined.
 ''Where Freeport really took it on the chin is the military who came in had no vehicles, and they would commandeer a Freeport bus or a Freeport driver,'' said the Rev. David B. Lowry, an Episcopalminister hired by Mr. Moffett to oversee social programs. ''We had no policies at that time.''
 No investigation directly linked Freeport to human rights violations, but increasingly Papuans associated it with the abuses of Indonesian military units, in some cases using company facilities. 
 An Australian anthropologist, Chris Ballard, who worked for Freeport, and Abigail Abrash, an American human rights campaigner, estimated that 160 people had been killed by the military between 1975 and 1997 in the mine area and its surroundings. 
 Finally, in March 1996, long-simmering anger at the company erupted in rioting when anti-mine sentiment among different groups coalesced into what was perhaps the biggest threat to the company to this day. 
 The mine and its mill were shut down for three days. Rioters destroyed $3 million of equipment and ransacked offices. 
 The company intercepted e-mail messages that, according to two persons who read them at the time, suggested that certain military units, the community and environmental groups were working together.
 One e-mail exchange, between a community leader and the head of an environmental group, was filled with tactical military intelligence, according to a person who read the messages. In another exchange, an environmental leader urged the group's members to pull out because the demonstrations had turned violent.
 Freeport told The Times that local leaders later met with company officials and said ''they had provoked the disturbances as a means of expressing their aspiration to receive greater benefits from our operations.''
 In recent interviews, current and former Freeport officials recalled how they were stunned when, among those rioting, they saw men with military haircuts, combat boots and walkie-talkies. They seemed to be directing the rioters, at one point, to a Freeport laboratory, which they ransacked. 
 It was not long before a worried Mr. Moffett flew out to Indonesia in the company jet. 
 Freeport refused to comment on the meeting that followed. But a company official who was there recounted that Mr. Moffett met with a group of senior Indonesian military officers at the Sheraton Hotel in the lowland town of Timika, near the mine. The all-powerful Gen. Prabowo Subianto, son-in-law of President Suharto and commander of the Indonesian Special Forces, presided. 
 ''Mr. Moffett, to protect you, to protect your company, you have to help the military here,'' General Prabowo began, according to the company employee who was present. 
 Mr. Moffett is said to have replied: ''Just tell me what I need to do.'' 

The Cost of Security
 Each military service drew up its wish list, current and former company employees said. 
 In short order, Freeport spent $35 million on military infrastructure -- barracks, headquarters, mess halls, roads -- and it also gave the commanders 70 Land Rovers and Land Cruisers, which were replaced every few years. Everybody got something, even the Navy and Air Force.
 The company had already hired a former C.I.A. operative, and on his recommendation, it now approached a military attache at the American Embassy in Jakarta, and persuaded him to join the company, according to former and current employees. Two more former American military officers were hired, and a special department, called the Emergency Planning Operation, was set up to handle the company's new relationship with the Indonesian military.
 The new department began making direct monthly payments to Indonesian military commanders, while the Security Risk Management office handled the payments to the police, according to company documents and current and former employees.
 ''They signed a pact with the devil,'' said an American who was part of Freeport's security operations at the time, and who agreed with the company's decision.
 Freeport gave the military and the police in Papua at least $20 million from 1998 to May 2004, according to company documents. In interviews, current and former employees said that at least an additional $10 million was also paid during those years. 
 Seven years of accounting records were provided to The Times by an individual close to the company. Additional records for three years were provided by Global Witness, a nongovernment organization, which released a report last July, ''Paying for Protection,'' about Freeport's relations with the Indonesian military. 
 Diarmid O'Sullivan, who works for Global Witness in London, criticized the payments. It may be necessary for a company to help governments with security, he said, but ''they should give the money through the proper channels, in a transparent way.'' 
 Freeport told The Times, ''Our books and records are transparent and accurately reflect the support that we provide.'' 
 That support, the company said in its responses, included ''mitigating living costs,'' as well as ''infrastructure, catered food and dining hall costs, housing, fuel, travel, vehicle repairs, allowances to cover incidental and administrative costs, and community assistance programs conducted by the military and police.'' 
 The company said all of its expenditures were subject to a budget review process.
 The records received by The Times showed payments to individual military officers listed under things like ''food cost,'' ''administrative services'' and ''monthly supplement.'' 
 Current and former employees said the accounting categories did not reflect what the money was actually used for, and that it was likely that much of the money went into the officers' pockets. The commanders who received the money did not have to sign receipts, current and former employees said.
 Asked if there was a reason Freeport would give money directly to military officers, Father Lowry, who retired in March 2004, but remained a consultant to Freeport until June, said, ''I can't think of a good one.''
 The records show that the largest recipient was the commander of the troops in the Freeport area, Lt. Col. Togap F. Gultom. 
 During six months in 2001, he was given just under $100,000 for ''food costs,'' according to the company records, and more than $150,000 the following year. Freeport gave at least 10 other commanders a total of more than $350,000 for ''food costs'' in 2002, according to the records. 
 Colonel Gultom declined to be interviewed.
 Those payments were made to individual officers, current and former employees said, even though since the riots Freeport had allowed soldiers to eat in the company's mess and had trucked food to more distant military kitchens. ''Three meals a day, seven days a week,'' a former official said. 
 Freeport also gave commanders commercial airplane tickets for themselves and their wives and children. Generals flew first or business class and lower ranking officers flew economy, said Brig. Gen. Ramizan Tarigan, who received $14,000 worth of tickets in 2002 for himself and his family. 
 General Tarigan, who held a senior police post, said that police officers were allowed to accept airplane tickets because their pay was so low -- as a general, his base salary was roughly $400 a month -- but that it was in violation of police regulations to receive cash payments.
 In April 2002, the company gave the senior commander of forces in Papua, Maj. Gen. Mahidin Simbolon, more than $64,000, for what was described in Freeport's books as ''fund for military project plan 2002.'' Eight months later, in December, he was given more than $67,000 for a ''humanitarian civic action project.'' The payments were first reported by Global Witness. 
 General Simbolon, who is now inspector general of the Indonesian Army, declined requests to be interviewed. 
 A former Freeport employee who was involved in making those payments said the company could not be certain how much of the money General Simbolon actually spent on those projects. 

Unsolved Killings
 By 2003, following the Enron scandal and passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposed more rigid accounting practices on companies, Freeport began making payments to military and police units instead of individual officers, according to records and current and former employees. 
 The company paid police units in Papua slightly under $1 million in 2003, according to the records, listed under items like ''monthly supplement payment,'' ''administrative costs'' and ''administrative support.'' 
 Freeport told The Times that ''company policies take into account the potential for human rights abuses in determining what types of assistance to provide.''
 According to the records received by The Times, the police Mobile Brigade, a paramilitary force often cited by the State Department for its brutality, received more than $200,000 in 2003. 
 In its 2003 annual human rights report, the State Department said soldiers from the Mobile Brigade ''continued to commit numerous serious human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, and arbitrary detention.'' It cited no specific incidents from Papua. 
 There was another reason for extra care by the company. 
 In August 2002, three teachers employed by Freeport, including two Americans, were killed in an ambush on a company road patrolled by the military that Freeport had paid to protect its employees. Three years later, the F.B.I. is still investigating and the reasons for the killings have not been determined. Freeport said that it could not comment on the investigation. 
 The United States indicted a Papuan, Anthonius Wamang, in 2004. But it has yet to receive the full cooperation of the military, several American officials said. 
 Freeport employees and American officials said the killings could have been part of a turf war between the military and the police, each of which wanted access to Freeport payments.
 An initial report by the Indonesian police pointed to the Indonesia military, and some Freeport and Bush administration officials have said they suspect some level of military involvement. 
 The police report suggested that the motivation was that Freeport was threatening to cut its support to soldiers. Soldiers assigned to Papua have ''high expectations,'' the report said, but recently, ''their perks, such as vehicles, telephones, etc., were reduced.'' 

Questions of Accountability
 Freeport has resisted nearly any detailed disclosure of its payments to the military, saying they are legal and even required under Indonesian law. 
 Marsillam Simanjuntak, who was minister of justice and later attorney general in one of the first governments after the fall of President Suharto, said it was a violation of Indonesian law for soldiers or police officers to accept payments from a company. ''Of course, it's illegal,'' he said.
 But many companies do it, he said. The better question to ask, he said, was, ''Is it allowed by the laws of the United States?'' 
 This year, the New York City pension funds submitted a shareholder resolution asking Freeport to review its policy on paying the police and military. They argued that it could violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids American companies from paying bribes to foreign officials. Freeport opposed the resolution.
 In 2002, the funds submitted a similar resolution demanding that Freeport disclose how much it was paying to the military. Freeport kept it off the ballot. 
 In later filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Freeport reported that it had paid the military a total of $4.7 million in 2001, and $5.6 million in 2002. The company did not indicate whether the money was paid into commanders' personal accounts, or what the money was used for. 
 Freeport, in its responses, said it was complying with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, a set of guidelines drawn up by the State Department. They recognize that natural resource companies ''may be required or expected to contribute to, or otherwise reimburse, the costs of protecting company facilities.'' 
 The principles do not address the question of direct payments to individual officers. Nor do they require companies to account for the payments.
 Freeport has also said that the payments were required under its Contract of Work, its basic agreement with the government of Indonesia, first signed in 1967 and updated in 1991. 
 The company declined to provide a copy of the contracts to The Times. A copy of each was provided by Denise Leith, author of ''The Politics of Power: Freeport in Suharto's Indonesia.'' They contained no language requiring payments to the military. 
 S. Prakash Sethi, head of the International Center for Corporate Accountability, which recently concluded a report on Freeport's development policies in Papua, said that the company had told him that it made ''in-kind'' contributions to the military, for housing and food, but that he had not been given access to accounting records.
 Any direct payments to military officers would be illegal, said Mr. Sethi, an expert on business ethics and corporate social responsibility and a professor at Baruch College. ''It's corruption,'' he said. ''It's bribery.'' 

Mine Waste in the Rivers
 All the while Freeport sealed its relations with the military, the country's fledgling environment ministry could do little but watch as waste from the mine piled up. 
 This year Freeport told the Indonesian government that the waste rock in the highlands, 900 feet deep in places, now covers about three square miles. 
 Down below, nearly 90 square miles of wetlands, once one of the richest freshwater habitats in the world, are virtually buried in mine waste, called tailings, with levels of copper and sediment so high that almost all fish have disappeared, according to environment ministry documents. 
 The waste, the consistency and color of wet cement, belts down the rivers, and inundates and smothers all in its path, said Russell Dodt, an Australian civil engineer who managed the waste on the wetlands for 10 years until 2004 for Freeport. 
 About a third of the waste has moved into the coastal estuary, an essential breeding ground for fish, and much of that ''was ripped out to sea by the falling tide that acted like a big vacuum cleaner,'' he said. 
 But no government, even in Indonesia's new democratic era, has dared encroach on Freeport's prerogatives. The strongest challenge came in 2000, when a feisty politician, Sonny Keraf, who was sympathetic to the Papuans, was appointed environment minister. 
 Again, Mr. Moffett flew out to Jakarta. 
 Mr. Keraf initially refused to see the Freeport boss, but eventually agreed, and on the day kept him waiting for an hour and a half. ''He came in so arrogant,'' Mr. Keraf recalled of the meeting in a recent interview, ''sitting with his legs crossed.'' 
 Freeport refused to comment on the meeting. The American ambassador to Indonesia at the time, Robert Gelbard, said in an interview: ''It was a terrible meeting.''
 Mr. Keraf said that Mr. Moffett had said that his company had never polluted. ''I told him that he should spend the money he spent on paying off people not to talk about the mine to properly dispose of the waste,'' Mr. Keraf said. 
 Behind the scenes, Mr. Keraf kept up the pressure, angered that the company was using the rivers, forest and wetlands for its mine waste, a process allowed during the Suharto years. 
 An internal ministry memorandum from 2000 said the mine waste had killed all life in the rivers, and said that this violated the criminal section of the 1997 environmental law.
 In January 2001, Mr. Keraf wrote to the coordinating minister for economic affairs, arguing that Freeport should be forced to pay compensation for the rivers, forests and fish that its operations had destroyed.
 Six months later, one of his deputies, Masnellyarti Hilman, wrote to Freeport, saying a special environmental commission had recommended that the company stop using the river as a waste chute, and instead build a system of pipes. 
 She also told Freeport to build sturdier dam-like walls to replace the less solid levees that it used to contain the waste on the wetlands. That practice has continued. 
 Freeport says that local and regional governments have approved its waste management plans, and that the central government has approved its environmental impact statement and other monitoring plans.
 But in a blistering July 2001 letter, Mr. Keraf took the governor of Papua to task for granting Freeport a permit in 1996 to use the rivers for its waste. The governor, Mr. Keraf said, had no authority to grant permits more lenient than the provisions of national laws. 
 Despite all these efforts, nothing happened. Mr. Keraf was unable to secure the support of other government agencies or his superiors in the cabinet. 
 In August 2001, a new government came to power, and a less aggressive minister, Nabiel Makarim, replaced Mr. Keraf. At first, he, too, talked publicly of setting stricter limits on Freeport. Soon his efforts petered out. 
 The Environment Ministry has begun trying to put teeth into its rules where it can. It brought a criminal suit against the world's largest gold company, Newmont Mining Corporation, for alleged pollution, including a charge of not having a permit for disposing of mine waste into the sea. Newmont has fought the charges vigorously. 
 But in the case of Freeport, the ministry has had no traction. Freeport still does not hold a permit from the national government to dispose of mine waste, as required by the 1999 hazardous waste regulations, according to Rasio Ridho Sani, assistant deputy for toxic waste management at the ministry. Mr. Arkin, Freeport's counsel, said that the company cooperated well with the environment ministry and that Freeport would not otherwise comment. 
 ''Freeport says their waste is not hazardous waste,'' Mr. Rasio said. ''We cannot say it is not hazardous waste.'' He said his division and Freeport were now in negotiations on how to resolve the permit question.

'A Massive Die-Off'
 The environment ministry was not the first to challenge Freeport over how it has disposed of its waste in Papua. 
 The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a United States government agency that insures American corporations for political risk in uncertain corners of the world, revoked Freeport's insurance policy in October 1995. 
 It was a landmark decision, the first time that the agency had cut off insurance to any American company for environmental or human rights concerns. 
 In doing so, two environmental experts, Harvey Himberg, an official at the agency, and David Nelson, a consultant, after visiting the mine for several days, issued a report critical of Freeport's operations, especially the huge amounts of waste it had sent into rivers, something that would not be allowed in the United States. 
 The company went to court to block the report from being made public, and only a redacted version was later released. A person who thought it should be made public provided an uncensored copy to The Times. 
 Freeport says the report reached ''inaccurate conclusions.'' The company says it has considered a full range of alternatives for managing and disposing of its waste, instead of using the river, and settled on the best one. 
 A storage area would not be large enough and would require a tall dam in a region of heavy rainfalls and earthquakes, it said. A waste pipeline, rather than the river, would be too costly, prone to landslides and floods. 
 To the American auditors, such arguments were not convincing. 
 Freeport ''characterizes engineered alternatives as having the highest potential for catastrophic failure when the project otherwise takes credit for legendary feats,'' the audit noted, like the pipelines more than 60 miles long down the mountains to carry fuel and copper and gold slurry. 
 At the time, the waste was jumping the riverbanks, ''resulting in a massive die-off of vegetation,'' the report said. 
 The company threatened to take the agency to court over the cancellation of its insurance. After protracted negotiations, the policy was reinstated for a few months, as a face-saving gesture to Mr. Moffett, according to the head of the agency then, Ruth Harkin. It was not renewed. 
 Today, many of the same problems persist, but on a much larger scale. A perpetual worry is where to put all the mine's waste -- accumulating at a rate of some 700,000 tons a day. 
 The danger is that the waste rock atop the mountain will trickle out acids into the honeycomb of caverns and caves beneath the mine in a wet climate that gets up to 12 feet of rain a year, say environmental experts who have worked at the mine. 
 Stuart Miller, an Australian geochemist who manages Freeport's waste rock, said at a mining conference in 2003 that the first acid runoffs began in 1993. 
 The company can curb much of it today, he said, by blending in the mountain's abundant limestone with the potentially acid producing rock, which is also plentiful. Freeport also says that the company collects the acid runoff and neutralizes it. 
 But before 2004, the report obtained by The Times by Parametrix, the consulting company who did the study for Freeport, said that the mine had ''an excess of acid-generating material.''
 A geologist who worked at the mine, who declined to be identified because of fear of jeopardizing future employment, said acids were already flowing into the groundwater. Bright green-colored springs could be seen spouting several miles away, he said, a tell-tale sign that the acids had leached out copper. ''That meant the acid water traveled a long way,'' he said. 
 Freeport says that the springs are ''located several miles from our operations in the Lorentz World Heritage site and are not associated with our operations.''
 The geologist agreed that the springs probably were in the Lorentz park, and said this showed that acids and copper from the mine were affecting the park, considered a world treasure for its ecological diversity.
 In the lowlands, the levees needed to contain the waste will eventually reach more than 70 feet high in some places, the company says.
 Freeport says that the tailings are not toxic and that the river it uses for its waste meets Indonesian and American drinking water standards for dissolved metals. The coastal estuary, it says, is a ''functioning ecosystem.''
 The Parametrix report shows copper levels in surface waters high enough to kill sensitive aquatic life in a short time, said Ann Maest, a geochemist who consults on mining issues. The report showed that nearly half of the sediment samples in parts of the coastal estuary were toxic to the sensitive aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, she said. 
 The amount of sediment presents another problem. Too many suspended solids in water can smother aquatic life. Indonesian law says they should not exceed 400 milligrams per liter. 
 Freeport's waste contained 37,500 milligrams as the river entered the lowlands, according to an environment ministry's field report in 2004, and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea. 
 Freeport would not comment on the measurements. The company says it spent $30 million on environmental programs in 2004, and planted 50,000 mangrove seedlings last year as part of its reclamation efforts. It says cash crops can be grown on the waste with the addition of nutrients, and has begun demonstration projects. 

An Uneasy Coexistence
 If the accumulating waste is the despair of critics, for Freeport it signals expanding production. To keep its mine running, the company has increasingly had to play caretaker for the world that it has created. 
 After the 1996 riots, Freeport began dedicating 1 percent of revenues annually to a development fund for Papua to pay for schools, medical services, roads -- whatever the people wanted.
 The company built clinics and two hospitals. Other services include programs to control malaria and AIDS and a ''recognition'' fund for the Kamoro and Amungme tribes of several million dollars which, among other things, gives them shares in the company as part of a compensation package for the lands Freeport is using. 
 By the end of 2004, Freeport had spent $152 million on the community development fund, the company said. 
 Mr. Sethi, of the Center for Corporate Accountability, commended Freeport for commissioning the report on the company's development programs, saying that it was the first mining company to do so. 
 The report, which was released in October, concluded that the company had successfully introduced a human rights training program for its employees and had doubled the number of Papuan employees by 2001. The company was poised to double the number of Papuans in the work force again by 2006, the audit said. 
 Still, Thom Beanal, the Amungme tribal leader, says the combined weight of the Indonesian government and Freeport has left his people in bad shape. Yes, he said, the company had provided electricity, schools and hospitals, but the infrastructure was built mainly for the benefit of Freeport. 
 Mr. Beanal, 57, a vocal supporter of independence for Papua, has fought the company from outside and inside. In 2000, he decided that harmony was the better path, and joined the company's advisory board. 
 In November, he and other Amungme and Komoro tribesmen met with Mr. Moffett at the Sheraton Hotel in Timika. In an interview in Jakarta not long afterward, Mr. Beanal said he told Mr. Moffett that the flood of money from the community fund was ruining people's lives. 
 When the company arrived, he noted, there were several hundred people in the lowland village of Timika. Now it is home to more than 100,000 in a Wild West atmosphere of too much alcohol, shootouts between soldiers and the police, AIDS and prostitution, protected by the military. 
 Still more soldiers are on the way. Having negotiated an end to a separatist insurrection this year in another province, Aceh, the government is redeploying soldiers to Papua in a move to defeat the growing enthusiasm for independence, once and for all, and to watch over the province with the world's biggest gold mine. Freeport says its gold ore has 35 years to go.
 Mr. Beanal said he was increasingly impatient with the presence of the soldiers and the mine. ''We never feel secure there,'' he said. ''What are they guarding? We don't know. Ask Moffett, it's his company.''

HEADLINE: Ghana's Uneasy Embrace of Slavery's Diaspora 

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: CAPE COAST, Ghana 

 BODY:
For centuries, Africans walked through the infamous ''door of no return'' at Cape Coast castle directly into slave ships, never to set foot in their homelands again. These days, the portal of this massive fort so central to one of history's greatest crimes has a new name, hung on a sign leading back in from the roaring Atlantic Ocean: ''The door of return.'' 
 Ghana, through whose ports millions of Africans passed on their way to plantations in the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean, wants its descendants to come back.
Taking Israel as its model, Ghana hopes to persuade the descendants of enslaved Africans to think of Africa as their homeland -- to visit, invest, send their children to be educated and even retire here. 
 ''We want Africans everywhere, no matter where they live or how they got there, to see Ghana as their gateway home,'' J. Otanka Obetsebi-Lamptey, the tourism minister, said on a recent day. ''We hope we can help bring the African family back together again.''
 In many ways it is a quixotic goal. Ghana is doing well by West African standards -- with steady economic growth, a stable, democratic government and broad support from the West, making it a favored place for wealthy countries to give aid. 
 But it remains a very poor, struggling country where a third of the population lives on less than a dollar a day, life expectancy tops out at 59 and basic services like electricity and water are sometimes scarce. 
 Nevertheless, thousands of African-Americans already live here at least part of the year, said Valerie Papaya Mann, president of the African American Association of Ghana. 
 To encourage still more to come, or at least visit, Ghana plans to offer a special lifetime visa for members of the diaspora and will relax citizenship requirements so that descendants of slaves can receive Ghanaian passports. The government is also starting an advertising campaign to persuade Ghanaians to treat African-Americans more like long-lost relatives than as rich tourists. That is harder than it sounds. 
 Many African-Americans who visit Africa are unsettled to find that Africans treat them -- even refer to them -- the same way as white tourists. The term ''obruni,'' or ''white foreigner,'' is applied regardless of skin color. 
 To African-Americans who come here seeking their roots, the term is a sign of the chasm between Africans and African-Americans. Though they share a legacy, they experience it entirely differently.
 ''It is a shock for any black person to be called white,'' said Ms. Mann, who moved here two years ago. ''But it is really tough to hear it when you come with your heart to seek your roots in Africa.'' 
 The advertising campaign urges Ghanaians to drop ''obruni'' in favor of ''akwaaba anyemi,'' a slightly awkward phrase fashioned from two tribal languages meaning ''welcome, sister or brother.'' As part of the effort to reconnect with the diaspora, Ghana plans to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., W. E. B. DuBois and others it calls modern-day Josephs, after the biblical figure who rose from slavery to save his people. 
 The government plans to hold a huge event in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the end of the trans-Atlantic trade by Britain and the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence. The ceremonies will include traditional African burial rituals for the millions who died as a result of slavery.
 Estimates of the trade vary widely. The most reliable suggest that between 12 million and 25 million people living in the vast lands between present-day Senegal and Angola were caught up, and as many as half died en route to the Americas. 
 Some perished on the long march from the inland villages where they were captured to seaports. Others died in the dungeons of slave castles and forts, where they were sometimes kept for months, until enough were gathered to pack the hold of a ship. Still others died in the middle passage, the longest leg of the triangular journey between Europe, Africa and the Americas. Of the estimated 11 million who crossed the sea, most went to South America and the Caribbean. About 500,000 are believed to have ended up in the United States. 
 The mass deportations and the divisions the slave trade wrought are wounds from which Africa still struggles to recover. 
 Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African nation to shake off its colonial rulers, winning its independence from Britain in 1957. Its founding father, Kwame Nkrumah, attended Lincoln University, a historically black college in Pennsylvania, and saw in African-Americans a key to developing the new nation. 
 ''Nkrumah saw the American Negro as the vanguard of the African people,'' said Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African and African-American studies department at Harvard, who first traveled to Ghana when he was 20 and fresh out of Harvard, afire with Nkrumah's spirit. ''He wanted to be able to utilize the services and skills of African-Americans as Ghana made the transition from colonialism to independence.''
 Many African-Americans, from Maya Angelou to Malcolm X, visited Ghana in the 1950's and 60's, and a handful stayed. To Nkrumah, the struggle for civil rights in the diaspora and the struggles for independence from colonial rule in Africa were inextricably linked, both being expressions of the desire of black people everywhere to regain their freedom. 
 But Nkrumah was ousted in a coup in 1966, and by then Pan-Africanism had already given way to nationalism and cold war politics, sending much of the continent down a trail of autocracy, civil war and heartbreak. 
 Still, African-Americans are drawn to Ghana's rich culture, and the history of slavery. 
 Ghana still has dozens of slave forts, each a chilling reminder of the brutality of the trade. At Elmina Castle, built by the Portuguese in 1482 and taken over by the Dutch 150 years later, visitors are guided through a Christian chapel built adjacent to the hall where slaves were auctioned, and the balcony over the women's dungeons from which the fort's governor would choose a concubine from the chattel below. 
 The room through which slaves passed into waiting ships is the emotional climax of the tour, a suffocating dungeon dimly lit by sunlight pouring through a narrow portal leading to the churning sea. 
 ''You feel our history here,'' said Dianne Mark, an administrator at Central Michigan University who visited Elmina Castle, six miles from Cape Coast castle, in early December, tears welling in her eyes as she gazed across the massive, buttressed walls to the ocean. ''This is where our people are from. That is a deep, deep experience. I look at everyone and wonder, 'Could he have been my cousin? Could she have been my aunt?' ''
 Like any family reunion, this one is layered with joy and tears. For African-Americans and others in the African diaspora, there is lingering hostility and confusion about the role Africans played in the slave trade. 
 ''The myth was our African ancestors were out on a walk one day and some bad white dude threw a net over them,'' Mr. Gates said. ''But that wasn't the way it happened. It wouldn't have been possible without the help of Africans.''
 Many Africans, meanwhile, often fail to see any connection at all between them and African-Americans, or feel African-Americans are better off for having been taken to the United States. Many Africans strive to emigrate; for the past 15 years, the number of Africans moving to the United States has surpassed estimates of the number forced there during any of the peak years of the slave trade. The number of immigrants from Ghana in the United States is larger than that of any other African country except Nigeria, according to the 2000 census.
 ''So many Africans want to go to America, so they can't understand why Americans would want to come here,'' said Philip Amoa-Mensah, a guide at Elmina Castle. ''Maybe Ghanaians think they are lucky to be from America, even though their ancestors went through so much pain.'' 
 The relationship is clearly a work in progress. Ghanaians are still learning of their ancestors' pivotal roles in the slave trade, and slave forts on the coast, long used to thousands of foreign visitors, have in recent years become sites for school field trips. 
 When the United States and the United Nations gave Ghana money to rehabilitate and restore Cape Coast castle, the government agency responsible for the castle repainted it white. Residents of Cape Coast were thrilled to see the moisture-blackened castle spruced up, but African-Americans living in Ghana were horrified, feeling that the history of their ancestors was being, quite literally, whitewashed. 
 ''It didn't go over too well,'' said Kohain Nathanyah Halevi, an African-American who lives near Cape Coast. 
 A recent African-American visitor to Cape Coast castle took the emotionally charged step through the door of no return, only to be greeted by a pair of toddlers playing in a fishing boat on the other side, pointing and shouting, ''obruni, obruni!'' 
 William Kwaku Moses, 71, a retired security guard who sells shells to tourists on the other side of the door of no return, shushed the children. 
 ''We are trying,'' he said, with a shrug.

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Tuesday about an effort by the government of Ghana to persuade black Americans to visit, invest and retire there misstated the undergraduate university attended by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the African and African American studies department at Harvard, who first visited Ghana when he was 20 years old. It was Yale, not Harvard.

 BODY:
As director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Holtz-Eakin has been Congress's top economist, handpicked by the Republican leadership. Recently, he had some advice for lawmakers -- mostly Republicans -- who insist that more tax cuts will foster economic growth and raise tax revenue: ''Don't even think about it.'' 
 The occasion was the release of the agency's long-term outlook, which shows huge unending deficits. ''You can't grow yourself out of this problem,'' said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. ''It's just too big.''
 That's startlingly straight talk, given that Republicans are determined to pass tens of billions in unpaid-for tax cuts come January. But it is typical of Mr. Holtz-Eakin, who is retiring this week after three years as the director. In those years, he has delivered nonpartisan, data-driven research on some of the most controversial issues.
Often, what Mr. Holtz-Eakin said wasn't what his bosses wanted to hear. He went on record in 2003 saying that President Bush's tax and spending plans would do little or nothing for long-term economic growth. One report issued under his leadership showed that Mr. Bush's tax cuts heavily favored the wealthiest Americans. Another debunked the politically potent but false contention that the estate tax hurts farmers. 
 By going where the facts and figures led, Mr. Holtz-Eakin also protected his agency, which may be the last bastion of neutral government analysis in Washington. To succeed him, Congressional leaders need a top economist who has a reputation to protect and is a superb number cruncher, fluent communicator of complex issues and good manager.
 That is a lot to ask. But, after all, they picked Mr. Holtz-Eakin in 2003.

HEADLINE: After Withdrawal, Engagement

BYLINE: By Andrew Erdmann. 
Andrew Erdmann was the senior advisor to the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in 2003 and director for Iran, Iraq and Strategic Planning at the National Security Council from 2003 to 2005.

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
ELECTING a Parliament under the new permanent Constitution was a significant achievement for the Iraqi people, who once again faced down terrorist violence and political intimidation to demonstrate their desire for a democratic future. For better or worse, in the election's aftermath, the United States will almost certainly begin to withdraw its military from Iraq in 2006. But that does not mean that the time has come to disengage. On the contrary, a broader, more diverse engagement with Iraqi society is needed to help Iraqis develop the institutions, practices and values essential to real and enduring democracy. 
 As President Bush emphasized in his second inaugural address, change of this sort -- from tyranny to democracy -- is a generational challenge. Our strategy in Iraq must be generational as well. We should reorient our efforts and reallocate some of our resources as our military presence scales down. The needs of Iraqi civic institutions, from the news media and universities to professional associations and nongovernmental organizations, are both vast and urgent. While the National Endowment for Democracy, the United States Agency for International Development and others have done important work to bolster such groups, overall, American efforts have so far been inadequate. 
Higher education is a case in point. In a country whose median age is about 19.5 years, universities play a crucial role in shaping public opinion and producing future leaders. Today's Iraqi political parties, like the Baath party before them, understand this -- so much so that Iraq's universities have become battlegrounds, with dozens of students and educators killed. Iraq's elite tends to emerge from the country's most competitive academic programs, including those for medicine, engineering and science. That the first two prime ministers of postwar Iraq, Ayad Allawi and Ibrahim al-Jafaari, were trained as doctors is no accident. 
 But after decades of neglect, brain drain and sanctions, Iraq's universities and colleges are unable to train sufficient numbers of professors or schoolteachers to educate the next generation. Today, Iraq's 20 public universities and more than 40 technical colleges and institutes struggle to educate more than 250,000 students annually. Hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to build the system back up to where it was before Saddam Hussein took power; billions will be needed to meet today's regional standard, set by countries like Qatar.
 How can we help build a better Iraq unless we focus on its vast population of young people, whose views of their country and its politics have yet to harden into dogma? But despite higher education's strategic importance, American support for it has been paltry. From 2003 to 2005, a United States Agency for International Development program allocated $20 million to building partnerships between American and Iraqi universities. That program ended without a successor; no agency funds are allocated for Iraqi higher education for 2006. The American Embassy in Baghdad backed the founding of an American University in Iraq in Sulaimaniya, but future support is uncertain. 
 The State Department offers Fulbright scholarships to about 30 Iraqis annually to study at universities in the United States. But these concentrate on the humanities and social sciences, rather than the scientific and technical disciplines that attract Iraq's best and brightest. With few exceptions, American educational institutions have not tried to fill this gap.
 The costs being equal, which is the better investment in Iraq's future: some 250 annual scholarships for future Iraqi leaders to study in the United States, or another fighter jet? We can greatly expand our efforts to reach out to Iraqi elites across the board, from ministry technocrats to journalists to doctors. Conferences and seminars, often in the region, have begun to reconnect Iraqis to the outside world. We can find other ways to bypass the current security situation by dramatically increasing our investment in communications technology like the Internet (including access to seemingly mundane but critical resources, like online journal databases) and video conferencing. 
 We should expand ''train and equip'' programs for Iraqi editors, journalists, and publishers. We should also increase financing for the National Endowment for Democracy, the United States Institute of Peace and other organizations that are helping Iraqis build and sustain civic institutions. Such investments cannot be postponed and must not be considered merely ''supplemental.'' We need to lock them into our budgets today.
 But the United States government should not carry the load alone. Americans of all types -- including educators, management consultants and municipal officials -- can contribute and need to step forward. More organizations should follow the lead of Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution, which works with civic leaders in regions of Iraq that are relatively peaceful. American trade unions, professional associations, educational institutions, journalists, students, human rights activists, scientists and business executives should establish ties with their Iraqi counterparts. 
 So far, many Americans who opposed the war have not extended a helping hand to the Iraqi people in its aftermath. Others sit on the fence. With elections under a new Constitution, the time has come to focus on Iraq's future and put aside the politics of the past.
 A strategy that emphasizes building Iraqi civil society may clear the way for bipartisan cooperation, as well as for more international participation. To be sure, if the United States does not do the heavy lifting, the lifting will not get done. Many partners have already paid heavily for their engagement in Iraq. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is virtually tapped out in Afghanistan. Germany, France and others face domestic challenges. Nonetheless, persuading the Germans, for example, to train 100 Iraqis as vocational educators would be infinitely easier than trying to convince them to put one military trainer on the ground. 
 To many ears, it sounds unrealistic, even idealistic, to say that we should begin concentrating our efforts on improving Iraq's civic life at its grassroots. But such a strategy is a realistic response to the challenges we and our Iraqi allies face, as well as a hedge against possible reversals.
 Those in office under the new Constitution will almost certainly seek to advance their own interests -- personal, party, sectarian, ethnic, tribal -- just as their predecessors in the transitional government did. Some tactics will be savage. Powerful militias will continue to stoke fear. Islamists will try to silence secular voices. Sunni extremists will mount attacks, and the attacks will provoke retaliation. Having seen the evidence of death squads and new torture chambers, we should be under no illusions about the dark possibilities of the coming era. Some leaders will try to make their power permanent. Should we expect otherwise, where the political stakes are still often life and death? 
 While we work with the party leaders of today, a new generation will determine what kind of country Iraq becomes. The forces we hope prevail should be the Shakespeare scholar turned newspaper editor, the architect leading an organization devoted to spreading Internet connections among students, and the independent candidate for Parliament advised by the National Democratic Institute. Promoting their success is not an ''extra,'' but is essential to long-term strategic success. 
 We must not underestimate the tenacity of the Iraqi people or lose sight of the lessons of history. Photocopiers, after all, became samizdat weapons against Soviet tyranny. American unions assisted their brethren behind the Iron Curtain in becoming independent forces for change. A once jailed playwright eventually led the Czech Republic. Serbian youth groups galvanized the peaceful uprising that toppled Slobodan Milosevic. Videos of that success inspired activists in Ukraine and elsewhere. And leaders of Georgia's Rose Revolution were once Muskie fellows in the United States.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has correctly emphasized that the political transition process in Iraq will not be a ''straight line.'' It will be long, difficult, and bloody. It will be uncertain. There will be more setbacks, even if the insurgency is checked. But our current predicament in Iraq centers on the question not of when to withdraw, but of how to broaden and deepen our engagement.

U.S. Military in Iraq Says Ethnic Balance Is a Must
Preliminary voting results from the Dec. 15 parliamentary election suggest that despite greater numbers participating, the Sunnis still have little representation in the Iraqi security forces. American military commanders believe an Iraqi Army that is representative of Iraq's ethnicity is crucial. Otherwise, there is a risk of Shiite and Kurdish forces attempting to pacify insurgent hotbeds dominated by Sunni Arab militants on their own. A1

HEADLINE: Aware of Political Ecosystem, Property Rights Advocate Embraces Conservation Plan 

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: LIBERTY HILL, Tex. 

 BODY:
Young cedar trees in the Texas Hill Country are obstructionist, brambly knots of vegetation. Older ones guzzle scarce moisture. When they are really mature, the golden-cheeked warbler, a songbird in danger of extinction, sometimes moves in. 
 So imagine the reaction in these precincts when, in the early 1990's, the Interior Department set out to protect the warbler by buying -- or condemning -- cedar-covered land. There were protests on the Capitol steps in Austin. One rancher took a bulldozer to his cedar trees. Others indicated they would tie the project up in court battles. The effort stalled.
 Over a decade later, in a cultural and political turnabout, people like Kerry Russell, a lawyer, rancher and lifelong resident of the area, have largely bought into a conservation program that combines federal and state incentives with flexibility for landowners, who can participate by committing land to conservation purposes forever, or for as little as 10 years. 
 Part of the payoff is that they are shielded in those years from unilateral conservation actions by government, a provision that gave the program the name ''Safe Harbor.'' 
 ''If you sign up to restore or enhance the habitat for a certain number of years, after that time you won't be held to'' the obligations any further, Mr. Russell said. He has committed to preserve and tend 150 acres of cedar groves on his property for the migratory warblers forever.
 Mr. Russell, like his fellow Republican Bob Long, a rancher a few counties away, is a familiar public face of the program in Texas. The state has been a focal point of safe harbor initiatives, and the Austin office of Environmental Defense has been in the forefront of putting together safe harbor agreements. Like personal shoppers, their representatives go out into departments of state and local governments and come back with a wardrobe of easements, grants and other arrangements to encourage land uses that help endangered birds, toads or insects. The ranchers choose the ones that fit best; the environmental advocates handle the red tape.
 Brandishing a walking stick and accompanied by his wife, Lee, Mr. Russell took two visitors through the cedar groves, pointing out the ideal spots for songbird nests with all the enthusiasm of a park ranger.
 But this third-generation Hill Country resident also understands the political ecosystem. ''The old folks around here don't want the feds to have their land,'' he said. There was ''a basic distrust of the federal government, a Texas kind of distrust: They are taking our land from us.''
 When his land was threatened with condemnation for a refuge for the warbler and the endangered black-capped vireo, Mr. Russell said he pointed out that local residents were not favorably disposed to federal biologists.
 And, he recalled with a grin, he said that if he went to court over the government's proposed price for the land, ''the judge and jury are going to be my kinfolk.'' But when a representative of Environmental Defense offered to broker benefits for him, including almost $1,800 an acre -- or about $250,000 -- for the perpetual set-aside for the warbler, his attitude changed.
 ''The reason we're strong property rights advocates is we want to preserve the land,'' Mr. Russell said. As for the money, he said, ''It's a benefit to me, and I'm mercenary in that respect, but at the same time this is a benefit to everyone else.'' 
 David Wolfe, the senior scientist in the Austin office of Environmental Defense, said of Mr. Russell: ''He's an excellent representative of the whole shift around here. He does have a strong property right ethic and certainly doesn't want anyone telling him what to do with his land.'' 
 But, Mr. Wolfe added, the shift in attitude paralleled a shift in economics. ''The historical ranching and grazing economy has been going away,'' he said. Landowners are looking for other ways to make money. One possibility, he said, is leasing the land to hunters. Another is making it ready for nature tourism by conserving the ecosystem.
 The safe harbor programs are widely acknowledged as one of the most successful blends of public and private initiatives to further conservation. They mimic the pollution credit trading programs that cut the amount of acid rain falling on New England. 
 Because the Endangered Species Act primarily regulates activities on federal land, the cooperative programs involving private land have filled in a gap in species protection. In states like Texas, where almost all the land is private, the voluntary trade-offs have been crucial.
 Despite the agreement that these efforts, often called ''cooperative conservation,'' have had significant success, there is far less agreement on the reason for it.
 Some conservatives say that the inducements -- tax credits, payments for easements and other government benefits -- are the essential element, turning the government from a sheriff into a partner. On the liberal side, some environmental groups believe that the incentives are important, but so is regulation. And they fear that, in the name of cooperative conservation, crucial regulatory safeguards will be abandoned.
 Legislation introduced this month by Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, and Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, crystallizes these disagreements.
 The measure includes a sliding scale of tax credits to landowners. The longer land is removed from commercial use, the greater the benefits offered. It also sets up a ''conservation bank,'' allowing landowners to put aside credits for setting aside land for endangered species, which could offset habitat destruction elsewhere.
 ''Collaboration and incentives offered to property owners will be a faster route to recovery'' than court battles, Mr. Crapo said in a news release.
 But John Kostyack, senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation, said in a statement that the legislation was disappointing. ''The bill would offer tax credits for mere compliance with the law,'' Mr. Kostyack said. 
 The National Audubon Society also weighed in against the measure, saying in a statement, ''It would make it harder to protect the very habitat endangered and threatened species need to live by creating new incentives for development.''
 And some property rights groups, like the National Center for Public Policy Research, based in Washington, oppose the measure because too much regulation remains. ''Cooperative doesn't mean voluntary,'' said Peyton Knight, the group's director of environment and regulatory affairs. ''It does not help if I'm saying, 'Cooperate or else.' ''
 If passed by the Senate, the bill could be married to legislation passed in the House and sponsored by Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of California, who has made pruning the regulatory impact of the Endangered Species Act a top priority.
 In Liberty Hill, Mr. Russell watches the developments in Washington through a lawyer's eye. He has taken the view that an endangered species law with reduced regulatory authority will work against conservation. ''There's a huge chance for abuse'' in incentive programs, he said. 
 If the only tool for conservation is regulation -- which he calls the ''command and control'' approach -- ''you impose a structure that doesn't work,'' Mr. Russell said. But, he added, ''You have to have some command and control because a huge multinational corporation isn't going to do something because it's right. They'll do what's good for the bottom line.''
 The approach that he and conservation groups like Environmental Defense have taken was a radical innovation 10 years ago. ''We were the first,'' he said. ''We were the exception. Now we're the rule. And it happened much faster than we ever thought.''

HEADLINE: No Left Turn

BYLINE: By Alvaro Vargas Llosa. 
Alvaro Vargas Llosa, the director of the Center on Global Prosperity at the Independent Institute, is the author of ''Liberty for Latin America.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN 1781, an Aymara Indian, Tupac Katari, led an uprising against Spanish rule in Bolivia and lay siege to La Paz. He was captured and killed by having his limbs tied to four horses that pulled in opposite directions. Before dying, he prophesied, ''I will come back as millions.'' To judge by the overwhelming victory of Evo Morales, an Aymara, in Bolivia's elections on Dec. 18, he kept his promise.
 Mr. Morales's election has been interpreted as confirmation that South America is moving left. Mr. Morales does not hide his admiration for Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez, and his proposals include the nationalization of the oil industry, the redistribution of some privately owned estates and the decriminalization of coca plantations in the Chapare region. He opposes the Free Trade Area of the Americas and blasts ''neoliberalism.'' 
It would be a mistake, however, to think that Mr. Morales will become another Hugo Chavez even if that is his wish. The new Bolivian president will not have the resources that Venezuela commands and his popular base is shakier. Moreover, Brazil has an important presence in Bolivia and will be in a position to exercise a moderating influence.
 Unlike Venezuela, where skyrocketing oil prices brought Mr. Chavez a windfall that allowed him to build a strong social network based on patronage, Bolivia has little revenue. The only reason its fiscal account is not showing a $1 billion deficit is foreign aid, mainly from the United States. Because Mr. Morales's followers toppled the two previous presidents and forced the authorities to impose heavy royalties on multinational companies exploiting natural gas, foreign investment has dried up: only $84 million worth of investment came into the country this year. 
 And the possibility of suddenly turning Bolivia's natural gas reserves (potentially a whopping 52 trillion cubic feet) into an exporting bonanza has been precluded by the cancellation of a project that sought to export natural gas to Mexico and California through Chilean ports. (Bolivia and Chile have been at odds since the late 19th century, when Bolivia lost its access to the sea to Chile in the War of the Pacific.)
 Bolivia's indigenous population, which wants results quickly, may also hold Mr. Morales in check. His party, Movement Toward Socialism, is a loose amalgam of competing social groups. If Mr. Morales tries to concentrate power, he will need a sturdy, permanent base of support that is by no means guaranteed. Furthermore, the residents of many provinces, especially in the east, are agitating for local autonomy and have warned that they will resist attempts to centralize even more power in La Paz. 
 Bolivia has had left-wing governments before that were toppled by the same people who made them possible. President Carlos Mesa, who replaced Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in 2003 after violent demonstrations, had the support of the population when he reneged on natural gas contracts with foreign investors and led a virulent campaign against Chile. Yet the masses still turned against him, forcing his resignation in June. 
 Finally, Brazil's pragmatic president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, could also constrain Mr. Morales's ambitions. Brazil is now effectively Bolivia's only foreign investor, and its role is likely to grow even more crucial, because Mr. Morales promises to nationalize the subsoil and keep the high royalties on oil and natural gas exploitation that have kept out investors from other countries. Bolivia therefore will need Petrobras, the Brazilian energy giant, to expand its investments. Mr. da Silva has not been able to rein in Mr. Chavez, but he will have leverage over the more vulnerable Mr. Morales.
 Of course, whether Mr. Morales will draw closer to Mr. Chavez will in part depend on American policy toward Bolivia. And that, in turn, will depend on whether Mr. Morales decriminalizes coca growing. If he does so, the United States should not overreact, because nothing much will change. Even with the restrictions that are in place now, there are already as many plantations in Chapare as the demand for coca -- and Bolivia's capacity to make cocaine from it -- warrant. In any case, cocaine production and distribution will still be banned in Bolivia, Mr. Morales says. If Washington were to respond to coca decriminalization by hindering Bolivia's exports of clothing and jewelry to the United States, tens of thousands of families in El Alto, one of Mr. Morales's indigenous power bases, would lose their source of income, and anti-American sentiment would pull Mr. Morales leftward.
 Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, recently told me that the United States aims to eliminate its remaining protectionist measures (which hamper some South American economies by restricting United States imports of their goods). Few Latin Americans have heard about this endeavor. If the goal is to promote development and foster good relations across the hemisphere, eliminating protectionist policies will be far more effective than making coca plantations the paramount issue in Bolivia-United States relations. Fractious politics and ethnic tensions already make for a delicate situation in the Andes. Let's not make it worse.

Tail-End of Holiday Weekend Brings Thinner-Than-Expected Crowds to Stores
Retailers hoping for a big finish to the holiday season instead found lighter-than-expected crowds over the long Christmas weekend, according to early and anecdotal reports, leaving stores to rely heavily on the next few days to pump up sales. [Page C1.] 


Like the yule log, fruitcake and Christmas caroling, the holiday ritual of returning unwanted gifts continues to slip away. [C2.]

Michigan's Governor Turns to Toyota
In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades. But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state. Ms. Granholm, having landed a $150 million Toyota design center earlier this year, now has her eyes on a potentially bigger prize: an engine plant that Toyota may build in the Midwest. [C1.]

Some United Automobile Workers members want a recount of a vote that narrowly approved an agreement between Ford Motor and the union, requiring workers and retirees to pay more for their health care. [C6.]

Tough Decisions Ahead on Pentagon Spending
As the Pentagon's budget faces tightening, it is redefining the strategic threats facing the United States and looking at weapons that are more high-tech, flexible and innovative. One big question, analysts say, is whether the Pentagon and Congress will be able to kill weapons programs where hundreds of billions of dollars -- as well as the careers of powerful generals and admirals -- are invested. [C1.]

As Winter Olympics Approach, So Do Endorsements
Michelle Kwan has never won an Olympic gold medal. But that has not stopped her from grabbing several long-term commercial endorsement deals that typically only go to those athletes who bring home the gold. As Ms. Kwan gears up for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy -- the last chance for the 25-year-old figure skater -- she has already lined up major deals with Coca- Coca-Cola, Visa and East West Bank. But the choice of Ms. Kwan is unusual. For most athletes, a winning performance at the Olympics is essential -- turning gold into big money. [C1.]

Russia's Gazprom Wields New Influence
Gazprom is aspiring to join the ranks of energy majors like Exxon Mobil and BP, with the scope and bulk to operate worldwide. It is also a powerful instrument of Russia's emerging foreign policy doctrine, which rests on energy exports -- and the power and prestige they bring -- in place of lost military might. An effort to overhaul Gazprom is spurred, analysts say, by a growing stake in the company among the Moscow elite, who have invested heavily in Gazprom stock. President Vladimir V. Putin, above, installed new management at the company, including Aleksei Miller, the chief executive, and as chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, who is also a deputy prime minister. [C1.]

Internet Is a Boon to Independent Music Companies
Exploiting online message boards, music blogs and social networks, independent music companies are making big advances at the expense of the four global music conglomerates, whose business model of blockbuster hits promoted through radio airplay now looks increasingly outdated. [E1.]

European Regulators Crack Down on Cartels
Across Europe, formerly docile cartel authorities are cracking down on collusion in economically weighty sectors like telecommunications, construction and banking. The drive includes tougher national and continental investigations as well as fines that are nearing 1 billion euros. [C3.]

Estonia Aims to Become a Global Shipping Lure
Tiit Vahi, a former Estonian prime minister, wants to transform a place once nicknamed Uranium Lake into a bustling commercial port, with the aim of allowing Estonia to shake up European trade. [C3.]

Influx of Immigrants Causes Concern in Ireland
An outpouring of support for more than 500 unionized workers of Irish Ferries, who will be replaced by new workers, mainly from Latvia, who will work for less than half Ireland's minimum wage, is raising questions about whether the tolerance for globalization that helped bolster the Irish economy is waning. [C4.]

Many Markets Closed; Asian Stocks Show Gains
Asian stocks rose for a seventh day yesterday. Exporters including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Samsung Electronics gained after a United States report showed consumer confidence had the largest jump in almost two years. Markets in the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Singapore were closed for public holidays. [C7.]

Business Travelers Expect More Woes in 2006
After surviving a year of airline bankruptcies, overcrowded flights, hidden hotel fees and indifferent service, business travelers might be wondering if 2006 could get any worse. The answer is, yes, it could. Itineraries. [C5.]

Japan Retailer to Buy Department Stores Group
Seven & I Holdings Company, the Japanese retailer, said that it would take over Millennium Retailing, the Japanese department store group, in a deal worth as much as $2.15 billion. [C4.]

HEADLINE: Looking to Toyota For a Helping Hand

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
In another era, Jennifer M. Granholm's courtship of Toyota would have been considered heresy for the governor of Michigan, where American automakers and their suppliers fueled the economic engine for decades.
 But with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company cutting thousands of jobs, closing plants and eliminating benefits for the shrinking number of workers still employed, the governor is vowing to ''go anywhere, do anything'' to find investment for her state.
And while the governor agrees that the state's monolithic economy has to be moved away from its dependence on manufacturing and toward high-tech industries, short term there is little she can do -- or wants to do -- to escape the auto industry's clutches. 
 While the pursuit of Toyota may strike some as desperate, it reflects her determination to draw an ace for the hand Michigan has been dealt. In July, she went to Toyota's offices in Nagoya, Japan, to promote sites in Michigan that could be home to a Toyota plant. She talked about the state's ample supply of skilled workers who have automotive experience and who would not need the degree of training that their counterparts at other Toyota plants in the United States have required. 
 Ms. Granholm, having landed a $150 million Toyota design center earlier this year, now has her eyes on a potentially bigger prize: an engine plant that Toyota may build in the Midwest.
 ''We want to make sure they know how welcome they would be here,'' she said in an interview last week in Michigan.
 In an earlier era, Toyota might never have considered Michigan, where the United Automobile Workers union is such a powerful force. Nor would it have needed to, given its freedom to choose among union-averse areas nationwide. 
 But with Toyota on the verge of becoming the world's biggest carmaker, possibly eclipsing G.M. as soon as next year, a Michigan plant would take it to the center of the American automotive heartland. Last week, Toyota officials in the United States and Japan finally said they were giving serious thought to building a factory in Michigan, although a decision is still months away. Such is the new reality of Detroit, where what once seemed out of the question is now up for discussion. 
 And Ms. Granholm, the state's Democratic governor, acknowledges that. ''We've got to transform Michigan. Change is imperative,'' the governor said in an interview last week.
 ''A Toyota plant in Michigan would be a very clear signal that this is the future,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 If anyone had any doubts about the impact of the auto industry's decline on Michigan, a report from the University of Michigan issued last fall put it bluntly. ''Michigan's old manufacturing economy is dying, slowly but surely,'' declared the report, prepared by the Millennium Project at the university and called ''A Roadmap to Michigan's Future.'' The economic shifts are ''putting at risk the welfare of millions of citizens of our state in the face of withering competition from an emerging global knowledge economy.''
 But while her long-term goal is to diversify the state's economy and lessen its dependence on the auto industry, Ms. Granholm's immediate priority is to make sure car companies still provide jobs here.
 Toyota has spent $16.3 billion during the last 20 years putting its North American plants in places like Ontario, Mexico, Alabama and Indiana, but never in the nation's automotive capital, where the U.A.W. is dominant. That trend initially caused some to view the governor's tactic as a Hail Mary pass. But her efforts now have a chance of bearing fruit. 
 ''If we do a new plant, we would consider Michigan, along with other states,'' Dennis C. Cuneo, a senior vice president at Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America, said in an interview last week.
 In some ways, a favorable decision would be a sign of continued cooperation with the governor, who came through for Toyota earlier this year when it was trying to acquire land to expand its technical center in Ann Arbor, about 45 miles from Detroit. Another developer seeking the same 600 acres in York Township offered a higher price than Toyota, but the governor prevailed when a court supported the state's decision to make the land available to Toyota.
 Then the State Legislature passed an incentive package for Toyota worth $50 million, including tax credits -- small change as far as such deals can go, but enough to impress Toyota officials that Ms. Granholm truly wanted them in her state.
 ''She really stuck her neck out for us politically, and we appreciated it,'' said Mr. Cuneo, who will play an important role in deciding whether Toyota will choose Michigan as the site for its engine plant.
 But before that happens, Ms. Granholm must deal with a more immediate issue: persuading Ford Motor to spare its big luxury-car plant in Wixom, outside Detroit, which is on a list of plants that Ford may close when it announces an overhaul plan on Jan. 23. 
 The state is also bracing for a plant-closing announcement by the Delphi Corporation, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in October. One of Delphi's targets could be a big parts plant in Flint, a community already devastated by years of shutdowns.
 Ms. Granholm's primary tactic is to persuade companies to consolidate operations in Michigan and shut plants elsewhere. Last week, she signed legislation granting $600 million in tax cuts to manufacturers, including a 100 percent tax break for companies that bring jobs back to the state in 2007 and 2008, and a specific break for Delphi, in a move to save its Michigan jobs.
 Simply supporting manufacturing, however, would not be enough, argued the ''Roadmap'' report, which was led by James J. Duderstadt, the former president of the University of Michigan and now a professor of science and engineering there.
 The report contended that the state's future relies on improving education and providing investment for advanced technologies that can create stable, high-paying jobs. 
 Less than a quarter of Michigan residents have college degrees, the report noted, reflecting an era when workers who lacked even a high school diploma could land lucrative jobs in auto plants. ''Michigan today is sailing blindly into a profoundly different future,'' the report warned.
 Indeed, statistics paint a gloomy picture. The state's unemployment rate, 6.6 percent, is the third-highest in the country, behind the hurricane-devastated states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and it ranks dead last in economic momentum, a measure based on employment growth, personal income and population trends, according to the Citizens' Research Council. 
 Even those who still have jobs are feeling the pinch of the auto industry's decline. In the fall, workers at G.M. and Ford agreed to health care restrictions that will require them to pay modest amounts for previously free coverage. G.M., meanwhile, will no longer match worker contributions to their 401(k) plans.
 All that helps explain why Ms. Granholm, who faces re-election next November, is focusing her attention on strengthening the state's ties to Toyota, the world's most profitable auto company.
 The factory she is vying for would supply engines to a Subaru plant in Lafayette, Ind., which plans to build 100,000 cars a year for Toyota beginning in 2006. Toyota has not said how many workers its engine plant might employ, but it typically hires a few hundred people as a start.
 Still, any jobs would be significant. Toyota, which initially thought to put the plant next to a Subaru factory, has scouted possible sites in southwestern Michigan, near the Indiana border, and on the part of Interstate 94 that is opposite Detroit.
 But no matter how far the plant is from the Motor City, Toyota officials must come to terms with the influence of the U.A.W., whose president, Ron Gettelfinger, has said the plant would benefit the state.
 Organizing its work force also would benefit the union, which has failed to organize workers at any of the major factories built by foreign automakers in the United States in the last 25 years.
 Still, Toyota has dealt with the union at New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., a joint venture plant owned by G.M. and Toyota in Fremont, Calif. At the plant, known as Nummi, formerly a G.M. site, workers operate under a special contract with more flexible work rules than other U.A.W. contracts, and the plant operates under Toyota's production methods.
 Toyota can easily avoid such drama by picking another plant site. But it can score points in its drive to be seen as a good local citizen by helping a state that can meet its economic needs and arguably needs its assistance the most -- Michigan.
 ''In a simple sense, one plant doesn't mean anything,'' Professor Chaison said, ''but in a symbolic sense, it would show that there is still life in Michigan, and good jobs to be gotten.''

HEADLINE: Exporters and U.S. Report Help Asian Stocks Rise Again

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Asian stocks rose for a seventh day yesterday. Exporters including Matsushita Electric Industrial and Samsung Electronics gained after a United States report showed consumer confidence had the largest jump in almost two years. 
 ''Higher U.S. consumer confidence helps investor sentiment,'' said Park Jae Hoon, who helps oversee $800 million at Tong Yang Investment Trust Management in Seoul. ''The outlook for demand for goods at technology companies is positive.''
 Retailers in Japan climbed after Seven & I Holdings, the world's largest convenience-store operator, said it would pay as much as $2 billion to buy a controlling stake in Millennium Retailing, which runs the Seibu and Sogo department stores.
 The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index rose 0.4 percent, to 123.43. The regional index has advanced for seven consecutive days, its longest winning streak since the period ended Nov. 8. For the year, the index has gained 22 percent, set for a third annual advance.
 The Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan climbed 1 percent, to 16,107.67, its first close above 16,000 in more than five years. In South Korea, the Kospi added 0.6 percent, closing at a record. In India, the Sensitive Index dropped 1.9 percent, the biggest decline in the region.
 Indexes in Taiwan, Thailand and China also rose. Markets in the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Singapore were closed for public holidays. Japan's was closed on Dec. 22 for the emperor's birthday.
 Russian stocks rose, led by OAO Sberbank. the country's largest lender, which approached a record high on optimism that economic expansion would help bolster earnings next year.
 Matsushita Electric, the world's biggest consumer electronics maker, rose 1.1 percent, to 2,300 yen. Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest exporter, advanced 1.4 percent, to 654,000 won. LG.Philips LCD, the world's largest maker of liquid-crystal displays by shipments, gained 2.3 percent, to 42,900 won.
 In Taiwan, AU Optronics, the world's third-largest maker of flat-panel displays used in computers and televisions, added 2.4 percent, to 46.95 Taiwan dollars. In Japan, retailers had the third-biggest percentage gain among the Topix's 33 industry groups, surging 4.3 percent.

PERSON: John Diebold

HEADLINE: John Diebold, 79, a Visionary Of the Computer Age, Is Dead 

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
John Diebold, a visionary thinker whose early and persistent promotion of computers and other far-reaching innovations helped shape industrial development in America and beyond, died yesterday at his home in Bedford Hills, N.Y. He was 79.
 The cause was esophageal cancer, said his nephew, also named John Diebold.
Mr. Diebold, who held degrees in business and engineering, was an evangelist of the future. In 1952, at a time when computers weighed five tons, his book ''Automation'' described how programmable devices could change the day-to-day operations of all kinds of businesses. Even the book's title was novel: it introduced the modern-day meaning of a term that had previously applied only to the mechanical handling of automobile parts at the Ford Motor Company. 
 Mr. Diebold (pronounced DEE-bold) made a career of recognizing relevant advances in technology and explaining them to the likes of A.T. & T., Boeing, Xerox and I.B.M. Through books, speeches and his international consulting firm, Mr. Diebold persuaded major corporations to automate their assembly lines, store their records electronically and install interoffice computer networks. 
 In 1961 he and his firm, the Diebold Group, designed an electronic network to link account records at the Bowery Savings Bank in New York. Rather than being updated after hours, the records immediately reflected both deposits and withdrawals and were available to any teller. Customers could then bank at any branch and at any window. 
 Soon other New York banks hired the Diebold Group to help them install such systems, which cost more than keeping paper records but quickly became vital for modern banking. 
 Another data network eliminated much of Baylor University Hospital's paperwork in departments like accounting, inventory, payroll and purchasing. More important to Mr. Diebold, the system made medical records and statistics available to researchers in electronic form, permitting studies that were otherwise too daunting. The American Hospital Association embraced the project, and hundreds of other institutions created data systems modeled on it. 
 ''Today's machines, even more than the devices of the industrial revolution, are creating a whole new environment for mankind and a whole new way of life,'' he told The New York Times in 1965. ''Today's machines deal with the very core of human society -- with information and its communication and use.''
 Many of his most ambitious proposals seemed to lead nowhere, but they often planted ideas that came to fruition years or even decades later. In 1968, 10 years before interstate ATM networks, he advised several Chase Manhattan Bank executives of the costs and benefits of a national system for electronic funds transfer. His audience included Paul Volcker, the future Federal Reserve chairman. What is more, innovations that he presented to newspaper executives in 1963, including an ''input keyboard'' and ''editing consoles'' to replace typewriters and carbon paper, became widespread only in the 1980's. 
 ''John Diebold's credentials as a prophet of high technology are impeccable,'' wrote Robert Lekachman, the economist, in a 1984 book review of one of Mr. Diebold's 12 books, including nine volumes of his speeches and scholarly articles. 
 Mr. Diebold came to believe that computers and other information technologies could reshape society, and he guided dozens of municipalities and foreign countries in using them to manage the budget (Venezuela), to compile government data (Indonesia) and to streamline public services like fire protection (Savannah, Ga.) and the distribution of welfare (California).
 He envisioned a utopia built on technological progress, complete with cars that diagnose their own problems and refrigerators that know to order groceries. He described his greatest hopes in 1987 in a series of published letters to his daughter Emma, then 2. By 2010, he wrote, defensive technologies will render nuclear weapons powerless and human tissue farms will grow replacement organs, while AIDS and heart disease will all but disappear. 
 In addition to Emma, who lives in Bedford Hills, Mr. Diebold is survived by his wife, Vanessa; a daughter, Joan, of Quincy, Mass.; and a son, John, of Bedford Hills. His marriage to the former Doris Hackett ended in divorce. 
 John Theurer Diebold (he later dropped the middle name) was born on June 8, 1926, in Weehawken, N.J., and received a bachelor's degree from Swarthmore College and a master's degree from Harvard Business School.
 He also had an engineering degree, and became interested in automation after observing the mechanized antiaircraft controls on a ship doing convoy duty in World War II. 
 In addition to the Diebold Group, he started John Diebold Inc., an investment firm, in 1967. It financed such ventures as a computer leasing company and a well-known manufacturer of polling machines. 
 After selling the Diebold Group in 1991 to Daimler-Benz, Mr. Diebold focused on the Diebold Institute for Public Policy Studies, a research group he founded in 1968 to promote broad, technology-based reforms.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 16, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Dec. 27 about John Diebold, a businessman and engineer who helped shape modern industrial development in America, misstated a business venture of John Diebold Inc., an investment firm he founded in 1967. It did not finance Diebold Election Systems, a maker of polling machines that, despite its name, has no connection to John Diebold.

HEADLINE: A Crackdown on Cartels By European Regulators

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
It was the kind of smoking gun that antitrust investigators dream of: a note, handwritten by the president of France Telecom, the largest French cellphone operator, describing plans to carve up the market the same way wartime leaders carved up the Continent in 1945.
 ''Unjustifiable,'' the French Competition Council ruled this month. The regulator fined France Telecom and two other operators a record sum -- more than 500 million euros, or $600 million -- after sifting through the evidence gathered during raids at the offices of some of the most senior French executives.
Across Europe, formerly docile cartel authorities are cracking down on collusion in economically weighty sectors like telecommunications, construction and banking. The drive includes tougher national and Europewide investigations as well as fines that are nearing a billion euros.
 The drive does not include -- at least not yet -- jail time for executives, something lawyers and officials say would be the most successful deterrent to price-fixing. 
 Even so, the authorities are startling price-fixers with dawn raids, developing a flair for publicizing wrongdoing by executives at prominent companies and enhancing the status of their agencies by imposing big fines.
 ''Cartels are 'flavor of the year' pretty much around the world in terms of the way agencies deploy their resources,'' said Terry Calvani, the former chief cartel enforcer at the Irish Competition Authority.
 Cartel authorities are turning into ''revenue generators from revenue users, returning a fair amount of money to the Exchequer,'' said Mr. Calvani, now a partner with the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Washington.
 The action against telecommunications operators in France mirrors similarly aggressive activities in Germany, Italy and Britain. The upswing comes as the European Commission gives more leeway to local authorities. With an enlarged European Union of 25 countries, the commission formally jettisoned some of its antitrust responsibilities last year, leaving it to national authorities to monitor their own markets while the European Union concentrates on catching bigger fish operating across national borders.
 Another factor behind the change, said Julian Joshua, a former top cartel enforcer at the commission, is pressure from Washington to stamp out overseas cartels that damage United States interests. Most European policy makers agree that curbing cartels improves economic performance, even if ''a gulf of incomprehension still separates countries in Europe that see price-fixing as an economic peccadillo from those like the United States, which see it as out-and-out theft,'' said Mr. Joshua, a partner with the law firm Howrey in Brussels.
 Cartels represent a serious drag on global prosperity. John M. Connor, a professor at Purdue University, estimates that cartels worldwide raise prices about 25 percent. And while there are few studies on the effects of cartels on prices in Europe, one way of illustrating their effects is to study ways that government regulations raise prices. In an example publicized by the Irish Competition Authority, limits on price-cutting among retailers end up adding nearly 500 euros to household grocery bills each year.
 The French telephone case was particularly grave, French officials said, because paying for mobile calls is a new and significant expense for households. Along with France Telecom, Vivendi Universal and Bouygues paid 534 million euros, the third-highest fine ever levied in Europe. Just days before, the same officials fined the owners of some of the most famous hotels in Paris, including the Hotel de Crillon and the Hotel Ritz, more than 700,000 euros for colluding to fix the prices of rooms.
 German authorities have also cranked up the pressure. In 2003, the German cartel office fined cement makers, including HeidelbergCement, 702 million euros -- the second-highest cartel fine imposed in Europe. The European Commission still holds the record for the highest fine -- 855 million euros -- imposed in 1999 on eight chemical and pharmaceutical companies, including Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland, caught fixing the prices of vitamin additives used in everyday foods.
 A trend toward serious cartel enforcement in Europe began in the late 1940's. American officials, believing cartels to be one of the tools that allowed authoritarian governments to extend their control over production, pressed Germany after World War II to pass antitrust laws. The German competition laws passed in the 1950's formed the basis of the antitrust statutes adopted by the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the European Union.
 Even so, fines remained low in Europe. The game changed with the drift toward competitive economic thinking in the late 1980's and with efforts to create an open and prosperous single European market in the next decade. Suddenly, conspiracies were being seen as ways of fleecing consumers and producers of money that could be better used to drive spending and investment.
 Individuals like Mr. Joshua, the former cartel enforcer, also played a role. He was among the European officials who fought for the right to fine companies more than 10 percent of their sales of a particular product. During the mid-1990's, Mr. Joshua helped lead the investigation into companies that colluded to raise the price of insulated heating pipes. The Swedish-Swiss engineering company ABB paid 70 million euros, a record cartel fine at the time and a sum that represented nearly 20 percent of pipe sales.
 ''ABB was a defining moment,'' Mr. Joshua said. ''Previously we were handing out parking tickets.''
 These days, the authorities are competing to land big fines for cartels, although they shy away from imposing the maximum penalty -- 10 percent of overall worldwide sales -- for fear of bankrupting companies, hurting shareholders and fueling unemployment. Still, there is ''a contest for who can swing the biggest club'' now that evidence has become easier to obtain, said Michael Wise, a lawyer at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris.
 New rules allowing companies to inform on co-conspirators in exchange for exemptions from fines mean that whistle-blowers have been lining up to confess. Lawyers estimate that the European Commission alone is dealing with as many as 80 new cases, but they warn that officials may lack resources to investigate and decide them all -- even after farming out more responsibilities to national authorities.
 The change is all the more startling because it comes against what many critics of the European system say is an inhospitable backdrop for aggressive enforcement.
 In Europe, part of the reason that price-fixers avoid jail is that the European Commission has no authority to prosecute criminal cases, though it can impose fines directly without the need for a judge's approval and it can ask national police forces to raid executives' homes.
 But the issue is a cultural one, too.
 Even where jail is an option, courts and the authorities have shied away from using such a strong sanction. Britain, France and Ireland are among European countries that have made price-fixing a crime, but none -- not even Norway, where price-fixing has been criminal since the mid-1920's -- has sent a single executive to prison.
 Lawyers warn that a reluctance to put executives behind bars means they will confess only when they fear a crackdown or an outbreak of dissent among conspirators. Moreover, said Christopher Bright, a partner with the law firm Shearman & Sterling in London, companies usually pass on the cost of fines to consumers and shareholders.
 ''Personalizing the penalty is what would make a real difference,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Europe's Film Box Office Declined in 2005 

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
A dearth of strong local films severely dented box office revenue in most of Europe this year, with only Britain holding steady thanks to a stream of homegrown favorites like ''Pride & Prejudice'' and the latest ''Harry Potter'' movie. German film executives expect a decline of as much as 20 percent, even with end-of-year help from blockbusters like ''King Kong'' and ''The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.'' France, Spain and Italy could end the year down more than 10 percent, according to industry estimates. 
 Filmmakers and theater owners typically attribute such slumps to everything from sluggish economies to piracy to the growing trend to move new movies from the big screen to DVD, all of which are said to have contributed to the 2005 falloff. But the primary culprit cited by industry executives this year was a lack of good local films. That, coupled with a crop from Hollywood that was widely perceived as weak, created the steep decline in so many countries. 
''We won't see another year as bad as 2005 next year,'' said Frank Mackenroth, the head of media and entertainment at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hamburg, Germany. ''But in the medium term, we are set to see stagnation in Germany while we expect fairly stable growth across Western Europe.'' He said Western Europeans would spend on average 4.4 percent more every year at the box office from 2005 to 2009, though Germany is expected to lag with an average annual gain of only 0.4 percent over that span. 
 Some studio executives were unfazed by the declining attendance figures, at least publicly, saying it is a cyclical problem, not the start of a more permanent one. ''When we look at the ups and downs in the marketplace, frequently they are seasonal or product-related and reflect shifts that are all manageable,'' said James Gianopulos, co-chairman of 20th Century Fox Filmed Entertainment. He sees growth in countries including Russia and Poland, where box office revenue is expected to surge by about 20 percent in 2005 with the spread of multiplex cinemas and strong economic growth, providing consumers with more disposable income. ''The U.S. is roughly 300 million people, and the rest of the world is 6 billion people, so when you think of the opportunity of international markets, that's the best example,'' he said, noting that about half the studio's revenue comes from outside the United States. 
 Box office revenue in the United States is expected to fall about 5.3 percent, to $8.9 billion, with admissions dropping 7.3 percent, to 1.4 billion, a third straight year of decline, according to the tracking company Exhibitor Relations. But Britain is bucking the global trend and expecting flat revenue, or perhaps even a small gain at the box office, powered by a yearlong output of local films including ''Closer,'' ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,'' ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' ''Nanny McPhee,'' ''Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit'' and ''Pride & Prejudice.'' 
 ''In the U.K., we've had a fantastic flow of local material,'' said Mark Batey, head of the UK Film Distributors' Association trade group. He added: ''In previous years, France and Germany have benefited from strong local films. This year they haven't, relatively speaking. They've had to rely on the international product flowing through, some of which has probably underperformed with audiences against expectations.'' 
 About a quarter of 2004 German box office revenue was generated by local films, led by the sci-fi comedy ''(T)Raumschiff Surprise -- Periode 1,'' with more than nine million viewers. The country's biggest domestic hit so far this year, ''Die Weisse Massai,'' the story of a Swiss woman living with a Kenyan Masai tribe, sold only a little more than two million tickets.
 ''Looking forward, we can see quite a few very hot numbers,'' said Johannes Klingsporn, chief executive of the German association of film distributors. The end of 2005 has brought more fans to theaters, which could soften the blow for Europe when the final tickets are counted, and which could be a harbinger of good things for 2006. 
 ''I think there has been a pickup in the last three months of the year, even though December is not yet done and dusted,'' said Charlotte Jones, the cinema analyst for the research company Screen Digest. ''We're still forecasting that admissions will be increasing over the longer term,'' she said. ''We feel that cinema is a cyclical market, and we think there's going to be a strong run of films into 2006.''

BRITISH AIR FIGHTS BACK -- Book a Club World business-class seat on British Airways between New York and London for, say, mid-March, and the round-trip fare is $8,824 -- about the going rate for trans-Atlantic business-class travel on most airlines. Book the same seat on British Air from Kennedy International Airport and eight other East Coast airports by Jan. 2, for travel through the end of February, and the round-trip fare is $2,798. Round-trip fares from Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Dallas and Detroit are $3,198, and from Los Angeles, Denver, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle, the fare is $3,798. Air travel specialists see the fare sales as an aggressive ploy by British Air to deflect competition from all-business-class upstarts like Eos and MAXJet, which undercut standard business-class fares. The airline is also seeking to compete against domestic carriers, who have been adding capacity on the lucrative trans-Atlantic routes, where fare sales are expected this winter. 


AIR CANADA GETS AN UPGRADE -- For years, travelers have complained about those cramped, all-economy 50-seat regional jets that airlines used on short-haul (and increasingly longer) flights. Air Canada now becomes the second North American airline to replace some regional jets with more spacious Embraer 190 aircraft, with 93 seats and two classes of cabin, one offering 38 inches of legroom and the other 33 inches. The airline, which has ordered 45 E190's, introduced its first E190 flight last week on the Ottawa-Orlando route. Last month, JetBlue Airways, which has 101 E190's, began using the aircraft, configured with 100 seats, on several domestic routes.

THE PRICE OF BETTER STATUS -- Five days till the end of the year, and you're still a little short of miles to requalify for Platinum or Gold Elite status on American Airlines? Planning an annoying last-minute run to top off the account? Well, American has a deal for you. You may be able to buy your way back into the fold without flying another mile this year. Repeating an offer it made at the end of 2004 to some elite-status members of its AAdvantage frequent-flier program, American said that for a $499 fee, current Platinum-level members who have flown at least 40,000 miles, or 48 segments, this year can requalify for Platinum in 2006 without getting on a plane. For Platinum members with fewer than 40,000 miles in 2005, requalification costs $599. Gold members with at least 20,000 miles, or 24 segments, in 2005 can requalify for $299, or $399 for those with fewer than 20,000 miles or 24 segments. On American, Platinum is the midlevel status, requiring 50,000 miles a year; gold is 25,000 miles. The top status, Executive Platinum (100,000 miles) is not included in the offer.

WINTER TRAVEL HEATING UP -- Last winter's rebound in travel will continue this winter, with Americans expected to take a record 251 million leisure and business trips in December, January and February, the Travel Industry Association of America says. Leisure travel in the period is to increase 2.4 percent, to about 202.8 million trips. Business travel is to increase about 1 percent, to about 30.5 million trips. The rest would consist of combined business and leisure trips. As for air travel in the first nine months of 2005, domestic airlines flew 500.4 million passengers, a 5.3 percent increase over the same period in 2004, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics at the Transportation Department said last week.

PERSON: Kerry Packer

HEADLINE: Kerry Packer, 68, Australia's Media Magnate

BYLINE: By JOHN SHAW

 BODY:
Kerry Packer, who became Australia's richest man by turning a magazine and television inheritance worth millions into a diverse business worth billions, died yesterday in Sydney. He was 68.
 His death was reported by his family. The Associated Press reported Mr. Packer had been plagued by ill health.
Through his company, Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd., Mr. Packer controlled Australia's most popular television network and a magazine empire, as well as having an interest in several casinos. His fortune was estimated at $5 billion. 
 There were some common points in the careers of Mr. Packer and the even richer Australian-born publisher Rupert Murdoch. Both inherited media companies. Their fathers, Sir Frank Packer and Sir Keith Murdoch, were awarded British titles for their newspaper industry achievements. Their sons multiplied their legacies into huge fortunes, sometimes as rivals, sometimes as partners.
 Unlike Mr. Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, who built that global enterprise from a single newspaper in Australia, Kerry Packer had national rather than global horizons. He once had a polo stable in Britain, made some profitable investments in the United States, employed several American executives and had a TV stake in India, but otherwise Australia was his focus.
 In the era of globalization he was an economic nationalist. One exception was his use of offshore finance havens to minimize personal taxation, a practice he defended as legitimate in the face of parliamentary and media scrutiny. This income allowed a lavish lifestyle, with personal aircraft, an oceangoing motor yacht, a private polo field and golf course, mansions and cattle ranches.
 He was often successful in lobbying Australian governments to shape media legislation to benefit his companies but was usually not able to persuade them to change laws to permit him to control newspapers as well as a TV network. 
 Eager to surpass his father's success, Mr. Packer was a tireless deal maker despite illnesses and disabilities that might have defeated others.
 He suffered poliomyelitis as a child and was afflicted by dyslexia, which limited his education at private boarding schools. Mr. Packer lost a kidney to cancer at the age of 40, and in 1990 while playing polo he suffered a heart attack. He underwent kidney and cardiac surgery in 1998, and two years later required a kidney transplant, receiving an organ donated by his pilot.
 ''We are the best of friends,'' the pilot, Nick Ross, said. Mr. Ross, a former British Royal Navy flier who piloted helicopters for Mr. Packer for more than 20 years and was a regular companion, said, ''Kerry comes across as larger than life. To some he's an ogre. The truth is that he's a very kind person who has got where he is by being tough.''
 Mr. Ross's donation led Mr. Packer to give a rare TV interview to express his gratitude. Choosing a noncommercial station rather than his own Nine Network he said: ''Imagine having a friend good enough to do that. There are so few people in the world who'd do it. It is the most precious gift anyone can give.'' 
 Mr. Packer reputedly had few close friends, and was known for a formidably competitive and abrasive personality, which he often displayed as a negotiator in business deals and in litigation.
 His biographer, Paul Barry, whose research was opposed by Mr. Packer's lawyers, wrote that some sources ''described him as the rudest and most frightening man they've ever met.''
 He was also known for generosity, however, giving employees expensive Christmas gifts and paying large bills for workers facing sickness or debt, and was considered a lavish tipper at the Las Vegas casinos and London clubs where he frequently played high-stakes games.
 His biggest winning gamble was selling his TV network for almost $500 million in 1987 and buying it back from its bankrupt owners for about $100 million in 1990.
 Mr. Packer gave no attention to the arts or education -- his personal pursuits were polo, golf and gambling -- but he donated significantly to the Australian hospitals and medical researchers he came to know in his treatments.
 Mr. Packer's bold personality and business drive apparently derived from the example of his father, whom he succeeded in 1974. 
 The elder son, Clyde, left the family company in 1972 after personal and editorial disputes with Sir Frank and settled in 1975 in Santa Barbara, Calif. He died there in 2001.
 In contrast to the mix of neglect and bullying that Kerry Packer endured from his father -- including beatings with a polo whip, which he described in a 1979 interview -- he had a warm relationship with his only son, James, who succeeded him in 2000 as head of the media and gambling companies.
 One of Mr. Packer's legacies is the revolution he brought to the British sport of cricket. In 1977-78, he thrust the game into the world of satellite TV, hiring star players away from traditional teams to play international challenge matches under lights. The cricket world condemned him at first but later adopted his changes.
 He is survived by his wife, Rosalind Weedon Packer, whom he married in 1963, his son, James, and his daughter, Gretel.

HEADLINE: Shares Plunge as Shift in Treasury Market Stirs Concern

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday as the bond market gave signals that in the past have preceded economic slowdowns. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 100 points.
 The yield curve, the spread between the yields of short-term and long-term bonds, inverted for the first time in five years. That means short-term interest rates were higher than long-term interest rates.
 Investors have been watching the yield curve closely because, in the past, inverted yield curves have preceded recessions. 
 Still, the bond market could be signaling no more than a harmless slowing in the economy, said Jon Brorson, head of growth equities at Neuberger Berman in Chicago.
 Volume in equity markets was light, exaggerating the effect. Some of the decline might also be attributed to investors' making adjustments to their portfolios before the end of the year.
 Yesterday's bond news was ''an excuse to lock in some profits on a somewhat illiquid day,'' Mr. Brorson said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 105.50 points, or 0.97 percent, to 10,777.77. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 12.12 points, or 0.96 percent, to 1,256.54, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 22.53 points, or 1 percent, to 2,226.89.
 Crude oil futures fell. A barrel of light crude was quoted at $58.16, down 27 cents, in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.341 percent, while the two-year Treasury note closed at 4.347 percent.
 Normally, lenders receive higher interest when they commit their money for a longer time. A surge in demand for short-term credit can flatten or invert the yield curve.
 The last time the yield curve was inverted was 2000, said Charles H. Blood Jr., senior financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. At the time, ''it served its classic function of a warning,'' he said.
 Investors have been watching for months as the yields on long-term and short-term debt securities grew closer. ''Although an inverted yield curve does not always imply an economic recession, it has predicted a profit recession 100 percent of the time,'' David R. Rosenberg, the North American economist for Merill Lynch, said this month.
 In company news, specialty retailers were mixed as investors waited for more details about holiday sales. Best Buy, the nation's largest consumer electronics retailer, fell 61 cents, to $43.69. Bed Bath & Beyond, the largest retailer specializing in home furnishings, rose 18 cents, to $36.72.
 Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, fell 61 cents, to $47.73, after it predicted Saturday that sales at United States open at least a year would rise 2 percent to 4 percent, in line with earlier forecasts. Amazon.com, the large online retailer, fell 66 cents, to $48.56, after its said it had its best holiday season ever, with a record number of items shipped.
 The online retailer Overstock.com fell $2.49, or 7.4 percent, to $31.15 after it said earnings would fall below earlier targets. 
 ''We've had a nice holiday season,'' Patrick Byrne, the company's chief executive, said in a statement, ''just not as nice a season as we've had in the past or as I'd hoped for.''
 Guidant, the maker of pacemakers and heart defibrillators, fell $2.29, to $64.69, after it said it received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration about its manufacturing, research and sales center in St. Paul. The company also said on Friday that its results would fall below expectations. 
 This month, Boston Scientific announced a $25 billion takeover offer for Guidant, after Johnson & Johnson lowered a previous bid for the company to $21.5 billion amid product recalls. Boston Scientific fell 77 cents, to $25.07. Johnson & Johnson fell 81 cents, to $60.30.

HEADLINE: In Russia, Pollution Is Good For Business 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 24 

 BODY:
By its own admission, Russia's electricity monopoly is the world's largest corporate producer of greenhouse gases, accounting -- by itself -- for nearly as much carbon dioxide as is emitted by Britain. 
 From smokestacks across Russia's 11 time zones, the company, Unified Energy Systems, spews out 2 percent of all human-generated carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere.
What will the utility get for being the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter? It is hoping for $1 billion. 
 It is one of the paradoxes of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change that companies in Russia and other Eastern European countries, which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases, are poised to earn hundreds of millions of dollars through trading their rights to release carbon dioxide into the air. 
 The Kyoto treaty, negotiated in 1997 and adopted by 36 industrial nations, established a mechanism aimed at finding the cheapest way to curb emissions of gases that contribute to global warming. The idea was that countries that produced more than their treaty-imposed limits could reach their goals by buying rights from producers in other countries where controlling output is easier and less expensive. 
 It is not clear how successful that approach will turn out to be. But because Russia's companies operate such outdated and inefficient equipment, they can easily and cheaply upgrade. As a result, the Kyoto process has already emerged as a potential source of earnings for the country's big energy and manufacturing companies, according to company executives and analysts. They have hired consultants, inventoried pollution sources to earn credits, and opened carbon-trading divisions. 
 Unified Energy and Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, which together release more than 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Russia, both have such trading units. 
 ''We're intensely interested in the carbon-trading market,'' Andrey V. Gorkov, the head of the carbon-trading division at Unified Energy, said earlier this month in Montreal, where he was attending the United Nations climate conference. Member countries formally approved emissions-trading rules at the meeting. 
 The protocol requires the 36 industrial nations -- with varying targets -- to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases below their 1990 levels, in the five years from 2008 to 2012. 
 For the European Union, the target is to reduce emissions to 8 percent below 1990 levels. In an indication of how robust the demand for emissions credits may be, this year the European Union is 6 percent above its 1990 levels. The United States, which generates a fifth of greenhouse gases but has not joined the Kyoto Protocol, is 19 percent above its theoretical limits. 
 Russia, in contrast, suffered an economic collapse in the 1990's, and is 43 percent below its 1990 baseline in the Kyoto agreement. In fact, Russia does not expect to reach 1990's emissions levels until around 2020 -- attesting to the severity of the economic setback from which it is still recovering. 
 At the same time, Russian industry is generally wasteful with energy, so that a few cheap upgrades go a long way to reducing emissions. Thus, with both outdated equipment and a surplus of carbon emissions, Russian companies have become attractive to European, Canadian and Japanese companies that need emissions credits. 
 The pace is increasing at Mr. Gorkov's cluttered office in Unified Energy headquarters, a drab concrete building on the outskirts of Moscow. Analysts give credit to the company's forward-looking chief executive, Anatoly B. Chubais, for recognizing the potential for profits under Kyoto. Mr. Chubais, a former deputy prime minister, had helped negotiate the pact while in government. 
 Mr. Gorkov's 16 employees at the division, which is called the Energy Carbon Fund, scan the Internet for companies or countries in need of carbon dioxide emissions credits. They also study their own company to identify areas where they can reduce pollution. The company signed its first deal in June, with the environmental protection agency of Denmark. 
 Denmark will pay an undisclosed sum for Unified Energy to replace coal-fired boilers at the Amurskaya power plant in Khabarovsk, near China in eastern Siberia, so that units will burn more efficient natural gas. It will also pay to upgrade an existing natural gas plant in the Orenburg region, in southern Russia near Kazakhstan, with a more efficient model. 
 The conversion to gas at the Amurskaya plant will cut carbon dioxide emissions by a million tons a year, according to Unified Energy. The upgrading of the natural gas generator at the Mednogorskaya power plant in Orenburg will save 210,000 tons. 
 Under the deal, the Danish government will receive 1.2 million carbon credits (one carbon credit being equal to reducing one ton of carbon dioxide), to be applied toward meeting its emissions goal in 2012.
 This fall, six other clients from Europe and Japan also lined up to buy emissions credits from Unified Energy, Mr. Gorkov said. The Toyota Corporation of Japan is co-financing studies at one plant, and may pay for upgrades, according to a Unified Energy Systems statement. 
 Gazprom, Russia's largest company, is studying ways to attract Kyoto financing to upgrade other pipelines, said Bogdan Budzulyak, director of the company's transportation and underground storage department. 
 Midsize Russian companies are also eyeing the emissions market. 
 The Arkhangelsk Pulp and Paper Mill, with revenues of about $250 million a year, has said it will monitor emissions, according to an article in the August 2005 issue of Carbon Finance, a trade publication. 
 In total, Russia could potentially reduce emissions by two billion to three billion tons of carbon dioxide by 2012, said Alexander A. Golub, a senior economist at Environmental Defense, a nonprofit group based in New York. The potential value for Russia ranges from $20 billion to $60 billion, he said. Or it could be worth nothing, if future climate talks collapse. The United States, the world's largest economy, is already sitting out the process. 
 President Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, citing the high cost to American industry. Now, without the support of the world's largest economy, there is less chance other countries will agree to extend the treaty beyond 2012. Companies must decide if it is worth investing millions of dollars to comply with an international regulatory regime that may not be enforced after 2012 -- and may collapse before then.
 ''Discussions over the future of the Kyoto Protocol are affecting our market,'' Mr. Gorkov said. 
 Even so, emissions trading has been slowed in Russia more by the sluggish pace of government bureaucracy than by uncertainty over the Kyoto Protocol. 
 The Danish deal was signed in June. It hinged on the Russian government passing a decree to endorse Kyoto trading. That was due in late November, but delayed until February, according to an e-mail message from Hans J. Eriksen, the program coordinator at the Danish environmental ministry. 
 Annie Petsonk, international counsel for Environmental Defense, said: ''This is quite a new commodity for Russia. Maybe they don't understand that Russia has tremendous potential.'' 
 Both Gazprom and Unified Energy have issued statements urging the Russian government to enforce Kyoto as quickly as possible. In the United States, in contrast, Exxon Mobil led corporate opposition to Kyoto. 
 In Russia, the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development has formed a working group to study the decree. It needs to clear various agencies and committees. Russian officials sent a letter of apology to the Danish ministry in November. 
 Meanwhile, at Unified Energy, where the order book for pollution credit projects is stacking up, Mr. Gorkov is getting impatient. ''We needed this document signed yesterday,'' he said.

HEADLINE: TRANSIT WORKERS IN DEAL TO SHARE HEALTH PLAN COST

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the transit workers' union announced a settlement yesterday in which the authority abandoned its demand for concessions on pensions and the union agreed to have all workers pay a portion of their health insurance premiums. 
 Last night the executive board of the union, Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, voted 37 to 4 to approve the tentative 37-month contract. One member abstained. The city's 33,700 subway and bus workers are expected to vote on the agreement early next month; some are expected to oppose it out of unhappiness over having to pay toward health premiums for the first time.
The agreement calls for transit workers to pay 1.5 percent of their wages toward the premiums, cutting into the raises they receive. That comes on top of the fines of slightly more than $1,000 that most transit workers face for participating in last week's illegal transit strike.
 The settlement calls for raises of 3 percent in the deal's first year, 4 percent in the second year and 3.5 percent in the third year. The subway and bus workers' current base pay averages $47,000 a year, and with overtime, their average yearly earnings total $55,000. 
 ''These were huge items for our membership,'' said Marvin W. Holland, a station cleaner and board member who voted to approve the contract. ''If it took a strike to get it, so be it. I think this is an overwhelming success.''
 The settlement is the latest chapter in a labor dispute that led to New York City's first transit shutdown in 25 years, one that prompted bitter public exchanges between political and union leaders, while hurting the city's economy.
 Bowing to the authority's wishes, the union agreed to a 37-month contract instead of a 36-month contract, making the expiration date Jan. 15, 2009, rather than Dec. 15, 2008. That move will no doubt please Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the city's retailers, because it removes the risk of a paralyzing strike at the peak of the holiday shopping season.
 Last Thursday, the authority persuaded the union to end a 60-hour strike by signaling that it would drop its demand for future workers to contribute more toward their pensions -- the issue that had caused the talks to fall apart. In exchange, the union indicated that it would agree to the concession on health care to help the authority bring its soaring benefits costs under control. The agreement on health premiums will save the authority nearly $32 million a year.
 George Perlstein, a subway road-car inspector and the sole board member who abstained, said the health care contribution would set a precedent for further increases. ''The health care contribution is going to be absolutely disastrous in the future,'' he said. ''Instead of holding our ground, we're acquiescing to the anti-labor ideology of Bloomberg, Pataki and the Republican agenda.''
 The transit agreement, coming after a fight that highlighted concerns about the rising cost of pensions for government employees, could have major implications for other public-employee unions because officials in City Hall and Albany often seek to use the transit contract as a precedent. The pact could thus influence District Council 37, the city's largest union of municipal workers, and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, whose contracts have already expired.
 The transportation authority and the union as well as much of New York will no doubt debate who won and who lost. The authority is expected to boast that it won important concessions on health insurance. The Local 100 president, Roger Toussaint, could say that he won sizable raises -- although he originally demanded raises of 8 percent a year -- and pressured the authority to abandon its demands for concessions on pensions and for treating future workers worse than current ones.
 In an appearance around 11 p.m., after the board meeting, Mr. Toussaint detailed the many benefits of the new contract, but he kept his comments brief. He thanked union members for ''their unerring support and their perseverance'' and thanked ''the riders and the working people of New York for their patience, forbearance and understanding.''
 After using harsh words to denounce the union last week, Mr. Bloomberg congratulated the union and the transportation authority last night. 
 ''This tentative contract provides the necessary cost savings and productivity to keep the M.T.A. solvent, mitigate fair increases and allow for vital investments in our transportation infrastructure,'' he said. 
 Earlier yesterday, negotiators from the union and the authority were discussing ways to sweeten the deal because of fears of widespread rank-and-file opposition. If the members vote down the settlement, it will put Mr. Toussaint and the transportation authority in a difficult position.
 One sweetener approved will provide better health coverage to retirees who are under 65 and live outside the metropolitan area. Another idea was to give the transit workers a one-time bonus, to help offset the fines from the strike. The authority rejected that idea. 
 In another sweetener that union officials said was worth tens of millions of dollars, the authority will reimburse some 16,000 transit workers for certain pension contributions they made before 2001. That year, the annual pension contribution paid by most transit workers was reduced to 2 percent from 5.3 percent.
 The settlement differs from the last offer that the authority made on Dec. 19, shortly before the strike deadline. At that time, Peter S. Kalikow, the authority's chairman, dropped his demand to increase the retirement age to 62 for future workers, from the current 55. But he added a demand that future workers contribute 6 percent of their earnings toward their pensions, up from 2 percent for current transit employees.
 In urging his union to carry out its first citywide strike since 1980, Mr. Toussaint cited that proposal as particularly objectionable. He vowed that he would never accept a contract that would ''sell out our unborn'' --one that treats future workers worse than current ones.
 But the deal announced yesterday contains a provision that he also said he strongly opposed -- health premiums for all workers.
 Throughout the negotiations, the authority's main goal was to rein in its fast-rising benefit costs. Its pension costs for transit workers jumped to $453 million this year from $145 million in 2002, while it expects its health outlays for those workers to jump to $380 million this year, from $262 million in 2002.
 Worried about a nearly $1 billion deficit forecast for 2009, the authority's chief negotiator, Gary J. Dellaverson, put concessions on pension and health benefits at the center of the authority's bargaining position. 
 But Mr. Toussaint and many transit workers insisted that there was no justification for concessions in a year when the authority enjoyed an unexpected $1 billion surplus.
 The union originally called for a far more generous pension plan, proposing that workers be eligible to retire with a pension equal to half their annual pay at age 50 after 20 years on the job. Workers now can receive such pensions at age 55, after 25 years on the job.
 The authority originally proposed a 3 percent raise in the first year and 2 percent in the second, but it later improved that offer to raises of 3 percent a year for three years. Yesterday's settlement included the same raises that the authority offered on the eve of the strike. 
 In his final prestrike offer, Mr. Kalikow agreed to make Martin Luther King's Birthday a paid holiday and to provide extra money for training. In addition, he withdrew a demand that new workers pay 1 percent of their wages toward health insurance premiums -- a provision that was revived when talks resumed.
 One union leader close to the talks said Mr. Toussaint was eager to be able to show his union's members that he delivered a better contract than the one received by 5,000 Philadelphia transit workers after their one-week strike last month. 
 The Philadelphia workers received raises of 3 percent a year for three years and their union agreed, for the first time, to have workers pay 1 percent of their wages toward their health premiums.
 Mr. Toussaint agreed to higher premiums but he can say he obtained bigger raises than the Philadelphia union received. 
 The settlement applies not only to Local 100, but also to two Amalgamated Transit Union locals that represent authority bus workers in Queens and on Staten Island. The deal also covers Local 100 members at five private bus companies the authority is taking over.
 Days before the strike began, Mr. Toussaint said he would accept raises of 6 percent a year, rather than 8 percent, but only if the authority agreed to a 25 percent cut in the number of disciplinary citations each year. Last year, supervisors issued 15,200 such citations to the union's 33,700 members. Under yesterday's settlement, the authority agreed to hire an independent consultant to help improve the disciplinary system. 
 The settlement reached last night is nearly identical to one proposed on Friday by three state mediators: Richard A. Curreri, director of conciliation at the state's Public Employment Relations Board, and two veteran mediators, Martin F. Scheinman and Alan R. Viani.
 The three mediators brokered the framework that enabled the strike to end Dec. 22, but the extent of their involvement in drafting the final settlement has not been disclosed. 
 ''We do so with some reluctance, since it is not our custom to take such a formal role in parties' negotiations,'' the mediators wrote in a statement on Friday accompanying the proposed settlement. ''In this instance, however, we firmly believe it to be in the best interests of both the parties and the public.''

DISCIPLINE AND OTHER ISSUES

Dec. 7
Several job titles would be merged; cleaners, station agents, bus maintainers and bus helpers could be asked to perform additional duties; train operator and conductor titles would be merged, but the assignments would remain separate.

Dec. 12
Same as previous, with new restrictions on sick leave unless workers reduce their use to 2002 levels.

Dec. 15
Proposal to merge job titles withdrawn. Martin Luther King's Birthday added as a paid holiday.

Dec. 19
Hire an independent consultant to help improve the disciplinary system. The union has complained that supervisors are unfair and arbitrary in issuing disciplinary citations; 15,200
 were issued in 2004. 

Dec. 27 settlement

HEADLINE: Police Forces, Their Ranks Thin, Offer Bonuses, Bounties and More 

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Among the depleted ranks of police departments throughout the country, it has come to this: desperate want ads offering signing bonuses to new recruits, and cops paying other cops to find new cops.
 It seems nobody wants to be a police officer anymore, officials say. As a result, departments are taking a page from recruiters in sports and the corporate world. Here in King County, the most populous in the Pacific Northwest, the Sheriff's Office is trying a kind of bounty hunting: any deputy who can bring in someone who eventually becomes an officer will get a bonus of 40 hours of extra vacation time, worth up to $1,300.
''This job used to be more enticing, and we didn't have to do a lot of marketing,'' said Sheriff's Deputy Jessica Cline, the chief recruiter for the King County force. ''Over time, it's become less attractive. We needed to do something.''
 But it is a competitive world out there among police recruiters. San Diego County, for instance, has already gone King County one better. ''Put a star in your future -- now offering a signing bonus of up to $5,000,'' goes the Web advertisement for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
 In a generation's time, the job of an American police officer, previously among the most sought-after by people with little college background, has become one that in many communities now goes begging. Experts find that the life has little appeal among young people, and those who might be attracted to it are frequently lured instead by aggressive counteroffers from the military. The problem is compounded by better pay at entry-level jobs in the private sector, where employment opportunities have recently brightened.
 The resulting shortage of new officers, says Elaine Deck, who tracks recruitment matters for the International Association of Chiefs of Police, is the top concern among issues facing law enforcement across the country. Nearly every police department at a recent statewide meeting in California reported being at least 10 percent short of the officers it needed. The Los Angeles Police Department has about 700 officers fewer than its full complement of 10,000, says Cmdr. Kenny Garner, who oversees recruiting there. 
 ''When I started out in the 1970's, there were lines around the block of people waiting to take the police test, and I had to sleep overnight in an elementary school to get my place,'' Commander Garner said. ''It's not an easy sell anymore.''
 Similarly, the test to join King County's ranks now draws only a small fraction of the 3,000 who used to take it.
 In the face of developments like those, police agencies have tried a variety of enticements.
 ''Walk-ins accepted for immediate testing!'' says an advertisement from the Los Angeles police force, which at one point sent recruiters to Florida to troll for prospective officers among college students lying on the beach during spring break.
 There, Fort Lauderdale's come-on for police academy prospects says ''no maximum age,'' along with ''up to five weeks' vacation.'' 
 The New York Police Department recently placed advertisements in newspapers in and around Buffalo, part of a broad sweep to find recruits in the economically depressed upstate region.
 Many cities have raised salaries well above the rate of inflation and are offering benefits like discount mortgages. Lexington, Ky., will give new officers up to $7,400 for a down payment on a home. 
 The Los Angeles police are offering $500 to any city employee who can bring in a police recruit who makes it through the academy, and another $500 if the prospect becomes a sworn officer. But the bonus, along with recruit inducements that include a retirement payment of $250,000 after 20 years in addition to a pension, has yet to turn the tide. 
 ''We're trying to cook up some other things so we can get back in the game,'' Commander Garner said, in a bow to the competition. 
 The pay in most departments remains competitive with that in other jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree. A rookie officer in Los Angeles will start at $51,000 a year -- certainly better than the starting salary for many teachers, of whom a degree is demanded. Police jobs also typically come with comfortable vacation, health care and retirement packages.
 Further, most height and weight restrictions have been thrown out at major police departments, after lawsuits challenging them on grounds of gender and race. As for strength and stamina, a recruit in King County need be able to do only 30 situps in a minute and run a mile and a half in less than 14 minutes 31 seconds. ''You don't have to be Superman,'' said Sheriff's Deputy Kurt Lange, a 14-year veteran of King County, where the vacation bonus has led deputies to start recruiting on their own, looking for friends, relatives or just casual acquaintances who might want to wear a badge.
 But whatever the attractions to the job, a powerful constraint is working against them, experts say.
 ''The people we are now trying to recruit look at life and jobs in a very different way than baby boomers do,'' said Ms. Deck, of the police chiefs association. ''People used to live to work. This younger generation works to live. Working late, working weekends, that's not attractive. They want to make money and retire early.''
 Then there is the competition from the armed services. At some military bases, commanders will not even allow police recruiters on the grounds, for fear that they will steal troops who might otherwise re-enlist, said Lt. Mike Barletta of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.
 King County has been sending recruiters to distant cities, where they scour job fairs, employment offices and even other police departments to find new people to wear the sheriff's uniform. 
 ''We went to Houston, made a presentation after their roll call, spent eight days in the city, and at the end of it all we got was only one new officer out of it -- and he didn't last,'' said Detective Robert Burrows, who does recruitment screening at the King County Sheriff's Office.
 What proved to be a bidding war of sorts between King County and San Diego County broke out this year when the sheriff's office here bought radio advertisements and sent recruiters south. The selling point was that houses are cheaper in the Pacific Northwest than in Southern California. 
 ''We sell the lifestyle, and the cost of living, less crime, the mountains,'' said Deputy Cline, the chief recruiter for King County. ''And in turn, we're looking for diversity, for someone with good people skills, someone who can go from a missing-child call to a bar fight.''
 San Diego countered by describing the Seattle area as a damp, cold outpost far from the beaches of Southern California.
 ''We say, 'Would you rather live in Washington State, where it's gloomy and gray, or live here with the sunshine and beaches?' '' Lieutenant Barletta said. ''Our biggest obstacle is housing prices. Young people can't afford to buy a home here.''
 To help with housing costs, San Diego started a Cop Next Door program, arranging with certain lenders to offer discount home loans to officers willing to live in less desirable neighborhoods. But the program has yet to show much promise, Lieutenant Barletta said. 
 ''We've got all the sunshine anyone could want,'' he said, ''but not enough officers. It's been bad for some time, but it's getting worse.''

HEADLINE: Republican Strategist Is Taking Heat for Taking Mexico as Client 

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 26 

 BODY:
Rob Allyn, the political consultant, meet Rob Allyn, the punching bag. 
 A longtime Republican strategist, Mr. Allyn has found himself in the cross hairs of conservative critics in the last week after signing a contract with Mexico's foreign ministry to lead a campaign to strengthen the country's image in the United States.
A CNN anchor asked Mr. Allyn whether Mexico was ''dabbling in U.S. policy'' by hiring him as a marketer. Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, describing Mexico as a ''corrupt, chaotic country'' with 40 percent unemployment (it is closer to 4 percent) told him in another interview that he had his work cut out for him. 
 Then protesters here in Dallas, where Mr. Allyn lives, held a news conference in front of the Mexican Consulate to assert that Mexico's government would have done better by hiring a Mexican-American firm. Allyn & Company is a unit of Fleishmann-Hillard, the public relations concern, itself part of the Omnicom Group, the international marketing company. 
 ''I've had friends say on this latest one, should I congratulate you or extend condolences,'' Mr. Allyn, 46, said in an interview at his office.
 Making news, rather than helping to shape it, is not what Mr. Allyn wants to do. Public relations consultants try to remain in the shadows. Perhaps that is impossible when the issue is as emotion-filled as immigration after the approval this month of a bill in the House of Representatives. 
 That bill requires mandatory detention of many undocumented illegal immigrants, stiffer penalties for employers who hire them and a broadening of the immigrant-smuggling statute to include employees of social service agencies and church groups that offer services to undocumented workers. It also calls for building 700 miles of fence along the border with Mexico. 
 Even some of the bill's supporters acknowledge that its requirements, once considered on the extreme fringe of the immigration debate, will make approval difficult in the Senate. 
 Mr. Allyn's contract, worth about $720,000 over the next year, calls for him to represent Mexico in the United States in meetings with nongovernmental organizations; through polling and organizing tours of Mexican officials; and potentially with a small amount of advertising. 
 Paramount among the Mexican government's concerns these days is fighting anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States. More than 10 million undocumented immigrants live in this country, according to a recent report by the Pew Hispanic Center. Nearly 500,000 undocumented immigrants, most of them from Mexico, have moved to the United States each year since 2000, the Pew study said. 
 The latest contract has a much higher profile than Mr. Allyn's last big foray into Mexican politics, in 2000, when he quietly helped orchestrate the campaign of President Vicente Fox. 
 Attuned to sensitivities in Mexico over the involvement of foreigners in the country's elections, Mr. Allyn traveled to Mexico under pseudonyms like Jose de Murga and Alberto Aguirre to advise Mr. Fox on polling, wardrobe and speeches. 
 Since then, Mr. Allyn has branched out to work on campaigns in other countries. He counts among his clients the Golkar Party in Indonesia; the prime minister of the Bahamas, Perry Christie; and, most recently, Dumarsais Simeus, the Haitian-born Texas millionaire who aspires to be elected president of Haiti. 
 Mr. Allyn said most of his foreign political work is a result of his Republican contacts in Texas, where he did political consulting work for President Bush while he was governor of Texas, as well as worked for prominent Democrats like Mayor Laura Miller of Dallas and Mayor Bill White of Houston. 
 Mr. Allyn is also co-chairman of Vox Global Mandate, a venture with other Omnicom companies, including GMMB and Mercury Public Affairs, to provide services from both Republican and Democratic strategists for political clients around the world. Still, none of his other campaigns generated as much controversy as his latest contract in Mexico. 
 ''I know people roll their eyes and say the last thing we need to export from this country is spin,'' said Mr. Allyn, a former writer, sitting next to a cutout from a magazine article describing him as Mexico's ''go-to gringo'' in Texas.
 ''But everything you see there,'' said Mr. Allyn, pointing to the skyline of downtown Dallas outside his window, ''was built largely by Mexican immigrants.'' 
 Few states have a Hispanic immigrant population as robust as Texas's. The United States Census Bureau said this year that Anglos make up less than half of the Texas population for the first time in more than a century, after a surge in the state's Hispanic population. 
 Yet in Texas, Mr. Allyn said, a less-hostile view of immigration from Mexico generally holds sway because of a perception of interdependent economic ties with Mexico. 
 He said one of his objectives would be educating people in other parts of the United States -- particularly in nonborder states with fast-growing Mexican populations -- about the economic importance of Mexico. After all, Mr. Allyn said, Mexico ranks ahead of Japan, China and Germany and behind only Canada as a trading partner with the United States. 
 The most pressing part of his campaign may be dealing with an emerging schism in the Republican Party over immigration. Congressmen like Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia threaten to drown out the administration's guest-worker plan with proposals to deny citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants born in the United States.
 ''The conservative movement I signed up for stood for tearing walls down, not building them,'' Mr. Allyn said. 
 Many people in Mexico find it hard to comprehend how the debate over immigration has progressed to such a level. And amid the firestorm over Mr. Allyn's contract, there is a feeling among some Hispanics in the United States that their voice on the immigration debate has been shunted aside by political leaders in Washington and Mexico City. 
 ''You don't promote Mexico by giving a contract to a friend who helped get you elected six years ago,'' said Carlos Quintanilla, a Dallas entrepreneur who has publicly criticized Mr. Allyn's deal with Mexico's foreign ministry. ''You don't need an Anglo to advance Mexico's interests in the United States. It's a regression and a disconnect.'' 
 Shrugging, Mr. Allyn said he was steeling himself for more criticism. ''All I can say is that I'm working on my Spanish as hard as I can,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Genoa Is the New Home of Decorative Arts Collection 

BYLINE: By RODERICK CONWAY MORRIS

DATELINE: GENOA, Italy 

 BODY:
With a vast heritage of fine arts to conserve, Italian public collections have given scant attention to the applied and decorative arts, especially to those of more recent times. 
 But Genoa has just opened a museum that is endowed with a remarkable private collection of more than 20,000 pieces dating from between 1880 and 1945. It includes paintings, sculptures, furniture, glass, ceramics, wrought iron, textiles, architectural projects (built and unbuilt), graphic design, political and publicity posters and leaflets, books, periodicals and newspapers.
The collection was amassed over several decades by Mitchell Wolfson Jr., who acquired some 100,000 objects from the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century. He decided to divide them between the Wolfsonian, the museum he founded in Miami (now a department of Florida International University), and the Wolfsoniana, which has been given the bulk of the pieces relating to Italy. 
 Genoa's Gallery of Modern Art already contains paintings and the furnishings of two historic interiors donated by Mr. Wolfson -- one in the Art Nouveau style from around 1902 and another of a distinctively Italian take on Art Deco. The gallery is in a villa dating to the early 17th century, expanded and updated over the centuries, in a lovely, semitropical park at Nervi, on the rocky Ligurian coast east of the city center. 
 To accommodate the large new donation, a former school building in the park has been remodeled and refurbished. 
 Mr. Wolfson's association with Genoa goes back to 1968, when he was posted to the United States Consulate there, ''one of the first to be opened after American independence,'' Mr. Wolfson said. When he left the foreign service in 1972, he bought a house here and has spent part of his time in the city ever since. He is reputed to have something of a love-hate relationship with the city, but he has a profound affection for the local inhabitants. ''The Genoese are a bit like the Japanese,'' he said, joking. ''They're always very pleased to see you, but are not quite sure they want you to stay on.'' 
 Born in 1939, Mr. Wolfson began to collect at an early age. The first collectibles he spotted, he said, were room keys from the hotels where he stayed when he toured Europe with his family as a 12-year-old schoolboy. When he came to Italy in the mid-1950's, he said, he felt a particular affinity for the country. 
 ''I began to build up a personal archive of pieces, because I came to believe in the language of the object,'' he explained. ''I was fascinated by the relationship between objects, cultures, the times and indeed the languages that created them.'' 
 About 30 years ago, he started to concentrate on the late 19th century and the period encompassing the two world wars, partly, he said, because other collections seemed to neglect these years but also because those decades represented the transition between the Old World and the New World, the world of artist-craftsmen and that of industrial design and mass production. 
 Visitors to the museum are greeted in the lobby by 1890's marble statues of Garibaldi, Mazzini, Count Cavour and Victor Emmanuel II, politically contrasting faces of four of the principal founders of unified Italy. At the same time, the statues are reminders that Italy was still a very young nation at the time that the Wolfsoniana collection's story begins. 
 The display is divided into sections covering late 19th-century Exoticism, Art Nouveau, Futurism, Art Deco, murals and so on. Some sections and pieces will be permanent while others will be rotated over time, to expose the full richness of the collection. 
 There are some astonishing pieces, like ''Pyramid Bed'' by the architect brothers Alberto and Fabio Fabbi's ''Pyramid Bed'' -- an elaborate, sumptuously detailed one-off designed for the fantasy bedroom of a palazzo near Mantua in around 1890. The high quality of object after object leaves one in no doubt that Mr. Wolfson managed to track down and acquire superb examples of design and craftsmanship potently redolent of their various epochs. 
 Individual artists and craftsmen, now little known outside specialist circles, are brought to life again. Among these is the Roman Duilio Cambellotti (1876-1960). A follower of the English Arts and Crafts movement and a painter, sculptor, potter, illustrator and designer of furniture, interiors, textiles, jewelry and stage sets, he produced a distinctive form of Art Deco, paradoxically informed by rustic and folkloric themes. One of the most arresting objects in the museum is his 1925 cabinet, known as ''La Notte'' (''The Night''), inlaid with ivory and ebony decorations. They appear at first to be clouds floating above the Roman campagna at night but on closer inspection reveal themselves to contain finely carved animal motifs. Mr. Wolfson said he spent 20 years trying to persuade the owners of this gem to part with it, until he could finally allay their fears of its leaving Italy. 
 The room devoted to Exoticism evokes the fin-de-siecle era of decadently inclined smoking rooms, bedrooms and grand hotels and spas, with ancient Egypt, the Islamic Middle East and even Japan and Thailand drawn on to conjure up a kind of composite mystic Orient. Later sections illustrate ''Rationalist'' art -- architecture and design of the Fascist period of organized communal vacations and public gymnastics, when furniture took a functional turn, as evidenced by the popular classic ''S.5'' tubular steel and plywood stacking chair. 
 The influence of politics on design is illustrated on a grander scale by a model of the Fiat showcase, the ultramodern Littorina train, a result of Mussolini's push to replace, with diesel and electric power, steam engines powered by coal. One of the final pieces is a 1949 model of the Vespa motor scooter, introduced in 1946, symbol of postwar Italian design and herald of the peninsula's economic miracle that brought with it the promise, at least, of la dolce vita.

HEADLINE: Housing That Has a Profit and a Social Motive

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
Contrary to what might seem logical, developing luxury projects for affluent buyers is not the only way to make profits in the real estate business. 
 Martin Dunn, 38, for example, is putting up housing aimed at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder: limited-income working families and people with psychiatric disabilities, many of them homeless. And he is doing so through a profit-making venture.
What he builds is called supportive housing, and he has completed two midrise apartment houses with 130 units and has started or is planning 11 more projects, all of them in Brooklyn or the Bronx. 
 Supportive housing is aimed at keeping people with disabilities or special needs out of institutions and off the streets by integrating them into buildings with working families as neighbors and offering them a panoply of on-site social services, counseling and supervision. It is a concept embraced by the state and city, which have signed an agreement pledging $1 billion over the next 10 years to such housing. 
 Mr. Dunn is a firm believer that such people can thrive when they live among the general population. ''It is therapeutic for them and better for neighborhood acceptance,'' he said. 
 Although Mr. Dunn came from the nonprofit world -- from 1992 to 1997 he was executive director of the East New York Urban Youth Corps, which is heavily involved in housing -- he decided to establish his firm, the Dunn Development Corporation, as a profit-making venture.
 ''We are for-profit, but we are mission-driven,'' he said. ''We are not looking to do the real estate that makes the most money. We want to do something important that still provides us a reasonable return.'' 
 There are a number of organizations that specialize in affordable housing and nonprofit groups that provide supportive housing. But Steve Coe, executive director of Community Access, a housing and advocacy agency for the mentally ill, which has collaborated with Mr. Dunn on several projects, said: ''No one else is doing what he is. There are plenty of private developers doing affordable housing, but not many of them want to do units for people with psychiatric histories. Doing them for, say, the elderly is cleaner and easier, and the money is the same for the developer.'' 
 Like his counterparts in nonprofit agencies, Mr. Dunn taps into a variety of public and private financing sources, including federal, state and city programs; equity generated by low-income tax credits; and commercial banks. 
 With tax credits going to investors, the profits derive mainly from developers' fees built into a project's financing structure. ''The percentage can range widely depending on the deal,'' he said. ''Normally we get 8 to 10 percent of the cost of the building.'' The two buildings that are already occupied cost $9.9 million and $11 million.
 Mr. Dunn establishes partnerships with agencies like Community Access and the Beulah Housing Development Fund Company to provide the on-site social services, including property management; 24-hour security; job and substance-abuse counseling; case management; and educational, recreational and social activities. 
 The agencies also have a financial stake in the projects. ''We intend to give the nonprofit partners the right to buy us out for $1 after 15 years,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''We think affordable housing should be affordable for the long term, and the nonprofit organizations are not likely to convert the buildings to market rate.'' In exchange, he said, ''we get bonus points in competition for funding for new projects.'' 
 The apartments in his buildings that are not set aside for people with disabilities are rented to low-income working families, who can earn no more than 30 to 60 percent of the area's median income, which is currently $62,800 for a family of four. Rents run from about $550 a month for a one-bedroom unit to $720 for two bedrooms. 
 While working families occupy a major portion of the buildings, Mr. Dunn has aimed the supportive units, which are studio apartments, for the psychiatrically disabled and homeless. They generally pay 30 percent of whatever income they have as rent, with the rest covered by government subsidies. He intends to broaden his scope to include developmentally disabled adults, people with H.I.V. and homeless veterans returning from Iraq. 
 The buildings that are occupied -- and flourishing -- are the 64-unit DeKalb Avenue Apartments at 910 DeKalb Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, which opened in 2004, and the 66-unit Franklin Avenue Apartments at 1363 Franklin Avenue in the Morrisania section of the Bronx, which opened in March. Both were built with financing from the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the New York State Housing Trust Fund, the Community Preservation Corporation and the Richman Group, a syndicator of low-income-housing tax credits. 
 Three more projects are under construction now -- two in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn -- with four more scheduled to begin in the next six months and another four in the pipeline. Most are designed by Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron, an architecture firm based in Manhattan.
 They are energy-efficient and notable for architectural details, like cornices and keystones, not usually found on publicly subsidized structures. Interiors are cheery, with ample communal facilities, including a 13,000-square-foot garden at Franklin Avenue with a play area, teak furniture and trellis. Inside is a library with computers and a community room for meetings and social get-togethers, where the residents gathered for a Thanksgiving dinner last month. 
 Joe Ward, 54, a messenger battling psychiatric difficulties, who moved there from a shelter on the Bowery in Manhattan, is an enthusiastic resident. 
 ''What I like is that you can't see the bed when you walk in,'' he said as he showed off his tidy studio recently. ''I am not used to having a closet or private bathroom. And I love having kids in the building.''

PERSON: John H. Herz

HEADLINE: J. H. Herz, 97, A Scholar Of Diplomacy 

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
John H. Herz, a scholar of international relations and law and a professor emeritus of government at City College, died on Monday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 97. 
 The death was announced by Thomas G. Karis, a friend and colleague.
Dr. Herz focused his studies and writings on the relationships between contemporary politics and its worldwide challenges, including population pressures, the exhaustion of natural resources, environmental destruction and possible nuclear annihilation. He sought to analyze, as he put it in an interview with Contemporary Authors several years ago, ''what changes in attitude patterns and political action are required to solve the global problems in ways under which mankind can survive.''
 John Hermann Herz was born in Dusseldorf, Germany, in 1908 and received a Ph.D. from the University of Cologne in 1931. He also studied at the Universities of Freiburg, Heidelberg and Berlin and received a diploma from the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva in 1938, just before coming to the United States.
 He worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., from 1939 until 1941. Unable to find a faculty position at a large university, he joined other young refugee scholars who found havens at traditionally black colleges. Ralph Bunche, then chairman of political science at Howard University, secured him his first teaching job there as an instructor in government in 1941. 
 In World War II, the United States Office of Strategic Services employed Dr. Herz as a political analyst, and he did the same work for the State Department from 1945 to 1948, returning to Howard as a professor of political science in 1948.
 He joined City College in 1952, and reached emeritus status in 1977. Over the years he also taught as a visiting professor at Columbia and the New School for Social Research and was a consultant for the RAND Corporation.
 Dr. Herz's wife, Anne Klein Herz, died in 2003 after 62 years of marriage. He is survived by a son, Stephen O., of Thun, Switzerland, and a sister, Lore Kingsley, of Pacific Palisades, Calif.

HEADLINE: When Scholarship and Politics Collided at Yale

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
David Graeber pulled a green object shaped like a Champagne cork out of his pocket.
 ''Do you know what this is?'' he asked recently. ''It's a plastic bullet.'' The bullet, he said, was fired by the police in Quebec City during a protest against globalization in 2001, grazing his head.
 Battles with the police are a fact of life for Dr. Graeber, an associate professor of anthropology at Yale and a self-proclaimed anarchist. It was his battle with Yale that surprised him. 
 The university notified him in the spring of 2005 that it would not renew his contract next year. Yale gave no reason, and officials said they could not discuss the dismissal because personnel matters were confidential. 
 But to Dr. Graeber the reason was obvious: his politics. He appealed, and supporters around the world wrote letters on his behalf, some calling him one of the most brilliant anthropologists of his generation. 
 This month, Yale, which says that personal political beliefs ''are not a consideration'' in appointments, amended its decision; it offered Dr. Graeber a paid sabbatical if he would drop his appeal. He accepted. 
 ''So many academics lead such frightened lives,'' he said. ''The whole system sometimes seems designed to encourage paranoia and timidity. I wasn't willing to live like that.''
 A Yale spokesman and three of Dr. Graeber's colleagues declined to comment about Dr. Graeber, repeating that personnel matters were confidential. 
 Dr. Graeber said that criticism of his behavior -- like coming late to class and turning in reports late -- did not surface until his politics became visible. 
 ''They couldn't criticize my research or my teaching, so they talked about my community work,'' he said.
 In theory, Dr. Graeber agrees that an anarchist professor might have problems in establishment institutions. In a online article, ''Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology'' (www.prickly-paradigm.com), he declared, ''Being an openly anarchist professor would mean challenging the way universities are run.'' 
 But Dr. Graeber, 44, a slender man with tousled hair and a chipped front tooth, says: ''I'm not really an anarchist as a professor. I'm a very conventional professor really. I do much more lecturing, for example, than sitting around doing free egalitarian discussion.'' 
 Known in anthropological circles for his work on value theory -- how societies determine what is important -- and anarchism, he said he had tried to compartmentalize the two sides of his life: ''I figured I'd be a scholar in New Haven and an activist in New York.''
 Over barbecued beef wrapped in grape leaves and jumbo shrimp on chipped ice, he described his path from a teenager who translated hieroglyphic passages that had never before been translated to a scholar whose books and articles are used in college classrooms around the world and an anarchist who is a card-carrying member of the Industrial Workers of the World. 
 Dr. Graeber said his comfort with anarchism stemmed, in part, from his family -- his father fought in the Spanish Civil War and his mother was a garment worker. ''Anarchy wasn't dinner table conversation,'' he said, ''but it was on the horizon.'' 
 And as an anthropologist, he said, he realized that ''throughout most of human history, people got by without centralized governments.'' 
 In Madagascar, where he worked on his doctoral thesis, he lived in an area where ''state authority had effectively disappeared,'' he said. 
 He began his anthropology studies at Purchase College of the State University of New York.
 Judith Friedlander, an anthropologist who taught him there and is now at Hunter College, said he was ''hands down, the most brilliant student I ever had.'' 
 At the University of Chicago, he won a Fulbright fellowship and completed a Ph.D. thesis on magic, slavery and politics in Madagascar. Two years later, in 1998, he joined Yale as an assistant professor, even though junior professors there were not on a tenure track. 
 ''I figured it was the best temporary job you could possibly have,'' he said. ''For 10 years, you don't have too big a teaching load. It had lots of prestige. And the pay was O.K.''
 He added, ''I'm up to about $63,000.'' 
 He was by many accounts a prolific writer and popular teacher. Although he sometimes came late, his classes were crowded. 
 Joseph Hill, a Yale graduate student in anthropology who supports Dr. Graeber, described his classes as ''highly interesting and provocative.'' 
 He added: ''They are all over the map, which makes it hard for some students to follow. But students who like to see how diverse little facts and grand theories come together actually find his lectures very well put together and easy to follow.'' 
 Dr. Graeber's first three years went well, and he was given a second three-year contract. By then, he had become captivated by direct political action. He said he found the large protests against globalization in Seattle and Washington ''transformative -- 30,000 people and no leadership. People coming to a consensus without anyone running the show. You wouldn't think it could happen, but it does. And it's compelling.''
 He joined groups like the Direct Action Network, and his political activity became more visible. He was an organizer and spokesman for the protest against the World Economic Forum in New York in 2001. And he was one of several hundred people arrested during a protest against the International Monetary Fund in Washington in 2002. 
 When he returned from a sabbatical for his second three years, he said, some colleagues would not talk to him. Three years later, he was given two years instead of a standard four-year contract and told to contribute more and be more careful about things like arriving at class on time. ''I was told I was unreliable,'' he said. 
 He said that after that critical review, he directed a colloquium series, took part in more meetings, taught more and was more careful about promptness. But he also had disagreements with senior colleagues, including defending a student active in the graduate student unionization movement. 
 Yale decided in the spring not to give him two more years, prompting outcries. More than 4,500 people signed petitions in his support. Maurice Bloch, a noted anthropologist at the London School of Economics, who says Dr. Graeber is ''the best anthropological theorist of his generation,'' called on Yale to rescind the dismissal. 
 ''I know nothing about the circumstances which have led you to your decision,'' he said, ''but I cannot believe that a university such as yours cannot cope with erratic behavior or that it can afford to lose so extraordinarily talented a colleague.'' 
 But some of his colleagues say it was not really about Dr. Graeber's politics. Linda-Anne Rebhun, an associate professor in anthropology at Yale who recently failed to win tenure, said the problem was ''the Yale system'' that has forced many junior faculty to leave. 
 ''It says something about Dr. Graeber's sense of politics,'' she added, ''that he seems to take this as an individual, personal thing rather than taking a more anthropological view of the nature of the system that affects all junior scholars at Yale.''
 Mr. Hill said that while politics may not have been the overt cause for Dr. Graeber's dismissal, his anarchistic manner was undoubtedly a factor. 
 ''I don't think senior faculty sat behind closed doors and actually adduced the fact that he's an anarchist in making the case against him: 'All in favor of the anarchist say aye,' '' Mr. Hill said. ''But it seems to me that he was fired at least in part for being who he is, a large part of which is his egalitarian philosophy and practice of life, his contempt for authority.''
 Others said they were not surprised that Yale did not want to keep him. ''I actually think places like Yale are not for people like David Graeber,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a left-leaning professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ''He's a public intellectual. He speaks out. He participates. He's not someone who simply does good scholarship; he's an activist and a controversial person.''
 Dr. Graeber said he planned to use his paid sabbatical year for research, writing, activism and a job search. He said that he had already had some nibbles and that he was leaving Yale with his ''integrity intact.'' He says with some satisfaction that while his department did not renew his contract, ''I'm better known than most of them.''

 One Thing Is Still Askew: Football's Not the Same
Phil Sorenson and his best friend, Cody Wentz, joined the North Dakota Army National Guard for college money. In February 2004, they were shipped to Iraq. On Nov. 4, 2004, the two were arguing inside a Humvee about their favorite football teams -- the Detroit Lions and the Minnesota Vikings -- when a roadside bomb exploded. It killed Mr. Wentz, and tore off Mr. Sorenson's lower left leg. 
 Mr. Sorenson, 23, is now back home in Williston, N.D. He bought a new pickup, jogs on his prosthetic leg and keeps in close contact with Mr. Wentz's parents, Joyce and Kenny. But the more his life starts returning to normal, Mr. Sorenson said, the more he misses Cody, especially during football season.
 ''I caught myself today saying, 'Oh, I should call and ask him to watch football and eat a pizza,' then it hit me,'' he said by telephone on a recent Sunday. 
 He and about 40 soldiers attended a memorial for the first anniversary of Mr. Wentz's death. The next day, Mr. Sorenson, his parents and the Wentzes, including Cody's brother, Jason, flew to Minneapolis for a Lions-Vikings game. Mr. Sorenson's girlfriend, Alaina Sacramo, met them there.
 The chief executive of Nash Finch Company, Ron Marshall, who had read an article in The New York Times about the two friends' love of football and Mr. Wentz's death, and Mike Kraft, the owner of the Economart in Williston, paid for the flights, game tickets and hotel rooms. 
 ''When we got into the stadium, Phil and I went close to the field, and the tears started coming,'' Mrs. Wentz said, choking up. ''Because we both thought it's just not right. Cody should be with us.''

HEADLINE: 20 YEARS LATER, BUYING A HOUSE IS LESS OF A BITE

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT and MOTOKO RICH; David Leonhardt reported from Portland, Me., for this article and Motoko Rich from New York.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me. 

 BODY:
Despite a widespread sense that real estate has never been more expensive, families in the vast majority of the country can still buy a house for a smaller share of their income than they could have a generation ago.
 A sharp fall in mortgage rates since the early 1980's, a decline in mortgage fees and a rise in incomes have more than made up for rising house prices in almost every place outside of New York, Washington, Miami and along the coast in California. These often-overlooked changes are a major reason that most economists do not expect a broad drop in prices in 2006, even though many once-booming markets on the coasts have started weakening.
The long-term decline in housing costs also helps explain why the homeownership rate remains near a record of almost 69 percent, up from 65 percent a decade ago.
 Nationwide, a family earning the median income -- the exact middle of all incomes -- would have to spend 22 percent of its pretax pay this year on mortgage payments to buy the median-priced house, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com, a research company. 
 The share has increased since 1998, when it hit a low of 17 percent before house prices began rising sharply in many places. Although the overall level has reached its highest point since 1989, it remains well below the levels of the early 1980's, when it topped 30 percent.
 ''This is a good deal -- a good, fair price,'' Dale Ruttenberg, a 53-year-old bar manager said of a tan one-bedroom bungalow, with a remodeled kitchen and finished hardwood floors, that he is buying for $211,000 after having rented in Portland for most of the last decade. ''Within a couple hours of being here, it was like, 'I'm home.' ''
 In high-profile places like New York and Los Angeles, home to many of the people who study and write about real estate, families buying their first home often must spend more than half of their income on mortgage payments, far more than they once did. But the places that have become less affordable over the last generation account for only a quarter of the country's population.
 Elsewhere, families tend to spend far less on housing. In Dallas, the share of income needed to buy a typical house has fallen to 13 percent this year, from 14 percent in 1995 and 31 percent in 1980. In Tampa, it has dropped to 21 percent, from 26 percent in 1980. Even in New England, where the soaring prices of the last decades have frustrated many young families, house values have still not reached the heights of the early 1980's, when calculated as a share of income.
 ''Over 20 years, affordability has definitely improved because interest rates are much lower,'' said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economic Research at the University of California, Berkeley. Houses have also grown bigger during that time, he said, so people are getting more for their money.
 Here in Portland, a smaller version of the big-city real estate boom has been in full swing until just the last few months. House prices have jumped since 2000, hundreds of new real estate agents have gotten their licenses and an old factory along the waterfront, once famous for making bright-red hot dogs, is set to be replaced with condominiums. 
 With many suburban houses now selling for $300,000 and up, young families have a much harder time buying their first home than they did a few years ago. Still, housing has been less expensive this year -- as a share of local incomes -- than at any point during the 1980's, according to Moody's Economy.com.
 Beyond cost, many families who simply could not have bought a house 10 or 20 years ago find themselves able to do so, thanks to changes in the ways banks lend money. In the past, a home buyer often needed to make a down payment equal to 20 percent of a house's value to get a mortgage; today, little or no down payment is common.
 The most money that Tim W. Gilbert has ever had in his possession was $15,000, he said, in the form of a check for a job he had done as a carpenter. But he and his wife, Marjorie, were still able to buy a 1936 Cape Cod-style house this year for $176,000 in Poland, about 45 minutes north of Portland.
 They took out two mortgages rather than making a down payment and they use Mr. Gilbert's $5,000 or so in pretax monthly income to cover $1,600 in mortgage, tax and insurance payments. Ms. Gilbert, a writer, home schools their daughters, ages 4 and 6. ''I paid rent for 18 or 19 years,'' Mr. Gilbert, 38, said. ''We waited years and years. We wanted to make this happen.''
 If almost anything had been different -- if interest rates had been higher or if the bank had required a down payment -- the Gilberts would still be living in an apartment underneath a loud landlord, Mr. Gilbert said. Instead, their house sits on three acres, and they get their tap water from the same source as the Poland Spring Water Company.
 ''We're making this work,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean things are a lot easier, but finally we are in control. It's been a long time coming.''
 The Moody's Economy.com calculations took into account the decline in down payment size in recent years. But even though these lower down payments mean home buyers are taking out loans equal to a larger share of a house's price than in the past, monthly payments have remained reasonable in much of the country.
 The sharp fall in mortgage rates -- from above 10 percent through most of the 1980's to less than 6 percent in the last few years -- is the main reason. Upfront mortgage fees have also dropped to about a third of a percentage point of a loan's value, from 2.5 percent 20 years ago. Computers have made lenders more efficient, and huge pools of global capital have brought more competition to a business that was once largely local.
 But when the list prices of houses are climbing as they have in recent years, it can be hard to imagine that real estate is more affordable than it once was. In a nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll conducted this month, 75 percent of respondents said they thought most families in their community spent a larger share of their income on housing now than in the 1980's. Only 5 percent said the share was smaller.
 One possible reason for the perception is that many families have recently taken on mortgage debt to pay for items other than housing. Some have folded higher interest loans, like credit card debt, into their mortgage, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. Others have used home equity loans to pay for a new car, tuition or even a vacation. 
 This has caused mortgage payments to rise over the last generation -- especially among high-income families, according to Federal Reserve data -- for reasons besides the cost of housing.
 But the monthly payments needed to buy a house still seem to be dictating people's behavior, if not their perceptions. The number of home sales has reached a record this year, according to the National Association of Realtors. In the Times/CBS poll, 90 percent of respondents said they were satisfied with their homes.
 ''People aren't really shopping prices,'' said Bill Trask, a broker at Coldwell Banker Friends and Neighbors Realty in suburban Portland. ''They're shopping payments.'' 
 Christopher Muncie recently bought his first home, a 1,000-square-foot condominium with a sunken living room and exposed beams in Portland's West End, for $169,000. It is part of a house built in 1838; a similar apartment in the building sold for $81,000 in 1990, according to real estate records.
 That increase starts to look less striking, though, when viewed in light of family incomes that have grown more than 50 percent in Portland over the same span and interest rates that have fallen nearly in half. 
 ''I walked away thinking I'm getting a bargain,'' said Mr. Muncie, 36, a psychologist. ''I was actually pleasantly surprised.''
 The median-earning family in the Portland area would need to spend about 23 percent of its pretax income on mortgage payments for a typical house this year, down from about 27 percent for much of the 1980's. But it is up sharply from the low of 16 percent reached in 1999, and some people here said the cost of housing has become onerous again. 
 With mortgage rates having inched up in recent months, houses are taking longer to sell, and asking prices have dropped. Homes that would have sold for $300,000 this summer are now selling for about $285,000, said Rita Yarnold, president of Bay Realty. 
 The market has also slowed in California and most other places where housing costs have risen far more rapidly than in Maine. In New York, the median-earning family would have to spend about half its income on the mortgage payments for a median-priced house, up from a third of its income in 1985. That will act as a drag on house prices in coming years, many economists say. 
 ''When you get affordability stretched so much, all the creative financing in the world can't stop some correction of house prices,'' Mr. Rosen, the University of California economist, said. ''It happened in Hong Kong, Japan and England.''
 It looks as if it may not happen, though, in most of the United States.

HEADLINE: In Pursuit Of Unhappiness

BYLINE: By Darrin M. McMahon. 
Darrin M. McMahon, a professor of history at Florida State, is the author of the forthcoming ''Happiness: A History.''

DATELINE: Tallahassee, Fla. 

 BODY:
''HAPPY New Year!'' We seldom think of those words as an order. But in some respects that is what they are. 
 Doesn't every American want to be happy? And don't most Americans yearn, deep down, to be happy all of the time? The right laid out in our nation's Declaration of Independence -- to pursue happiness to our hearts' content -- is nowhere on better display than in the rites of the holiday season. With glad tidings and good cheer, we seek to bring one year to its natural happy conclusion, while preparing to usher in a happy new year and many happy returns.
Like the cycle of the seasons, our emphasis on mirth may seem timeless, as though human beings have always made merry from beginning to end. But in fact this preoccupation with perpetual happiness is relatively recent. As Thomas Carlyle observed in 1843, '' 'Happiness our being's end and aim' is at bottom, if we will count well, not yet two centuries old in the world.'' 
 Carlyle's arithmetic was essentially sound, for changes in both religious and secular culture since the 17th century made ''happiness,'' in the form of pleasure or good feeling, not only morally acceptable but commendable in and of itself. While many discounted religious notions that consigned life in this world to misery and sin, others discovered signs of God's providence in earthly satisfaction. The result was at once to weaken and transpose the ideal of heavenly felicity, in effect bringing it to earth. Suffering was not our natural state. Happy was the way we were meant to be.
 That shift was monumental, and its implications far reaching. Among other things, it was behind the transformation of the holiday season from a time of pious remembrance into one of unadulterated bliss. Yet the effects were greater than that. As Carlyle complained, ''Every pitifulest whipster that walks within a skin has had his head filled with the notion that he is, shall be, or by all human and divine laws ought to be, 'happy.' '' 
 Carlyle was notoriously cranky, but his central insight -- that the new doctrine of happiness tended to raise expectations that could never possibly be fulfilled -- remains as relevant today as it was in 1843. Despite enjoying far better living standards and more avenues for pleasure than before, human beings are arguably no happier now than they've ever been. 
 Sociologists like to point out that the percentage of those describing themselves as ''happy'' or ''very happy'' has remained virtually unchanged in Europe and the United States since such surveys were first conducted in the 1950's. And yet, this January, like last year and next, the self-help industry will pour forth books promising to make us happier than we are today. The very demand for such books is a strong indication that they aren't working. 
 Should that be a cause for concern? Some critics say it is. For example, economists like Lord Richard Layard and Daniel Kahneman have argued that the apparent stagnancy of happiness in modern societies should prompt policymakers to shift their priorities from the creation of wealth to the creation of good feelings, from boosting gross national product to increasing gross national happiness. 
 But before we take such steps, we might do well to reflect on the darker side of holiday cheer: those mysterious blues that are apt to set in while the streamers stream and the corks pop; the little voice that even in the best of souls is sometimes moved to say, ''Bah, humbug.'' As Carlyle put it, ''The prophets preach to us, 'Thou shalt be happy; thou shalt love pleasant things.' '' But as he well knew, the very commandment tended to undermine its fulfillment, even to make us sad.
 Carlyle's sometime friend and long-time rival, the philosopher John Stuart Mill, came to a similar conclusion. His words are all the more worth heeding in that Mill himself was a determined proponent of the greatest happiness for the greatest number. ''Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so,'' Mill concluded after recovering from a serious bout of depression. Rather than resign himself to gloom, however, Mill vowed instead to look for happiness in another way. 
 ''Those only are happy,'' he came to believe, ''who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.'' For our own culture, steeped as it is in the relentless pursuit of personal pleasure and endless cheer, that message is worth heeding. 
 So in these last days of 2005 I say to you, ''Don't have a happy new year!'' Have dinner with your family or walk in the park with friends. If you're so inclined, put in some good hours at the office or at your favorite charity, temple or church. Work on your jump shot or your child's model trains. With luck, you'll find happiness by the by. If not, your time won't be wasted. You may even bring a little joy to the world.

HEADLINE: Thrown Together, Sticking Together, for Iraq Duty 

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: FORT DIX, N.J., Dec. 22 

 BODY:
As a convoy of Humvees crawled down a sandy, bumpy road, a bomb exploded. Inside one vehicle, the gunner collapsed.
 ''We have a casualty down and wounded,'' a sergeant yelled into his radio handset. ''We need a medical evac and helicopter.''
Specialist Jeffery Kavanaugh, 21, the gunner, lay motionless, still breathing but gurgling. The driver tossed him a bandage. No one else in the vehicle moved to help.
 Later, recalling those moments, Specialist Kavanaugh said he wondered what would have happened if this were Iraq, not a training exercise in the pine forests of New Jersey. ''If I was really hurt, would they let me just die there?'' he said.
 The Bush administration has announced troop reductions, and some politicians in Washington are debating whether the United States should pull out altogether. But none of that matters to the men of the 654th Military Police Company, a newly formed unit of the Virginia Army National Guard. Their reality is that American soldiers are still needed to patrol the streets of Iraq, and within a few weeks this patchwork company will be doing just that. 
 ''If there has been ups and downs in the news about the war, we haven't noticed,'' said Capt. Lowell Nevill, the 654th's commander. ''We're in another world here.'' 
 For two months, the group of 157 veterans and rookies has lived on Tiger Base, a 30-acre re-creation of Iraq at Fort Dix, one of two bases in the United States that offers an immersion course for new security forces, said Lt. Col. Norberto Cintron, who is in charge of the training.
 They awaken before 5 a.m. and hear Muslim prayer calls five times a day. They eat flavorless food, use portable toilets and sleep on cots, 12 to a tent. In military exercises, simulated grenades and improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.'s, explode, and soldiers like Specialist Kavanaugh dramatize severe or fatal wounds. 
 Despite the emphasis on physical preparation, the trainers and soldiers at Fort Dix say the most important skills they will learn here are loyalty and teamwork, which will help them survive a year at war.
 ''None of us thought we were going to be able to come together and do this,'' said Pfc. Michael Goodrich, 19, who had straight A's in high school and gave up college basketball scholarships to join the National Guard last year. ''After awhile, we pretty much gave up complaining, because we realized we were stuck with each other for a year. 
 ''It's just like working together on a basketball team. But being on a basketball team won't get you killed; going to Iraq just might.''
 The 654th arrived here in early November, a mixture of men -- whites, blacks, Asians and Hispanics from different economic backgrounds -- plucked from more than 10 National Guard units from Virginia and pieced together to form a unit big enough to serve as a military police company in Iraq.
 Like a weekend softball team, these men represented a range of ages (19 to 50), athleticism (college athletes to couch potatoes) and professional backgrounds (including policemen, a cook and a dog trainer). Most came from field artillery units. Some, slightly less than 10 percent, had served in Iraq and volunteered to return. 
 Captain Nevill, 33, who has a bachelor's degree in cultural anthropology from the University of Virginia, is in charge of this unit. At home, he is a patrolman for the Manassas Police Department. Here, he is responsible for these men.
 In the shared misery of Tiger Base, Captain Nevill said, he saw his soldiers transformed from individuals to a cohesive unit, especially after a grueling transition to military life: limited sleep and no days off. Many of his men contracted nagging coughs or upper respiratory infections, particularly when temperatures dipped into single digits and the tent heaters stopped working.
 ''We're not running or lifting weights, but we're athletes of another kind,'' Captain Nevill said, wearing his required helmet and bulletproof vest. ''It's endurance and toughness. It takes the body a long time to get used to that.''
 Although the gym often goes unused, soldiers work out during drills more mental than physical. The training for the Guard has evolved. Units deployed early in the war sometimes received a week or two of training. Now, the training for security forces at specialized sites like Fort Dix lasts at least two months and includes more complex simulations. 
 But the 654th will not know how prepared it is until it comes under live fire.
 ''What's going to take them to get with the program is a bullet whizzing by their head or an I.E.D. blowing up next to them,'' said Sgt. First Class Donald Wilson, a trainer here who likened this work to his days as an adult league basketball coach. Only then, Sergeant Wilson said, will they find out ''how good a team they've become.''
 Every day, convoys from the 654th roll through a makeshift Iraqi city with hidden threats. When the men see the sign ''The City of Balad Welcomes You,'' gunners grasp their M-249's and 50-caliber machine guns.
 The convoys pass a blue mosque and aluminum shipping containers made to look like buildings, each spray-painted with Arabic or English phrases like ''Go home USA.'' Sometimes snipers shoot blanks at the Humvees, inciting a simulated firefight. 
 Civilians, including Iraqis living in the United States, occasionally linger in the streets like movie extras. Some are instructed to look friendly and wave, others to grimace and yell in Arabic. 
 Soldiers must react to cues: Purple smoke means a rocket-propelled grenade has hit, white means a roadside bomb. And when a trainer hands a soldier like Specialist Kavanaugh a pocket-size card describing an injury or death, he must act the part.
 The first time Pvt. Christian Chandler, 20, traveled through Fort Dix's Balad, he was a nervous wreck. Hoping to become a cosmetologist or a massage therapist, he joined the Guard to earn extra money and then trained to be an administrative specialist. Now he is a gunner, which he said, ''surprised and shocked and scared me'' because gunners are vulnerable.
 Private Chandler said he felt sick when he saw the Arabic words for ''Stop or I will shoot'' written phonetically on the windshield of his vehicle so he could memorize them. He was so skittish, he once lost control of a Humvee and plowed into a tree.
 His team leader, Sgt. Jamie Padgett, said Private Chandler was initially unwilling to pop out of the gunner's hatch. ''We had to pretty much push him up there,'' he said.
 As weeks went on, Private Chandler convinced himself he could be a worthy gunner because he was athletic. He played high school basketball in Smithville, Va., though as a senior his team lost every game. In the final weeks here, he began wearing a black ski mask, revealing only his eyes, to keep warm and to look menacing. One day, he picked up his machine gun and growled.
 ''Do I look mean now?'' he said, before laughing.

Going Back to Look for Revenge
 Not everyone in the 654th is a rookie. About a dozen have served in Iraq in the same tightly knit engineering unit. They returned from a yearlong deployment in March after losing two men on Dec. 21, 2004, when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a dining hall in Mosul. The returning soldiers volunteered for this mission out of loyalty to their buddies.
 Sgt. Jon Faulkner was friends with those soldiers, both 20, and took it hard when they died. He said all he could think about was returning to Iraq, where he could help protect less experienced men in his new unit. He keeps rereading a poem another soldier sent in an e-mail message to him, including these lines: 
 This is the life I have to live.
 This is the soul to the Devil I give.
 You have your parties and drink your beer
 While young men are dying over here.
 ''I'm here kind of for revenge,'' said Sergeant Faulkner, a 21-year-old archaeology student. ''I'll keep going to Iraq until the war is over.''
 Sergeant Faulkner, from Fredericksburg, Va., said that as a boy he was the target of bullies but that he grew into an aggressive young man. He played on two state championship soccer teams in high school, then joined the National Guard because, he said, ''I love getting shot at and I love shooting back.''
 He is serious about his work, always giving orders, hardly smiling. His commanders say he is a good soldier. Still, his colleagues shy away from asking him about Iraq because they are afraid to upset him.
 When his fellow soldiers said goodbye to their families in October, Sergeant Faulkner said, he wanted the emotional moments to end. ''Let's get boots on the ground,'' Faulkner recalled thinking, ''so we can kill something.'' 

'We're Basically Dinosaurs'
 Specialist David Newton worried about the naive, overzealous and hardheaded young soldiers -- both rookies and veterans -- he saw when he arrived at Fort Dix. 
 ''These guys will need me as a medic,'' said Specialist Newton, 40, a cook and college student from Chesterfield, Va., who re-enlisted in the National Guard in 2004 after a 10-year break. ''Before I left, I made a promise to some of these young guys' wives that I'd bring their husbands home in one piece. Well, maybe not in one piece, but they'll come home.''
 Specialist Newton and Guardsmen like him, many with active-duty experience, weather jokes about being old enough to have had Moses as a boot-camp instructor and about their lack of technological expertise. But they have developed a paternal bond with the rookies.
 Staff Sgt. Lee Stanford, 50, a former Marine Corps chief warrant officer nicknamed Old School, said, ''It takes all types to make a good squad. Not everybody has to be 19 and in perfect shape to be a good team player.'' His job, he said, was to bring his 12-man squad home. 
 Sgt. Ernest Grigsby, 39, who is unmarried and has no children, is out of shape but said he had nothing to lose by going to Iraq so ''some 20-year-old wouldn't have to die or lose his legs.''
 While keeping a Humvee warm for officers during a seven-hour training exercise one night at Fire Base Falluja, Specialist Newton said, ''We're basically dinosaurs here, but I really do believe they need us for our experience and patience.'' 
 Outside, the wind and freezing temperatures cut through the soldiers' Gore-Tex jackets, reddened their faces and numbed their hands. The gunners aimed for pop-up targets glowing in the dark. The barrage of gunfire echoed as tracer rounds zoomed like red lasers.
 Trainers were also simulating an attack on the base, detonating fake mortars every few minutes, causing blinding flashes and deafening blasts. 
 ''I'm not going to lie to you, 90 percent of us are apprehensive about going to Iraq,'' Specialist Newton said as another mortar hit. ''We'd be crazy if we weren't.''
 To relieve stress, he smokes two packs of cigarettes daily, cracks jokes and serenades his buddies with songs from Elvis Presley films like ''Harum Scarum'' and ''Kissin' Cousins.'' But at night in his bunk, he becomes solemn. 
 ''Every day I think about the chances of these kids dying there,'' Specialist Newton said. ''It's my burden. In the end, I'll watch their back, and I hope they'll watch mine.''

Anxious, but Ready
 The 654th completed its final test this week. On one day, the men reacted to six car bombs, two incoming mortars, two roadside bombs, one rocket-propelled grenade and several hand-thrown grenades, resulting in a total of seven casualties. 
 After one of those exercises, one of the trainers, Sgt. First Class Tony Paden, told them, ''You guys stay tight, stay a good team, because you're going to need each other to stay alive over there.'' The soldiers stood in the biting wind, faces drawn, camouflage uniforms dirty, knowing those words were true. 
 By this time, they also knew what to expect: death or injuries, maybe lost limbs. Their wives or girlfriends could leave them. They could welcome newborns, not by touch but by e-mail.
 ''You can see it in their eyes that they are scared,'' said Sergeant Wilson, the trainer. ''But it's good to be scared. Nothing brings a group of guys closer than sharing the same fear.''
 The men were given nine days' leave to spend the holidays with their families. Private Chandler, the reluctant gunner, planned to take his girlfriend to dinner at an Applebee's. Specialist Newton, the veteran, wanted to embrace his wife. Sergeant Faulkner, the serious soldier, hated the thought of wasting time. Private Goodrich, the basketball player who had three friends die in Iraq, left early to marry Jacqueline McCown in Richmond on Christmas Eve.
 Early next month, each soldier in the 654th will return alone to Fort Dix and begin packing for Iraq. Soon after, they will board a flight together, their world now shrunk to a team of 157 men.

With Incomes Up and Mortgage Rates Down, Housing in Most of Nation Is More Affordable
Despite a widespread sense that real estate has never been more expensive, families in the vast majority of locations around the county can still buy a house for a smaller share of their income than they could have a generation ago. Together, a sharp fall in mortgage rates since the early 1980's, a decline in mortgage fees and a rise in incomes have more than made up for rising house prices in almost every place outside of New York, Washington, Miami and along the California coast.

Former Enron Accountant Pleads Guilty in Fraud Case
The former chief accounting officer of Enron, Richard A. Causey, agreed to cooperate with the government in its case against the two leading executives, Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling, in the scandal over Enron's collapse. Mr. Causey will face a sentence of seven years that could be reduced by up to two years depending on his cooperation at trial. Mr. Causey did not agree to testify, leaving open that possibility as the trial gets under way. [C1.]

A tale of two Richard A. Causeys -- one steadfastly defending Enron's accounting decisions, the other admitting criminal liability in a fraud -- is now at the heart of the prosecution of Kenneth Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. And in this dichotomy lie the issues and evidence that could well determine whether the two remaining defendants go free or spend much of the rest of their lives in prison. News Analysis. [A1.]

Energy Sector and Consumer Confidence Lift Stocks
Stocks edged higher as an increase in crude oil prices lifted the energy sector, while an index showed consumer confidence rose to a four-month high.

HEADLINE: How a Factory Worker Rose to Prominence In Real Estate

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
There are only 10 known billionaires in China, and he is one of them. His name is Xu Rongmao, and he is no Donald Trump, Sam Zell or Mortimer Zuckerman. He's bigger.
 Mr. Xu, who is the chairman of the Shimao Group, controls much more land than any private developer in America and builds luxury real estate projects that put even Mr. Trump to shame for their sheer scale and flamboyance. But unlike the ubiquitous Mr. Trump -- who is never at a loss for words and goes out of his way to attract the attention of cameras -- Mr. Xu almost never grants interviews and is highly secretive about his operations.
For all his reserve, Mr. Xu, a former textile factory worker, is one of China's wealthiest entrepreneurs and a prime example of the nation's first generation of real estate tycoons. ''I don't know much about Mr. Xu, but Shimao has this uncanny ability to find the right projects at the right time,'' says Michael T. Hart, director of research in Shanghai at Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate consulting firm. ''Their North Bund project has one of the best views in all of Shanghai.'' 
 In a country that started permitting people to buy homes only in the 1980's, developers like Mr. Xu (pronounced SHOO) found a way to gain rights to prime land in the nation's biggest cities. Now they reap huge profits by building large residential projects, often with hotels and other commercial buildings.
 An industry that emerged only a decade ago suddenly has annual sales of $130 billion, making real estate one of the biggest engines in this nation's roaring economy.
 The growth has helped propel Mr. Xu to No. 9 on the Forbes list of the richest people in China. With $1 billion in net assets, he runs two publicly listed real estate companies and a collection of private offshore companies, and is overseeing $9 billion in projects. 
 The Shimao Group is expected to complete building about 145 million square feet of property by 2010, more than the entire 120 million square feet controlled by Sam Zell of Chicago, the commercial real estate baron who is the biggest individual property owner in the United States.
 By all accounts, Mr. Xu, who in his listed companies uses his Cantonese name, Hui Wing Mau, is a pioneer, willing to take big gambles. Through Shimao, he created one of China's first luxury real estate brands. He bought prime land in Shanghai in the late 1990's when others, fearing that the city was becoming overbuilt, were fleeing the market. 
 And now, with housing prices rising, the Shimao Group is so profitable that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are negotiating to take the company public in 2006.
 Several of China's other real estate tycoons share Mr. Xu's rags-to-riches story. The developer of Shanghai's new Citigroup building, for example, was once a truck driver from impoverished Jiangxi Province.
 But little is known about Mr. Xu, 55, particularly how he earned his early fortune and developed his network of powerful political allies, who include several high-ranking Communist Party officials.
 He turned down repeated requests for an interview for this article, as did many other major Chinese developers. Some privately admitted they simply did not want the publicity and scrutiny in a country still officially communist and uneasy about the creation of individual wealth. 
 ''The nail that sticks up gets hammered,'' said Jack J. T. Huang, chairman of Asia for the law firm Jones Day, citing a common Chinese saying that is also popular in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. ''No one wants to be that nail and talk about this kind of business.''
 Perhaps for good reason. China's real estate industry, like those in many other places, has been dogged by scandal -- tales of illegal land grabs, corruption, government bribery, shoddy construction work and the forced relocation of millions of peasants and urban poor.
 Yet almost everyone with means in China these days seems to want to play the real estate game. Of the 50 richest Chinese, according to Forbes's rankings in 2005, half rely on real estate as one of their primary businesses.
 People who have worked with Mr. Xu, a sprightly looking man with well-groomed black hair, say that he leaped to the top after he bought a collection of distressed properties in Shanghai in the late 1990's and began a huge riverfront development in the city's Pudong district, where some apartments now sell for more than $4 million.
 ''He's just smart,'' said one developer who spoke anonymously out of fear of angering government officials. ''He got a lot of his land at ridiculously low prices, ridiculous. He knew where to go and when to buy.''
 Mr. Xu's start was inauspicious. Like just about every person in China who came of age in Communist China, he started out poor. He grew up in Shishi, an entrepreneurial city in coastal Fujian Province, the oldest of eight children born to a machinery worker and a doctor. 
 After graduating from high school during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, he was sent to the countryside to work as a barefoot doctor. In the late 1970's, he went to Hong Kong and worked in a textile factory. Then, he told friends, he got lucky and made a small fortune trading stocks.
 By the mid-1980's, he was investing in textile factories in western Gansu Province. His leap into real estate began in 1988 when he agreed to invest $1.2 million in a knitting factory in his hometown. Some say he intended all along to build a hotel instead, even though investments in private hotels were forbidden.
 ''He told others the construction was a factory,'' said Cai Shijia, a Fujian official who worked with Mr. Xu. ''But the truth was, he was building a hotel. 
 ''The construction on that land was all implemented according to hotel designs and standards. And as soon as the construction was completed, the government policy changed. Xu Rongmao became the owner of the first private three-star hotel in China.''
 Mr. Xu then plowed millions into developing residential complexes and resorts in Fujian.
 Along the way, he struck up friendships with powerful political figures, including Fujian's party secretary, Chen Guangyi, whom he had known in Gansu Province, and Jia Qingli, who succeeded Mr. Chen in Fujian before moving to Beijing to became a member of the Politburo. Mr. Xu recently met with Mr. Jia, who still holds a high position and was one of the highest-ranking Communist Party officials under Jiang Zemin, the former president.
 For all his personal connections, people close to Mr. Xu say much of his success came from his willingness to take risks and his ability to spot opportunities ahead of others. When business dried up in Fujian, he moved his family to Australia, where he invested in real estate in the early 1990's. Then he pushed his way into Beijing and Shanghai just before housing prices there took off.
 He made money the same way other developers in China have: he negotiated with government officials to acquire cheap land, often with a small down payment, by limiting the commitment to a small initial phrase; then created a design for a new building that could serve as the template for a larger development.
 ''You can use Phase I cash to pay for Phase II or III,'' says one Shanghai developer who has observed Shimao's projects. ''It's all about cash flow -- it's about how you use the money. That's how these guys got off the ground. The early guys were visionaries and now they're ridiculously wealthy.'' The system in China favors developers. Homebuyers pay far in advance of their move-in date, often more than a year ahead of construction. Developers often use that presale money to build the project or buy additional land elsewhere.
 ''That was one way to go from a small amount of money to making a lot of cash,'' said Mr. Hart at Jones Lang LaSalle. ''Many of these guys weren't necessarily good at developing, but they were in the right place at the right time.''
 Mr. Xu has worked the system to perfection. Following the money at Shimao, however, is difficult. Adapting a method honed to perfection by overseas Chinese, the Xu family controls a labyrinthine collection of public and private companies, official filings in China show, including offshore entities. The companies swap property, finance one another's projects and seem to shift profits around.
 For instance, the Shanghai Shimao Group, which is listed in Shanghai, said it had revenue of $280,000 in 2003 but profit of $16.3 million. A year later, revenue jumped to $134 million, with profit of $20 million.
 And in one of many related-party transactions, Shimao International, a company listed in Hong Kong, said it bought 100 percent of a company called Value Added from Dynamic Keen Developments, which was wholly owned by Mr. Xu. Value Added owned a construction company set up by Mr. Xu to develop a project on the China-Russia border. 
 Avoiding investment bankers, two of his companies went public in Hong Kong and Shanghai a few years ago by acquiring listed companies and changing their names, in what is called a ''back-door'' listing. The bulk of the Shimao Group's holdings would create a third company, which could go public soon.
 Real estate experts here say many developers create project companies and engage in related-party transactions, partly for tax reasons. Indeed, Mr. Xu operates another Shimao company. One public filing says the ''ultimate holding company'' for Shimao's pieces is a shell corporation created in the British Virgin Islands called Perfect Zone.
 Shimao has acquired huge tracts of riverfront land in some of China's biggest cities and has used it to build developments packed with signature features, including gardens, palm trees, villas and luxury high-rises outfitted with marble interiors.
 In Harbin, Shimao acquired 43 million square feet in an area the city government is redeveloping, and then received approval to build a huge project north of Harbin, on both sides of the China-Russia border.
 The project includes a casino that would operate just over the border in Russia, escaping the legal prohibition on gambling everywhere in China but Macao. Meanwhile, the government has begun an aggressive campaign to crack down on gambling elsewhere along its borders.
 In Wuhan, Shimao outbid the Hong Kong billionaire Li Kai Shing and agreed to pay $380 million to develop 9.4 million square feet in the historic area of the provincial capital. 
 With the market slowing because of worries about a looming real estate bubble, Mr. Xu and his management team, which includes his son and daughter, are stepping up their investments. They have lined up international architects and five-star hotels to work with them.
 People who work with Mr. Xu say he maintains his close ties to government officials and often makes large charitable donations to help stay in their good graces. When the chief executive of Warner Brothers Entertainment went to Beijing to meet Wu Yi, China's vice prime minister, Mr. Xu was there, too. And he often visits with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.
 Next up for Shimao? An initial public stock offering in Hong Kong early next year, which could value the company at billions of dollars and catapult Mr. Xu to the No. 1 spot on China's rich list.
 The name his parents gave him, Xu Rongmao, seems apt: in Chinese, it can be translated as ''Wealth and Success.''

HEADLINE: It's Like 'Sex and the City,' Only the City Is Moscow

BYLINE: By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
At first glance, it is very much a Slavic ''Sex and the City.'' Four attractive, well-dressed girlfriends meet at chic cafes to kvetch about life, love and sex.
 But as much as modern-day Moscow can seem like New York, what with fast-paced lifestyles, pressure-cooker careers and complicated relationships, Vera, Alla, Sonia and Yulia are not quite Carrie, Miranda, Samantha and Charlotte.
''Balzac Age, or All Men Are Bast '' (as in bastards; the Russian short form is a common term here), a popular television program whose second season just began, may be a comedy about sex in a big city, but many aspects of the lives of its four female leads might be a bit of a shock to the fabulous quartet from Manhattan.
 '' 'Sex and the City' is full of the glamour, chic, splendor and beauty of New York,'' said Alika Smekhova, who plays Sonia, a widowed gold digger on the prowl for yet another rich, old husband. ''Our heroines, like our countrywomen, are deprived of glamour,'' she added, though Sonia lives in a duplex -- luxurious lodgings in this city of unaffordable apartments. 
 The series, which enjoyed big ratings on the NTV channel in its first season in 2004, has from the beginning been described here as a Russian version of ''Sex and the City,'' though NTV said it had no licensing agreement with HBO, producer of the original.
 Vera has a teenage daughter, a product of the Soviet practice of marriage at a very young age. She and Yulia both live with their mothers, as does Vera's boyfriend, Zhan, reflecting the overhang of Communist-era housing shortages and Moscow's sky-high real estate prices.
 Yulia, a nymphomaniac who is unemployed, is desperately trying to land a husband since her father, who supported her, has left her mother for a woman younger than Yulia. Vera finds out that Zhan is married to a woman he says he wed fraudulently to provide her with the residence permit needed for even Russian citizens to live in Moscow.
 Alla, a high-powered lawyer with a fetish for male strippers and a fear of commitment, has some of Samantha's traits. But Lada Dance, the pop star turned actress who plays her, is equally well aware of what differentiates the series from ''Sex and the City'' and what unites the two shows.
 ''It's about our life, about our mentality,'' she said. ''We have our friendship between women. They have theirs. It's different. The only thing is that it turns out that men both here and there are bast '' she added, using the same Russian shorthand as in the program's title.
 At first Sonia enjoys her life as a widow, taking young lovers for pleasure, but when the money runs out, she becomes a call girl to an oligarch who is sick of his Barbie-doll wife. She has sex with him in a dark, empty apartment, without seeing his face, and he begins to confide in her.
 Harking back to Dostoyevsky's prostitute with a heart of gold and reflecting the attitude of many Russian women toward their men, Sonia begins to pity her lonely client. In a modern twist, she also confesses to Vera -- who is a psychotherapist and, like the Carrie Bradshaw character on ''Sex and the City,'' provides the voice-over for the show -- that she has never enjoyed sex so much as this anonymous kind for money.
 In the episode that was broadcast Monday, Sonia ends up being driven to drink and, surrounded by empty wine bottles, her face bruised after a drunken fall, is saved by an intervention from her girlfriends, who listen to her lamentations. ''I'm 35 and I have neither children nor a husband nor a job,'' she cries. ''It's all over. All that's left is a lonely old age.''
 Yulia tries to comfort her, then cries when Sonia points out that she is in the same boat. Alla hires male strippers to clean up the apartment, and then all the girlfriends get depressed because they realize that if they were young and desirable, men would clean up for them for nothing.
 The hunky strippers in thong underwear washing the dishes and vacuuming the floor gave the bittersweet denouement of the episode a satirical edge. In general, the show's cheery theme music and exaggerated characters and situations underscore its comedic core.
 But the series nonetheless reflects contemporary Russian realities. Women, especially in Moscow, have become engines of a growing market economy and are putting off marriage. Yet women over 30 are still often regarded as aging, if not old; even those who have their first child in their late 20's are categorized as coming late to motherhood. Indeed, the show's name, ''Balzac Age,'' refers to Honore de Balzac's novel ''A Woman of Thirty'' and is the polite Russian way of referring to a woman who is getting on in years.
 These mores have long placed men in a privileged position in relationships. So did the Soviet Union's historical legacy of war, repression and alcoholism, which has left Russia, where men live to an average age of about 59, with an acute shortage of males -- many of whom are raised and spoiled by single mothers.
 ''It is our history,'' said Maksim Stishov, the scriptwriter and a producer of ''Balzac Age.'' ''We have completely different relations between men and women. We have fewer men, many fewer men than women. This affects relations of women with each other and with men.''
 Dmitry Fiks, the director and co-producer, is even more blunt. ''We have infantile men,'' he said. But he added that the goal of the series was not to roast them mercilessly, but to poke fun at their weaknesses. ''We love them and make them funny,'' he said. ''They are very gentle and touching, but all slight imbeciles.''
 Not unlike the ''Sex and the City'' stars, the actresses who star in ''Balzac Age'' have seen their lives splashed across Russia's tabloids and celebrity magazines.
 Zhanna Epple, who plays Yulia, recently separated from her common-law husband of nearly two decades; in an interview with a Russian television magazine, she said he could not deal with her success.
 Yulia Menshova, who plays the sympathetic, studious Vera, divorced after the series began filming. She was host of a television talk show in the mid-1990's called ''I Myself,'' about women standing up for themselves as Russia was making its rocky transition to a market economy. She said the uncertainty of that transition was reflected in relations between Russian men and women.
 ''People live well, but they always live in fear that this is the last time they will live like this,'' Ms. Menshova said. ''This creates a psychological pressure that makes people so afraid to let someone into their inner world that even relations between men and women have become some kind of threat.''

HEADLINE: Rise in Consumer Confidence Seen as Favoring Sales in '06

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumer confidence has nearly recovered from the beating it took from Hurricane Katrina and other severe storms, boding well for spending in 2006. 
 The Conference Board said yesterday that declining gasoline prices and improving job opportunities raised its Consumer Confidence Index to 103.6 in December, from 98.3 in November. That was better than the 103.0 reading analysts had expected. 
 The index plummeted after Hurricane Katrina devastated Gulf Coast states on Aug. 29 and disrupted fuel and trade for much of the nation, but now it is approaching the 105.5 reading preceding the storm. 
 The report is closely watched because consumer spending drives about two-thirds of the nation's economy, and gains in confidence tend to precede increases in spending. 
 Gary R. Thayer, chief economist for A. G. Edwards & Sons, a brokerage firm in St. Louis, said it was ''encouraging that confidence has bounced back after the hurricanes, and it suggests the economy has some good momentum going into the new year.'' 
 Still, he expects overall economic growth to slow from about 3.5 percent this year to 3.2 percent in 2006 and to 3 percent in 2007. Higher interest rates are likely to dampen consumer borrowing and weaken the housing market, discouraging some consumers from borrowing against their homes, he said. 
 ''But we're looking at a moderation, not a major slowdown,'' Mr. Thayer said. 
 Higher fuel prices also remain a concern. The Energy Information Administration, part of the United States Department of Energy, reported that the national average retail price of regular gasoline fell 1.4 cents, to $2.19 a gallon, in the week that ended Monday; but that still leaves gasoline prices more than 40 cents higher than they were the same time a year ago. The Conference Board index is derived from responses received through Dec. 20 to a survey mailed to 5,000 households on a consumer research panel. 
 Although the overall index has risen strongly in the last two months, the survey indicates that consumers are more confident of current economic conditions than they are for conditions in the future.

HEADLINE: Profiting From Cures for the Sarbanes-Oxley Blues

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU

 BODY:
Who would have thought the scandals at major corporations like Enron and WorldCom would be a boon for owners of some businesses? But that is just what has happened.
 New regulations that sprang from systematic fraud at those two corporations have created a cottage industry of businesses that provide consulting, accounting, computer security and other services to help companies cope with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. That law was passed in an effort to clean up corporate accounting.
 Sarbanes-Oxley, nicknamed SOX in the financial world, requires corporate managers to evaluate internal financial controls, hire outside accountants to review those controls annually, make more information available to the public and to follow procedures to stifle fraud. 
 Critics say the new rules are burdensome, expensive and of questionable value, but some entrepreneurs smelled the sweet scent of opportunity in somebody else's problem. 
 Sanjay Anand, who ran his own financial and technology consulting business, created the Sarbanes-Oxley Institute of Clifton, N.J., this year to offer training and his brand of Sarbanes-Oxley certification.
 Diane Wolff transformed her financial-management business, the Blue Sage Group of Canton, Mass., into a firm that helps publicly traded companies comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, most recently introducing a compliance software package for small and medium-size businesses. 
 Shai Stern created Vintage Filings, also in New York, to help public firms format and file financial statements quickly and economically.
 Some of these entrepreneurs say their company's revenue has doubled and tripled since they began to provide advice and services to companies needing to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley. 
 This year alone, public companies will have spent an estimated $3.5 billion on technology and consulting services to meet their Sarbanes-Oxley obligations, according to John Hagerty, a vice president at the Boston-based AMR Research, which released an annual compliance survey of information-technology and business leaders in November. And there are no signs of a letup. The survey found that more than 80 percent of the companies polled planned to update their compliance initiatives in the next 12 months.
 ''It's like a new-found religion has formed around SOX compliance,'' Mr. Hagerty said. 
 One of the most daunting demands of Sarbanes-Oxley, and one that is driving much of the need for compliance assistance, financial experts say, is Section 404 of the act, which requires the documentation and auditing of a company's internal controls. 
 Mr. Anand of the Sarbanes-Oxley Institute started his consulting company in June 2002, just as the law was being enacted. He realized there would be a need for Sarbanes-Oxley education for company employees.
 ''We kept hearing about all these standards for SOX compliance, but there was no standard in place for companies to educate them on bringing firms up to the level of compliance,'' he said. And so, last February the institute was founded. ''The certification we offer helps companies decide if employees are familiar enough with SOX,'' he said.
 For example, Telwares Communications, a procurement and invoice-processing firm for the telecommunications industry that is based in Pleasanton, Calif., needed help with Sarbanes-Oxley, so Michael Voellinger, a vice president, enrolled 15 of his employees in an intensive week of training at Mr. Anand's institute. 
 ''The Sarbanes Oxley Institute is the only body at this point that is offering this level of certification,'' Mr. Voellinger said. ''It covered everything, from the fundamentals to what compliance looks and feels like.''
 Mr. Anand says the company's sales have grown well into the six figures and that he expects them to rise to seven figures next year.
 Ms. Wolff, who founded Blue Sage Group in July 2002, reported impressive results, too. In 2003, she said, ''I decided to begin focusing on corporate governance and compliance and provide companies with the tools and techniques and training material to help them implement Sarbanes-Oxley programs.''
 ''I realized this was a huge opportunity.'' Since then, she says, her revenue has increased tenfold, to the high six figures, and she expects it to reach seven figures this year. Most recently, Ms. Wolff said she designed a software package to help companies comply with Sarbanes-Oxley's auditing and reporting requirements, and she also devised a Sarbanes-Oxley checklist for managers on her Web site, thebluesagegroup.com.
 Regular financial filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, also known as Edgar, have also intensified since Sarbanes-Oxley was passed. 
 William E. Grownup Jr., general counsel at Napster, the digital-music provider based in Los Angeles, says the more frequent filing deadlines required by Sarbanes-Oxley induced him to hire Vintage Filings a little more than a year ago to handle the less complex statements, like the 8-K's that announce any major events that may be of interest to shareholders.
 ''We were using the bigger shops but they were more expensive,'' he said, while Vintage ''is more nimble and costs half as much because they don't have the overhead.''
 Mr. Stern, co-chairman and chief executive of Vintage Filings, says he spotted opportunity right away when he took a close look at Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002. At the time, he says, he was working as a sales representative for a stock-transfer company while his future partner in the venture was a securities lawyer.
 ''We thought with SOX there would be a need to create an Edgar filer as a service to publicly traded companies,'' he said, and some quick research confirmed his hunch.
 ''I called a whole bunch of people I knew at big companies and asked them if they would use the service if I provided it,'' he said. The overwhelming answer was yes, and the company was formed with two employees in 2002. Vintage Filings now has 60 employees, its 8-K filing business has increased by 350 percent, and sales quadrupled last year and are on target to do the same again this year. Mr. Stern declined to specify a figure beyond saying it was in ''the millions.''
 Keeping computer data secure and out of the hands of individuals that might compromise a company's financial standing, although not specifically mentioned in Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, is getting some attention, too, said Mary Ann Merryman, associate professor of accounting at St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind. 
 The possibility of such sabotage has meant more business for companies like Scalable Software in Houston, a consulting firm that specializes in information technology and asset management. Scott Bils, the vice president for marketing at the firm, said Scalable Software had aggressively pursued companies needing help complying with Sarbanes-Oxley's information-technology requirements, like password protection and security settings.
 ''We dove into SOX because we saw it as an attractive business,'' he said. ''And it just keeps growing.''

HEADLINE: A Nobel Winner Can Help You Keep Your Resolutions

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel (dynamist.com) is the author of ''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness.''

 BODY:
WHY make New Year's resolutions? If you need to start a diet or get up earlier in the morning, why wait until Jan. 1? Why not do it today? New Year's resolutions do not make any rational sense.
 While perfectly logical, that analysis misses the point. New Year's resolutions help people cope with some of the most difficult conflicts human beings face. 
So argues one of the economics profession's greatest experts on conflict, Thomas C. Schelling, who shared this year's Nobel in economic science for, in the words of the citation, ''having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis.'' 
 Professor Schelling, now a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, is famous for his work on conflicts between nation-states, particularly those with nuclear weapons.
 One of his best-known ideas is ''precommitment.'' One party in a conflict, he demonstrated, can often strengthen its strategic position by cutting off some of its options to make its threats more credible. An army that burns its bridges, making retreat impossible, is a classic military example. 
 Others involve strong diplomatic commitments. By passing a law saying the United States will defend Taiwan if it is attacked, for example, Congress gives future administrations less flexibility in dealing with a crisis, but the threat makes an attack less likely.
 In the early 1980's, Professor Schelling applied similar analysis to individuals' internal struggles, seeking to develop what he called ''strategic egonomics, consciously coping with one's own behavior, especially one's conscious behavior.''
 The problem, he suggested, is that pretty much everybody suffers from a split personality. One self desperately wants to lose weight or quit smoking or run two miles a day or get up early to work. The other wants dessert or a cigarette, hates exercise or loves sleep.
 Both selves are equally valid, and equally rational about pursuing their desires. But they do not exist at the same time.
 ''What I have in mind is an act or decision that a person takes decisively at some particular point in time, about which the person's preferences differ from what they were earlier, when the prospect was contemplated but the decision was still in the future,'' he wrote in ''Ethics, Law and the Exercise of Self-Command,'' (available online at http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/schelling83.pdf). ''If the person could make the final decision about that action at the earlier time, precluding a later change in mind, he would make a different choice from what he knows will be his choice on that later occasion.''
 New Year's resolutions help the earlier self overrule the later one by raising the cost of straying. ''More is threatened by failure than just the substance of the resolution: one's personal constitution is violated, confidence demoralized, and the whole year spoiled. At least one can try to make it so,'' wrote Professor Schelling in ''The Intimate Contest for Self-Command,'' a 1980 essay in his book ''Choice and Consequence: Perspectives of an Errant Economist'' (Harvard University Press, 1984).
 As many a broken resolution demonstrates, those consequences often are not a big enough deterrent. To make success more likely, Professor Schelling's work suggests a few additional strategies.
 One is a mild precommitment: not keeping sweets or tobacco in the house, for instance. At the very least, this step forces you to delay indulgence until you can go to the store -- and allows time to recover your resolve.
 Another approach is to use bright-line rules, which make it harder to cheat through clever reinterpretation. That may explain why many people find it easier to eliminate whole categories of food, like carbohydrates, rather than simply to cut back on calories.
 ''Just as it may be easier to ban nuclear weapons from the battlefield in toto than through carefully graduated specifications on their use, zero is a more enforceable limit on cigarettes or chewing gum than some flexible quantitative ration,'' Professor Schelling wrote.
 He once resolved to smoke ''only after the 'evening meal.' '' That rule ''led to tortured reasoning Thanksgiving afternoon, or flying west across the Atlantic with perpetual afternoon, and it stimulated lots of token sandwiches on leaving the ski slopes to drive home.''
 For those who cannot face the prospect of an eternity without a favorite indulgence, there is the strategy of delay. Instead of resolving to go without, you give yourself permission to smoke or drink or eat chocolate cake again within a specified time -- say, three hours -- after deciding to go off the wagon. Like having to go out to buy supplies, this strategy allows time once again to resolve not to indulge.
 A twist lets the newly resolute self reset the clock at any time. ''I have spoken to distance runners who, as exhaustion approaches, pick their stopping places a mile in advance, with the rule that any place more distant can be picked at any time before they reach the current target, and once picked even by the most fleeting resolve it becomes controlling,'' Professor Schelling wrote, wryly noting that it is not always obvious which self should be in control. ''I think I know whose side I'm on, and I'm sorry for him.''
 A slight variation allows a third ''self'' to mediate between the two in conflict by enforcing a prearranged deal: the chance to sleep late at the price of skipping TV at night, for instance, or a new dress in exchange for losing 10 pounds.
 This system works, however, only on two conditions. First, the incentives have to be strong enough. Then, wrote Professor Schelling, ''the 'someone' who wants to turn off his alarm with his eyes closed has to believe that another 'somebody' will later have the fortitude to administer the punishment or deny the reward, when 'they' are really all the same person.''

HEADLINE: Energy Shares Lift Indexes As Oil Prices Rebound 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks edged higher yesterday as an increase in crude oil prices lifted the energy sector, while an index showed that consumer confidence rose to a four-month high. 
 Crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.66, to $59.82 a barrel, on expectations of a decline in crude oil and distillate stockpiles in the United States this week, as well as a cut in OPEC supply next year. Earlier in the day, crude oil prices exceeded $60 a barrel.
 ''The jump in oil prices lifted shares in the whole energy sector,'' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, N.Y. ''And we also had very strong confidence numbers, which helped support the rest of the market.'' 
 Exxon Mobil gained 38 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $56.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 18.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,796.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.63 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,258.17, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 2.05 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,228.94. 
 Among Nasdaq 100 stocks, the online marketplace eBay rose 1.4 percent, or 62 cents, to $44.37, and contributed the most to the Nasdaq's gain.
 The biggest drag came from shares of Apple Computer, off 66 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $73.57. That reversed Tuesday's gains for Apple, whose iPod digital music players were a top holiday seller. 
 Early in the session, the Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment rose in December to 103.6, from 98.3 in November. The level was the highest since August, before Hurricane Katrina and the ensuing surge in oil prices. Economists had expected the index to rise to 101.8. 
 The industrial conglomerate 3M was the Dow's best performer, rising 82 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $78.20. 
 In addition to 3M and Exxon Mobil, gainers in the Dow included American International Group, up 46 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $68.41; the jet maker and defense contractor Boeing, up 43 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $70.96; the chemical maker DuPont, up 24 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $43.26; and the retailer Wal-Mart Stores, up 11 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $47.84. 
 The rise in oil prices also lifted shares of Chevron, up 81 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $56.70, and ConocoPhillips, up 79 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $58.29. 
 Concern raised by activity on Tuesday in the bond market kept gains in check, analysts said. 
 On Tuesday, stocks declined as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell below that of the two-year note for the first time since December 2000. That development, called an inverted yield curve, has predicted the start of recessions in the past. 
 ''Some investors worry that if the inversion persists, it may signal a tough time ahead for the economy,'' said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer at Bingham Legg Advisers in Boston. ''But it's still too soon to know it for sure.'' 
 The yield on Treasuries was higher yesterday, with the 10-year Treasury note rising to 4.37 percent, from 4.34 percent Tuesday. 
 The two-year note rose to 4.36 percent.
 The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 8/32, to 1011/32. Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.730

HEADLINE: Was It Worth It? For Transit Workers, Strike Is Open for Debate

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; John Clarke Jr. and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Over cellphones and two-way radios, through e-mail messages and in locker-room conversations, word of the settlement between the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union drifted out to the front line workers. 
 The proposed contract was virtually the only topic of conversation in trainyards, bus depots, car barns and subway stations yesterday. 
The workers had carried signs, chanted slogans and walked the picket lines in the cold, having taken part in the first New York City transit strike in 25 years. And so there was not much to do but question whether it had been worth it.
 ''The strike was worth it in the long run,'' said a bus driver, Brian A. Ince, 40, who added that he was delighted the pact included improved health benefits for retirees who live outside the metropolitan area and are not old enough to be eligible for Medicare.
 Another driver, Robert Cornick, 43, said the union won a major victory when the authority dropped its demands that new workers wait until age 62 before being able to collect full pensions (compared with age 55 for most current workers) or pay 6 percent of their wages toward the pension plan (compared with 2 percent for current workers). 
 ''I won't have to work until I am 65,'' he said. ''I can retire at 55 and still have health benefits. It's good for my family.'' 
 The union's full membership -- some 33,700 workers -- will vote on the contract in the coming weeks. 
 But if there was substantial support for the proposed deal, interviews with dozens of workers yesterday made clear that a true consensus has not yet taken hold. Most workers were aware of the basic provisions -- raises of 3 percent, 4 percent and 3.5 percent over three years, and a new contribution of 1.5 percent of wages toward health care -- but quite a few were uncertain about the specifics. 
 In fact, many of the workers said the contract only deepened their ambivalence about the 60-hour transit strike last week, which ended when the union president, Roger Toussaint, agreed to resume talks with the authority. Outside the Michael J. Quill Depot in Manhattan, named for the man who led the union from 1934 to 1966, workers debated whether the strike had been effective. 
 ''It's a bum deal,'' said Richard Smith, 37, a bus cleaner. ''We are still stuck, staying right above the rising waters with inflation.'' 
 Mr. Smith and several other workers said they collected substantial overtime pay. He said that the health care contribution should be only a proportion of base pay based on a 40-hour week, and not net income, as the proposed contract now calls for. 
 Michael Tutrone, who represents bus workers in Manhattan and the Bronx as one of 15 division chairmen in Local 100, noted that most workers would pay at least $1,000 in fines for engaging in an illegal strike. He also noted that on the eve of the strike, the authority offered the same wage package as the one in the final settlement, and asserted that the new health care contribution opens the door for future increases. 
 ''What we came back for was everything that was on the table before the strike,'' he said. ''These guys are only interested in the food on the table for their families, and this deal doesn't help them with any of that.'' 
 Indeed, some workers felt a sense of helplessness. They said they had walked out, and then back on, at the instruction of their union. 
 ''We went on strike for nothing -- to get exactly what we had plus a few extra things,'' said Twana L. McDonald, 33, a subway conductor. ''It's a lot of money we lost with the strike. We stayed where we are. We got maternity leave and they aren't going to touch the pensions, but the increase in wages stayed the same.'' 
 Some workers questioned Mr. Toussaint's insistence that new workers -- ''our unborn,'' he called them -- be treated the same as current ones.
 ''I would have much rather have the new employees pay an extra 4 percent for pensions than have all of us pay an extra 1.5 percent for health care,'' said Kevin Rose, 29, a bus driver. ''At least new workers know what they're getting into when they get hired.''
 Archibald F. Miller, 48, a subway car cleaner based in Coney Island, said he did not think there would ever be an agreement. ''For some people this contract is good, and for others it isn't,'' he said. ''It's O.K. for me. But it's been very emotional. It's over now and we all have different opinions, and you just have to respect each other's opinions.''

HEADLINE: A Hyphenated-American Dream

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
A truly great city inspires truly great dreams, even during the days when all else seems lost. 
 There was no bleaker time in New York's history than 9/11. Yet it was then, with the restaurant where he had worked for six years -- Windows on the World -- in splinters and 73 of his fellow employees gone, that Silverio Moog's dream started to take shape.
Now Mr. Moog, a spunky 41-year-old bartender from the Philippines, can hardly believe what is about to happen. Next week he'll go to work in a brand-new restaurant, and start a totally new life. 
 Restaurants open in New York all the time, but there has never been one like this. Mr. Moog and 50 other waiters, busboys, bartenders and dishwashers, many of them immigrants who worked at Windows, have formed a cooperative that will run one of the city's first worker-owned restaurants. 
 Each one of them will claim a piece of the restaurant, called Colors, as their own and share in any profits. Each one submitted a family recipe to help shape the restaurant's eclectic menu -- which they describe as American fare with a global twist. And each one has pinned lifelong dreams on an idea formed in the crucible of disaster. 
 ''This is one of my American dreams, to be an owner of a business being run by immigrants who have a common goal,'' Mr. Moog said.
 The possibilities and opportunities are wondrous, he said, and he is especially proud to see his Philippine Lobster Lumpia -- lobster and minted sweet potato spring rolls -- on the Colors menu. 
 But the reality of what he and the other workers are undertaking is daunting as well.
 ''I guess I'm a little bit scared,'' he said.
 And no wonder. With the failure rate of restaurants -- 60 percent after three years according to a recent Ohio State University study -- and all the vagaries of location, perception and the economy to deal with, even experienced, well-financed restaurateurs can stumble.
 While the co-op members have centuries of restaurant experience among them, they have never owned a business. So they brought in a professional, Stefan Mailvaganam, a Canadian citizen of Sri Lankan descent, to be general manager. 
 Mr. Mailvaganam realizes this is no ordinary job. ''What we are trying to do here is start a restaurant with a conscience,'' he told two dozen co-op members who gathered last week for a final training session. While he spoke, spacklers and carpenters rushed to complete their work. The restaurant, in Lower Manhattan a few doors down from the Public Theater, is scheduled to open for dinner on Tuesday. ''It's challenging,'' Mr. Mailvaganam said over the din of steel and wood, ''but we are committed to doing it.'' 
 Rarely has one project had to carry so many expectations. Besides memorializing the 73 who died in Windows, which was atop 1 World Trade Center, the co-op is trying to do no less than change an industry. 
 Nobody in the restaurant, not even the dishwashers, will receive less than $13.50 an hour, far higher than average restaurant wages. They will share tips and be eligible to receive overtime and vacations. Eventually they will be covered by health insurance and have pensions.
 And, of course, each will share in the profits of the restaurant, if and when there are profits.
 ''I am doing this for myself, for the workers who died and for all restaurant workers in the city,'' said Awal Ahmed, 43, a waiter from Bangladesh who worked at Windows for 17 years. ''It doesn't matter to me how much profit I get. It's like having a piece of my own restaurant.''
 The Sept. 11 attack forced many people to change their outlook on life. Surviving workers from Windows realized that nothing more than a simple matter of scheduling had determined who lived and who died. 
 Many of the surviving workers were left scrambling for work. A cooperative restaurant was seen as a way of providing jobs as well as making a strong point about workers' rights. Money had to be raised, but traditional lenders balked, even after an Italian food cooperative put up $500,000 to support the project. 
 Saru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, which gets support from the restaurant workers union, said she thought workers would be eligible to receive the 9/11 financing available for rebuilding Lower Manhattan. But except for wage subsidies from Catholic Charities, they have not received any of that financial help. 
 The project has a budget of $2.2 million, which the co-op finally raised from more than 20 sources. Each worker contributed at least 100 hours of sweat equity. 
 The decision to open an expensive, 120-seat tablecloth restaurant in a good location, rather than a humbler place that would have cost much less, and opened a lot sooner, turned into a heated dispute that led several co-op members to leave.
 Others left because the legal framework for the co-op was structured so that members' early profits go to pay back the Italian co-op.
 Some are still unhappy with how profits are to be shared. ''Our percentage keeps going down and down,'' said Khondoker Delwar, 43, a waiter from Bangladesh. But he's sticking with the project, he said, because it means his young daughter will know he was part of something noble that happened in New York.
 A successful co-operatively owned restaurant could become a powerful symbol. Juan Galan, an organizer with Local 100 of Unite Here, which represents hotel and restaurant workers, is trying to persuade co-op members to join the union because it would show owners how treating workers well can actually help increase profits. 
 And the co-op members are joining the New York State Restaurant Association, an owners' lobby. At a recent co-op meeting, Rajani Adhikary, a policy organizer for the Restaurant Opportunities Center, a labor advocacy group that has been instrumental in forming the co-op, told members that by joining the association they would be helping all restaurant workers. ''You're going to be like spies,'' Ms. Adhikary told them, ''and tell us what they do so we will know more about them.'' 
 E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president of the restaurant association, said the co-op members were welcome. ''We're on their side,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''We just don't see why they would feel they need to have spies amid our ranks.''
 Most of the co-op members found other jobs while waiting for Colors to open. Magdi Labib, an Egyptian immigrant and a natural leader of the co-op, is doing well as a waiter at an expensive Midtown steakhouse. He said he would probably earn less at Colors, but he will make the switch anyway. ''I know that 6 out of 10 restaurants fail, but it's not going to happen here,'' said Mr. Labib, 51. ''Everyone is going to know how to do their job in a proficient way, and that's going to help.''
 The workers had planned to bring memorabilia from Windows to the new restaurant but abandoned that idea because they felt the constant reminder of what happened there would be too depressing. 
 The new restaurant will feature 1930's decor because the workers feel that era represented the height of labor power in New York. The name Colors reflects the 22 nations from which the members come, as will be shown on a giant mural in the restaurant. 
 These veteran restaurant workers realize that the emotional link to 9/11 will bring in diners, but it will become secondary to the things that really determine a restaurant's success -- service and food. 
 ''Yes we have 9/11 and people who believe in workers' rights might come at first,'' said Fekkak Mamdouh, a former Windows waiter who now is assistant director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center, ''but if you don't give good service and good food, they won't come back.''
 Mr. Mamdouh said that if Colors fails, it will be a failure for all immigrants in the city. But if it succeeds, he said ''it will be a victory for all restaurant workers in New York, all immigrants and all people who believe in workers' rights.''

HEADLINE: New Twist in Iran on Plan for Nuclear Fuel

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN and DAVID E. SANGER; Richard Bernstein reported from Berlin for this article, and David E. Sanger from Waco, Tex.

DATELINE: BERLIN, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
In what may herald a sharp reversal of previous statements, a senior Iranian official said Wednesday that Iran would ''seriously and enthusiastically'' study a Russian proposal aimed at breaking the deadlock on efforts to block Iran from enriching nuclear fuel. 
 The official, Javad Vaeedi, deputy head of the Supreme National Security Council, was referring to a proposal made by Russia several weeks ago under which Iranian-produced uranium gas would be processed into fuel in Russia and returned to Iran. 
The circuitous route would ensure that Iran would be able to produce fuel only for nuclear power, and could not enrich the uranium into a form that could be used in weapons. It would also slow Iran's ability to obtain enrichment technology. 
 Last week in Vienna, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, the leader of the delegation that has been conducting talks with British, German and French negotiators, rejected the same proposal, saying that Iran had told the Europeans to ''act on the proposition that enrichment will be conducted inside'' Iran, and that any other option was ''unacceptable'' and ''an insult.''
 It is difficult to ascertain Iraq's true position on the issue. There have been some hints of a struggle within the new government over nuclear policy, American and European officials say, but a senior American official said last week, ''We're not clear who is calling the shots.''
 Iran has insisted on many occasions that it has the right to develop the technology to produce nuclear fuel on its own territory. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has responded that the issue is not one of rights under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed, but rather a question of whether Iran can be trusted, after repeatedly deceiving the International Atomic Energy Agency about its facilities and abilities.
 Iran claims that its nuclear program, parts of which it carried out clandestinely for 18 years before it was discovered by United Nations inspectors, is only to generate power, but the United States and Europe believe the true goal is to develop nuclear weapons.
 Mr. Vaeedi's statement indicating a more welcoming attitude toward the Russian proposal was reported Wednesday by the Iranian Student News Service, which has been used in the past to make policy declarations to the world.
 One interpretation is that Iran, faced with the possibility that the Europeans will halt the talks once and for all and refer Iran's violations of the nonproliferation accord to the United Nations Security Council for a vote on sanctions, has decided that the Russian proposal is an acceptable compromise.
 But it seemed equally likely that Iran was not so much making a policy change as it was continuing the jockeying for international support that has been taking place over the past several months. The United States and the three European nations have been simultaneously trying to convince Russia and China that Iran is seeking a weapon, and pressing them to tell Tehran that neither would block action at the Security Council.
 ''The trouble is that when they say they'll give it serious study, it doesn't mean they'll accept it,'' David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a nonpartisan research group that follows developments in Iran, said of Mr. Vaeedi's statement. ''Iran's problem is that just to turn down the Russian proposal adds a lot of support to those who want to bring the matter to the Security Council.'' 
 The Europeans suspended the talks with Iran in August when Iran, breaking an agreement to cease all uranium processing activities while the talks were under way, began converting uranium into gas at a plant in Isfahan, an activity that it has vowed to continue.
 The conversion into a gas is a major step in producing nuclear fuel, and the Europeans and Americans seem willing to allow that to go forward in Iran, though for much of the year they have said even that technology could not remain in Iranian hands.
 The next step would be the enrichment of the gas into material that can be used either to generate electricity or to build a bomb, which is the stage of the process that Russia has offered to conduct. Russia would stand to earn tens of millions of dollars in fees for the service.
 Following the suspension of negotiations, the next natural move for the Europeans and the United States would have been to carry out a longstanding threat to refer Iran to the Security Council for sanctions. But the Western countries have hesitated to do that because of a likely veto of sanctions by Russia and China, both of which have major commercial ties to Iran.
 The European strategy since then has clearly been to hold open the possibility of resuming talks, either to make real progress on the substance of Iran's nuclear program, or to persuade Russia and China that everything has been done to give Iran an opportunity to come to an agreement and that the only option is sanctions.
 Russia has been reported in recent weeks to be growing impatient with what it has come to see as Iranian intransigence. Russia also joined the European countries and the United States in harshly criticizing remarks by Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in which he has denied that the Holocaust occurred and said Israel should be ''wiped off the map.''
 Last week in Vienna, the three European countries and Iran held talks about whether to resume negotiations. The result was inconclusive, and another meeting has been scheduled for January. It was at last week's meeting that Mr. Akhondzadeh seemed to reject the Russian proposal.
 The very different tone taken Wednesday by Mr. Vaeedi in Teheran could be aimed at persuading the Europeans to reopen talks, and to forestall support for sanctions by Russia and China.
 ''They'd seemed to be hardening over the last several months,'' Mr. Albright said of the Iranians, ''so I'd be surprised if this statement was a real change of position.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Iran's agreement to study a Russian proposal aimed at breaking a deadlock over Iran's nuclear program included an erroneous reference to Iraq at one point. It is Iran -- not Iraq -- whose true policy on the issue has been difficult to ascertain.

HEADLINE: Inequality at Home, Too

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Trade, Oppression, Revenge'' (column, Dec. 25), David Brooks discusses the inability of the poor in Bolivia and other Latin American countries to prosper in a capitalist society. Aren't we seeing the same phenomenon develop in America? 
The following contribute to a climate that could gradually lead to the loss of equal opportunity here: the cuts in the estate tax, which encourage formation of an ''aristocracy of the wealthy''; other tax cuts that go mainly to the rich; the development of huge conglomerates with less competition; fabulous salaries and bonuses for chief executives; lobbying and political donations by the rich that ''buy off'' elected officials; cuts to education, Medicaid and Medicare; and fewer differences between the political parties. 
 It grows harder for anyone with a good idea to start a business, and harder for working people to make a decent living. America is looking more and more like the stratified societies described in Mr. Brooks's column.

HEADLINE: For Energy Users, a Surprising Wrinkle

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
EVERY fall, as temperatures begin to drop, many homeowners who heat with natural gas find a flier tucked inside their utility bill inviting them to switch to a rival provider. Those who cool with electricity get a similar invitation come spring: Dump the familiar old utility and buy your fuel or energy from a ''third party'' supplier, typically bearing an obscure name. Often the invitation includes an inducement, like a cash bonus of $25 or $50.
 ''Your gas, your choice, your rebate,'' read one insert sent by Con Ed, which serves New York City and most of Westchester County. 
Confused? So are a lot of people. Con Ed says about 95 percent of its residential customers simply shrug and throw the fliers away.
 The notion of offering a choice goes back to the days of energy deregulation, which opened up the market to allow any company, or third party, to generate or sell power. Delivery remains a local monopoly, which means Con Ed, for example, still delivers power and gas sold by its rivals, picking up a fee for its trouble. 
 Small wonder some consumers are confused.
 In most states, utilities can sell gas at only the market price. Third parties, however, may offer a contract with a fixed rate that lasts a year or longer -- a great deal for those who signed up in 2004. Some contracts are variable, prices rise and fall with the market. 
 Chris Olert, a spokesman for Con Ed who lives in Warwick, N.Y., switched to a different provider about three years ago. ''I shopped around,'' he said, ''and I know that I saved money.'' Those who roll the dice in 2006 may also save but only, of course, if prices continue to rise.
 State regulators, who set up the competition, say their goal was simply to give the public the right to choose suppliers. But that is not necessarily a simple undertaking. ''Consumers have no way of comparing price, environmental impact or reliability of the power they are switching to,'' said Anna Aurilio, an energy expert at the U. S. Public Interest Research Group, a national organization that lobbies Congress on consumer issues. After viewing Con Ed's Web site (www.poweryourway.com), she said its offers left her flummoxed. 
 Roger B. Cooper, the executive vice president for policy and planning at the American Gas Association, a Washington trade group that represents nearly 200 gas utilities, said that even he had a hard time in 2005 deciding whether to stay with his old utility or switch to a supplier offering a fixed-price contract.
 ''Guess what? I can't predict,'' he said. ''It's a crazy idea that you can give people a choice on a commodity that's harder to predict than the stock market.'' 
 ''That said,'' he added, ''people like a choice.'' 
 Exactly, said David Flanagan, a spokesman for the New York Public Service Commission. ''The commission's perspective, and the perspective of many others around the country, is that no matter what product or service you're talking about, consumers are always better off when they have a choice,'' he said.
 Some consumer advocates think that the offer of a choice distracts from more serious issues, like providing incentives and help to people who want to use energy more efficiently, or reducing power plant emissions. 
 Another energy expert at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Rob Sargent, also noted that for third parties the cost of signing up new customers is high, and that when it comes to residential customers the profit margins are low. This means there are few incentives to woo homeowners with bargain rates.
 ''Utilities really are natural monopolies,'' Mr. Sargent wrote in an e-mail message. ''We'd be better off getting off this markets-competition kick and replace it with smart regulation that balances the need of consumers, society and the opportunities for regulated entities to make a fair rate of return.''
 Some third parties are old-line utilities venturing outside their monopoly territories; others are companies that used to sell heating oil and have branched into natural gas. Some want a foot in the door because they also sell more lucrative Internet access or long-distance phone service or because they sell maintenance contracts on heating systems, which tend to be more profitable than selling fuel.
 In all cases, though, the third parties are brokers who buy electricity or gas and resell it to consumers. Like commodity traders, who buy and sell pork bellies but never see them, third parties do not usually take possession of energy supplies. 
 They have made the biggest inroads among industrial users, who often have someone in charge of shopping around for the best deals on energy, and among residential customers in the Midwest, where the concept of choice has been pushed harder and for longer. 
 And some third parties do an especially good job of promoting the cause. Jeff Mayer, the chief executive and founder of MX Energy, a third party supplier based in Annapolis Junction, Md., said he started offering contracts to individuals after seeing how industrial consumers had benefited, asking himself: why can't my father in Philadelphia have the same protection that Ford Motor Company has?'
 Today Mr. Mayer offers contracts that work like mortgages: some come with fixed rates, and others float up and down with the market, like a variable-rate mortgage. The company, which was founded six years ago, has signed up about 300,000 customers in 11 states and the Canadian province of Ontario. 
 In Mr. Mayer's view, the issue is not all that complicated. ''We're offering the little guy what the big guy has had for years,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Kurds Are Flocking to Kirkuk, Laying Claim to Land and Oil

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Mona Mahmoud and Ali Adeeb contributed reporting from Baghdad for this article.

DATELINE: KIRKUK, Iraq 

 BODY:
Clusters of gray concrete houses dot the barren plains surrounding this city, like seedlings scattered here by winds blowing down from the mountainous Kurdish homeland to the north.
 The villages are uniformly spartan, except for the red, green and white flag of Iraqi Kurdistan sprouting from many rooftops, even though this province is not officially part of the Kurdish autonomous region.
The settlements' purpose is as blunt as their design: they are the heart of an aggressive campaign by the Kurds to lay claim to Kirkuk, which sits on one of the world's richest oil fields. The Kurdish settlers have been moving into the area at a furious pace, with thousands coming in the past few months, sometimes with direct financing from the two main Kurdish parties.
 The campaign has emerged as one of the most volatile issues dogging the talks to form a new national government. In this region, it has ignited fury among Arabs and Turkmens, adding to already caustic tension in the ethnically mixed city, American and Iraqi officials say. 
 It could also be contributing to a complex web of violence. In the past three months alone, American commanders say, at least 30 assassination-style killings have happened in the area, making Kirkuk one of the deadliest midsize cities in Iraq. 
 The Kurdish parties are completely open about their desire to incorporate Kirkuk into Iraqi Kurdistan. No single issue is dearer to Kurdish leaders as they negotiate with the country's Arabs to form a new, four-year government. Kurdish voters cited it as one of the main reasons they flocked to the polls on Dec. 15. 
 ''The important issues for us are those that concern all Iraqis, but at the top of them is Kirkuk,'' said Fouad Massoum, a vice president in the transitional National Assembly and senior official in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the two main Kurdish parties. ''If we leave it, it will be like a time bomb ready to explode at any time.''
 Because the Kurdish parties are expected to get at least 40 seats in the 275-seat Council of Representatives, they will almost certainly be a key ally for any Arab bloc that wants to muster the two-thirds vote needed to form a government. Kurdish leaders will use that leverage, they say, to force the Arabs to speed the repatriation of Kurds to Kirkuk. That would put the Kurds in an extremely favorable position by the time the province holds a referendum in 2007 to decide whether it should be governed by Iraqi Kurdistan.
 The Kurds say all this goes toward redressing the crimes of Saddam Hussein, who for decades evicted Kurds and Turkmens from the oil-rich region and moved in Arabs.
 There is an official mechanism that is supposed to help evicted Kurds move back to Kirkuk, a city of 800,000 with a crumbling citadel and twisting market streets at its center. Article 58 of the interim constitution, drafted in early 2004 by American and Iraqi officials, established a property claims commission to review individual cases. It also created a national panel to help make policy decisions on Kirkuk.
 The Kurds say that because the Shiite-led government has dragged its feet on empowering these bodies, thousands of Kurds who returned to Kirkuk after the fall of Mr. Hussein still live in squatters' camps. 
 The Kurds have wrested control of most of the government institutions here. They won the majority of seats in the provincial council last January, partly because of a Sunni Arab boycott of the elections. That, coupled with their political influence in Baghdad, has helped them get most of the top local ministry posts and retain control of the police force.
 All the ethnic groups here appear to be caught in rampant violence, American officers say. There is the occasional suicide bombing: one in November killed at least 16 oil infrastructure guards. The targets of assassinations are commanders of Iraqi security forces, as well as politicians, doctors, professors and oil engineers. In November, six police commanders -- four Turkmens and two Arabs -- were killed.
 No one doubts that peace would be easier to come by if it were not for the oil reserves, 10 to 20 percent of the country's total. They are the economic fulcrum of the Kurdish drive to secure virtual independence for Iraqi Kurdistan. During the drafting of the permanent Constitution last summer, Kurdish leaders in Baghdad managed to work in a clause that says this province, Tamim, will hold a referendum in 2007 to determine whether it should be ruled by the Kurdistan regional government or the central authorities in Baghdad.
 ''Clearly, for the Kurds, Kirkuk is a strategic prize,'' said Col. David Gray, commander of the First Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division, charged with securing the province. ''They feel very strongly about bringing their people to Kirkuk to right the wrong that was done under Saddam's regime and the Arabization program. That does collide, of course, with the other groups in the province.'' Arabs and Turkmens argue that many of the Kurds moving in were not displaced by Mr. Hussein -- they originated elsewhere and are settling here to ensure that the province is voted into Kurdistan in 2007.
 ''The Kurds are building property, houses on land they don't own,'' said Sangul Chapuk, a Turkmen politician who served on the American-appointed Iraqi Governing Council. 
 The last accurate census showed that the Turkmens, a Central Asian ethnic group that governed this area under the Ottoman Empire, had a slight majority. That was in 1957. The numbers drastically changed under Mr. Hussein's decades-long program of ethnic displacement and further shifted after the American-led invasion. 
 Capt. Greg Ford, the First Brigade's intelligence officer, estimated that 85,000 to 350,000 Kurds had moved into the Kirkuk region since spring 2003. The result is a building boom in Kirkuk itself and along the main roads leading to the border of Iraqi Kurdistan. In Altun Kopri, a Kurd-Turkmen village 15 miles northwest of Kirkuk, new homes constructed in slapdash fashion line dirt tracks. White pickup trucks with Kurdistan flags roll through. ''The construction is just huge,'' said Maj. Victor Vasquez, the head civil affairs officer for the First Brigade. ''I've seen entire villages that didn't exist before spring up from rubble. It's a suburb of Kirkuk overnight.''
 ''There's some funding from the Kurdish parties in terms of the housing,'' he added. ''That's a fair assessment. A lot of it is also private business standing up.''
 The Kurds who have moved back to Kirkuk invariably say they were evicted from the area by Mr. Hussein. One, Adnan Abdul Rahman, a mathematics professor in Kirkuk, said his family was kicked out of the village of Dibis in the 1960's. ''Let me tell you the honest truth,'' Mr. Rahman, 41, said as he stood in the courtyard of a high school on election day. ''I've had 19 executions in my family, and I'll pay another 19 for Kirkuk to go back to Kurdistan.''
 Some Arabs say the Kurdish parties, backed by their militias, are threatening Arab families who refuse to sell their property and leave Kirkuk. Khalid al-Izzi, the Arab head of a human rights group in the city, said the Kurds had coerced Arabs into selling their property for considerably less than what it was actually worth. Kurdish leaders deny the accusations and insist it is the Kurds who are still suffering, because the repatriation process is moving so slowly. With the 2007 referendum fast approaching, the Kurds say their patience has run out.
 ''We've lost a lot of time,'' Mr. Massoum, the Kurdish politician, said. ''For the Kirkukproject, there is a deadline. We insist on commitment to the deadline and implementing the Constitution.''

HEADLINE: Report Finds Far-Flung Use Of 9/11 Loans

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 28 

 BODY:
The Small Business Administration allowed special post-9/11 loans to go to Dunkin' Donuts and Subway franchises and thousands of other businesses nationwide without ensuring that they had been financially hurt by the attacks, according to a report released Wednesday by the agency's inspector general. 
 The load program has come under criticism because lenders profited by being able to give loans to a far-flung array of businesses, from Florida to Alaska, after the terrorist attacks. Besides Dunkin' Donuts and Subway, the businesses included chiropractors in Texas and Iowa, a Georgia liquor store, a Wisconsin orthodontist, a Nevada tanning salon and a funeral home in Oregon. There were also other fast-food restaurants like Dairy Queen and Papa John's Pizza. 
For the most part, the report did not place blame on the loan recipients because in most cases the businesses did not even know they were receiving any special 9/11-related aid. Rather, the report raised questions about the lending practices of financial institutions involved in the program, the oversight by the Small Business Administration and the pressure Congress placed on the agency to jump-start the program after a slow start. 
 The agency responded by reassuring lenders that they would not be second-guessed over their decision on who would get the loans, said the report, which was released in Washington. 
 The problems in the program are an example of how, in the desire to provide economic assistance as quickly as possible after the 9/11 attacks, in some cases funds flowed to businesses that did not really need it.
 ''This is deeply disturbing,'' Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and minority leader of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement in response to the inspector general's findings. ''Congress provided loans to help businesses hurt by the Sept. 11 attacks, not to be used as an accounting gimmick to cover up this administration's failure to provide for small businesses.''
 The report examined 59 loans and found that in 85 percent of them lenders did not do the required paperwork to establish that the borrowers had been affected in some way by the attacks. Some loans were granted to businesses that changed ownership after the attacks, while other lenders said businesses had been harmed by the attacks when financial records indicated that they had not. 
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, the Maine Republican who requested the investigation and chairwoman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a statement that ''these initial findings are troubling'' and that the committee would continue its own investigation. 
 A spokesman for the Small Business Administration said the agency's administrator, Hector V. Barreto, was not available for comment. In a statement, Mr. Barreto, who has led the agency since 2001 and who also requested the investigation into the loan program, said his agency had put the program in place ''as Congress intended.'' He added, ''Furthermore, the program in no way impacted those eligible to receive low-interest loans through our separate disaster loan program following the terrorist attacks.'' 
 The loans were formally called Supplemental Terrorist Activity Relief loans. About 8,200 loans totaling $3.7 billion were approved, though only roughly 7,000 were disbursed. 
 In the case of Dunkin' Donuts, for example, 29 franchises in nine states received loans worth nearly $22 million, according to data provided by the Small Business Administration. Fifteen loans went to franchises in New York or New Jersey, and others went to stores in Arlington, Tex.; Essex Junction, Vt.; and Woodstock, Ga., among other places.
 The supplemental loans are different from disaster relief loans, special low-interest loans provided directly by the S.B.A. to aid businesses directly affected by the terrorist attacks and generally close to the attack sites. 
 Congress set up the supplemental loan program with a much broader intent, to aid businesses nationwide that claimed to be ''adversely affected'' by the attacks, though the report suggests that it was never precisely clear what that meant. The loans benefit lenders because the loans reduced by half a fee that the lenders usually must pay the S.B.A. for guaranteeing loans to businesses that do not have sufficient collateral. 
 The program, which required an appropriation of only $75 million to guarantee the number of loans projected to default, ended in 2003.
 Officials with the agency say the loans were intended by Congress to provide a national economic stimulus that could be obtained by almost any small business. 
 Two former agency officials said in comments included in the report that ''what we did during those dark days after Sept. 11, 2001, was play very small roles in an effort to try to keep our economy from faltering.''

HEADLINE: Hard Choices (And Work) Revive Burke

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
OWNING a ski area has never been easy. It's labor-intensive. You need natural and financial resources. Poor economic times shrink your client base. There are liability issues.
 And that was before global warming.
So maybe this isn't a great time to buy into the ski market.
 But some people are jumping into the ski business anyway, despite the potential pitfalls. That's good news for us in the snow-sliding tribe. 
 In its 50-year existence, Burke Mountain in northeastern Vermont has seen everything the ski business has to dish out, and then some.
 Today, Burke Mountain, which was bankrupt and sold at auction just five years ago, is poised to see something else: a rebirth. It is a Cinderella story for all the lesser-known, off-the-beaten-path ski areas out there.
 The Burke ski area, a midsize mountain with 45 trails and a respectable 2,000 feet of vertical drop, has always been isolated, remote enough that even Vermonters think it's far away. Burke's location, closer to Montreal than to Boston, has long been a part of its charm. It's just outside East Burke, a village of only 1,600 wedged into the state's celebrated Northeast Kingdom. People came to Burke for an authentic New England skiing experience.
 The problem was that, in many years, not enough people came to make the ski area profitable. Even now, Burke draws about 6 percent of the skiers and riders (65,000) that its downstate cousin Killington does in a usual winter.
 But that was also one of Burke's charms -- it was never crowded. Alas, charm doesn't pay bills.
 Burke is most renowned for the nearby Burke Mountain Academy, the country's first ski-racing institution. The academy took in promising high school-age skiers, and with the secluded location as an ally for keeping the athletes focused, turned them into Olympians -- 39 so far, including the 1994 Olympic gold medalist Diann Roffe.
 For decades, the academy was the constant amid the tumult that frequently enveloped Burke Mountain, which struggled to overcome changing ownership, shifting strategies, aging equipment and, of course, the occasional snow-deprived winter. 
 In 2000, a bankrupt Burke Mountain was put up for auction. Burke Mountain Academy board members and alumni decided to buy the mountain, although they needed help first.
 At a town hall-like meeting attended by more than 400 local residents, Kirk Dwyer, the academy headmaster, explained that for Burke Mountain to open in the winter of 2000-1, it would have to double its season-ticket base of 1,100.
 ''We had local people volunteering to man the phones for us,'' Mr. Dwyer said. ''Everyone pitched in, calling neighbors, working hard to get to 2,200 passes. People were buying 10 passes and giving them to local grammar schools. But we did it. That first winter, the mountain broke even.''
 Still, the academy, a nonprofit entity, didn't want to be in the ski area business. It spent the next several years looking for a financial partner, someone who could afford to turn Burke into a four-season resort and develop real estate near the mountain -- the customary modern business model for making money in the ski business.
 Last month, the academy found a suitor. The Ginn Company, a resort developer based in Celebration, Fla., bought the mountain earlier this month for $3 million. The Ginn Company plans a real estate development around a new four-season resort. Plans include a golf course, luxury homes, condominiums, an inn and restaurants in a project that will most likely cost hundreds of millions of dollars. How many property units will be added has not yet been determined.
 The Ginn Company has already invested more than $4 million in a new high-speed lift, new snow-making equipment and completed a spectacular renovation of the base lodge.
 People in Burke have noticed all the activity at the ski area, which is on state land and must remain open to the public. The local reaction has been mixed.
 ''Development is going to benefit the town, and most people feel positively about this,'' said Mike Harris, one of three members on the Burke Board of Selectmen. ''But there are people concerned about too much development or too soon. Change comes hard.''
 After all, a lot of people live in the Burke area expressly because it is three hours from Boston, unspoiled and out of the way. They came to the Northeast Kingdom for its absence of resort living.
 RYAN JULISON, a spokesman for the Ginn Company, said local residents and others who will visit the new Burke Mountain have nothing to worry about.
 ''The pristine setting of Burke is what drew us there, and we want to preserve it,'' Mr. Julison said. ''Our clients have been to the places that are overcrowded, and they're migrating away from them. That's who we're catering to, people who want to come to a place like the Northeast Kingdom because of its heritage as a peaceful getaway.''
 Mr. Dwyer, the academy headmaster, said he understood why locals were concerned.
 ''There's no question this sale will forever change the area,'' he said. ''But if a group didn't come in and develop, the ski area would likely have closed. It couldn't go on without it.''
 Given that alternative, even a historic place like Burke needs help to survive. Because running a ski area, in some places, is just too hard.
 The drive to Burke will still be peaceful (and relatively long). There's time, and space, to keep rooting for authenticity, too.

Previews and Openings

'ALMOST, MAINE' Opens Jan. 12. A comedy consisting of 11 episodes, which all take place at 9 p.m. on a Friday, about love and heartbreak in a cold town in Maine (2:00). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200.

'BEAUTY OF THE FATHER' Opens Jan. 10. The New York premiere of a new play by Nilo Cruz (''Anna in the Tropics'') about a young woman who travels to Spain to reconcile with her father (2:10). Manhattan Theater Club, at City Center, Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212.

'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' Opens Jan. 9. If you are pining for the television series ''Entourage,'' currently on hiatus, you might want to try Douglas Carter Beane's new comedy, which covers similar territory: Hollywood agent, cute movie star, tabloid gossip (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422.

Broadway

'CHITA RIVERA: THE DANCER'S LIFE' At 72, Ms. Rivera still has the voice, the attitude and -- oh, yes -- the legs to magnetize all eyes in an audience. If the singing scrapbook of a show that surrounds her is less than electric, there is no denying the electricity of the woman at its center (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'THE COLOR PURPLE' So much plot, so many years, so many characters to cram into less than three hours. This beat-the-clock musical adaptation of Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prizewinning novel about Southern black women finding their inner warriors never slows down long enough for you to embrace it. LaChanze leads the vibrant, hard-working cast (2:40). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) (On Jan. 17, Jonathan Pryce will assume Mr. Lithgow's role.)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) (On Jan. 10, Eileen Atkins will assume Ms. Jones's role and Ron Eldard Mr. O'Byrne's.)

'JERSEY BOYS' From grit to glamour with the Four Seasons, directed by the pop repackager Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''). The real thrill of this shrink-wrapped bio-musical, for those who want something more than recycled chart toppers and a story line poured from a can, is watching the wonderful John Lloyd Young (as Frankie Valli) cross the line from exact impersonation into something far more compelling (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE ODD COUPLE' Odd is not the word for this couple. How could an adjective suggesting strangeness or surprise apply to a production so calculatedly devoted to the known, the cozy, the conventional? As the title characters in Neil Simon's 1965 comedy, directed as if to a metronome by Joe Mantello, Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick reprise their star performances from ''The Producers,'' and it's not a natural fit. Don't even consider killing yourself because the show is already sold out (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SEASCAPE' While George Grizzard sounds affecting depths in this audience-friendly revival of Edward Albee's 1975 Pulitzer Prizewinner, Mark Lamos's production is most notable for being likable and forgettable, traits seldom associated with Albee plays. The ever-vital Frances Sternhagen plays life-affirming wife to Mr. Grizzard's curmudgeonly husband, while Frederick Weller and the wonderful Elizabeth Marvel are the sea creatures who confront the old couple one afternoon at the beach (1:45). Lincoln Center Theater, at the Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence has found a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'SWEENEY TODD' Sweet dreams, New York. This thrilling new revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical, with Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone leading a cast of 10 who double as their own musicians, burrows into your thoughts like a campfire storyteller who knows what really scares you. The inventive director John Doyle aims his pared-down interpretation at the squirming child in everyone who wants to have his worst fears both confirmed and dispelled (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'SOUVENIR' Stephen Temperley's sweet, long love letter of a play celebrates the unlikely career of Florence Foster Jenkins, a notoriously tone-deaf soprano socialite. It's a show that could easily have been pure camp, and at over two hours it still wears thin. But with Vivian Matalon directing the redoubtable Judy Kaye as Mrs. Jenkins, and Donald Corren as her accompanist, the play's investigative empathy turns the first act into unexpectedly gentle, affecting comedy (2:15). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'A TOUCH OF THE POET' It takes Gabriel Byrne, playing a self-dramatizing monster father, roughly an hour to find his feet in Doug Hughes's lukewarm revival of Eugene O'Neill's drama. But when he does, in the show's second half, audiences are allowed a rare glimpse of a thrilling process: an actor's taking hold of the reins of a runaway role and riding it for all its worth. Unfortunately, nothing else in this underdirected, undercast production begins to match his pace (2:40). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did on Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE WOMAN IN WHITE' Bravely flouting centuries of accepted scientific theory, the creators of this adaptation of Wilkie Collins's spine tingler have set out to prove that the world is flat, after all. This latest offering from Andrew Lloyd Webber, directed by Trevor Nunn, seems to exist entirely in two dimensions, from its computer-generated backdrops to its decorative chess-piece-like characters (2:50). Marquis Theater, 211 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

* 'ABIGAIL'S PARTY' Scott Elliott's thoroughly delectable production of Mike Leigh's 1977 comedy about domestic discord among the British middle classes. Jennifer Jason Leigh leads a superb ensemble cast as a party hostess who wields the gin bottle like a deadly weapon, resulting in an evening of savagely funny chaos (2:15). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.(Isherwood)

'APPARITION' Anne Washburn's gothic shorts are like an excellent late-night storytelling session at the Vincent Price camp for disturbed children (1:20). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Jason Zinoman)

'BINGO' Play bingo, munch on popcorn and watch accomplished actors freshen up a stale musical about game night (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

* 'CELEBRATION' and 'THE ROOM' The Atlantic Theater Company's production of the first and most recent plays by Harold Pinter gets only the later work right. (That's ''Celebration,'' an unexpectedly boisterous comedy from 2000.) But if the italicized acting scales down dramatic effectiveness, it heightens thematic clarity. Essential viewing for anyone wondering why Mr. Pinter won the Nobel Prize this year (1:45). Atlantic Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DOG SEES GOD: CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE BLOCKHEAD' The ''Peanuts'' characters grow up, do drugs and have sex in this dark, disposable parody. Good grief (1:30). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and, on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'INFERTILITY' A harmless, insubstantial and highly amplified musical about the struggles of five people hoping to become parents (1:20). Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444. (Zinoman)

* 'IN THE CONTINUUM' Danai Gurira and Nikkole Salter are both the authors and the performers of this smart, spirited and disarmingly funny show about two women: one a middle-class mother in Zimbabwe, the other a 19-year-old at loose ends in Los Angeles whose lives are upended by HIV diagnoses. Emphatically not a downer (1:30). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 868-4444. (Isherwood)

'MR. MARMALADE' A zany comedy by Noah Haidle about emotionally disturbed children. Yes, you read that right. Michael C. Hall of ''Six Feet Under'' plays the now-cuddly, now-abusive imaginary friend of a neglected 4 year old. Unfortunately, Mr. Haidle never truly capitalizes on his provocative conceit, choosing instead to draw us a scary but ultimately hollow cartoon (1:50). Roundabout Theater Company, Laura Pels Theater, at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Isherwood)

*'MRS. WARREN'S PROFESSION' An absolutely splendid Dana Ivey takes the title role in Charlotte Moore's sensitively acted production of Bernard Shaw's famously provocative play, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary on the New York stage this year (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Isherwood)

'THE OTHER SIDE' In Ariel Dorfman's ponderous comedy-drama, an old couple standing in for all of Suffering Humanity endure the trials of warfare and the bureaucratic absurdities that come with peace. Even the redoubtable Rosemary Harris and John Cullum can do little to enliven the proceedings (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

* 'THE TRIP TO BOUNTIFUL' Led by Lois Smith in a heart-wrenching performance, the cast never strikes a false note in Harris Yulin's beautifully mounted revival of Horton Foote's drama, finding an emotional authenticity in a work largely remembered as a tear-jerking chestnut. This is not to say you should neglect to bring handkerchiefs (1:50). Signature Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS -- GRANDMA GOES TO HOLLYWOOD' Long on sweetness, rich in color and highly tuneful, but short on eye-popping, cheer-igniting wows (2:10). Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center, Broadway and 63rd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'FEAR ITSELF: SECRETS OF THE WHITE HOUSE' In the latest cartoonish sendup of the Bush administration, the simple task of translating ideas into dramatic form seems to have been overlooked (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-0255. (Zinoman)

* 'JACKIE HOFFMAN: CHANUKAH AT JOE'S PUB' The return of a beloved ritual for those wanting a reprieve from enforced benevolence and good cheer. The fearless, explosively funny Ms. Hoffman radiates anything but love and charity as she reviews the year in outrage, both global and personal (1:10). Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WALKING IN MEMPHIS: THE LIFE OF A SOUTHERN JEW' Part memoir, part stand-up routine, this autobiographical piece is endearing, but not quite as colorful as it thinks it is. Jonathan Ross, the piece's creator, grew up Jewish in Memphis: anecdotes about his life may make for good theater, but will probably be better when he gets a little older (1:20). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Anne Midgette)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200.(Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway. With Rosie O'Donnell and Harvey Fierstein (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'ALMOST HEAVEN: SONGS OF JOHN DENVER' Almost 30 of John Denver's songs are ''rediscovered and reinvented,'' as the show's publicity material says, though not generally improved upon. But Nicholas Rodriguez hits the high notes of ''Calypso'' spectacularly (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Neil Genzlinger)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldbergesque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' Spirited entertainment (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Van Gelder)

'FIVE COURSE LOVE' This musical is pleasantly fluffy, but Heather Ayers may make a star vehicle out of it, thanks to an energetic, versatile performance in five roles. She, John Bolton and Jeff Gurner search for love in five restaurants, with a too-generous portion of bad accents and phallic jokes along the way, but lots of laughs (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100, closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'HIS ROYAL HIPNESS LORD BUCKLEY IN THE ZAM ZAM ROOM' Jake Broder's scrupulous (and rigid) re-creation of the influential nightclub comic Lord Buckley, an unlikely mix of English royalty and Dizzy Gillespie (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman).

'LATINOLOGUES' In contrast to the colorfully individualized portraits in John Leguizamo's solo shows, the men and women of ''Latinologues'' are composites of worn, easy stereotypes (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

*'MEASURE FOR MEASURE' The joyous surprise of this Shakespeare's Globe production, directed by John Dove, is how it floods this famously dark play with continuously roaming beams of comic light. In particular, Mark Rylance, the troupe's departing artistic director, is an endearingly clueless Duke Vincentio (3:05). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, closing Sunday. (Isherwood)

'MISS WITHERSPOON' This poignant, funny mess of a comedy by Christopher Durang, set in an antechamber of the afterlife, cheerfully suggests that there are worse fates than death for sensitive souls in this self-destructive world. The play meanders but has the good fortune to star the priceless Kristine Nielsen as a dead woman who intends to stay that way (1:20). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Sunday. (Brantley)

'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI strives for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but all others will scratch their heads (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Zinoman)

'ON SECOND AVENUE' This genial show by the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, celebrating Second Avenue's theatrical heyday, somehow manages to be both a perfect ensemble production and a star vehicle for Mike Burstyn. The production, first seen last March and April, is in its second go-round (2:00). J.C.C. in Manhattan, 334 Amsterdam Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Isherwood)

'PETER PAN' Entertaining without being exhilarating (2:00). The Theater at Madison Square Garden, 4 Penn Plaza, closing tomorrow. (212) 307-7171. (Van Gelder)

'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' It remains prime entertainment (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000, closing Monday. (Van Gelder)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'TIGHT EMBRACE' Jorge Ignacio Cortinas's political hostage drama wants to show, with its dash of magic realism and flickering poetic fire, how human beings use language as a weapon to betray one another. Good acting, especially by Zabryna Guevara, helps the play toward its goal (2:00). Intar Theater at the Kirk on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, closing Monday. (Andrea Stevens)

'WAITING FOR GODOT' (2:30). In this solid production, it is Sam Coppola (Vladimir) and Joseph Ragno (Estragon) who are waiting for the world's most famous no-show. It's been 50 years since Samuel Beckett's play was first staged on Broadway, and the changes in the world since then give the never-changing world of Didi and Gogo some interesting new resonance. Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, closing Sunday. (Genzlinger)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'AEON FLUX' (PG-13, 95 minutes) Adapted from MTV animated shorts from a decade ago, this glossy, incoherent movie sends Charlize Theron 400 years into the future, where she runs around and does somersaults in a spandex body suit. (A. O. Scott)

* 'BREAKFAST ON PLUTO' (R, 129 minutes) ''Candide'' meets ''Tom Jones'' in drag heaven might describe Neil Jordan's picaresque fairy tale about a foundling who becomes a transvestite in 1970's and 80's London, against the backdrop of the Irish troubles. (Stephen Holden)

* 'BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN' (R, 134 minutes) Annie Proulx's heartbreaking story of two ranch hands who fall in love while herding sheep in 1963 has been faithfully translated onto the screen in Ang Lee's landmark film. Heath Ledger (in a great performance worthy of Brando at his peak) and Jake Gyllenhaal bring them fully alive. (Holden)

* 'CACHE (HIDDEN)' (R, 121 minutes, in French) Michael Haneke, one of the most elegantly sadistic European directors working today, deposits his audience at the intersection of voyeurism and paranoia in this tense, politically tinged psychological thriller about vengeance and injustice. Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil are in top form as an affluent Parisian couple menaced by mysterious drawings and videotapes. (Scott)

* 'CASANOVA' (R, 110 minutes) Heath Ledger affirms his status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the moment in this high-spirited farce suggested by the career of 18th-century Venice's most notorious seducer. Silly, sly and delightful. (Scott)

'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN 2' (PG, 100 minutes) In this unnecessary sequel to a mediocre remake, Tom Baker (Steve Martin) and his clan visit Lake Winnetka, which is also the regular summer dwelling of Tom's longtime archrival (Eugene Levy). A tiresome film, full of repetitive, misfired jokes, false emotions and caricatures. Even the pairing of Mr. Martin and Mr. Levy fails to inspire anything more than the occasional smile. (Laura Kern)

'CHICKEN LITTLE' (G, 80 minutes) The sky is falling! The sky is falling! Well, it's not as bad as that. Almost, though. (Scott)

'THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE' (PG, 135 minutes) This honorable adaptation of C. S. Lewis's novel has much of the power and charm of the source. The fusing of live action and computer-generated imagery is adequate, if rarely inspiring. Adult viewers are likely to imbibe the film's wonders indirectly, through the eyes of accompanying children, who are likely to be delighted and sometimes awed. (Scott)

'THE FAMILY STONE' (PG-13, 102 minutes) A home-for-the-holidays movie about a tribe of ravenous cannibals that bares its excellent teeth at anyone who doesn't accommodate its preening self-regard, most recently a big-city executive played by a very good Sarah Jessica Parker. (Manohla Dargis)

'GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' ' (R, 134 minutes) This lumbering vehicle for the rap star 50 Cent blends gangster intrigue with follow-your-dream striving. The story is a mess, and the star is no actor, but a fine supporting cast and Jim Sheridan's warmhearted direction make it watchable. (Scott)

* 'GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK' (PG, 90 minutes) George Clooney, with impressive rigor and intelligence, examines the confrontation between the CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (a superb David Strathairn) and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (himself). Plunging you into a smoky, black-and-white world of political paranoia and commercial pressure, the film is a history lesson and a passionate essay on power, responsibility and the ethics of journalism. (Scott)

* 'HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE' (PG-13, 150 minutes) Childhood ends for the young wizard with the zigzag scar in the latest addition to the Potter saga, even as the director Mike Newell keeps its British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck irresistibly intact. (Dargis)

'INITIAL D' (No rating, 95 minutes, in Cantonese) A street-racing film based on a popular Japanese comic book, ''Initial D'' pitches swaggering Takeshi (Shawn Yue) against diffident Takumi (Jay Chou), a reluctant hero who prefers the charms of his girlfriend (Anne Suzuki) to the dangers of hairpin bends. A slick but silly affair unlikely to appeal to anyone over 15. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

* 'THE INTRUDER' (No rating, 130 minutes, in French) The French director Claire Denis's most ambitious and poetically intuitive film explores the troubled soul of a brooding loner who undergoes a heart transplant and travels halfway around the world, from the Jura mountains to the South Seas, to begin a new life. This visually rhapsodic film is both profound and profoundly enigmatic. (Holden)

* 'KING KONG' (PG-13, 180 minutes) Peter Jackson's remake is, almost by definition, too much -- too long, too big, too stuffed with characters and effects-driven set pieces -- but it is also remarkably nimble and sweet. Going back to the Depression-era setting of the 1933 original, Mr. Jackson's film is as much a tribute to the old, seat-of-the-pants spirit of early motion pictures as it is an exercise in technological bravura. Naomi Watts as the would-be movie star Ann Darrow and Andy Serkis as the big monkey who loves her have a rapport that gives the spectacle the pathos and sweetness it needs, and help to turn a brute spectacle into a pop tragedy. (Scott)

* 'MATCH POINT' (R, 124 minutes) Woody Allen's best in years, and one of his best ever. Beneath the dazzling, sexy surface, this tale of social climbing in London (brilliantly acted by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Scarlett Johansson and Emily Mortimer) is ice cold and pitch black, which curiously enough makes it a superior diversion. (Scott)

'MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Think ''As the Geisha Turns,'' with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming. Directed by Rob Marshall from the Arthur Golden book, and starring Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li and Michelle Yeoh. (Dargis)

'MRS. PALFREY AT THE CLAREMONT' (No rating, 108 minutes) This weepie about the tender friendship between a 70-something British widow (Joan Plowright) and a struggling young writer (Rupert Friend) is as anachronistic as the notion of a Terence Rattigan play set in the present. (Holden)

* 'PARADISE NOW' (PG-13, 90 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) This melodrama about two Palestinians, best friends from childhood, chosen to carry out a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv is a superior thriller whose shrewdly inserted plot twists and emotional wrinkles are calculated to put your heart in your throat and keep it there. (Holden)

* 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' (PG, 128 minutes) In this sumptuous, extravagantly romantic adaptation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel, Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet exudes a radiance that suffuses the movie. This is a banquet of high-end comfort food perfectly cooked and seasoned to Anglophilic tastes. (Holden)

'THE PRODUCERS' (PG-13, 127 minutes) At a fraction of the Broadway ticket price, it's no bargain. (Scott)

'RENT' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Jonathan Larson's beloved musical is as loud, earnest and sentimental as ever. But somehow, as it has made the transition to the screen almost a decade after its theatrical debut (with much of the original stage cast), the show has dated less than the objections to it. Yes, the East Village was never really like this, but in Chris Columbus's hands, the hectic updating of ''La Boheme'' to the age of AIDS and gentrification feels surprisingly sweet and fresh. (Scott)

'THE RINGER' (PG-13, 94 minutes) A hilarious and resourceful cast of intellectually challenged actors smartens up an otherwise brain-dead comedy produced by the Farrelly brothers. Johnny Knoxville stars, dimly, as a cash-strapped office clerk who tries to rig the Special Olympics. (Nathan Lee)

'RUMOR HAS IT' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Jennifer Aniston, trying her best, traipses through this pointless updating of ''The Graduate,'' in which we learn that Ann Bancroft was really Shirley MacLaine all along, and that Dustin Hoffman grew up to be Kevin Costner. Actually, that makes the movie sound much more interesting than it is. (Scott)

* 'SHOPGIRL' (R, 107 minutes) This delicate, deceptively simple film, taken from Steve Martin's novella, spins perfect romance out of loneliness, compromise and the possibility of heartbreak. As a young retail clerk adrift in Los Angeles, Claire Danes gives a flawless performance, and Mr. Martin and Jason Schwartzman, as the very different men competing for her affection, bring gallantry, farce and sweetness to this funny, sad, insightful movie. (Scott)

* 'SYRIANA' (R, 122 minutes) Ambitious, angry and complicated, Stephen Gaghan's second film tackles terrorism, American foreign policy, global trade and the oil business through four interwoven stories. There are at least a half-dozen first-rate performances, and Mr. Gaghan, who wrote and directed, reinvents the political thriller as a vehicle for serious engagement with the state of the world. (Scott)

'TRANSAMERICA' (R, 103 minutes) Felicity Huffman's performance as a preoperative transsexual on a cross-country journey with her long-lost son is sensitive and convincing, and helps the picture rise above its indie road-picture cliches. (Scott)

'WALK THE LINE' (PG-13, 138 minutes) Johnny Cash gets the musical biopic treatment in this moderately entertaining, never quite convincing chronicle of his early years. Joaquin Phoenix, sweaty, inarticulate and intense as Cash, is upstaged by Reese Witherspoon, who tears into the role of June Carter (Cash's creative partner long before she became his second wife) with her usual charm, pluck and intelligence. (Scott)

'THE WHITE COUNTESS' (PG-13, 135 minutes) Set in Shanghai in 1936 and starring Ralph Fiennes and three Redgraves, the final collaboration between James Ivory and Ismail Merchant (who died during post-production) wants to be a pulse-racing cross between ''Casablanca'' and 'The English Patient.'' But this fussy, pieced-together epic manque never develops any stamina. (Holden)

'YOURS, MINE AND OURS' (PG, 90 minutes) Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo inhabit roles originated by Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in this snug, airtight remake of the 1968 comedy about the combining of two antagonistic families with 18 children between them. Cutesy unreality prevails. (Holden)

'ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE' (PG, 113 minutes) In this extraterrestrial fantasy, adapted from a Chris Van Allsburg story, a magical board game sends two squabbling young brothers into space to fend off invaders and learn the meaning of brotherhood. The movie is sweeter, gentler and more family-friendly than ''Jumanji,'' to which it is the unofficial sequel. (Holden)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

THE BLACK CROWES, TREY ANASTASIO, THE NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALL-STARS (Tomorrow) Jam bands have long claimed New Year's Eve at Madison Square Garden. This triple bill looks toward Southern rock jams with the reunited Black Crowes, whose raspy-voiced frontman, Chris Robinson, brings a rare touch of charisma to the jam scene, and the North Mississippi All-Stars, who build their jams on the idiosyncratic riffs of blues learned at the source. Trey Anastasio's old band, Phish, used to headline New Year's Eve shows at the Garden; now, he's back with his new one. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $45 to $65. (Laura Sinagra)

BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Tomorrow) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet, smithied in the arty Nublu club scene, plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 8 p.m. and midnight, Coda, 34 East 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-3434; $50 in advance, $75 at the door. (Sinagra)

MARIAH CAREY (Tomorrow) If cramming your body into a two-block radius with a crowd of thousands to watch a glowing ball drop is the only thing that will start your year off right, you may also catch a few notes from the pop R&B star Mariah Carey, whose appearance will be the first live music performance by a singer on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve. 11:30 p.m., Times Square, free. (Sinagra)

CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH, THE NATIONAL, DR. DOG (Tomorrow) The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rockers Neutral Milk Hotel, and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. Shaggy Philly lo-fi rockers Dr. Dog open. 9:30 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25 in advance, $30 at the door. (Related article, Page 1 of Weekend.) (Sinagra)

GOV'T MULE (Tonight and tomorrow night) Gov't Mule's guitarist and leader, Warren Haynes, brings the gravity of the blues and the rolling grooves of Southern rock together with the bleary determination of grunge. His songs are haunted by death and memory, and he leads them into jams that can be both soaring and unsparing. 8, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070; tonight, $39.50 to $59.50; tomorrow, $53.50 to $73.50. (Jon Pareles)

HARLEM GOSPEL CHOIR (Sunday) Founded in 1986 by Allen Bailey, the Harlem Gospel Choir, which includes voices from several uptown church choirs, focuses its rhetoric and repertory on promoting peace and relief for the city and the nation's poor. The choir is home now after a recent tour of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Noon and 2:45 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $35. (Sinagra)

HOLLADAY JAM TOUR (Tonight) This collection of R&B hitmakers skews to the twitchy teenage side of the genre. Performers include Bow Wow (who has dropped his diminutive ''L'il''), the up-and-coming youngster Chris Brown and the singers Omarion and Ciara, posited as a new Aaliyah, a singer who could ride hip-hop beats with a conspiratorial, low-key urgency. Also appearing will be Dem Franchize Boys, Marques (Batman) Houston and Trey Songz. 7 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741; $39.75 to $54.75. (Sinagra)

JAMES HUNTER (Thursday) The English soul singer James Hunter aims for a sound that draws on the influences of Sam Cooke and Van Morrison. 7 p.m., the Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 533-7235; $5 suggested donation. (Sinagra)

JORDAN KNIGHT, JEFF TIMMONS (Thursday) This pairing unites two former boy-band cuties, New Kids on the Block's Jordan Knight -- a strong singer who hasn't enjoyed a post-Kids success equal to that of the later boy-band heir Justin Timberlake -- and 98 Degrees's Jeff Timmons, who just might be better off than his more famous former bandmate and soon-to-be Jessica Simpson's ex-hubby, Nick Lachey. 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144; $25 in advance; $50 V.I.P. ticket (includes entry into the room at 6 p.m. and an autographed poster). (Sinagra)

KUDU (Tomorrow) Anchored by Sylvia Gordon's vocals, the hip-hop-inflected Kudu plays an electronic blend of jazz and soul. This show will also include performances by Certainly, Sir; Langhorne Slim; and Roy Dank & Brennan Green, among others. 11 p.m., Asterisk* Art Project, 258 Johnson Avenue, between Bushwick Avenue and White Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn; details at www.reupmag.com; $20 at the door, $15 with Web site R.S.V.P. (Sinagra)

LITTLE STEVEN'S UNDERGROUND GARAGE: ESPN NEW YEAR'S EVE (Tomorrow) This expensive event makes strange bedfellows of wispy hipsters and the ESPN rock 'n' jock crowd.

 Opera

'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Monday) The Met is bringing back its colorful John Copley production of Donizetti's delightful romantic comedy about a shy Tuscan country bumpkin who, thanks to a quack doctor who sells him a love potion (in truth, a bottle of wine), is emboldened to approach the girl he pines for from afar. The cast looks strong, with the ardent tenor Ramon Vargas and the splendid soprano Ruth Ann Swenson in the leading roles. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)

'DIE FLEDERMAUS' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Most stagings of Strauss's ever popular operetta, including some revivals of the Met's 1986 Otto Schenk production, seem uncomfortable with the mix of silliness and cynicism in the story of playful infidelities in 1870's Vienna. But the Met's current presentation boasts a winning cast of singers who, for the most part, take the story seriously and give subtle portrayals, especially Bo Skovhus as the ladies' man Gabriel von Eisenstein, Sondra Radvanovsky as his knowing wife, Marlis Petersen as the perky chambermaid Adele and Earle Patriarco as the wily Dr. Falke. Jacques Lacombe conducts a lithe and bracing performance. And with the masterly comedic actor Bill Irwin as the drunken jailer Frosch, the show has plenty of hilarity. Those attending the New Year's Eve gala performance can count on surprise guests showing up to sing during the party scene in Act II. (There will be several cast changes for Wednesday's performance.) Tomorrow night at 7 and Wednesday night at 7:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $50 to $250 tomorrow, $26 to $175 on Wednesday. (Tommasini)

'LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR' (Tonight and Thursday) Sometimes, late in the run of a production at the Met, the changes in casting can get a little dizzying. Such is the case for the final two performances this season of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' starting tonight. There will be a new Lucia, the established Korean soprano Youngok Shin. The young Italian tenor Giuseppe Filianoti, who made an impressive Met debut earlier in the run as Lucia's beloved Edgardo, returns to the cast to sing the role tonight. But Ramon Vargas, a veteran bel canto tenor, takes over on Thursday. Edoardo Muller, who has been conducting the revolving-door ''Lucia'' casts all along, provides some consistency on the podium. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $205. (Tommasini)

'WOZZECK' (Tomorrow and Tuesday) Alban Berg's bleak atonal opera may not strike many people as quite the thing to usher in the New Year. But James Levine is a masterly interpreter of this musically stunning and dramatically compelling work, which he keeps bringing back to the Met in a noble effort to make ''Wozzeck'' essential to the company's repertory. With Mark Lamos's arrestingly abstract 1997 production and an inspired cast headed by Alan Held in the title role, this revival should be seen by all serious opera fans. Mr. Levine elicits a searingly beautiful performance from the great Met orchestra. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. and Tuesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000; $26 to $220. (Tommasini)

Classical

BACHWORKS (Tomorrow) Over the last decade, traversals of Bach's ''Brandenburg'' Concertos have joined Handel's ''Messiah'' as seasonal favorites. Don't let the fact that the works have no historical connection to the holidays worry you; neither does ''Messiah,'' which was composed for performances around Easter. Anthony Newman leads the BachWorks ensemble in these six great compositions. 8 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; $35 to $100; $20 for students and 65+. (Allan Kozinn)

GILBERT AND SULLIVAN GALA (Tomorrow) The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players, experts in the repertory of their namesakes, usher out 2005 in the spirit of lightheartedness, parody and sheer silliness, with an evening of scenes and songs from the Savoyard canon. In addition to the planned excerpts, the troupe, supported by a full orchestra, will take audience requests. 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; $55 to $75. (Kozinn)

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Tuesday and Thursday) The German violinist Julia Fischer says that the second movement of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto reminds her of Lensky's aria from ''Eugene Onegin.'' Hearing her make that link in her performance should be enlightening. The program also includes a rarity, the Weber Bassoon Concerto, with Judith LeClair as the soloist, and Lorin Maazel's reading of the Sibelius Fifth Symphony. That program straddles the New Year's weekend, but for New Year's Eve, Mr. Maazel and company are joined by the soprano Angela Gheorghiu for an evening of Italian opera arias. On Thursday, the young Canadian violinist James Ehnes is the soloist in Walton's sumptuous Violin Concerto. Lorin Maazel also conducts Wagner's ''Flying Dutchman'' Overture and the Dvorak Seventh Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500; $26 to $94, except $80 to $235 tomorrow. (Kozinn)

WILLIAM TRAFKA (Tomorrow) Mr. Trafka, the organist and music director at St. Bartholomew's Church, plans to while away the final hour of 2005 playing works by Bach, Widor, Langlais, Handel, Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, with Copland's ''Fanfare for the Common Man'' closing the concert at the stroke of midnight. 11 p.m., St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue at 50th Street, (212) 378-0248; free. (Kozinn)

YING QUARTET (Thursday) This quartet continues its series of enterprising programs at Symphony Space with an evening built around the music of Tod Machover.

SARAH EAST JOHNSON (Thursday through Feb. 19) Ms. Johnson's award-winning, all-women company, LAVA, presents ''(w)HOLE'' (short for ''The Whole History of Life on Earth''), its first new work since 2003. Using trapeze, Chinese acrobatics and swing dancing, among other things, the company tackles rock formation, punctuated equilibrium theory and magnetic polarity reversal with its usual strength and verve.

 Museums

Asia society: 'Vietnam: Destination for the New Millennium -- The Art of Dinh Q. LE,' through Jan. 15. Born in Vietnam, Mr. Le moved to the United States at 11 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the School of Visual Arts in New York. This small exhibition presents high-concept photographic and sculptural works about the Vietnam War and its effects, as well as a pair of sleek sculptures representing communications satellites that satirize Vietnam's plans to enter the Space Age and the global consumerist economy. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400.(Ken Johnson)

Brooklyn Museum: 'Edward Burtynsky: Manufactured Landscapes,' through Jan. 15. Large, expertly made color images by a Canadian photographer show industrial subjects like marble quarries in India, a tire dump in California and modern development in China. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000. (Johnson)

CHELSEA ART MUSEUM: 'THE BODY IMAGE IN CRISTOBAL GABARRON'S ART, 1963-2005,' through Jan. 14. A member of the mid-20th-century European Informal art movement based on mentally improvised rather than formal motifs, this Spanish artist is concerned with the body but not in its traditional manifestations. His abstractions and semiabstractions give it a morphing, metaphysical presence; sometimes they involve the depiction of actual body parts, but they rely more on textures, colors and vague forms to evoke the body's ever-shifting sense of itself. But for all the blustery vigor on display, the work gives the viewer a powerful sense of been-there-seen-that. 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-0719. (Grace Glueck)

* Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'FASHION IN COLORS,' through March 26. Drawn from the collection of the Kyoto Costume Institute in Japan, this sumptuous show arranges 68 often lavish Western gowns and ensembles according to the colors of the spectrum and reinforces their progress with a posh color-coordinated installation design. For an experience of color as color, it is hard to beat, but it also says a great deal about clothing, visual perception and beauty. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400. (Roberta Smith)

* GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'RUSSIA!,' through Jan. 11. This survey of nine centuries of Russian art ranges from 13th-century religious icons to a smattering of 21st-century works, achieving its astounding effect without resorting to a single egg, or anything else, by Faberge. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3600. (Smith)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRaPHY: 'African-American Vernacular Photography,' through Feb. 26. These days, collectors and curators prize vernacular photographs -- commercial studio portraits, postcards, snapshots and other sorts of often anonymous photographic kitsch. Here that trend intersects with a commitment to photography as a form of social documentation in an exhibition of about 70 vernacular photographs depicting African-Americans from 1860 to 1940. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000. (Johnson)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'HIROSHI SUGIMOTO: HISTORY OF HISTORY,' through Feb. 19. A personal, whimsical exhibition by this well-known Japanese photographer who incorporates into his work artifacts he has collected, particularly from East Asia and Japan. Mr. Sugimoto's reach is long and his range is broad, from fossils to textiles to undersea dioramas to Japanese calligraphy to the Trylon and Perisphere (a minisculpture) that symbolized the 1939 New York World's Fair. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155. (Glueck)

JEWISH MUSEUM: 'SARAH BERNHARDT: THE ART OF HIGH DRAMA,' through April 2. This exhibition is devoted to the flamboyant 19th-century actress whose name was once invoked by mothers as a warning to melodramatic daughters: ''Who do you think you are, Sarah Bernhardt?'' Its almost overstuffed roster of items includes original Felix Nadar photos of Bernhardt at 20 and the costumes she wore as Cleopatra and Joan of Arc. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200. (Edward Rothstein)

* Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'FRA ANGELICO,' through Jan. 29. An exhibition as rare as it is sublime brings the divine Angelico down to earth, showing how he had the best of both worlds, using the innovations of the Renaissance to parlay the radiant colors, gilded surfaces and doll-like figures of Gothic art into a final flowering. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Smith)

MET: 'DAVID MILNE: PAINTING TOWARD THE LIGHT,' through Jan 29. Watercolors by a Canadian painter little known in the United States, although he spent some 25 years in New York City and other parts of the state. In his quiet, spare renditions of urban vignettes, country landscapes, trees and domestic life, David Milne (1882-1953) focused mainly on aesthetic matters, like color, line and light, while skirting the avant-garde. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710. (Glueck)

* MET: Robert Rauschenberg: 'Combines,' through April 2. Big and handsome almost to a fault. There's something weird about seeing once joyfully rude and over-the-top contraptions from the 1950's and 60's lined up like choirboys in church, with their ties askew and shirttails out. But even enshrined, the combines still manage to seem incredibly fresh and odd, almost otherworldly. I thought of a medieval treasury -- all the rich colors and lights and intricate details. The most beautiful tend to be the early ones: large but delicate, with a subtle, fugitive emotional pitch. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

* Museum of Modern Art: Beyond the Visible: 'The Art of Odilon Redon,' through Jan. 23. The timing was off for the big Odilon Redon retrospective in Chicago in 1994. The art world's mind was on identity politics and neo-conceptualism. Fin-de-siecle drawings of moony monsters and lamp-bright flowers existed on some other planet. Now there's another Redon survey, smaller, very beautiful, culminating in his lush, pixilated late paintings. And the timing for it is just right. 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400. (Holland Cotter)

* Museum of Modern Art: 'ELIZABETH MURRAY,' through Jan. 9. Here is the complete range of shape-shifting, dizzily colored pictures that Elizabeth Murray has produced over four decades. The colors are noisy, the harmonies pungent, the scale big and bold. While art-world fashion has drifted here and there, Ms. Murray has stuck to her craft, with all its difficulties and at the occasional cost of failure and neglect. Her show is a meaty, openhearted, eye-popping event. (See above.) (Kimmelman)

Museum of Modern Art: 'PIXAR: 20 YEARS OF ANIMATION,' through Feb. 6. With more than 500 drawings, collages, storyboards and sculptured models by 80 artists; numerous projections; and a mesmerizing three-dimensional zoetrope, this exhibition offers a detailed glimpse of the creative and technological processes behind such computer-animation wonders as ''Toy Story,'' ''Monsters, Inc.'' and ''Finding Nemo.'' In the end, nothing has as much art or magic as these films themselves, but the concentrated effort and expertise that go into them is nonetheless something of a wonder, too. (See above.) (Smith)

EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what Latino art means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212) 831-7272. (Cotter)

* The Museum for African Art: 'Lasting Foundations: The Art oF Architecture in Africa,' through Jan. 6. Like most architectural shows, this one uses lots of photographs and texts, and more than many, it also incorporates objects: Dogon door locks from Mali; carved Igbo doors from Nigeria; Swahili window frames, rich with Indian and Islamic motifs, from Kenya. World Financial Center Courtyard Gallery, 220 Vesey Street, Lower Manhattan, (718) 784-7700. (Cotter)

neue galerie: 'Egon Schiele: The Ronald S. Lauder and Serge Sabarsky Collections,' through Feb. 20. This extensive exhibition mostly of works on paper gives an informative account of the regrettably brief career of one of the 20th century's great draftsmen and romantic rebels. Schiele's self-portraits, drawings and watercolors of sexy young women still burn with fires of narcissistic yearning, erotic desire and bohemian dissent. 1048 Fifth Avenue, (212) 628-6200. (Johnson)

* Rubin Museum of Art : 'What is it? HimalAyan Art,' For a basic guide to the art of Tibet and Nepal, you will do no better than to take a slow walk through this new show, which, using an array of gorgeous objects, distills knotty visual and spiritual systems to a soothing but stimulating entry-level form. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000. (Cotter)

* Studio Museum in Harlem: 'FREQUENCY,' through March 12. Despite some marked unevenness, this display of new and recently emerged talent confirms the current vitality of black art, contemporary art and midsize New York museums. Names to look out for include Kalup Linzy, Leslie Hewitt, Jeff Sonhouse, Shinique Amie Smith, Demetrius Oliver, Michael Paul Britto, Nick Cave, Mickalene Thomas and Michael Queenland, but don't stop there. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Smith)

* Whitney Museum of American Art: 'THE ART OF RICHARD TUTTLE,' through Feb. 5. For 40 years Richard Tuttle has murmured the ecstasies of paying close attention to the world's infinitude of tender incidents, making oddball assemblages of prosaic ephemera, which, at first glance, belie their intense deliberation and rather monumental ambition. Out of cord, tin, Styrofoam, florist's wire and bubble wrap he has devised objects whose status is not quite sculpture or drawing or painting but some combination of the three, and whose exquisiteness is akin to that of jewelry. His outstanding retrospective is a cross between a kindergarten playroom and a medieval treasury. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800) 944-8639. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Uptown

Charles Biederman: 'Works from the 30's' One of the most interestingly maverick and talented of between-the-wars American Modernists, Biederman left New York in 1942 for Minnesota, where he continued to make art and write art theory until his death in 2004. This small exhibition of biomorphic abstract paintings and one glossy construction of squares and knobs from the 1930's shows what an excellent student of European Surrealism and Constructivism he was. Meredith Ward, 60 East 66th Street, (212) 744-7306, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Richard Pousette-Dart: 'Presences: The Imploding of Color' Though routinely associated with Abstract Expressionists, Pousette-Dart had metaphysical and symbolist interests that distinguished him from better-known members of that group. In the 1960's and 70's, he turned to what you could call Pointillist Color Field Painting, and though the sensuous impact of light, color and thickly stippled paint is strongly asserted, the works are also animated by intimations of cosmic mysticism. Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

* 'THE THIRD EYE: FANTASIES, DREAMS AND VISIONS' The ostensible theme for this dizzying, diverting assortment of 89 very high-end drawings and prints is the fantastical, visionary strain of Romanticism that persists through Symbolism right up to now. Goya gets things officially started. The show takes in contemporaries or near-contemporaries like Eva Hesse, Basquiat and Matthew Ritchie. It rambles around two floors in no particular order: a connoisseur's heaven. Richard L. Feigen & Company, 34 East 69th Street, (212) 628-0700, through Jan. 28. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: 57th Street

Gerhard Richter This celebrated German master presents two sets of paintings. One set, made in his familiar manner of squeegeeing layers of wet paint, is enigmatically punctuated by a photograph of Mr. Richter's own painting of flying fighter planes from the 1960's. The other, consisting of large canvases bearing blurry, all-gray patterns based on silicate molecules, casts a spell of visionary pessimism. Marian Goodman, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

'Structure' Hardly any artist today takes geometry as seriously as certain American Modernists did, following the lead of Mondrian in the mid-20th century. So this well-produced show of geometric relief sculptures by Ilya Bolotowsky, Nikolai Kasak and Charles Biederman, among others, comes as a nice surprise. Eli Bornstein's truly beautiful, neatly gridded constructions of floating wood blocks painted lovely confectionery colors are alone worth the trip. Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

Abetz/Drescher The Berlin-based collaborators Maike Abetz and Oliver Drescher paint large, busily detailed pictures of Renaissance ruins densely populated by fashion models, broken guitars, televisions and naked figures from pagan myth in a style you might call psychedelic Pre-Raphaelite. Though not impressive formally or technically, they do capture a certain wildly eclectic and deeply narcissistic state of youthful consciousness. Goff & Rosenthal, 537B West 23rd Street, (212) 675-0461, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Marina Abramovic: 'Balkan Erotic Epic' This performance artist's staged video tableaus illustrating beliefs about the magical efficacy of certain sexually charged acts are interesting and amusing but less arousing than you might have hoped. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

ELLEN ALTFEST: 'STILL LIVES' Painted from life in the studio and outside, these thoughtful images of plants, cactuses, logs and driftwood reflect old-fashioned painterly values but still manage a fresh intensity of surface, space, form and intention. Bellwether Gallery, 134 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 929-5959, through Jan. 21. (Smith)

Carolina Raquel Antich: 'All of a Sudden' An Argentine who lives in Venice, where she was included in last summer's biennale, Ms. Antich makes extremely spare paintings and drawings of children that exude moods of such sweet innocence that you can't help suspecting something malevolent lurking just beyond the outer edges of her imagery. Florence Lynch, 531-539 West 25th Street, (212) 924-3290, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Nobuyoshi Araki, 'Painting Flower and Diaries' Mr. Araki is one of Japan's great photographers, but his installation of pictures of tied-up nude young women interspersed with pictures of exotic flowers garishly slathered with paint is too fashionably transgressive. Anton Kern, 532 West 20th Street, (212) 367-9663, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

Miki Carmi: 'Psychic Readymades' This young Israeli-born painter makes strangely creepy pictures of oversize bald heads based on those of elderly members of his family. He lavishes painterly attention on veins, age spots, baggy eyes, wrinkles and drooping lips, and he floats the heads like weird balloons against white backgrounds. The paintings are far from beautiful, but their unsettling impact feels right for the often confusing roles that elders play in our psychic lives. Stux, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-1600, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

* ROY DE FOREST: NEW PAINTINGS At 75, this underappreciated West Coast artist, a sort of Neo-Expressionist before the fact, brings a new vehemence of color and texture, amplified by clearer compositions, to his comic-sinister universe of bright-eyed, zoned-out men and animals. George Adams, 525 West 26th Street, (212) 564-8480, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

RYAN DOOLAN: 'RATIONAL GAYZ' This appealingly arcane debut by a Scottish artist includes small, vaguely photo-based paintings and a photo-performance work involving golf that look great in this austere but cozy new gallery. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 29th Street, (212) 481-0362, through Jan. 11. (Smith)

Matthew McCaslin This inventive sculptor plays with the tension between nature and technology. A working fountain has water flowing from sunflowers made of wide showerheads and copper pipe planted in a claw-foot bathtub. And the arrangement of a cuckoo clock and a flat-screen video view of peaceful lake waters on a natural plywood wall slyly enhances the faux-rustic ambience. Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through Jan. 14. (Johnson)

GORDON MOORE Elegantly understated paintings animated by ghostly linear figures and their shadows, which gambol before the large-paned grid of -- well, maybe a factory window. Composed of lines of different lengths and colors and various thicknesses, these antic figures seem to vibrate on and under the paintings' lightly brushed surfaces. Mr. Moore rings many intricate variations on his basic format, which, while it commits to the visible, manages to engage the mystery of what lies beyond it. Betty Cuningham Gallery, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 242-2772, through Jan. 28. (Glueck)

Annysa Ng: 'Love & Fear' A beautiful new gallery occupying two floors of a tiny brick house presents works of postmodernist faux-antiquity by a Chinese artist who has studied in Hong Kong, New York and Germany. The large, Victorian-style silhouettes are not without possibilities, though perhaps they are too Kara Walker-like; the hanging assemblages made of braided hair, fabric and found objects have an erotically stirring poetic delicacy. Holasek Weir, 502 West 27th Street, (212) 367-9093, through Jan. 20. (Johnson)

Nicholas Nixon: 'Life and Times' Among other photographs from the last 30 years, this show features Mr. Nixon's famous ''Brown Sisters,'' a set of group portraits of four sisters made annually, starting in 1975. It is almost painfully touching to see the beautiful siblings evolve from teenagers to late middle age. And then you begin to wonder how long this can go on before one of the five participants will no longer be available. Yossi Milo, 525 West 25th Street, (212) 414-0370, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

* LAMAR PETERSON In a show that is transitional in a good way, this promising young artist expands his reach, taking his bright, dystopic portrayals of the American dream onto canvas and into distinctive collages that pit the hand against the camera with succinct bluntness. Fredericks & Freiser, 536 West 24th Street, (212) 633-6555, through Jan. 21. (Smith)

PAULA SCHER: 'THE MAPS' Big paintings in the form of maps of Europe, North America, Los Angeles and Long Island combine abstraction and eccentric cartography with invigorating, subtly comical verve. Maya Stendhal, 545 West 20th Street, (212) 366-1549, through Jan 21. (Johnson)

Felix Schramm: 'Comber' It looks as if a tornado ripped parts off an ordinary house and slammed them into the gallery, creating a Cubist-Expressionist-style environment that was, in fact, carefully designed and assembled by this young and innovative German sculptor. Grimm/Rosenfeld, 530 West 25th Street, (212) 352-2388, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Catherine Sullivan: 'The Chittendens' In a multiprojection video work, professional actors, none speaking, perform scripted sequences of actions. At first the effect is comical, but humor is overridden by an academic mission to deconstruct codes of behavior in film, theater and real life. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, through Jan. 21. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo and TriBeCa

* JIM DRAIN and ARA PETERSON: 'HYPNOGOOGIA' With a kaleidoscopic, mirrored DVD installation and multifaceted sculptures that resemble gaudy, 12-foot-high soccer balls, two of contemporary art's most interesting collaborators have masterminded a kind of wonderland of digital and analog psychedelia. The best piece is best experienced by descending on a ladder into a kind of rabbit hole. The total effect is amazing, if a little vacant. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 343-7300, through Jan. 28. (Smith)

'The Last Generation' More or less obscurely, this group show addresses how digital forms of communication and representation are altering human experience. Best are Kota Ezawa's black-and-white animation of a scene from ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''; Jan Mancuska's text and video sculpture; motorized military hats doing synchronized movements, by Malachi Farrell; and Laurent Montaron's combination of a digital photograph of someone sleeping and an audio system that plays on headphones the sounds a sleeper makes. Apexart, 291 Church Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, through Jan. 7. (Johnson)

Last Chance

* THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'MEMLING'S PORTRAITS' Just over 30 portrait paintings by Hans Memling survive from the 15th century. Of those, about 20 are on view at the Frick. That's a whale of a lot of paintings by any major early Northern European artist to be in any one place at one time, and there is little question that this show -- two rooms of compact pictures, each picture a main event -- will figure on any shortlist of outstanding events of the year. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)

* MET: 'THE PERFECT MEDIUM: PHOTOGRAPHY AND THE OCCULT' Hands down the most hilarious, not to mention the most charming, exhibition the Met has done in years: an assemblage of 19th-century and early-20th-century spirit photographs, seance reportage and other examples of transparent tomfoolery. Like all examples of great humor, it is, at heart, also a sneakily serious affair. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)

* Met: 'VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS' Think again before deciding you've got a case of van Gogh fatigue and skipping this exhibition -- not just because the focus is on drawings, which on the whole are less well known than the paintings and were so important to the early spread of his reputation, but also because in the flesh, great art, no matter how often it has been dully reproduced or mistaken for a price tag or overrun by crowds, retains its dignity and originality and utter strangeness. (See above.) Closing tomorrow. (Kimmelman)

NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: BRIAN JUNGEN Aware that the Nike Air Jordan sneakers worn by the basketball star Michael Jordan are a fetish item for youth throughout the world, Mr. Jungen, a young British Columbian partly of Northwest Coast Indian descent, has cleverly refashioned these trophy sneakers into ceremonial masks that strikingly suggest those produced by Northwest Coast tribes.. A sardonic and wizardly craftsman is at work here. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 219-1222, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)

Derek Walcott: 'Another Life' In his spare time, the 1992 Nobel laureate in literature makes amateurish but appealing Impressionist-style oil and watercolor paintings of Caribbean towns and beaches. June Kelly, 591 Broadway, SoHo, (212) 226-1660, closing today. (Johnson)

Richard Walker: 'Beacon Road Paintings' Working on compact panels in a deft, painterly style that mixes influences of Alex Katz and Neil Welliver, this Scottish artist creates vividly atmospheric views of snowy woods and other quiet nature scenes. Alexander, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 755-2828, closing today. (Johnson)

HEADLINE: Overseas, the Trains and the Market for Them Accelerate 

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: KREFELD, Germany 

 BODY:
Even more high-speed trains? Europe must be kidding.
 In one vast hall, workers in blue overalls are putting the finishing touches on what would, on an old-fashioned train, be a locomotive, except that it houses a spacious conference room with a large table and seven comfortable armchairs.
 In an adjacent hall, others are attaching what look like ordinary wheel trucks to a rail car, except that these contain electric motors that will essentially do the locomotive's job of pulling the train.
 ''We're now turning out a car every one or two days,'' said Michael Gessner, project manager at the Siemens rail car plant in Uerdingen, a suburb of this industrial city. ''When we begin the Chinese order, it will be two a day.'' 
 Work at the Siemens factory illustrates a coming together of two developments in high-speed passenger train travel: technical breakthroughs in the way the bullet-shaped trains run, and the opening of vast new markets in Eastern Europe and Asia that are combining to give a steady boost to the business. 
 Unless they have traveled abroad, most Americans have had little first-hand experience with high-speed trains, and the problems with the Acela service on Amtrak have left its customers with a slightly bad taste. Hence, as countries including Italy and Spain -- and emerging markets like China and Russia -- open their pocketbooks for huge high-speed railway development, the United States remains on the sidelines, vulnerable to losing out on new technologies for propulsion and vehicle control.
 For those who thought railroads were basically 19th-century technology, think again. Thanks to miniaturization, newer trains have motors built into the axles of every second rail car, rather than concentrating the pulling power in the locomotive, as was done in traditional pull-push trains. 
 The technology makes the trains lighter and enables them to go faster and to brake and accelerate more easily, while causing less wear on rails and wheels. 
 And the newer generation of very high-speed trains has other breakthrough features, including so-called eddy current brakes, which employ electromagnetic fields rather than brake disks for slowing and stopping. 
 ''The carriages are stable and light and of very high speed,'' said Francois Lacote , senior vice president in Alstom's transport division, which will install the new technology in the fourth generation of its TGV. 
 (The French manufacturer Alstom, like most of the industry, considers high-speed trains to be those with a top cruising speed of 150 miles per hour; trains with a top cruising speed 210 miles per hour are considered very high speed. The Acela's top cruising speed is about 125 miles per hour.)
 In November, Siemens landed a $804 million contract to supply 60 sleek-nosed high-speed trains to the Chinese railways. The order is just one in a 15-year program to upgrade China's rail network, including the introduction of 180-mile-per-hour bullet trains. ''Up to 2020 they want 12,000 kilometers of high-speed rail,'' or 7,200 miles, said Dietrich G. Moller, president of Siemens' trains division.
 At about the same time, Siemens signed a preliminary contract for high-speed trains to connect Moscow and St. Petersburg. Like China, Russia, too, has gigantic railway ambitions. The line may one day continue beyond St. Petersburg to Helsinki, Finland, and past Moscow to Russian cities like Nizhny Novgorod.
 In South Korea, Alstom, the inventor of the train a grande vitesse, or TGV, is supplying 185-mile-per-hour trains for a five-year $17 billion project that has connected Pusan and Seoul. 
 The growth in Asia is giving the small club of high-speed passenger train manufacturers a lift just as Western European governments are watching their budgets more closely. Europe's dense population and geographical features like the Alps make the construction of high-speed lines costly. 
 Moreover, environmental groups often resist the construction of new train lines, saying they bring noise and unwanted development and divert money from more urgent needs.
 Nonetheless, Spain hopes to have a Madrid-Barcelona link open by 2008; France and Germany are upgrading the line from Paris through Strasbourg and on to the German cities of Stuttgart and Frankfurt for 210-mile trains.
 ''What has happened is that cuts in travel time have stimulated demand'' for trains, said Ernest Godward, an economist with Scott Wilson Railways, a British consultancy.
 American industry is largely sitting this one out. While some American companies, like the electro-motive division of General Motors and the MotivePower Industries division of the Wabtec Corporation, are doing brisk business with Chinese rail operators, their business is mainly freight, while the market for high-speed passenger trains is limited to a small group that has shrunk in recent years through a wave of mergers and acquisitions.
 In 2001, Bombardier, the Canadian transport company, acquired Adtranz, a German-based rail equipment maker; at about the same time, Alstom bought Fiat Ferroviaria, Fiat's rail equipment division and the original developer of technology that enables high-speed trains to tilt into curves, much the way a motorcycle can.
 (Alstom and Bombardier installed the technology on the Acela in the United States, but faulty measurements of the train's right-of-way rendered it virtually useless.)
 Within Europe, the three leaders are vying to grab market share with snazzier and ever faster models. 
 Siemens introduced distributed power, meaning that electric motors pulling the train are distributed through the train's cars; that technology was used in trains for a high-speed line from Frankfurt to Cologne and will be used in trains on the Barcelona-Madrid connection.
 Alstom will introduce similar technology on the new Paris-to-Strasbourg TGV line. 
 Bombardier, fearful of being left out of the running, introduced in October a concept train called the Zefiro, which will include most of the technology employed by the market leaders. Neil Harvey, Bombardier's communications director for Europe, said the Zefiro would have all the latest traction and braking technology and would be loaded with features like electronic seat reservations, power outlets at every seat and free Wi-Fi. 
 In Europe, to be sure, the growth of the market is not without its obstacles. Some argue that the cost of high-speed rail is excessive, compared with the operation of no-frills airlines, and that it only indulges a European penchant to go first class whenever possible; others say the environmental damage is too great.
 In northeast Italy, near the site of the next winter Olympics in February, environmental groups are opposing a new high-speed line and tunnel to connect Lyon in France and Turin in Italy, arguing they would drag even more industrial traffic into the Alps. The train will cross a valley that already has a conventional train line and a superhighway. ''It's incredibly costly, they're talking 13 billion euros,'' almost $16 billion, said Marco Ponti, a transportation expert at Milan's Polytechnic Institute who backs the protesters.
 Mr. Ponti likened the project to the English Channel rail tunnel, whose construction cost was almost double the original estimates. ''The Channel tunnel went bankrupt not once, but twice,'' he said.
 Mr. Ponti, a former World Bank consultant, acknowledged, however, that ''there is a place for high-speed trains for medium distances and in very densely populated areas.''
 Still, the governments in Rome and Paris are throwing their full weight behind high-speed rail. West of Turin, engineers are blasting a tunnel through the craggy Alps, and this fallItaly took tenders on 30 very high-speed trains and says it wants to acquire 100 in all. Its master plan foresees building high-speed lines in the shape of a T, from Milan in the north to Naples in the south, and from Turin in the west to Venice in the east.
 In Asia, too, the European train builders face challenges. For one, there is competition from the fabled Shinkansen of Japan, the first high-speed train to go into service. That design was chosen by Taiwan for a 210-mile-per-hour train inaugurated last year from Taipei to the southern port of Kaoshiung. And while Asian contracts are lucrative, most countries insist on technology transfers including the assembly of most of the trains in local factories. Such requirements put pressure on the Europeans to continuously upgrade their technology or risk being overtaken by their own customers. 
 ''The key is new technology,'' said Mr. Lacote of Alstom. ''The Chinese market is very interesting,'' he said. ''They have the culture; they want to acquire the technology.''
 Of course, not all of the Chinese acquisitions will be very high speed. Bombardier, which has a strong presence in China thanks to its Adtranz acquisition, does a brisk business in light rail and subway car construction. This year, Bombardier signed a long-range agreement to supply trains to China with cruising speeds of 120 miles per hour.
 The Siemens contract for China calls for it to supply 60 trains with a cruising speed of 180 miles an hour to link Beijing to the coastal city of Tianjin.
 And the United States? Despite the debacle of the Acela, European rail executives say that heavy population concentrations on the East and West Coasts and in the Midwest around Chicago make high-speed trains a natural. Mr. Moller of Siemens said, ''When the skies and the roads are full, they will turn to trains.''
 Mr. Lacote of Alstom said three conditions had to be fulfilled for a country to turn to high-speed rail: the political will, large population concentrations, and a level of economic prosperity adequate to pay for a rail system.
 ''In the United States you have the second two,'' he said. ''I am not sure that you have the first.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth May Hinge On Businesses

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The housing market is gradually fading as a prop for the economy, eroding a source of increased wealth that allowed consumers to borrow and spend avidly in recent years. 
 Meanwhile, the bond market, where short-term interest rates are now slightly above long-term rates in what is known as an inverted yield curve, suggests that the economy is headed for a sharp slowdown, perhaps even a recession. The stock market rally earlier this year has petered out.
So why do most forecasters predict that economic growth will remain relatively strong next year? Perhaps because they are counting on other sectors that have been relatively weak -- particularly stepped-up business investment -- to help sustain the robust expansion of the last 30 months. 
 ''I think the surprise will be that housing prices and housing sales will decelerate, but the economy will do just fine,'' said Richard Berner, chief domestic economist for Morgan Stanley. 
 Mr. Berner is not alone in his optimism. Despite some worrisome indicators, only a handful of the 53 economists surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators predict that the growth rate in 2006 will drop much below the 3.7 percent average so far this year.
 That outlook also assumes that consumer spending, deprived of the lift from rising home prices and mortgage refinancing, will not drop very much. 
 Despite high debt levels, it is still safe to say that Americans will somehow continue to buy on credit, and with energy prices falling, wages now diverted to gasoline purchases should be freed up to spend on the array of goods and services that drives the economy.
 ''One of the big stories today is that people are so happy with $2 gas,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, explaining a big jump in consumer confidence this month. ''There is nothing better than a relative price decrease.''
 Forecasters are notorious for missing major turning points in the economy. Still, as home construction and home sales subside and consumer spending eases off, most experts see a different powerhouse kicking in to keep the economy on its upward path. The prime candidate is capital investment -- the spending by business on all the equipment and facilities needed for production.
 Business contributed powerfully to the boom of the late 1990's by investing generously in high-tech machinery and computers, but then cut back sharply in the dot-com bust, helping to weaken the economy. Now an upturn in this spending in the spring and summer months has raised expectations that corporate America has finally begun to replace aging and outdated equipment, drawing on record profits to do so.
 ''Business has tons and tons of capability to spend,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. ''The longer the recovery keeps going and stock prices go up, the more and more confident business is going to become and the more it will spend on its operations.''
 The anecdotal evidence is mixed on this score. Verizon, for example, invested $15 billion this year to expand its wireless system and start building a fiber optic network that will allow it to compete more directly with cable television providers. The same hefty sum is to be spent in 2006. But that is not enough. For the economy as a whole, matching last year's outlay, no matter how hefty, adds nothing to economic growth. 
 There must be more investment, and a new survey of chief financial officers, sponsored by Baruch College and Financial Executives International, suggests that there will be. Two-thirds said their companies planned to increase capital spending in 2006 by 8 or 9 percent, a rise reminiscent of the late 1990's.
 But Haas Automation in Oxnard, Calif., a big manufacturer of the machine tools installed in factories to cut and shape metal, expects sales to be only marginally better next year. ''Our customers are inhibited by the high cost of energy and steel,'' said John Roth, Haas's director of customer service, explaining the restraint he is seeing in capital spending. ''They are concerned that the prices they are forced to charge make them less competitive.'' 
 Apart from capital spending, many forecasters expect contributions to growth from other sources. Exports should rise, partly in response to a weakening dollar against the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen, and partly because Boeing is selling so many aircraft abroad.
 Rapid inventory depletion since July should prompt retailers and wholesalers to restock their shelves and warehouses, increasing production with their orders. At the state level, budget surpluses, or smaller deficits -- unexpected a year ago -- have already resulted in more public spending.
 ''We can sustain the expansion,'' said Lee Price, director of research at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, who is usually more pessimistic than his colleagues in forecasting. ''Come January and February,'' he said, ''people are going to get hammered with huge heating bills. But once they get past that, they'll be O.K. I have no beef with a forecast of 3.5 percent G.D.P. growth next year.''
 Forecasters tend to see the economic glass as half full rather than half empty, and they have reason for that optimism. The economy has grown -- expanding its output of goods and services -- every year but one since 1990. 
 Even in 2001, a year in which a recession occurred, there was enough growth to offset the contraction in two of the quarters. Moreover, consumers kept spending at an ever-greater rate right through the relatively brief downturn.
 Given this history, nothing in the current array of statistics, short of a crash in housing prices, suggests that a recession is in the offing. To the contrary, the consensus forecast is that the gross domestic product will grow by a respectable 3.4 percent in 2006, Blue Chip reports. 
 The beef for Mr. Price and for others is that robust expansion is not making the nation's workers better off. The current expansion, unlike the one in the late 1990's, has failed to lift real incomes. 
 Wages and salaries have risen, but often by less than inflation. Real hourly earnings -- that is, wages adjusted for inflation -- fell this year for 80 percent of all workers, according to new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Not since the early to mid-1990's has the wage loss been so broad. So far, however, this backsliding has not inhibited consumer spending. For most of this decade, Americans have spent beyond their incomes, borrowing the difference to keep consumption rising. 
 The steady rise in home prices helped them to do this, providing the wherewithal through mortgage refinancing, home equity loans and other forms of credit. Falling interest rates encouraged the process. 
 With home prices leveling off and the Federal Reserve pushing up interest rates, that big source of consumer credit may be on the verge of shrinking sharply. For now, holiday spending suggests that it is still fairly robust. Consumer outlays are likely to erode next year, however, as the enthusiasm from falling gasoline prices wears off and borrowing against one's home becomes more difficult, Mr. Curtin says. 
 But Nigel Gault of Global Insight, a forecasting and data gathering firm, said there was not cause for much worry. While he is expecting a slowdown in growth next year, he is not looking for the economy to plummet.
 ''It is very unlikely that business spending can do so much that it can keep the growth rate of the overall economy from falling,'' he said. ''But it can prevent a rapid plunge and hopefully it will.''

HEADLINE: Shares Decline as Investors Do Some Year-End Selling 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks fell in light trading yesterday as investors sold shares of some of 2005's strongest performers, including Apple Computer, before the close of the year.
 A rebound in crude oil prices and the trading in some of the year's highfliers kept the three major stock indexes in a narrow range for most of the day, with the downturn coming late in the session. The decline left the Dow barely higher for the year.
 Shares of Apple, up about 130 percent since the start of the year, fell 2.9 percent, to $71.45, and dragged on the Nasdaq. 
 Intel, another gainer this year and a Dow component, fell 1.5 percent, to $25.07.
 Crude prices rebounded above $60 a barrel and helped drive down the shares of Dow industrial companies like I.B.M., off 0.8 percent at $82.40, and United Technologies, down 1 percent at $56.33. Crude for February delivery rose 50 cents, to settle at $60.32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Volume was lighter than average, with about 1.03 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 ''With volume so low and just one more trading day for the year, investors decided to consolidate some of the year's gains by selling some shares,'' said Michael Viracola, a managing director for trading at Adams Harkness in Boston.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 11.44 points, or 0.11 percent, to end at 10,784.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 3.75 points, or 0.30 percent, at 1,254.42. The Nasdaq composite index was down 10.78 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,218.16.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 3/32 in price at 101 4/32, yielding 4.36 percent, down from 4.37 percent on Wednesday. That left it yielding 0.01 percent less than the existing two-year note, in another mild inversion of the yield curve.
 On the economic front, sales of existing homes fell 1.7 percent in November, to an annual rate of 6.97 million units as inventories climbed, the National Association of Realtors said. In contrast, an index of Midwest business activity, released by the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, was higher than expected.
 Separate reports showed first-time claims for jobless pay rose last week, while the number of help-wanted ads in American newspapers increased modestly in November.
 ''Some people are beginning to get concerned with the housing market,'' said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at the Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management, with $15 billion in assets. ''That is enough to put some pressure on home builders and home-improvement stocks.''
 Shares of Home Depot, the world's biggest home improvement retailer, declined 0.9 percent, or 35 cents, to $40.74 and were among the biggest drags on the Dow. Shares of the luxury home builder Toll Brothers slid 1.5 percent, or 55 cents, to $35.27.
 General Motors shares touched their lowest price in more than 20 years. G.M. shares slipped as low as $18.33, but rebounded to close up 40 cents at $19.01. Analysts said an expected weak end to G.M.'s United States sales year; a possible change in pension accounting that could erase most shareholder equity; and investors' taking their losses in the stock to offset gains in other investments depressed G.M. stock before it bounced back.
 Shares of Hilton Hotels jumped 7.6 percent, or $1.70, to $24 after it said it would buy the hotels of its British sister company, the Hilton Group, for $5.71 billion.
 Merck gained 1.4 percent, or 44 cents, to $32.35, and helped support the Dow. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the drug maker's stock to $38 from $34, citing new medicines and recent cost-cutting efforts.
 The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes and 14-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Weld's Role At College Still Troubles Some in G.O.P.

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
Some New York Republican leaders are increasingly concerned that William F. Weld, a top Republican candidate for governor in 2006, could ultimately founder because of his past leadership of a bankrupt Kentucky college. 
 Several party leaders, including some who are influential in vote-rich counties, said that they were troubled by new revelations about his 10 months as chief executive of Decker College.
Specifically, they questioned why Mr. Weld, a former prosecutor and governor of Massachusetts, was not aware of allegations of student loan fraud that are now under federal investigation. And politically, they wondered if he could prevent the Decker mess from wounding his candidacy. 
 A New York Times article this month reported that Mr. Weld said he was unaware of the claims of fraud, even though he signed a confidentiality and severance agreement with a former dean who was making some of the allegations.
 Other former employees say that during Mr. Weld's tenure, from January to October, Decker staff members routinely falsified federal loan applications and allowed classroom cheating in order to hold onto students and their loan money. 
 Mr. Weld said he never heard of such behavior, and his lawyer has said he has been told Mr. Weld is not a target of the federal investigation. 
 The state party officials, some of whom are allies of Mr. Weld's, said he needed to provide a full accounting of his role at the school, perhaps at a news conference or at county and state party meetings this winter. Otherwise, they said, donors might opt to withhold financial support, and Democratic and Republican rivals would continue to attack his management capabilities.
 ''There are questions that need to be asked directly of Mr. Weld,'' said RoseMarie Panio, the Republican leader in Westchester County, who is neutral on Mr. Weld's candidacy for now. ''I personally have a lot of questions, and I may ask him to come before my county leaders with his answers.''
 Anthony Capozzi, chairman of the Broome County Republicans and a strong Weld supporter, said he was worried that the Decker College scandal would distract voters from looking at Mr. Weld's record in Massachusetts, where he cut taxes and overhauled Medicaid, welfare and public school programs.
 ''Hearing Bill Weld's name tied over and over to allegations of fraud is a real problem for him, and for us,'' Mr. Capozzi said. 
 He added that he and other Republican officials have recently received mail, with only a Long Island postmark, that included news articles about Mr. Weld's problems.
 The Republican leader in the Syracuse area, Robert Smith, said that average voters were reading and talking about Mr. Weld's problems at Decker, and that the candidate would be damaged if he did not put the controversy behind him soon.
 ''I'm sure he has answers, but he's going to have a lot of explaining to do,'' said Mr. Smith, who said he likes Mr. Weld but has yet to endorse a candidate.
 None of Mr. Weld's Republican allies have publicly abandoned him, and several would only express concerns without their names being published. It is too early in the 2006 campaign cycle, moreover, to judge whether he has paid, or is likely to pay, any sort of meaningful price among potential donors. 
 Mr. Weld won a straw poll among candidates for the Republican nomination at a party leadership conference on Dec. 12.
 Some county leaders, including James Ortenzio of Manhattan, predicted that Mr. Weld would flourish in spite of his time at Decker because he had more stature and experience than the other Republican candidates in the race, such as former Assemblyman John Faso and former Secretary of State Randy A. Daniels.
 In an interview this week, Mr. Weld said that no Republican leaders have asked about Decker College recently, nor have they brought up the Times article.
 He said his campaign was going well, though he added it was ''too soon to tell'' if the Decker issue would affect his fund-raising.
 ''Even if the story lingers, if it lingers in perspective, I think that's O.K.,'' Mr. Weld said. ''I would argue that, in perspective, my record of performance for 14 years as a prosecutor and as a state governor -- which is the office I'm seeking -- is more probative and relevant to this election.''
 ''I'm not aware that anyone has asserted that I did anything improper,'' he added, ''or that I condoned anyone else doing anything improper.'' He would not go beyond these remarks when asked about the concerns of county leaders.
 Mr. Weld, who came to Decker because his former venture capital firm had a stake in the for-profit trade school, drew a salary of $700,000 a year as chief executive. When the college foundered this summer, he invested $530,000 of his own money in Decker. He left both the college and his firm this fall to run for governor. 
 The college, which relied heavily on student loan money, collapsed into bankruptcy and closed this fall after federal loan aid was terminated.
 Mr. Weld said in the interview that federal and Kentucky investigators had not contacted him for questioning. 
 A Harvard-trained lawyer who was popular with voters and the media in Massachusetts, Mr. Weld has sat for hours of interviews about Decker, without lawyers or spokesmen present, and pledged to answer questions about his time there. 
 ''He's addressed every question and concern that people have put to him,'' said Vincent Reda, the Republican chairman in Rockland County. ''I think he's making Decker a non-issue.''
 The Weld campaign has continued apace, meanwhile. He is holding a New Year's party on Monday at his Long Island home for delegates and other members of the state's Republican and Conservative Parties, and he is scheduled to deliver a major speech next month laying out his ideas to improve the state's economy.

HEADLINE: If the Sidewalks Feel Jammed, Well, They Are

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Outside Grand Central Terminal, where he has tended his ''Nuts 4 Nuts'' food cart for 10 years, Eric Cabrera said he has never seen anything like it. ''Where are all these people coming from?'' he asked Wednesday night as he was swallowed by the rushing crowd.
 Four blocks west in Times Square's business improvement district, which has for years recorded rising levels of pedestrian traffic, head counters discovered something peculiar on Wednesday morning, a 57 percent increase in congestion compared to a day almost exactly a year earlier. (The survey was delayed a week because of the transit strike.) 
And by Thursday, despite a cold rain, Margaret Cooper, a visitor from Newcastle, England, found herself engulfed in a throng of umbrella-wielding shoppers in Herald Square. ''It's total chaos,'' she said.
 Crowds in Midtown during the holiday season are nothing new, but this year's crowds appear to be thicker and denser. It is a change that has not gone unnoticed by the people and machines that monitor such things. 
 Daniel A. Biederman, executive director of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation, said that by Wednesday a number of Manhattan business people ''were saying to each other independently that this may be the busiest day ever in Midtown.'' 
 Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism bureau, agreed, saying that the economic benefits of such crowds may help ease the losses suffered during the 60-hour transit strike. She said Manhattan hotels were at more than 90 percent occupancy by midweek, higher than usual for the holiday week before the arrival of visitors for New Year's Eve.
 ''I don't recall seeing these kinds of crowds, ever,'' she said.
 It will take time to count sales receipts, and any sweeping historical comparison of Manhattan crowd sizes would be hard to verify. 
 But several factors have converged to almost instantaneously transform Manhattan from a forbidding center of labor unrest during the transit strike to a magnet for visitors, said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, the group responsible for counting pedestrians. He said the crowding may be most intense today, despite a forecast for rain during the New Year's Eve festivities, as thousands of people are expected in Midtown early in the day. ''It has been a perfect storm of events,'' he said.
 There was the transit strike itself, which prompted many in the region to put off visiting Manhattan from the days before Christmas to the week before New Year's Day. With both holidays falling on Sundays, many took the intervening week off from work to shop and see the sights.
 For retailers, the popularity of giving gift cards as presents has contributed to a surge in after-Christmas shopping, industry analysts said. And for tourists from abroad, the robust exchange rates of many currencies against the dollar have turned the city into a bargain.
 Times Square, the perennial center of gridlock, is under added strain this year as it is prepared for competing New Year's Eve telecasts by Dick Clark and Ryan Seacrest, Regis Philbin and Carson Daly, and live performances by Mariah Carey and Mary J. Blige. The shows are all supported by video trucks, soundstages, portable bathrooms and forklifts that are already pushing pedestrians from the sidewalks to the streets.
 ''Unfortunately, all this theatrical infrastructure is being built while people are trying to walk through,'' Mr. Tompkins said.
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, describing the preparations for New Year's Eve, told reporters yesterday, ''We think it is going to be a larger crowd relative to what we've seen'' for previous New Year's Eve festivities.
 E-mail messages from the Times Square Alliance on Thursday, which detailed the latest pedestrian counts, were prefaced by words like ''outrageous'' and ''insane.'' The group's researchers, which clicked off mechanical counters, said that from 10:30 to 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday 9,226 pedestrians made their way along the sidewalk, at 1501 Broadway between 43rd and 44th Streets -- 57 percent more than at the same time on Dec. 18, 2004.
 Some of the city's businesses and cultural institutions were prepared for the crush. The Museum of Modern Art, which is usually closed Tuesdays, decided to open the Tuesday after Christmas to capitalize on its ''Pixar: 20 Years of Animation'' exhibit, which it had expected would draw families with children during the holiday week.
 For some pedestrians, gridlock had prompted unfamiliar strategies.
 ''It is a bit like global positioning,'' said Kris Graham, 56, a middle school English teacher from Philadelphia. ''Whenever we come to a big crowd, we analyze the situation and try to hopscotch around it.''

HEADLINE: The life and death of a leading lay Catholic, and the profound change in the currents of her church.

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
Patty Crowley died on Nov. 23. She was 92. When someone dies at that age, as one of her friends pointed out, it is unusual to find a cathedral four-fifths filled for the funeral. But that was the case at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. 
 Of course, those in the pews were celebrating the life and mourning the death of a remarkable person. But they were also marking a development that once seemed full of promise for Roman Catholicism in the United States and now seems mainly to pose questions. 
Patty Crowley lived at the very center of forces shaping American Catholicism in the last century. Born Patricia Caron, she was the daughter of a prosperous Chicago couple and a forerunner of the economic and educational upward mobility that changed the face of an immigrant church. In the 1930's she went from convent schools to Trinity College in Washington, spending a year studying abroad. 
 At Trinity, she took a class from Msgr. John A. Ryan, adviser to the Catholic bishops and so outspoken a proponent of social reforms that he became known as the Right Reverend New Dealer. She married Patrick Crowley, an up-and-coming Chicago lawyer, started a family and moved to suburbia. Along the way, the Crowleys were deeply influenced by theological ideas and models of lay Catholic activity imported from Europe.
 Those models were conceived for workers and students, but the young couple were soon leading the Christian Family Movement, or C.F.M., an American adaptation nicely suited to postwar prosperity and family centeredness. For Catholics succeeding at last in material terms but wanting to do more with their new security and advantages, the organization offered a framework of couples' working together to observe problems around them, to analyze and judge them in terms of Scripture and church teaching, and then to take actions, whether large or small. 
 The method was helpful, but the theology, based on St. Paul and emphasized by Pope Pius XII, was at least equally important: the church was a mystical body in which all the members, not only clergy and hierarchy, had essential roles. 
 As they spent decades tirelessly organizing and traveling for C.F.M., the Crowleys seemed to represent the kind of family all but apotheosized by the church in the 40's and 50's. Ms. Crowley gave birth to five children (one died in infancy); the couple adopted another child and over the years cared for countless foster children and foreign students. Their eldest daughter, Patricia, became a Benedictine nun. The parents were lay associates -- ''oblates'' -- of the order. Even their matching names -- everyone referred to them as Pat and Patty -- seemed to ring with Catholic emphasis on marriage and family. No wonder they were awarded a papal medal by Pope Pius XII in 1957. 
 And no wonder that Pope Paul VI named them in 1964 to the special papal commission re-examining the church's condemnation of contraception. The large number of personal testimonies that they brought to the commission, followed by a systematic study of C.F.M. couples around the world, had a profound effect. Here was personal experience that seemed to challenge the largely deductive reasoning of the theologians. It was the experience, moreover, not of lax Catholics but of particularly devoted couples trying to live out the church's ideals of family life.
 In 1966, of course, the pope's commission voted overwhelmingly for a change in teaching. And in 1968, after a perplexing and suspenseful delay, he rejected that change. Back in Chicago, the Crowleys were immersed not only in C.F.M. work but also in Eugene J. McCarthy's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. No one in Rome informed them of the pope's decision -- they were simply awakened by a 4 a.m. phone call from an inquiring reporter -- and no one in Rome, Ms. Crowley remarked later, ever thanked them for their service. 
 The next years were hard. The widespread Catholic controversy over ''Humanae Vitae,'' the pope's birth-control encyclical, divided C.F.M. and shattered much of the work the couple had accomplished. Equally shattering, on a personal level, was Mr. Crowley's death from cancer, at age 61, in 1974. Eugene McCarthy, who died less than three weeks after Ms. Crowley, was one of the eulogists at her husband's funeral. 
 Ms. Crowley carried on. She served on the boards of civic, religious and women's groups. She was appointed by Mayor Harold Washington to the Chicago Housing Authority. 
 But her focus became homelessness and prisoners. She helped found Deborah's Place, a shelter for homeless women that her Benedictine daughter oversaw for a number of years. Thirty-nine units of permanent housing for the formerly homeless were rededicated as the Patty Crowley Apartments. On Sundays after Mass, mother and daughter often headed for the 12th floor of the Metropolitan Correctional Center to deliver knitting supplies and play cards with the women imprisoned there.
 ''She was as comfortable and gentle around people who were homeless and incarcerated as she was around prominent government or church officials,'' her daughter noted at the funeral.
 But Patty Crowley was not Dorothy Day or Mother Teresa. She lived in an apartment with stunning views on the 88th floor of the John Hancock Center. She took early morning swims in the building's pool. She enjoyed life, travel and providing hospitality, even for what she called ''conscience-raising sessions.'' 
 She was, in other words, representative of a large segment of American Catholics who have come to enjoy material security, good educations and confidence in their own initiatives. If, like her, they reached maturity before the crisis over church authority that began with the birth-control controversy, they often have a kind of bred-in-the-bones Catholicism. If they come from the younger generations, well, it's a different story. 
 In some ways, her funeral may be seen as a last hurrah for a marriage of the spirit of the Second Vatican Council with the spirit of the 1960's. It is an outlook that some Catholics cling to with uncritical nostalgia and that a growing number of church leaders find dangerously unpalatable. 
 But could it also be a last hurrah for a demographic, as the marketing people like to say, a socioeconomic slice of American Catholics, that has been central to the church for more than half a century? Patty Crowley and her peers never doubted that the church had something to say, but after 1968 they began to wonder whether it was interested in listening. For millions of their children and grandchildren, that doubt apparently looms larger and larger.

Bush Rejects Quotas on Steel Pipe From China Despite Recommendation From Trade Panel
President Bush rejected a request to place quotas on steel pipe imported from China yesterday, saying the cost to American consumers would outweigh the benefit to domestic producers. United States pipe makers and a labor group, which strongly condemned the president's decision, asked the Bush administration to impose the quotas on certain kinds of steel pipe used primarily in construction. They argued that a surge in imports from China was disrupting markets. The International Trade Commission sided with the companies and recommended that the president provide relief. Mr. Bush rejected that, saying it was not in the best interest of the economy. (AP) 


Tyson Foods Cuts Salary of Chief Executive
Tyson Foods said in a government filing yesterday that the pay of its chief executive, John H. Tyson, left, was reduced by 44 percent in fiscal 2005 as profit fell. Mr. Tyson received $5.5 million in salary, bonus and other compensation, including his personal use of the company plane and taxes paid on his behalf. He received no stock options, and his bonus was cut 40 percent, to $3.3 million. His compensation in 2004 was $10 million, including stock options. Net income at Tyson Foods, based in Springdale, Ark., fell 12 percent in the year ended Oct. 2, to $353 million, or 99 cents a share. Tyson reported losses in its beef business in five of the last eight quarters. Sales for the year fell 1.6 percent, to $26 billion. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

Royal Ahold to Cut 700 Jobs in the United States
Royal Ahold, the owner of the Giant and Stop and Shop supermarket chains in the United States, said yesterday that it planned to eliminate 700 jobs at its U.S. Foodservice unit as it reduced costs to try to regain an investment-grade credit rating. The Amsterdam-based company will take a charge of $50 million to $60 million in the fourth quarter to reflect the cost of the changes. Ahold, which said in 2003 that it had overstated earnings by 970 million euros ($1.1 billion), is reorganizing the food distribution business, where most of the problem occurred. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

Striking Mechanics Reject Northwest Airlines Offer
Mechanics at bankrupt Northwest Airlines rejected a settlement proposal that would have ended a strike that began in August, the workers' union said yesterday. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association said 56.59 percent of its voting members rejected the deal, which would have granted them 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, four weeks of layoff pay, and payment of accrued vacation time. Northwest, which filed for bankruptcy in September, has continued flying since the strike began by using replacement labor. The striking workers walked off the job in August after failing to reach a labor contract with Northwest, which is based in Eagan, Minn. (REUTERS)

Agency Seeks Lending Data From Bear Stearns
The Bear Stearns Companies was asked by the Federal Trade Commission to provide data and documents in connection with an investigation of home loans to risky borrowers. The EMC Mortgage Corporation unit of Bear Stearns, which buys and services home loans, received the request after a Dec. 8 trade commission resolution, according to a filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said EMC Mortgage was cooperating with the government's inquiry. According to the filing, made by a mortgage trust set up by Bear Stearns, the order is part of a broader trade commission investigation of the $1 trillion market for so-called subprime mortgages.

The Fox and Hound Restaurant Group, which operates its namesake and Bailey's restaurants, agreed yesterday to be bought by Levine Leichtman Capital Partners for about $155.4 million to end a bidding war.
