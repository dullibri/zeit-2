HEADLINE: ALEC Backs Down

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The American Legislative Exchange Council is disbanding its Public Safety and Elections Task Force. 

 BODY:
It's not often that a grassroots campaign against a well-funded business organization actually works. But that may have happened today. The American Legislative Exchange Council - responsible for spreading "stand-your-ground" laws and voter ID restrictions to dozens of states around the country -announced that it will disband its Public Safety and Elections Task Force, the internal panel that was the impetus for those kinds of laws. ALEC will now concentrate on economic issues. 
 The announcement didn't say so, but the move was clearly a reaction to the steady stream of corporate defections from ALEC by prominent businesses that depend on consumer goodwill. In the last few months, since liberal groups began pointing out the council's role in helping disenfranchise millions of low-income and minority voters through voter ID requirements, ALEC has lost funding from companies such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Kraft Foods, Wendy's, and Intuit.

The exodus accelerated when it became clear ALEC had helped implement Florida's stand-your-ground law in 24 other states, through conservative lawmakers who are affiliated with the group. The law allows people to attack a perceived assailant if they believe they are in imminent danger, without having to retreat, and was originally pushed by the National Rifle Association, a longtime ALEC member.
Kaitlyn Buss, a spokeswoman for ALEC, said the group would no longer work on issues relating to elections or guns. Given the controversy surrounding those issues, she said, ALEC's legislative board had decided to focus purely on issues such as taxes, fiscal policy, and tort reform.
Writing prototypes of state laws in those areas could still do a great deal of harm, reducing the power of public and private unions, fighting minimum wage laws and tax increases on the rich, and repealing environmental regulations.
But corporations sent a clear message to the right wing that they did not want to be associated with laws that diminish democracy and anger police departments. The question now is when state lawmakers, too many of whom seem to take their directions from ALEC, will learn the same lesson.

HEADLINE: The French Plan a New York Fête

BYLINE: FLORENCE FABRICANT


HIGHLIGHT: La F&#234;te de la Gastronomie, a celebration of food backed by the French government, is coming to New York on Sept. 22. 

 BODY:
The French have big plans for New York on Sept. 22: La Fête de la Gastronomie, an all-day and evening tribute to the glory of French dining, and not just haute cuisine. Plans are still being formulated, but a meeting was held Tuesday morning in one of the grand salons of the French Consulate on Fifth Avenue to announce the purpose of the event and some of the details, and to get the ball rolling.
In welcoming remarks, the consul general, Philippe Lalliot, explained that the first Fête was celebrated last Sept. 23 all over France and in some French-speaking countries. "It was a huge success," he said. "And now we plan to internationalize it." In addition to France, New York and Tokyo will be included this year. 
The festival was created by Frédérique Lefebvre, the French secretary of state in the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industry, whose portfolio includes tourism. He said its purpose was to promote French gastronomy, tourism and commerce. "Gastronomy encompasses many elements that represent France," he said. The festival also celebrates "conviviality and generosity." 
In other words, unlike most food festivals that pepper the New York calendar from spring through fall, this one, staged with the blessing and participation of the French government, and intended to stimulate tourism and commerce, will not be a charitable fund-raiser, or a celebration of pizza or pork, or even a showcase for a particular group of restaurants. It will simply promote all things French as they have to do with eating. 
Admission prices will be kept low to encourage maximum participation on the part of the public. There will be many commercial partners. Some kind of showcase to display French products, open to the public, is also planned. 
The organizers of the New York event, who were meeting for the first time, also heard a presentation by Sophie Mise, the commissioner of the Fête, on some of the details. They are looking for a venue for some kind of grand event that can accommodate thousands of people. Special menus will be offered in restaurants; there will also be special markets, classes and participation by the farming, fishing and wine industries. In France there were picnics in the vineyards of Burgundy, for example, and kitchens open to visitors. 
The theme for this year's Fête, both here and in France, is "terroir," a term that is most often used in connection with wine, to define the characteristics of a particular region. But the term can also apply to food. 
As Mr. Lefebvre said: "Globalization has led to standardization around the world, but it's the regional diversity that has to be honored."

HEADLINE: Regulators to Ease a Rule on Derivatives Dealers

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The rule would exempt many players in the derivatives market from new regulatory oversight. 

 BODY:
As federal regulators put the finishing touches on an overhaul of the $700 trillion derivatives market, a major provision has been tempered in the face of industry pressure.
On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to approve a rule that would exempt broad swaths of energy companies, hedge funds and banks from oversight. Firms would not face scrutiny if they annually arrange less than $8 billion worth of swaps, the derivative contracts tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and gas.
The threshold is a not-insignificant sum. By one limited set of regulatory data, 85 percent of companies would not be subject to oversight. After five years, the threshold would reset to $3 billion; it is the same amount suggested by a group of energy companies in a February 2011 letter, according to regulatory records.
 When regulators first proposed the rules in late 2010, they set the exemption at $100 million. At that level, only 30 percent of the players would have been excused from the oversight, which was mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. 
It is unclear whether that data tells the full story. Other numbers produced by the S.E.C. suggest that the initial $100 million plan would have ensnared some companies that the law did not intend to affect.
The agencies that wrote the rule covering so-called swap dealers note that their policy would oversee the largest derivatives players that pose a systemic risk to the broader economy. And despite exempting many companies from oversight, the rule still would capture the vast majority of swaps contracts because it applies to several big banks like Goldman Sachs that arrange most of the deals. Under the rule, the agencies also must study whether the $8 billion figure is appropriate. The agencies could change the figure if it proved too high or low.
Some watchdog groups, however, fear that regulators are carving out a significant loophole that will open the door to problems. The exemption, the culmination of wrangling among the regulators and a yearlong lobbying blitz, would excuse firms from having to post additional capital and file reports.
"That's bad for the markets, customers and the system as a whole," said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The new rule comes as financial regulation takes center stage in Washington.President Obama called on Tuesday for more "cops on the beat" to monitor speculative commodities trading, which some experts blame for rising gas prices. In a speech in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama invoked the Enron scandal, in which the energy firm amassed a major derivatives trading operation and skirted the law amid lax rules.
In the new rule set to be completed on Wednesday, the controversy lies in the so-called de minimis exemption, a sort of regulatory hall pass for firms that have insignificant derivatives holdings. At $8 billion, Mr. Kelleher said it amounts to a de maximum exemption.
The initial $100 million limit met harsh criticism from most derivatives players, who argued that a single swaps trade can carry a notional value of billions of dollars. The notional amount reflects the value of the underlying assets rather than the amount of money that changes hands. So, on the face of it, even the $8 billion level would be a blip for a market that is valued at $700 trillion.
But the regulatory fine print could allow many firms to whittle down the size of their activity to under $8 billion.
Under the rule, companies can exclude the swaps they use to hedge their business against risk like, say, interest rate fluctuations. And the rule would apply only to a company's swaps transactions, so firms would not need to count their other varieties of derivatives, like forwards and options. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also scrapped a strict provision that would have prevented companies that are exempt from the rules from arranging more than 20 swap contracts in one year, regardless of the dollar amount.
As a result, some large banks and other players are expected to avoid regulatory scrutiny in swaps, based on data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Both Northern Trust and BOK Financial, the parent company of Bank of Oklahoma, which are listed among the top 25 banks in the derivatives business, could be exempt. Major energy firms like Constellation Energy are also expected to get a pass.
Such companies pushed regulators to relax the rules. A coalition of energy firms, including BP, Constellation Energy and Shell, sent regulators a letter that pitched a $3.5 billion threshold and even suggested specific wording changes to the rule. Another group, known as the Coalition of Physical Energy Companies, proposed a $3 billion figure, the threshold that regulators are set to adopt after five years.
The energy groups dominated the frenetic lobbying effort surrounding the rule and its exemption. Firms dispatched executives to testify before Congress, hired an army of lobbyists and lawyers to draft comment letters and held more than 100 meetings with regulators to discuss the rule, records show. The Coalition of Physical Energy Companies hired the law firm of the former New York City mayor,Rudolph W. Giuliani, to plead its case in Washington. The other group that included Shell and BP had more than 10 meetings with regulators.
That coalition, led by law firm Hunton & Williams, also hired a consulting firm and a former prominent regulator, Sharon Brown-Hruska, to study the rule. Ms. Brown-Hruska, who was acting chairwoman of the C.F.T.C. under PresidentGeorge W. Bush, concluded that "the proposed expansive definition of 'swap dealer' is contrary to the public interest." The study said the rule would reduce liquidity in markets and cause energy companies to cede their business to riskier too-big-to-fail banks.
That concern was echoed by a trade group representing midsize banks, which urged regulators in a letter "to closely examine and understand the low-risk nature of small dealers' businesses in connection with establishing the criteria for the de minimis exemption."
Inundated with pressure and complaints from industry groups, regulators debated the proper size of the exemption for months. The trading commission scheduled several meetings to vote on the rule, only to delay the vote each time as both agencies reviewed the final draft.
Ultimately, regulators found only imperfect numbers to support their oversight effort surrounding swaps. The data, which showed that an $8 billion figure would exclude about 85 percent of the companies, is limited to one type of derivatives contract known as a credit-default swap. But the data also encompassed a broader group than necessary, most likely including pension funds and municipalities that are not subject to the federal regulatory crackdown. The S.E.C. relied on separate information that showed the exemption would affect a significantly smaller percentage of companies.
Regulators said they tried to strike a balance using the limited data as a guide. At the least, they argued, the new rules add transparency to a market that went unpoliced during the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: April 17, 1961 | The Bay of Pigs Invasion Against Castro

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On April 17, 1961, about 1,500 C.I.A.-trained Cuban exiles began the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in what would become a failed attempt to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro, the Marxist revolutionary who had seized power two years earlier. 

 BODY:
On April 17, 1961, about 1,500 C.I.A.-trained Cuban exiles began the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in what would become a failed attempt to overthrow the government of Fidel Castro, the Marxist revolutionary who had seized power in January 1959.
The April 18 New York Times said that both the rebels and the Cuban government reported successes in the battle. Mr. Castro released a communiqué stating: "[O]ur armed forces are continuing to fight the enemy heroically," while there were a "wave of rebel assertions of victories, new landings and internal uprisings," according to The Times. The paper added "a complete blackout of direct news from Cuba made it impossible to assess the situation accurately."
The Times also noted that Secretary of State Dean Rusk denied that the United States would become involved in the situation. However, the United States had organized the attack. The C.I.A. formulated invasion plans in 1960 during the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower and presented the plans to President John F. Kennedy after he was elected in November 1960. Mr. Kennedy, who had taken a hard line on Cuba during the election, approved the plan.
The invasion ended in failure, as Cuban forces defeated the rebels in just three days. There were several reasons for the failure. First, the C.I.A. intended for a covert invasion, but Cuba had been made aware of possible attacks through intelligence and increased dissident activity. The Times wrote: "The climate for the invasion -- anticipated and promised by the Cuban rebels for many weeks -- was created to a large extent by events of last week. Since last Thursday a major wave of sabotage swept Cuba. Saturday, three B-26 aircraft bombed three air bases on the island. Beginning in the middle of last week informants in Cuban groups made it known confidentially that 'important events' were to be expected over the weekend."
Second, the United States had failed to neutralize the Cuban Air Force, as the B-26 attacks of April 15 missed many intended targets. The Cuban Air Force, therefore, was able to bombard the rebels as they invaded. Lastly, the rebels, who were far outnumbered by Cuban forces, were not able to stir up local Cubans to join their insurgency, which was necessary for the invasion to have a chance of succeeding.
Of the 1,500 invaders, more than 100 were killed and 1,200 were captured. The Cuban government tried and executed some of the leaders and kept the rest prisoner for 20 months while negotiating with the United States for their release. In December 1962, Cuba agreed to release the more than 1,100 prisoners in exchange for $53 million in food and medical aid from the United States.
The failed invasion was a major embarrassment for the United States and the Kennedy administration. It strengthened Mr. Castro's power in Cuba and pushed him to pursue closer relations with the Soviet Union, Cold War enemy of the United States.

In 2008, Fidel Castro ceded power to his brother Raul after 49 years in charge. As the Times Topics: Cuba overview page explains: "Cuba as a country has been seemingly locked in time since its revolution. But through a labyrinth of rations, regulations, two currencies and four markets (peso, hard currency, agro and black), people make their way, though the going is hard." Raul Castro, it notes, has offered blunt assessments of Cuba's condition and has pushed for economic reforms.
In March 2012, Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba and called for "authentic freedom" in Cuba. A government official issued a rebuttal to the pope, saying, "We are updating our economic model, but we are not talking about political reform."
What kind of changes do you foresee for Cuba in the near future? How might economic reforms lead to political and social reforms? What role, if any, do you think United States might play in shaping Cuba's future?

HEADLINE: Q. & A.: Campaigning in an Age of Deadlock

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, talks about the Obama administration's record on environmental issues, his group's priorities and the political landscape. 

 BODY:
All environmental politics is local, and local politics can be fierce, particularly at the Sierra Club. Witness members' outrage over the revelation in February that the group had accepted $26 million for its "Beyond Coal" campaign from a natural gas company, Chesapeake Energy.
Chesapeake is one of the biggest players in the controversial business of fracking deep rock structures to free embedded natural gas. At the same time came a declaration by the club's executive director, Michael Brune, who had succeeded Carl Pope in the job in 2010, that the group had stopped accepting Chesapeake money after he took over.
The loss of the funding came as the club was confronting a decline in dues-paying members. After peaking at 780,000 in 2004, membership had dropped to 601,000 by last year. From 2007 though 2010, the Chesapeake grant amounted to eight percent of the club's annual inflow of contributions. A $50 million donation from Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City helped to offset some of turned down funds.
Last month Mr. Brune sat down and offered his views on many subjects local and national, including the Obama administration's abandonment of an Environmental Protection Agency proposalto curb emissions of smog-causing chemicals, and the E.P.A.'s subsequent adoption of a rule to make utilities cut emissions of toxic mercury. (Here are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity.)
Q.
In relation to the campaign against new coal plants, what can you do now that you could not do, say, 25 years ago?
A.
Compared with 25 years ago, we have a much bigger staff working on this; we have a much better-trained corps of volunteers. The knowledge that we've built in stopping new coal plants from being built has made us a much more potent, well-informed, sophisticated force for changing energy markets.
Q.
And what can you not do now that you could do 25 years ago?
A.
I would say it is much more challenging for us to find and collaborate with people across the ideological spectrum. For a group like the Sierra Club that has historically built alliances across the aisle, that has worked with not just tree-huggers form Berkeley or Amherst but hunters and anglers and ranchers and farmers, the politicization of almost every issue we work on makes it hard to collaborate across ideological lines.
Q.
What is there less emphasis on as you put more emphasis on coal?
A.
We didn't shift $50 million from saving salamanders to working on coal. It was an infusion of new cash. Like most groups, we have less unrestricted funding that enables us to be flexible. So more and more of your funding is coming dedicated to a specific purpose. So if there's an oil spill, we have a much more limited ability to jump on that.
Q.
I looked at the club's tax returns for the period of the Chesapeake Energy contributions and it showed, if I read them right, a decline in general membership contributions starting slightly before the 2008 economic downturn. The Chesapeake money saved you from a stair-step decline in revenues. Am I reading those returns right?
A.
If you look at how many members we have, there was a big buildup in the 1990s that peaked around the dot-com bubble. Then we tanked for a while. And then built up again to 2004-5. And then slowly declined. Last year, we bottomed out and now it's slowly increasing. Welcome to my challenge.
Q.
In terms of the club's finances over all, how important was the Chesapeake money?
A.
It was huge. It was $26 million. Those are extraordinary-size gifts for any nonprofit. It had a very big impact. It allowed the anti-coal campaign to scale up, to hire a bunch of organizers and communications staff and lawyers. It paid for training of local groups. And it helped the Sierra Club build a very strong record of resisting the expansion of coal-fired power plants.
Q.
In a post-Chesapeake world, you still have the same priorities vis-à-vis coal?
A.
The same priorities, but there aren't as many new coal plants to fight so we are focusing on existing ones.
Q.
How do you make up for the loss of the Chesapeake money?
A.
We diversified our funding; we found a bunch of other donors to increase their investment into the campaign. Bloomberg being one prominent donor. But other donors also increased their gifts.
Q.
The Sierra Club has always been a contentious place...
A.
Really? [Laughs]
Q.
... with strong-minded, passionate people. What's your philosophy for dealing with the strain when the local chapters have a different policy interest from where the national is going?
A.
Listen carefully. That's the heart of my philosophy. And remembering that a local Sierra Club member holds in their heart the idea that the Sierra Club should be fighting for what's right in their community. My job is to honor that. The challenge is when there's a conflict between different local entities or a national and local perspective. Then you need to listen even more closely to find out where there is common ground.
Q.
One argument you inherited is where to put concentrated solar power plants in the desert. There is an irreducible minimum of people who are not going to be satisfied.
A.
Listening and showing respect helps to validate the perspective of these local groups, many of whom have been leaders, national leaders, in the effort to save millions of acres in the desert and protect some of the most beautiful and ecologically important areas in the country. We can't avoid having conflict altogether, but when we have it we can try to make it less damaging. The best that I can do is communicate clearly why a particular decision was made, to be honest about the negative consequences of that decision from a different perspective, and then take the heat. And breathe deeply when I'm getting it.
Q.
Do you see a way out of the national political deadlock and the effort to marginalize environmental concerns, once we are past this election?
A.
Well, yes and no. I see a way out in terms of the issues we're working on. Whether or not there's a way out in the political tone in the Senate or inside the Beltway or just in most places across the country, I don't have a clear vision on that. It will take a small set of leaders on both sides of the aisle to change the conversation.
Q.
Is Barack Obama one of those leaders?
A.
Yes.
Q.
He hasn't been a disappointment to you?
A.
I actually think that he did an excellent job of helping to foster a healthier, more respectful debate. I continue to think that he does a good job pulling ideas from both sides of the aisle, giving credit for those ideas, attempting to build personal relationships. The criticism I would have is the administration has been too self-critical.There's no way that one side can unilaterally change the nature of the debate. About strictly environmental policies, I would say we are mostly pleased with most of the things the administration has done most of the time.
Q.
And when weren't you?
A.
I can give some examples of when I was and when I wasn't. Just in the last six months. The mercury rule. Twenty-one years in the making, probably the single most effective rule to reduce air pollution in a generation. Will have a big impact on public health. Huge rule. Will have a big impact on coal-fired power plants. The car fuel efficiency rules. Historic. They will cut gas prices in half because they will be doubling fuel efficiency.
Q.
But? Ozone?
A.
I would put at the top of the heap that he could have led much more strongly on the climate bill. In the absence of that, there hasn't been strong and aggressive leadership on climate issues. The second thing: The response to oil spill was a little weak, and I'd like to see a more inspiring, bolder goal. We'd like to see a stronger goal on reducing oil consumption. A lot less focus on drilling and a lot more focus on getting us off oil. 
The ozone rule? Yes, that was a slap in the face. A clear opportunity to protect public health. Ample amounts of scientific data ignored. And dropped at the last minute.

TOP STORIES 
Goldman's 1st-Quarter Earnings Fall 23%, but Beat Estimates | Goldman Sachs reported that its first-quarter profit was $2.1 billion, down 23 percent from $2.74 billion it reported in the first quarter of 2011.
Goldman's revenue fell to $9.95 billion, down from $11.89 billion in the year-ago period. Goldman reported earnings per share of $3.92, which was better than the $3.55 a share that analysts had estimated, according to Thomson Reuters.
The company also said its board voted to increase the quarterly dividend on common stock to 46 cents a share, from 35 cents a share.

Stock Split for Google That Cements Control at the Top | It came as a surprise last week when Larry Page, Google's co-founder and chief executive, pressured the board to split Google's highflying shares 2 for 1, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in his DealBook column.
But make no mistake, he wasn't doing it for shareholders, who have long been pushing for a stock split to make Google's shares a bit more affordable, given that they have been hovering around a whopping $650 each. He was doing it for himself.
Cleverly, Mr. Page, along with his other co-founder, Sergey Brin, and the company's chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, created the stock split so that Google could issue a special new class of shares to current shareholders. The catch: the new class of shares has no voting rights.
In other words, the entire point of the stock split was to solidify the founders' control of the company by diminishing the future voting power of the shareholders. So even as the founders continue a plan to sell some of their shares over the next three years through a program they enacted in 2009 and the company continues to issue new shares to employees, they have developed a plan to retain an iron grip over Google.

HEADLINE: Boehner and McConnell Endorse Romney

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: John Boehner, the House speaker, promised to do "everything I can to help him win." 

 BODY:
4:09 p.m. | Updated House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio formally endorsed Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday, throwing the weight of his office behind Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, roughly a month before the candidate can amass the delegates necessary to make it official.
"It is clear now that Mitt Romney is going to be our nominee," Mr. Boehner said at a news conference that followed his weekly meeting with the House Republican Conference. "I think Mitt Romney has a set of economic policies that can put Americans back to work and, frankly, contrast sharply with the failed economic policies of President Obama."
Mr. Boehner promised to do "everything I can to help him win."
Later in the day, under questioning from reporters, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, also said he was backing Mr. Romney.
 "Yeah, I support Governor Romney for president of the United States," Mr. McConnell said. "And he is going to be the nominee. And as you have noticed, the party is in the process of unifying behind him. And I think it's going to be an incredibly close, hard-fought race. Everybody is banding -- bandying polls around, but just look at the Gallup tracking poll yesterday actually had Governor Romney with a two-point lead. I think it's going to be a very, very competitive election. We're all behind him and looking forward to the fall campaign, which is actually already under way." 
By tradition, the presumed nominee comes to Capitol Hill to rally the Republican troops once the delegate totals are secured. Because of an elongated primary calendar, that ceremony is likely to wait until May, Congressional liaisons said last week. In the meantime, the campaign is carefully coordinating and rolling out endorsements to show a unified Republican front.
Mr. Boehner had remained studiously neutral even as his lieutenants threw their lots in with the candidates. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, endorsed Mr. Romney on March 4, ahead of the Virginia primary.
Mr. Romney's embrace of the House passed budget plan, which sets an ambitious course to cut the size of government and lower personal and corporate income tax rates has put the presumptive nominee in sync with House Republicans on the issues they believe will shape the election - deficits, taxes and federal spending.
But on some smaller issues, he has strayed. Mr. Romney has vowed to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and draw up punitive tariffs, a move Republican leaders say would start a damaging trade war. Last week, his campaign said Mr. Romney would not change a Democratic law easing lawsuits claiming unequal pay for women, legislation Mr. Boehner has denounced as a "bonanza" for trial lawyers.

HEADLINE: Wearable Computers Are the Next Big Devices, Report Says

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: The wearable computing wars are about to begin, a report released Tuesday by Forrester Research says, predicting that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook will help usher in the new era of computing. 

 BODY:
The wearable computing wars are about to begin, says a report released Tuesday by Forrester Research.
The report predicts that consumers will begin experimenting more with wearables over the coming year, specifically around health and fitness, navigation, social networking and gaming. This new theme among consumers will hasten big tech companies to begin creating wearable computing products.
In a blog post on the Forrester Web site, Sarah Rotman Epps, the personal computer analyst who wrote the report, said that wearable computing was about to move into the mainstream and the big technology companies in Silicon Valley would help hasten its adoption.
"Wearable devices, or 'wearables' for short, have enormous potential for uses in health and fitness, navigation, social networking, commerce, and media," Ms. Epps wrote in the blog post. "Imagine video games that happen in real space. Or glasses that remind you of your colleague's name that you really should know. Or paying for a coffee at Starbucks with your watch instead of your phone. Wearables will transform our lives in numerous ways, trivial and substantial, that we are just starting to imagine."
The report says that Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, along with each company's developer communities, will bring about a new platform war - not dissimilar to the mobile battles that are taking place today. The race to own this new computing space will help accelerate the creation of wearable computers.
In the report, Ms. Epps outlined how each company can benefit consumers with its current war chest. "Apple has the most polished marketing, channel and brand," she writes, "Google has an open platform and license to dabble. Microsoft has the best depth sensor yet. Amazon has information on more than 100 million products and their buyers. Facebook has a Rolodex - and facial recognition - for 800 million people."
These companies will likely be paying attention to the lessons they have learned from the smartphone wars.
As I wrote in a Disruptions column last year, wearables will likely seep into mainstream over the next five years and become commonplace over the next decade. The Forrester report predicts this could happen much faster.
Earlier this month Google finally pulled back the curtain on a secret project called Project Glass that can augment a person's vision through a computerlike pair of glasses. The glasses can stream information to the lenses and allow the wearer to send and receive messages through voice commands. There is also a built-in camera to record video and take pictures.

HEADLINE: When Too Big to Fail Gets Bigger

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs says its assets on its balance sheet have grown by 7.6 percent since the end of 2008. Does that mean financial reform isn't working? 

 BODY:
Goldman Sachs is still growing. Does that mean financial reform is proving a big fail on the too big to fail question?
Goldman, in reporting its first-quarter results on Tuesday, said its balance sheet had $951 billion of assets at the end of March. That's 7.6 percent higher than the level at the end of 2008. Goldman has been able to grow since the financial crisis, despite facing new, more stringent regulations, many of which are intended to make it inconvenient and expensive for banks to bulk up their balance sheets. 
Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on Thursday, had $750 billion of assets at the end of 2011, which is 14 percent higher than in 2008. 
Other large banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, have also grown a lot since the crisis, but that's mainly because they acquired large ailing banks, like Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and Wachovia. Since 2008, assets at JPMorgan Chase's investment bank are actually down 5 percent. 
What to make of the growth?
One camp of reformers is O.K. with the fact that Goldman has more assets than in 2008, because the bank has increased its capital over that period, making it more resistant to losses and market shocks. It also has less hard-to-sell, hard-to-value assets, and more liquid securities. They'd also note that balance sheets at both Morgan Stanley and Goldman are quite a bit smaller than their peak levels before the financial crisis. 
For others size is critical. Even if a bank has higher capital and better quality assets, it can still be subject to a run, and if it's huge, the taxpayer would have to step in to save it. They say the government should force banks to be made small enough to fail without bringing down the system.
A middle camp fuses the two approaches. It wants banks to be smaller over time, but it expects tougher regulations will surely, but gradually, cause that over time. For instance, once banks have to hold much higher capital against illiquid bonds and derivatives they'll be quick to dispense with them. This is expected to happen once global bank regulations -known as the Basel III rules - come into effect over the next few years.
The hardliners say that it's naïve to expect capital-based regulations alone to reduce the size of banks substantially. That's a little unfair, because new capital rules haven't had a chance to show their effect.
Banks aren't shrinking. But nor is the anger behind the too-big-to-fail bailouts.

HEADLINE: Revealing Prostate Cancer, Buffett Plays Down Effect

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Warren E. Buffett wrote in a letter that the disease was in Stage 1 and that he had been told by doctors that it was "not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way." 

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett disclosed on Tuesday that he had prostate cancer, a development that would probably heighten the questions over his successor as the chief executive of his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway.
Yet Mr. Buffett, who will turn 82 this summer, also made clear that he would continue to run the company, writing to shareholders that the disease was in Stage 1 and that he had been told by doctors that it was "not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way."
A diagnosis of Stage 1 prostate cancer means the disease has been detected very early and it has not spread beyond the walnut-size prostate gland. According to data from the National Cancer Institute, the 10-year survival rate for men with localized disease is 99.5 percent.
 The disclosure of the diagnosis was made just three weeks before Berkshire's annual meeting, when thousands of shareholders descend upon Omaha, Mr. Buffett's hometown, and for two days celebrate him as an investing giant. On Tuesday, the news did not appear to worry analysts and investors.
"Go to any actuarial table; a healthy, stress-free 81-year-old has a 12-year life expectancy, and I'll take the over on that," said Whitney Tilson, the managing partner at T2 Partners and a Berkshire shareholder.
Still, Mr. Buffett's letter was a reminder that he would eventually hand over the reins of Berkshire, a sprawling empire of insurers, a railroad operator and scores of other companies.
Over Mr. Buffett's nearly 50-year tenure as chief executive, Berkshire has grown into one of America's largest corporations, with a market value of nearly $201 billion. With operations that touch nearly aspect of the nation's economy, it is sometimes considered a proxy for the business health of the United States.
And the company's success has made Mr. Buffett one of the world's richest men and a spokesman for American capitalism. The Obama administration has even called its plan to raise tax rates on people with incomes above $1 million the "Buffett Rule." (The measure was blocked in the Senate on Monday.)
Succession at Berkshire has long been a topic of fierce speculation on Wall Street, even as some elements of Mr. Buffett's plan have already been disclosed. His son Howard will become nonexecutive chairman of Berkshire, and two former hedge fund managers have been hired to eventually take over the company's vast investment portfolios. In February, Mr. Buffett told investors that he had selected a successor for chief executive, but he did not name the person.
The leading candidates are thought to be three of the company's top lieutenants: Ajit Jain, the head of Berkshire's vast reinsurance operations; Matthew Rose, chief of Burlington Northern Santa Fe; and Tad Montross, the leader of the General Re insurance subsidiary.
"The risk is not so much who takes over for Buffett," said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. "It's the fact that whoever takes over won't be Warren Buffett. It will be a step down in perception and in reality."
He told CNBC on Tuesday that he had not yet notified his chosen successor.
In Tuesday's letter, Mr. Buffett wrote that the diagnosis came on April 11 and that he had undergone several tests. Those tests are not expected to change his routine much.
"I feel great - as if I were in my normal excellent health - and my energy level is 100 percent," he wrote.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Buffett declined to comment beyond the letter.
Stage 1 prostate cancer is typically found as a result of a prostate specific antigen, or P.S.A., blood test that leads to a needle biopsy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against P.S.A. screening for men over 75, because even if cancer is detected during screening, its slow nature means the disease is unlikely to kill him and he will die of other causes.
Berkshire's class A shares fell 1.8 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, to $119,100.
Berkshire of late has not maintained its longtime streak of outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Mr. Shields of Stifel Nicolaus pointed to both the question of succession and concern that the profitability of Berkshire's insurance operations had slowed down.

HEADLINE: On Reality TV, Every House Has Its Horror

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
As spring house-buying season gears up, there will no doubt be a lot of talk about why home sales are sluggish, or at least not as robust as they used to be. Unemployment, low consumer confidence, tight credit and more arcane Wall Street metrics will all be implicated, but the real culprit is sitting blame-free in America's living rooms and dens: the television.
Forget what the economists say; it's obvious that the housing market's plunge in recent years parallels the proliferation of shows whose main message is that only an idiot would buy a house.
Someone could easily fill an entire network with all the reality shows that have been devoted to home buying and house flipping. Call it MPC, the Money Pit Channel. On MPC, pipes crack and foundations crumble at roughly the same pace that gladiators are skewered in the ''Spartacus'' franchise. And there's just as much hemorrhaging too, from the home buyer's wallet. 
The latest of these shows -- and possibly the worst, though that's another story -- arrives on April 28 on A&E and is called ''Flipped Off.'' It features two brothers who are trying to make money by flipping houses in the Houston area. In the premiere, as on similar shows like ''Flip Men'' on Spike, they actually do make a modest profit, but that's not the point. The point is that they do so only after encountering catastrophic repairs that would cause an ordinary homeowner to call the arsonist-for-hire hotline.
''Flipped Off'' features Russell Hantz, who because he has been on ''Survivor'' has the mistaken idea that he's entertaining. Since he knows nothing about contracting, he delegates project-management duties to a bland brother named Shawn, who appears to not know much more about contracting than Russell does.
In the premiere, their problems with the house they have just bought for flipping begin when they look in a toilet and find that something has been using it as a swimming pool. ''I've got some bad news for you,'' a plumber is telling them minutes later. ''We're going to have to repipe the whole house.''
That's the kind of thing that can make a prospective house buyer decide that raising two kids in a cramped one-bedroom apartment isn't so bad after all. Of course the Hantz brothers might not have been so surprised by the $8,000 plumbing repair had they had the house inspected before buying it, since even the laziest inspector at least lifts the toilet seat lids.
It's a lesson they could have learned from ''Little House, Big Trouble,'' an episode last year of ''Holmes Inspection,'' an HGTV program in which a contractor named Mike Holmes tells unlucky property owners that pretty much everything they could possibly imagine is wrong with their little pieces of heaven. That particular episode involved a woman who, like the Hantzes, had bought a house without having it inspected.
''The whole inside of your home has to be completely removed,'' Mr. Holmes tells the poor woman, which is not an unusual diagnosis for this program.
Mr. Holmes seems never to have met a house he couldn't gut. Pray this guy never stops by your place for a visit. He'll notice some flaking paint on a shutter, and the next thing you know, he'll be ordering up the kinds of repairs that can be paid for only by selling all of your stocks, cars and children.
Mr. Holmes's many money pit companions on HGTV have included Drew and Jonathan Scott, another brother act, who on ''Property Brothers'' help people find and renovate fixer-uppers. Drew is a real estate agent, Jonathan a contractor with a fondness for computer-generated graphics that leave homeowners salivating over what their ratty new house could look like if only they would sink enough cash into it to purchase a small country.
''We're spending more money every day than I anticipated, and I'm just wondering when it's going to stop,'' a homeowner named Pete lamented in an episode called ''Run-Down Renovation,'' summing up the experience of almost everyone who turns up on these types of show. Pete had just bashed through a wall to begin the process of eliminating an awkwardly placed bathroom, only to find some of the home's plumbing inside, which then had to be moved at great expense. (It's often unclear on the shows involving homeowners -- as opposed to house flippers -- who will pay for the repairs, but you have to think the programs give some sort of assistance, since Bill Gates couldn't afford the work a lot of these dumps require.)
Money disappears on these programs in an eye blink. On a recent ''Flip Men,'' the best of the house-flipping shows, the title flippers, Doug Clark and Mike Baird, were getting an assessment from an expert about the swimming pool of a poorly kept mansion they had acquired for $1.6 million. The guy had just told them that the pool cover was fine, as long as it didn't have any holes in it, when Mr. Clark lifted a flap and, sure enough, a critter had nibbled a hole.
''A squirrel just cost us $1,800,'' Mr. Clark lamented. Moments later they discovered that the $7,000 pump for the pool had been stolen.
Would-be home buyers don't need to watch many of these shows before reaching a few conclusions that will make them renters for life:
If a house has plumbing in it, the whole place is likely to be flooded at any moment unless costly repairs are undertaken.
If a house has electricity in it, it's a fire trap and requires a complete rewiring.
If a house is more than an hour old, it has mold in it.
If a house is in the country, or in the suburbs, or in the city, animals are living somewhere in it.
If a house has a roof, a chimney, brickwork, a kitchen, interior walls, exterior walls, a porch, a foundation, an attic -- oh, heck, you might as well just tear the dang thing down.
Besides the budget-busting insanity of home ownership, one other thing is keeping people out of the housing market: the fear of ending up on one of these programs. There are so many of them now, that apparently anyone who buys a house is actually required to be filmed doing so, just to fill up air time. And few things are more irritating than a person or, especially, a couple in the process of buying a house.
This is driven home regularly on HGTV's ''House Hunters,'' which serves up perfectly mundane house-buying stories by the dozen. (''New episodes every weeknight.'') How mundane? One recent episode was titled ''Moving Out of a Hotel, Into a Home in Indiana.''
Eric, the male half of the couple involved, seemed to care only about whether the house had a gas range. Carmen, the female half, had an even more annoying fixation: She so disliked shower curtains that the presence of one seemed to be a deal breaker for her.
Pegging an investment of hundreds of thousands of dollars to a $1.99 shower curtain? Even the resident critters, in the toilet or elsewhere, have more perspective.

HEADLINE: Solar Company to Cut 2,000 Jobs and Close a German Factory

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Five months ago, First Solar was celebrating making the millionth solar module at a plant it had built in Frankfurt, to double its production in Germany, the world's largest market for solar power.
The party did not last long. On Tuesday, the company, which is based in Arizona, announced that it would stop all of its German production as part of a broad restructuring plan that will cut its global work force by 30 percent, or 2,000 workers, and sharply reduce its global production capacity.
''We need to resize our business to a level of demand that is highly reliable and predictable,'' Mark R. Widmar, the company's chief financial officer, told investors on a conference call Tuesday. ''We do not see a business case for continuing manufacturing operations in Germany.'' 
With lower government subsidies and weakening demand, the German market is now so unappealing that First Solar said it will return a $30 million government grant, write off at least $150 million in assets and spend as much as $55 million on severance payments to its workers there to pull out. The company said it would focus on other parts of the world and emphasize building large-scale solar projects.
The entire solar industry is struggling to cope with three new realities: lower government subsidies for solar power around the world, significant global overcapacity in panel manufacturing, and intense competition from Chinese makers of solar panels, which has driven prices down.
SunPower, another leading solar panel maker based in the United States, recently announced that it was reducing manufacturing in the Philippines. BrightSource Energy, which makes equipment for and develops large-scale solar power plants, canceled its initial public offering last week because of weak investor demand.
Shawn W. Kravetz, president of Esplanade Capital, said that the spate of news over the last week provided ''a pretty compelling chapter in the story of the big unwind'' of an overheated market.
For years, Europe provided fertile ground for solar makers, with generous subsidies that spurred a boom in development, especially in Germany and Italy, which accounted for more than half of the global market last year. Executives say the industry had become accustomed to increasing growth each year, driven by supports like feed-in tariffs and clean-energy mandates.
But now, with government and corporate budgets squeezed by the economic downturn and demand for solar power weakening, those subsidies are on their way out. Some analysts and industry executives are predicting that global installations of solar capacity, which they say grew by about 40 percent last year, will expand by no more than 10 percent, if at all, this year. German installations are expected to remain flat.
Complicating First Solar's difficulties is the fact that it uses a different kind of technology than the Chinese makers. That technology, known as thin-film, makes its panels better-suited to large-scale solar farms with thousands of panels. The company is also operating without a permanent chief executive.
Wall Street welcomed First Solar's news, sending its stock up 10. 3 percent, to $22.96. Shares of other solar companies also rose.
Arno Harris, chief of Recurrent Energy, a solar developer, said the sector might be at the beginning of a contraction that was inevitable as it matured. ''In order to stay at the leading edge of the industry, there's a degree of creative destruction that has to go on to make sure that your manufacturing costs are competitive and you're focused on the right markets and the right place in the value chain,'' he said.
In recent months, First Solar has delayed opening a new factory in Arizona and stopped work on another in Vietnam. It took steps in February to retain its manufacturing in Germany, cutting worker hours, but it was hurt by proposed changes to government incentive programs and increasing restrictions on the use of arable land and construction of the large, ground-mounted solar systems that are the core of its business.
''Their steps today were necessary medicine that they had to take,'' said Mr. Kravetz, who praised the company's project development side but had doubts about the profitability of its module sales to other entities. ''These moves are not so much creating value, but they are about managing the destruction of value in the third-party module sales.''

HEADLINE: Sales Are Stagnant, but I.B.M. Earnings Beat Analysts' Expectations

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. is a tale of two growth stories. Revenue is anemic, but earnings are robust.
That has been the pattern for I.B.M. in recent years, and its first-quarter results on Tuesday were an emphatic example. The company's earnings easily surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but sales were flat.
The focus on earnings and not revenue growth reflects the company's strategy of shifting into higher-margin businesses, while pruning less profitable operations, and steadily whittling costs throughout the corporation. I.B.M. is confident enough that the trend will continue this year that it raised its profit guidance for the year from ''at least $14.85'' to ''at least $15.00'' a share. 
I.B.M. is the largest global supplier of information technology -- hardware, software and services -- to corporations and governments, so it is seen as a bellwether of technology spending trends.
I.B.M.'s quarterly performance and outlook for the year may provide some measure of reassurance for a technology sector that is facing the challenges of a weak European economy and an uncertain outlook in the United States.
Earlier this month, Gartner, the research firm, cut its growth forecast for worldwide information technology spending in 2012 to 2.5 percent, from 3.7 percent. And I.B.M.'s failure to deliver revenue growth, analysts say, could confirm the softening of demand.
In after-hours trading, I.B.M.'s shares fell 2.4 percent. During regular trading, its shares rose $4.73, or 2.33 percent, to $207.45. In the last year, I.B.M.'s shares have gained about 25 percent.
The company reported that its first-quarter net income rose 7 percent, to $3.07 billion. Its operating earnings rose 9 percent, to $3.3 billion, and its operating earnings rose 15 percent, to $2.78 a share. I.B.M.'s program of regularly buying its own stock results in fewer shares outstanding than a year ago.
The quarterly earnings per share were well above the $2.66 estimate of Wall Street analysts.
I.B.M.'s revenue was stagnant, at $24.67 billion, falling short of analysts' forecast of $24.8 billion.
This is the first financial quarter in the tenure of Virginia M. Rometty, who became I.B.M.'s chief executive at the start of the year, succeeding Samuel J. Palmisano, who was at the corporate helm for the nine previous years and is now chairman.
No major changes in I.B.M.'s strategy, analysts say, are expected anytime soon under Ms. Rometty. In recent years, I.B.M. has moved into more profitable niches of the services and software businesses, while shedding hardware businesses where competition was fierce and profits slender, like personal computers and disk drives.
It has aggressively expanded its global footprint, pursuing growth opportunities abroad and tapping pools of lower-cost skilled workers, especially in India. Major share buyback programs have increased earnings per share, by reducing the number of shares outstanding.
''We're going to see the same playbook from Ginni Rometty as we saw from Sam Palmisano,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein.
With its shift to higher-margin businesses and rapid expansion in emerging markets like China and India, I.B.M. has largely escaped the cyclical swings of the technology industry. The company's profits increased throughout the financial crisis and recession.
The first quarter displayed how the breadth of the company's business serves to deliver steady profits. The weakness in the hardware business was offset by higher profit margins in services and strong growth in emerging markets.
Hardware sales fell 7 percent, to $3.7 billion, pulled down by lower sales of mainframe and large Unix data-serving computers, compared with the previous year when new models had recently been introduced. But that falloff was more than offset by modest growth and higher profit margins in I.B.M.'s big software and services business.
I.B.M.'s big services business, which accounts for 57 percent of its revenue, more than $15 billion in the quarter, grew a scant 1 percent. But the profit of the services business rose 11 percent.
The software unit grew by 5 percent, to $5.6 billion, while profits in that high-margin business increased 12 percent. The software business generates 43 percent of the company's profit.

HEADLINE: In Jersey City, a LeFrak Office Project Awaits a Tenant

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
JERSEY CITY -- The Newport neighborhood here, at 600 acres among the largest urban mixed-use developments on the East Coast, has seemed in no real hurry to be completed.
Its chief developer, the LeFrak Organization, has sometimes let years go by after finishing one building before starting another, which has occasionally given the waterside parcel, the site of defunct rail yards, a patchwork air. The last office building went up in 2003, a six-story midrise with just 90,000 square feet.
Now LeFrak is ready to break ground again. The company just announced plans for Pier 6, a project that could add up to 1.25 million square feet of office space to a nine-acre pier at the end of Sixth Street, on the southern edge of Newport. 
But the company will not build on speculation. The tenant -- most likely a financial services or media company that requires a huge amount of room -- will determine the size and configuration of the buildings, said Jamie LeFrak, a principal in the company.
''We wouldn't have stayed in business for 100 years if we were doing wild speculation,'' said Mr. LeFrak, who represents the fourth generation to run a company that built LeFrak City, in Corona, Queens, and Gateway, in Battery Park City, among other major projects.
The Pier 6 site could handle a single 17-story building, which one tenant would occupy. Or, if there were demand for a smaller building, LeFrak would build on half the site, though the tenant would have to commit to taking at least 300,000 square feet to make the project financially feasible, Mr. LeFrak said.
Started in 1986, Newport now includes 14 apartment buildings, 7 office buildings and the Newport Centre Mall, as well as shops, playgrounds and a waterfront walkway, though there are still dozens of empty parcels. While 13,000 people live there today, LeFrak says the eventual population of the $10 billion project will be twice that.
The Pier 6 site, which a century ago contained a sheep slaughterhouse, is now used mostly for storing construction equipment and trees for other sites; there is also a helipad there, which will be retained. About a five-minute walk from the Newport PATH station, the site also has front-and-center views of One World Trade Center, rising across the river in Manhattan.
Office rents at Pier 6, which is expected to cost $100 million to $300 million to build, will most likely be far below Manhattan's, Mr. LeFrak said. In the first quarter of 2012, the average asking rent along the Hudson waterfront in New Jersey, which includes Weehawken and Hoboken, was about $38 a square foot for state-of-the-art office space, versus close to $70 for comparable space in Manhattan, according to Cushman & Wakefield.
And, if the tenants in the new buildings qualify for New Jersey's Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit program, which was created to encourage development in nine cities near subway and train lines, the rents could effectively be around $20 a square foot or less, brokers said. But Mr. LeFrak said that if the tenant spent enough on construction, those rents could be closer to zero.
Then again, most of the credits in the four-year-old, $1.5 billion program have already been spoken for, according to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which administers the program. All applications are currently being reviewed, however, which could free up funds, a spokeswoman said. The State Legislature could vote to expand the program and is now considering a bill to that effect.
Still, even without those credits, Pier 6's economics are compelling, said Gil Medina, a former state commerce secretary and a current Cushman broker who has worked with LeFrak in Newport in the past. The Hudson waterfront vacancy rate has been below 10 percent for years, a sign of a healthy leasing market, Mr. Medina said. Mr. LeFrak said the company's office towers had a 2 percent vacancy rate.
Among recent large leases, Citigroup last year added to its presence at 480 Washington Boulevard, a 32-story LeFrak high-rise, leasing 46,000 square feet. Its neighbors there include UBS and Societe Generale.
This year, according to reports, Fidelity Investments will finally consolidate some of its operations, including bringing workers from Manhattan, into a four-floor berth at 499 Washington Boulevard, a 14-story tower that also has Bank of America offices, according to reports. And next year, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which plays a central backup role in stock transactions, will move the bulk of its operations to the entirety of 570 Washington, from its current address at 55 Water Street in New York.
These tenants have been drawn to Newport from New York in part by low rents -- and, sometimes, special tax deals, subsidies or grants. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City has criticized those programs as encouraging a bidding war for jobs.
But Mr. Medina played down any suggestion of a border clash. Companies like JPMorgan Chase, which has 21 floors at 575 Washington in Newport, have relocated only support functions to New Jersey while keeping their headquarters in Manhattan, he said.
''It's more of a symbiotic relationship,'' Mr. Medina said. ''We are definitely tied together economically.''
While it might have been a sleepy decade for LeFrak on the office front in Newport, the company has been busily adding residential units. In 2007, it completed the Shore Club, a sprawling 400-unit condo complex on River Drive. A few years later, it developed Aquablu, a 300-unit rental building with tinted windows across the street. Rising next to it is Laguna, a 150-unit rental building to be completed next year.
A new park, with playground equipment and immaculate lawns, sits across the street, by the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. In a sign that there is still room for Newport to grow, it brushes up against a desolate industrial parcel that contains a cement plant.
Even if Newport still has a long way to go, the project has been a success so far, said Robert Cotter, the director of the Division of City Planning in Jersey City and an author of the redevelopment plan that allowed it to happen.
In some ways, Newport was a bold experiment, he said. Previous master-planned developments created separate zones for businesses and homes. In Newport, though, Jersey City encouraged an integrated layout, which creates a livelier streetscape, and which the Pier 6 project should only enhance, Mr. Cotter said, adding that the slow and steady pace was understandable.
The LeFraks' timing ''was cyclical in response to various rises and falls in the economy, and they have lived through three recessions,'' he said. '' 'Rome wasn't built in a day' is absolutely true here.''

HEADLINE: Studies Question the Pairing Of Food Deserts and Obesity

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
It has become an article of faith among some policy makers and advocates, including Michelle Obama, that poor urban neighborhoods are food deserts, bereft of fresh fruits and vegetables.
But two new studies have found something unexpected. Such neighborhoods not only have more fast food restaurants and convenience stores than more affluent ones, but more grocery stores, supermarkets and full-service restaurants, too. And there is no relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents.
Within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood, ''you can get basically any type of food,'' said Roland Sturm of the RAND Corporation, lead author of one of the studies. ''Maybe we should call it a food swamp rather than a desert,'' he said. 
Some experts say these new findings raise questions about the effectiveness of efforts to combat the obesity epidemic simply by improving access to healthy foods. Despite campaigns to get Americans to exercise more and eat healthier foods, obesity rates have not budged over the past decade, according to recently released federal data.
''It is always easy to advocate for more grocery stores,'' said Kelly D. Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, who was not involved in the studies. ''But if you are looking for what you hope will change obesity, healthy food access is probably just wishful thinking.''
Advocates have long called for more supermarkets in poor neighborhoods and questioned the quality of the food that is available. And Mrs. Obama has made elimination of food deserts an element of her broader campaign against childhood obesity, Let's Move, winning praise from Democrats and even some Republicans, and denunciations from conservative commentators and bloggers who have cited it as yet another example of the nanny state.
Speaking in October on the South Side of Chicago, she said that in too many neighborhoods ''if people want to buy a head of lettuce or salad or some fruit for their kid's lunch, they have to take two or three buses, maybe pay for a taxicab, in order to do it.''
Mrs. Obama has also advocated getting schools to serve healthier lunches and communities to build more playgrounds.
Her office referred questions about the food deserts issue to the Department of Agriculture. A spokesman there, Justin DeJong, said by e-mail that fighting obesity requires ''a comprehensive response.'' The federal effort, he added, includes not just improving access to healthy foods but also improving food in schools, increasing physical education time, and educating people on the importance of healthy diets.
Some researchers and advocates say that further investigation is still needed on whether grocery stores and chain supermarkets in poor neighborhoods are selling produce that is too costly and of poor quality. ''Not all grocery stores are equal,'' said John Weidman, deputy executive director of the Food Trust, an advocacy group in Philadelphia.
It was difficult to design a study that could rigorously answer the questions: Do poor urban neighborhoods lack places to buy fresh produce and is that contributing to obesity? But Helen Lee of the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization, found a way. For data on where children lived and went to school and how much they weighed, she used a federal study of 8,000 children. For data on the location of food establishments, she used a data set that compiled all the businesses in the nation and included their sizes and locations.
''I knew where the children lived, so let's take the middle of that neighborhood,'' Dr. Lee said. ''What is the nearest grocery store? What is the nearest convenience store?''
She used census tracts to define neighborhoods because they tend to have economically homogeneous populations. Poor neighborhoods, Dr. Lee found, had nearly twice as many fast food restaurants and convenience stores as wealthier ones, and they had more than three times as many corner stores per square mile. But they also had nearly twice as many supermarkets and large-scale grocers per square mile. Her study, financed by the institute, was published in the March issue of Social Science and Medicine.
Dr. Sturm's study, published in February in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, had a different design. With financing from the National Institutes of Health, he used data on the self-reported heights, weights, and diets of more than 13,000 California children and teenagers in the California Health Interview Survey. The survey included the students' addresses and the addresses of their schools. He used a different data set to see what food outlets were nearby. Dr. Sturm found no relationship between what type of food students said they ate, what they weighed, and the type of food within a mile and a half of their homes.
He has also completed a national study of middle school students, with the same result -- no consistent relationship between what the students ate and the type of food nearby. Living close to supermarkets or grocers did not make students thin and living close to fast food outlets did not make them fat. The study will be published soon in Public Health.
It is unclear how the idea took hold that poor urban neighborhoods were food deserts but it had immediate appeal. There is even an Agriculture Department ''food desert locator'' and a ''National Food Desert Awareness Month'' supported by the National Center for Public Research, a charitable foundation.
But, Dr. Lee said, studies lending support to the idea tended to be limited by methodological difficulties.
For example, some researchers looked at neighborhood food outlets but did not have data on how fat residents were. Others examined small areas, like part of a single city and extrapolated to the entire nation. Others had a different problem. They looked at much bigger areas like ZIP codes, which include people of diverse incomes, making it hard to know what happened in pockets of poverty within those regions.
Some researchers counted only fast food restaurants and large supermarkets, missing small grocers who sold produce. Some tallied food outlets per 1,000 residents, which made densely populated urban areas appear to have fewer places per person to buy food. A more meaningful measure, Dr. Lee said, is the distance to the nearest stores.
In one neighborhood in Camden, N.J., where 80 percent of children are eligible for a free school lunch, children bought empanadas, sodas and candy at a grocer, while adults said they had no trouble finding produce. Wedged in among fast food restaurants, convenience stores, sit-down restaurants, take-out Chinese and pizza parlors were three places with abundant produce: Pathmark and Save-A-Lot supermarkets and a produce stand.

HEADLINE: Web Site Stole Job Seekers' Data in Tax-Fraud Scheme

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
A Web site that promised to connect people with much-needed jobs during the recession was actually a means to steal the applicants' personal information in a scheme to file fraudulent tax returns, prosecutors said on Tuesday. 
The site, www.jobcentral2.net, listed nonexistent jobs and used applicants' identities to file the bogus federal tax returns and collect tax refunds, said Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney.
Petr Murmylyuk, 31, a Russian citizen living Brooklyn, preyed upon unemployed people because they were unlikely to have income and unlikely to file a tax return, reducing the chances that the fraudulent returns would draw attention, Mr. Vance said.
''His scheme hurt jobless individuals and society as a whole,'' Mr. Vance said.
The ease with which a bogus company can look legitimate on the Internet has created a perfect scenario for fraudulently ''phishing'' for Social Security numbers and other personal information under various pretenses.
Filing fake tax returns, in particular, is a growing problem. In January, the Internal Revenue Service and the Justice Department announced that a law enforcement sweep through 23 states had revealed the potential theft of thousands of identities and taxpayer refunds.
The I.R.S. has devoted a Web page to listing enforcement actions involving identity thefts used to fraudulently claim tax refunds. In the most recent case, a woman from Monroeville, Ala., who had conspired with a tax return provider to file bogus returns was sentenced to 75 months in prison and ordered to pay more than $1.3 million to the federal government.
The most common form of identity theft complaint received by the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Sentinel Network relates to the filing of fraudulent government documents or benefits.
Mr. Murmylyuk's site claimed that its job placement services were ''sponsored by the government and intended for people with low income,'' prosecutors said. He sent e-mails with links to his fake Web site through legitimate job search forums and college electronic mailing lists, they said.
He collected refunds in the names of 108 job seekers, an indictment against him said. The amount collected on each was about $3,500 to $6,500, which totaled more than $450,000. Mr. Vance's office said that money was stolen from the federal government.
Mr. Murmylyuk recruited 11 students from Kazakhstan, who let him use their bank accounts to cash the tax refunds, according to court documents. Some of the students returned to Kazakhstan shortly after opening the accounts for Mr. Murmylyuk, and were indicted in absentia.
Mr. Murmylyuk, also known as Dmitry Tokar, was charged with money laundering, identity theft and other charges. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the top charge of grand larceny.
Federal prosecutors in New Jersey, meanwhile, charged Mr. Murmylyuk on Tuesday with working with a ring that stole $1 million by hacking into retail brokerage accounts at Scottrade, E*Trade, Fidelity, Schwab and other brokerage firms and executing sham trades.
He was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to computers and securities fraud. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine on the federal charges if convicted.

HEADLINE: Reports Suggest a Slowdown in Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Production at the nation's factories slipped in March for the first time in four months and builders started construction on fewer homes, offering cautionary signals for an economy that appeared to be gaining traction. 
Manufacturing output dropped 0.2 percent, the Federal Reserve reported Tuesday. The decline dragged on overall industrial production, which was unchanged and fell short of analysts' expectations.
''It looks pretty bad on the face of it,'' said Tom Porcelli, an economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
Surging exports and efforts by companies to restock their shelves have made economic growth look more solid in recent weeks.
The factory data did little to change that view, but economists said it suggested the recovery had lost a little steam at the close of the first quarter, partly as a result of the European debt crisis, which is weighing on global growth.
The weakness in industrial production ''raises the possibility that the recent easing in global demand is starting to take a toll on U.S. manufacturers,'' said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics in London.
Signs of a slowdown in growth became apparent earlier this month when the Labor Department reported that payrolls grew far less than expected in March.
Still, Mr. Porcelli and others said the factory sector, which has been a major driver of the United States' recovery from the recession, appeared to have enough momentum to continue growing.
Auto production, for example, increased 0.6 percent after rising 0.8 percent in February. Also, initial estimates for manufacturing output in February were revised higher.
Citing these factors, Goldman Sachs on Tuesday raised its forecast for first-quarter growth in gross domestic product to a 2.6 percent annual rate from 2.5 percent.
A separate report on new home construction also provided mixed signals. Housing starts slipped 5.8 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000 units, the Commerce Department said.
That unwinds some of the incipient recovery seen in recent months in the struggling housing sector. At the same time, the data still suggests housing construction will add to gross domestic product during the first quarter, said Millan Mulraine, a macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
Also, new permits for home construction surged to their highest level in 3 1/2 years, which could lead to more housing construction in coming months.

HEADLINE: For Chefs at Home, A Pie Above the Rest

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN

 BODY:
I'M here -- back in the Dining section with a new column -- to insist once again that not only can you cook it at home, but you can likely cook it better.
''It,'' in this case, is pizza, and the impetus for today's installment was a visit to a highly acclaimed pizza joint in Manhattan, where I was served (for $15, or about four times the cost of the ingredients in a supermarket) a perfectly ordinary, overly poofy, drearily sauced pizza. Granted, the mozzarella was first rate. Big deal.
This followed by a couple of days what has become a not-atypical dinner at my house, where I served a pizza bianca, lightly sprinkled with olive oil, salt and rosemary, and threw together a pie with a tomato sauce based on a slew of onions and a bit of guanciale (only because I happened to have some), along with a sufficient amount of grated Parmesan to make its presence known. 
I won't even get into the money-saving part; people who cook at home for economic reasons already know about that. I will say that my crust tasted better, and my pizza was more properly cooked (yes, that's a matter of taste, but do you really want to eat a bialy with tomato and cheese, as seems to have become de rigueur?) and better sauced than the one I ate a few days later in Midtown.
Yours can be, too, and I know that because I'm not really that good at making pizza. In fact, two or three of my close friends do it better, and I know of others.
It's about three things: some confidence, practice and a food processor. This piece is my attempt to instill you with the first, encourage you to get the second and implore you to use the third, though even that's not necessary, since there is an alternative: the no-knead method popularized by Jim Lahey. I've gone back and forth between the two, but for ease, lack of mess and more-flexible timing, I've come to prefer the food processor. Still, make the dough however you like, because you won't go wrong.
From the beginning, the food processor was justifiably promoted as a tool for making dough. (My longstanding guide for this, by the way, is ''The Best Bread Ever,'' by my friend Charles Van Over.)
I love it for pizza because you can make the dough in five minutes. (A video of this is here.) Although rushing isn't ideal, you can start pressing or rolling out the pizza 20 minutes later. (Use the larger amount of yeast if you're doing this.) Which means, in a pinch, start to finish in an hour.
What is ideal is letting the dough rest for a while in the refrigerator or even freezer, though for best quality not for more than a few days. The advantages of this technique, besides the obvious convenience (make the dough in the morning or up to a few days before, and just let it come to room temperature before proceeding), is that the dough matures, marginally improving its flavor and making it considerably easier to handle.
There are, of course, some fine points, but even here there's flexibility. Should you roll the dough or pat it out? That's your call. (If you pat it out, you can leave it thick and dimpled -- use your fingertips -- and call it focaccia.) Should you use a pizza peel and a stone? Well, yes, and if you preheat the stone for a good half-hour, the crust will crackle even more, but it isn't essential. I didn't have a peel for a couple of years (no room) and used a piece of plywood or a flexible cutting board. And if you don't have a stone, a baking or cookie sheet will do fine; just use a little olive oil to keep the dough from sticking. This will give you a crisper crust, one sort of halfway to the fried dough Pete Wells writes about this week.
A whole-wheat crust? Sure, 50 percent; it won't be as crisp or have the same ''pull,'' but it will have a deeper flavor and give you a warm, fuzzy feeling. (You can also integrate herbs, garlic, dried chiles, loads of black pepper, cornmeal, whatever, into the crust; the food processor makes this incredibly easy.) Extra-crisp crust with extra-moist topping? Prebake the crust about halfway, with just a bit of olive oil on top, then add everything else and return to the oven.
Mix the dough by hand? Yes, but you're increasing your workload or, if you go for the no-knead method, your time. If your food processor isn't big or powerful enough for the recipe here, halve the recipe or get a new food processor. Other uses for the dough? Fried pizza or calzone, both discussed elsewhere in this section; rolls or bread or even those silly garlic knots. But pizza is the highest and best use.
The options don't stop, and we haven't even started on toppings. When it comes to these, I'm pretty conservative, favoring the kind of treatments I mentioned earlier, or pizza with potatoes (a legitimate Roman favorite, obviously for carb lovers), eggplant or zucchini.
Others include the obvious, like tomato sauce of almost any type, with or without mozzarella and/or Parmesan; fresh tomatoes; pepperoni; anchovies; sausage (cooked or crumbled); chorizo or other cured meat; olives; onion cooked to any degree or not at all, with olive oil; pesto (or fresh basil); eggplant or zucchini, sauteed or grilled first, with or without cheese and/or tomatoes; seafood (raw clams, oysters, shrimp, scallops, lightly steamed mussels, lobster, whatever), preferably with garlic, oregano and oil.
I don't wander far from those, which doesn't mean you can't. It's all optional, and all good. Better, in fact.
Recipe: Basic Pizza Dough
Adapted from ''How to Cook Everything: The Basics''
Time: 2 to 3 hours, mostly unattended, or less in a pinch
3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, or more as needed, plus more for kneading
1 teaspoon fast-rising yeast (2 teaspoons if you're in a hurry)
2 teaspoons salt, plus more for sprinkling
2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as necessary
Rosemary, optional.
1. Put the 3 cups flour, yeast, 2 teaspoons salt and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a food processor. Turn the machine on and add 1 cup water through the feed tube. Process until the mixture forms a slightly sticky ball, about 30 seconds. If the mixture is too dry, add more water 1 tablespoon at a time and process for 5 to 10 seconds after each addition. If the mixture refuses to come together, add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time and process until it does.
2. Rub a little olive oil or sprinkle a little flour onto your hands and shape the dough into a ball; wrap in plastic. Let rest at room temperature until the dough doubles in size, 1 to 2 hours. Or, if time is tight, let it rest at least 20 minutes before proceeding. Or refrigerate for several hours, deflating if necessary if it threatens to burst the plastic. (Or divide in half, wrap each ball in plastic, slip into a plastic bag and freeze.) Let it return to room temperature before proceeding.
3. Reshape the dough into a ball and cut in half, forming 2 balls. (From here on, use olive oil if you're cooking on baking sheets, flour if on a pizza stone.) Put them on a lightly floured surface (a pizza peel is ideal), sprinkle with flour and cover with plastic wrap; or brush then with a bit of oil and place on a lightly oiled sheet. Let rest for about 20 minutes, while you heat the oven to 500 degrees.
4. Press a dough ball into a 1/2-inch-thick flat round, adding flour or oil to the work surface as necessary. Press or roll the dough until it's as thin as you can make it; let it rest a bit if it becomes too elastic. (Patience is your friend here.) You can do two baking sheets at once, or one after another, as you'll have to if using a peel. If doing the latter, slide the dough from the peel onto the stone.
5. Sprinkle the pizzas with olive oil (just a little), salt and rosemary. Bake for at least 10 minutes, perhaps rotating once, until the crust is crisp. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
Yield: 2 pies, 4 to 6 servings.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Vornado Addresses Investor Concerns

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Vornado Realty Trust, whose diversified portfolio includes a large swath of office towers near Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan and strip shopping centers in the Northeast and California, was once considered the company with the magic touch. But lately many investors and analysts have soured on Vornado, a real estate investment trust, saying it failed to capitalize on opportunities in the downturn and has become too unwieldy for investors to evaluate.
As a consequence, Vornado's shares have trailed the broader market for real estate investment trusts, or REITs, over the past five years, outperforming it only once, in 2008.
But last week, the company's 70-year-old founder and chairman, Steven Roth, assured shareholders that he had gotten the message. In an usually forthcoming letter to them, included in the company's annual report, Mr. Roth promised to consider a wide range of remedies for fixing his company, including shrinking it or splitting it two. 
''We have lost some luster and we are going to fight to get it back,'' Mr. Roth wrote, quoting a recent remark by Michael Fascitelli, Vornado's chief executive, to an industry group. ''Everything is on the table,'' he said. Mr. Roth and Mr. Fascitelli declined requests for an interview.
Real estate trust analysts said the letter represented a good first step. ''The tone has changed,'' said Alexander D. Goldfarb, a managing director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. ''Rather than being very defensive, there was much more receptiveness.''
As a concession to his critics, Mr. Roth said Vornado for the first time would hold quarterly conference calls with analysts, beginning with its second-quarter earnings report.
Vornado has encountered several challenges in recent years. The company owns 17.5 million square feet of office space in the Washington area, with 2.9 million square feet of leases that are expiring this year. Occupancy may fall as low as 82 percent, the company said, mostly because of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Act but also as a result of a slowdown in the usually stellar office leasing market there. In his letter, Mr. Roth said it would take two or three years to fill the vacant space.
Though Vornado's roots are in retail, the company's regional mall business -- it owns seven, including two in Puerto Rico -- has lagged. ''In the mall business, bigger is better, and Vornado lacks the scale to be a meaningful player in this space,'' Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., said in a report this week.
In his letter, Mr. Roth acknowledged the size limitation and said the company would reduce its mall holdings. He said the company was shedding some of its 5.7 million square feet of troubled merchandise showrooms and office space but would hold onto the Chicago Merchandise Mart for now.
But, according to analysts, Vornado's problems extend beyond these individual sectors. Though the company built its reputation by aggressively seeking out low-cost opportunities, it went on a buying spree when real estate prices were at their highest, acquiring $6 billion worth of property. But then it was curiously cautious during the recession, when other real estate companies were taking advantage of better deals, analysts said. ''In hindsight, the company was probably too conservative immediately after the downturn,'' said Ross T. Nussbaum, a senior REIT analyst at UBS.
Investors were surprised, for example, that Vornado did not try to acquire General Growth Properties, a large shopping center landlord, after its 2009 bankruptcy. But these days, investors have another worry, Mr. Nussbaum added. ''Now the concern is, what exactly is Vornado?'' he said. ''The market has struggled with that question.'' In addition to its real estate investments, Vornado has sizable stakes in Toys ''R'' Us, J. C. Penney and the mortgage servicer LNR Property Corporation of Miami Beach.
Investors in the current market prefer companies that are more narrowly focused and easier to understand, analysts said. ''Right now,'' said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va., ''the market seems to be rewarding companies that are sticking to their knitting.'' Total returns for the broader REIT market are up 12 percent over the last 12 months, while Vornado is down by 6 percent, Mr. Lindemann said.
Some of the uneasiness about Vornado goes back to early 2007, when the company bid on Equity Office Properties, the nation's largest office landlord. Though Vornado lost out to the private equity company Blackstone Group, which paid $39 billion for the portfolio and immediately began to dismantle it, some analysts wondered at the time why Vornado was willing to put shareholders at risk when prices for office buildings already seemed quite high.
Mr. Roth began his rise in quite a different way -- by recognizing the real estate value in failed retail companies. In the late 1970s he bought a stake in Two Guys, a New Jersey discount appliance chain, and later gained control of the parent company, which was called Vornado after an air-conditioner made by another company that Two Guys had acquired. He turned the stores and their parking lots into successful strip malls.
Around the same time, Mr. Roth began investing in the Alexander's department store chain, now defunct, also for its real estate. Alexander's is now a separate New York-area REIT that is managed and partly owned by Vornado.
In 1996, after Mr. Roth lured Mr. Fascitelli away from Goldman Sachs, Vornado began to gobble up office buildings. It bought a $647 million Midtown office portfolio from Bernard Mendik and acquired additional buildings on Seventh Avenue, near Pennsylvania Station. In 2002, the company bought Charles E. Smith, the largest office landlord in Washington. Since 2001, the company's holdings have tripled in size, from $6.3 billion to $20.4 billion.
Mr. Roth burnished his image by developing the 55-story glossy tower at 731 Lexington Avenue between 58th and 59th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Designed by Cesar Pelli, it is home to the Bloomberg information and media company.
Analysts have generally praised the performance of the New York office buildings but have warned that a retrenchment by Wall Street could have a negative effect. Mr. Roth said little in his letter about Manhattan office properties, but he expressed optimism about the two markets in which Vornado was most heavily concentrated. ''Capital wants to invest in our home markets of New York and Washington more than anywhere else in the United States -- and that's a good thing,'' he wrote.
He was even more enthusiastic about the company's portfolio of Manhattan retail properties, which includes the Manhattan Mall on 34th Street and the Avenue of the Americas and 1540 Broadway near Times Square. ''Manhattan retail is on fire,'' he wrote.
But analysts point out that while the retail spaces have been highly successful, they represent too small a part of its overall business to affect the company's performance. ''Despite their successful track record in New York City retail, it hasn't moved the needle,'' said Jim Sullivan, a managing director at Green Street Advisors.
Though Mr. Roth's letter has been well received -- Vornado shares closed at $83.15 on Tuesday, up from $79.94 on Friday -- investors will be waiting to see if Mr. Roth follows through on his promises. ''Those are words,'' said Mr. Goldfarb of Sandler O'Neill. ''The market wants action.''

HEADLINE: Competition Needs Protection

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
To believe publishers and authors, the government just handed Amazon a monopoly over the book market: The price-fixing suit against Apple and the nation's top publishers filed by the Justice Department last week will free Amazon to offer ruinous discounts in the booming new market of electronic books, drive brick-and-mortar bookstores out of existence and kill off publishers' lucrative business of ink on paper.
Yet there is a different reading to this story. Publishing companies -- like bookstores -- fear they are on the losing end of a technological whirlwind of digital distribution that will make much of what they do obsolete. They would like to stop it. But though publishers may be happy to subvert competition to protect their business, this can entail a heavy cost for the rest of society.
The media industry's efforts to limit competition date at least as far back as the 1920s and 1930s, when the emergence of radio threatened newspapers' stranglehold of local markets. 
At a meeting at the Biltmore Hotel in New York in December 1933, newspaper executives offered what was essentially a plan to divvy up the audience between radio entertainment and newspaper news. The newspapers would stop their campaign against radio and reinstate radio listings if the major radio networks would limit their news offerings to a couple of short bulletins a day from the newspapers' wire services.
The Biltmore Agreement, as their pact was known, soon fell apart, as independent stations not part of the deal started buying information from new radio news services and offering real news. Despite that cartel's failure, the anticompetitive impulse survives to this day.
The Internet is walloping media perhaps like no other technology before. And the media establishment again looks upon competition as a hindrance to its survival.
Flailing under the loss of readers and advertisers to online competition, newspaper executives approached regulators three years ago floating the idea of an antitrust waiver. They wanted to coordinate on a strategy to charge readers for their online news and take steps against the aggregator Web sites that were republishing much of their content. Though they gained the sympathy of crucial members of Congress, the government rightly shot down the idea.
The top record labels, meanwhile, are facing a class action antitrust suit that accuses them of colluding to keep the price of online music artificially high to protect their lucrative CD business.
The suit filed last week against Apple and five of the nation's six main publishers has a similar plot. Amazon had been buying e-books wholesale and selling many best sellers at a heavily discounted $9.99, taking the loss to encourage sales of its Kindle e-reader. Fearful that this discounting could destroy the $25-a-book hardcover business, publishers took advantage of Apple's entry into the market to change the terms. According to the lawsuit, they colluded with the computer colossus to establish an ''agency model'' under which publishers would set e-book prices in a range of $12.99 to $14.99, and give the distributor -- be it Apple or Amazon -- a 30 percent cut.
It's natural to feel some sympathy for old media firms as technology juggernauts bear down on them. To many of us, book publishers and newspapers are more than just businesses. They are the keepers of the culture, the guarantors of our democracy. And they are small compared with Amazon, which controls 60 percent of the growing e-book market, as well as a big share of the market for books on paper. Absent any collusion, Apple's entry into the e-book market would be the kind of competitive challenge we should welcome in the digital world.
But the charges aren't trivial. The kind of collusion alleged by the Justice Department is called price-fixing. It has been illegal for a very long time, even if one is fighting a very large rival. According to the Consumer Federation of America, it would cost readers about $200 million this year alone. More important perhaps, this behavior could arrest the development of innovative platforms to sell digital goods on the Web.
Competition in the digital domain doesn't look like carmakers' slugging it out for market share. In digital markets, dominant firms are almost inevitable. There is no other social media firm with anywhere near Facebook's 850 million members. Almost two-thirds of all Internet searches in the United States happen on Google.
The concentration is driven by the economics of the Web. The cost to Amazon of selling one more e-book is pretty near zero. This increasing return to scale makes big digital companies much more profitable than small ones. It is compounded by what economists call ''network effects'': If many programmers design apps for iPads, they will become more popular, which will encourage more programmers to write apps for them.
Competition is nonetheless crucial to keeping innovation alive. Think of Google's successful move into the smartphone business with Android, or its less successful stab at social media with Google Plus. A lot of innovation is also built on top of the dominant platforms. That is perhaps where competition most needs protection.
European and American regulators are looking into Google's behavior not to check how it treats Microsoft's Bing, but to determine whether it abuses its dominant search engine to increase secondary businesses -- like, say, its shopping guide -- while pushing innovative rivals down the rankings. The Justice Department is interested in how Apple sets terms for media companies because it wants to make sure they have a shot to innovate on the iPad and Apple's other platforms.
Just as important as ensuring that platforms cannot abuse their dominance is to ensure that the companies that make the products that flow on these platforms -- book publishers, say -- do not use anticompetitive tactics to benefit one platform at the expense of others. This is the kind of competition that the Justice Department's civil suit against Apple and the book publishers is meant to protect.
Admittedly, the Justice Department's case may be bad news for the established book industry. Amazon and other online competitors have squeezed Borders out of business. It is only a matter of time before cheap e-books put an end to hardcover tomes selling for $25. And with Amazon pushing into publishing itself, some publishers could become victims as well.
But what really matters to society is what the case means for the production and consumption of books. That might not be so dreadful.
For sure, if brick-and-mortar bookstores disappear, browsing will die with them. But writers and publishers will have plenty of other ways -- think Amazon, Facebook or Google -- of letting readers know about their books. E-books, moreover, can be profitable. Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America estimated that producing, distributing and selling an e-book costs about 25 percent of the cost of a physical tome; a $10 e-book still gives publishers about $4 to cover overhead and profit. And in an e-book world, publishers' costs are sure to fall.
While Amazon remains dominant, its share of the e-book market has fallen to about 60 percent from 90 percent. Barnes and Noble, which has about a quarter of the market, would suffer if Amazon discounts sharply. But it could shed costs by getting rid of bookstores. And publishers can recover pricing power. Apple and two of the five publishers decided to fight the charges in court. But three settled. Though they must allow Amazon to resume discounting, they must do so for only two years.
And even if every existing publisher were driven out of business, reading would probably survive. Without the middlemen, publishers might even pay higher royalties to creators.
Music offers perhaps the best parallel of what could happen to the written word online. Record labels that originally welcomed Apple's iTunes soon realized it was a killer in disguise, allowing consumers to unbundle $13 CDs and buy only their preferred singles for 99 cents.
But it wasn't generally terrible for musicians. ITunes offered a shot to garage bands that could never have signed with a label. And fans didn't fare too badly. Last year, consumers bought 1.3 billion singles -- saving about $5 billion by not having to buy entire albums. This is hardly chump change. Would we be willing to give this up to save endangered record labels? While we ponder this, why not consider reviving Blockbuster, Circuit City and Tower Records?

HEADLINE: Upturn on Profits and Spain's Debt Sale

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON

 BODY:
Stock markets rose Tuesday on both sides of the Atlantic, propelled by encouraging corporate profits, a well-received sale of government debt in Spain, a recovery in Apple shares -- and the lack of any strikingly bad news.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed above 13,000 for the first time since April 5, closing at 13,115.54, for a gain of 194.13 points, or 1.5 percent. 
The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, rose 21.21 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,390.78, while the Nasdaq composite index shot up 1.8 percent, or 54.42 points, to 3,042.82, led by a 5 percent gain in Apple stock.
Analysts mostly cited the day's reports of first-quarter earnings as the buying impetus. Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson and Goldman Sachs -- all giants in their fields -- were among those posting profits that exceeded analysts' expectations.
Of the 39 companies in the S.& P. 500 that reported through Tuesday morning, 74.4 percent topped analysts' forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters data. This week, 86 S.& P. 500 companies are scheduled to report.
''Earnings are coming in well enough to support the market and stabilize any significant downdraft,'' Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, told Reuters.
But the bullish wave began in Europe earlier Tuesday, with several markets there achieving gains of close to 3 percent.
Investors there were encouraged by a bond auction of short-term government debt in Madrid, which sold well although at rates that exceeded those of the previous auction.
The debt sale raised confidence as yields on Spain's 10-year bond dipped below 6 percent. The interest rates rise and fall on concerns about Spain's fiscal stability in the latest flare-up of the euro zone debt crisis.
European stocks gained after the Spanish bond auction. The CAC 40 in France jumped 2.7 percent, the DAX in Germany also gained 2.7 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 1.8 percent. The Euro Stoxx 50, a measure of euro zone blue chips, gained 2.9 percent.
Economic data released on Tuesday painted a mixed picture. Groundbreaking on American homes declined unexpectedly in March, the Commerce Department reported, but permits for future construction rose to their highest level in three and a half years.
A Federal Reserve report showed American industrial output was flat for a second consecutive month in March, held back by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing. A measure of how fully companies are using their plants fell to 78.6 percent from 78.7 percent in February.
The strong gains on Wall Street on Tuesday reversed a two-day losing streak. The S.& P. 500 rose on Tuesday after falling 1.25 percent on Friday and about a percentage point on Monday.
The Nasdaq, meanwhile, rose as Apple jumped $29.57, to $609.70.
All three of the main stock market indexes are sharply higher for 2012: the Dow by 7.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 by 10.6 percent and the Nasdaq by 16.8 percent.
In the bond market, prices declined on Tuesday, pushing up yields modestly. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 4/32, to 100 1/32, as its yield rose to 2 percent, from 1.98 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Goldman Profit Falls 23%, but It Surpasses Analysts' Forecasts

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
7:35 p.m. Updated
Goldman Sachs on Tuesday beat analysts' estimates, but its earnings results reflected a bank still feeling the effects of the economic slowdown.
The bank said its first-quarter profit was $2.1 billion, down 23 percent from a year ago. But its earnings of $3.92 a share were better than the $3.55 analysts had estimated, according to Thomson Reuters.
Last year, Goldman reported quarterly earnings of $908 million, or $1.56 a share. Those results, however, were dragged down by a large one-time expense after the bank paid off a financial crisis lifeline it had received from the investor Warren E. Buffett. Excluding that cost, Goldman earned $2.7 billion in the first quarter of 2011. 
The bank's quarterly revenue of $9.95 billion was better than the results for the challenging fourth quarter. But revenue was down in almost every segment when compared with the quarter a year ago. Only two main business segments - investment bank and fixed income - performed better than in the first quarter of 2011.
David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, struck a cautious note on a conference call with research analysts. He said that while the economic environment had improved in recent months, it often takes longer to show in the bank's results.
For instance, he noted that Goldman's merger and acquisition activity had not picked up, reflecting what he said was the ''longer time required to improve C.E.O. confidence and investor conviction.''
In 2011, Goldman announced plans to cut $1.4 billion in costs. Those costs are largely out of the system now, and the first-quarter results reflected less spending on everything, including real estate and fees for outside lawyers.
Goldman's head count is down 8 percent to 32,400 employees, consultants and temporary workers from a year ago.
In the conference call, Mr. Viniar took aim at Moody's Investors Service, which in February put Goldman and 16 other banks on review for downgrade, citing concerns about more difficult operating conditions and a tougher regulatory environment.
''We think that if you look at every single credit metric there is for Goldman Sachs, and frankly for many of our competitors, none of the actions they have talked about are warranted,'' Mr. Viniar said.
The first-quarter results were announced after a difficult period for Goldman. Recently it has struggled to produce a profit near where it had historically performed, and it has faced a number of public relations and staffing problems. It has had unusually high turnover in its top ranks, with dozens of partners leaving in the last year.
The bank also has been criticized for trading against its clients. Last month, an executive resigned and publicly criticized the bank for putting its own needs ahead of those of its clients, an accusation the bank denied.
And two years ago this week, Goldman was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with duping clients by selling mortgage securities created by a hedge fund that sought to profit from the housing market's collapse. Goldman later agreed to pay $550 million to settle the charges, without admitting or denying guilt.
Glenn Schorr, a Nomura analyst, asked Mr. Viniar about the turnover in the bank's executive suite, saying it comes up ''a lot'' in conversations he has with clients. Mr. Viniar said that very few partners left during and immediately after the financial crisis, so the bank considered the current turnover ''catch up'' for those years. ''Our bench is so deep that it is really not an issue at all,'' Mr. Viniar said.
Goldman also said in its earnings release that its board had voted to increase the quarterly dividend on common stock to 46 cents a share, from 35 cents a share. The decision surprised some shareholders because Goldman rarely raises its dividend. The decision was reached after regulators gave Goldman and some other banks a good report card on their capital plans.
Goldman was not the only bank to beat expectations this earnings season. But while some banks were buoyed by consumer driven activities Goldman does not have a big consumer banking division as a fallback. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase beat analyst forecasts partly because of consumer demand for items like mortgage loans.
Revenue in Goldman's largest division, institutional client services - which trades bonds, currencies and commodities - was $5.71 billion, down 14 percent from a year ago. The division is a powerhouse for the bank, accounting for roughly 57 percent of all revenue generated in the first quarter.
Revenue for Goldman's ''equities client execution'' division, which trades stocks, topped $1.05 billion, up 7 percent from a year ago.
In a sign of the challenging regulatory and economic environment, Goldman's annualized return on equity, a critical measure of profitability, was 12.2 percent in the first quarter. In 2006, its return on equity was 32.8 percent.
The bank, which is based in New York, set aside $4.38 billion, or 44 percent of its revenue, to pay employees, which was consistent with past quarters. Goldman will not actually pay much of that until early 2013, after it knows the year-end performance.
Goldman's shares closed down 0.74 percent to $116.86.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Poll, Many Link Weather Extremes to Climate Change

BYLINE: By JUSTIN GILLIS

 BODY:
Scientists may hesitate to link some of the weather extremes of recent years to global warming -- but the public, it seems, is already there.
A poll due for release on Wednesday shows that a large majority of Americans believe that this year's unusually warm winter, last year's blistering summer and some other weather disasters were probably made worse by global warming. And by a 2-to-1 margin, the public says the weather has been getting worse, rather than better, in recent years.
The survey, the most detailed to date on the public response to weather extremes, comes atop other polling showing a recent uptick in concern about climate change. Read together, the polls suggest that direct experience of erratic weather may be convincing some people that the problem is no longer just a vague and distant threat. 
''Most people in the country are looking at everything that's happened; it just seems to be one disaster after another after another,'' said Anthony A. Leiserowitz of Yale University, one of the researchers who commissioned the new poll. ''People are starting to connect the dots.''
The poll opens a new window on public opinion about climate change.
A large majority of climate scientists say the climate is shifting in ways that could cause serious impacts, and they cite the human release of greenhouse gases as a principal cause. But a tiny, vocal minority of researchers contests that view, and has seemed in the last few years to be winning the battle of public opinion despite slim scientific evidence for their position.
The poll suggests that a solid majority of the public feels that global warming is real, a result consistent with other polls that have asked the question in various ways. When invited to agree or disagree with the statement, ''global warming is affecting the weather in the United States,'' 69 percent of respondents in the new poll said they agreed, while 30 percent disagreed.
Dr. Leiserowitz's unit at Yale, along with researchers at George Mason University, commissioned the survey, conducted by Knowledge Networks. That company surveyed 1,008 American adults by computer in the last half of March, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
While many online polls are not representative of the broad public, Knowledge Networks is noted for its efforts to overcome this problem, including giving computers to households too poor to have them. The survey reveals public attitudes that are at least roughly consistent with scientific understanding of how the climate is changing.
For instance, when people were asked whether they attributed specific events to global warming, recent heat waves drew the largest majorities. Scientists say their statistical evidence for an increase of weather extremes is indeed strongest when it comes to heat waves.
Asked whether they agreed or disagreed that global warming had contributed to the unusually warm winter just past, 25 percent of the respondents said they strongly agreed that it had, and 47 percent said they somewhat agreed. Only 17 percent somewhat disagreed, and 11 percent strongly disagreed.
Majorities almost as large cited global warming as a likely factor in last year's record summer heat wave, as well as the 2011 drought in Texas and Oklahoma. Smaller but still substantial majorities cited it as a factor in the record United States snowfalls of 2010 and 2011 and the Mississippi River floods of 2011. Those views, too, are consistent with scientific evidence, which suggests that global warming is causing heavier precipitation in all seasons.
One of the more striking findings was that 35 percent of the public reported being affected by extreme weather in the past year. The United States was hit in 2011 by a remarkable string of disasters affecting virtually every region, including droughts, floods, tornadoes and heat waves.
Dr. Leiserowitz said that recent events might be puncturing the public's ''very simplistic mental model of what global warming is supposed to be.''
Past survey work had suggested, he said, that people tended to see the climate change problem as ''distant in time and space -- that this is an issue about polar bears or maybe Bangladesh, but not my community, not the United States, not my friends and family.''
Because the survey questions are new, it is not clear how people's views about weather extremes may be changing over time. However, more general polling by the Gallup organization suggests that public concern about climate change, which has waxed and waned over the years, may be starting to rise again.
Since 1989, Gallup has asked, ''how much do you personally worry about global warming?'' The percentage of people saying they were worried peaked at 66 percent just before the recession, then fell to a low of 51 percent in 2011, as the economy overwhelmed other concerns.
Gallup's most recent survey, in March, showed an uptick to 55 percent. ''It's certainly possible that this is the start of a trend back up,'' said Frank M. Newport, Gallup's editor in chief, though he added that another year of polling data would be necessary to be certain.
Advocacy groups seeking policies to limit climate change say that extreme weather is giving them an opening to reach the public.
A group called 350.org is planning a worldwide series of rallies on May 5, under the slogan ''Connect the Dots,'' to draw attention to the links between climate change and extreme weather. (The group's name is a reference to what it views as the safe upper limit for the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.)
''My sense from around the country and the world is that people definitely understand that things are getting freaky,'' said William E. McKibben, the founder of 350.org. ''During that crazy heat wave in March, everyone in Chicago was out enjoying the weather, but in the back of their mind they were thinking, this is not right.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about a poll indicating that more Americans are inclined to link recent weather extremes to global warming referred imprecisely to the name of a group that is trying to draw attention to that link. The name, 350.org, refers to what the group considers a safe upper limit for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (350 parts per million), not an ideal level. (The level in March was 394 parts per million.)

REPORTED ARRESTS IN MALI
CAST DOUBTS ON TRANSITION
Soldiers have arrested a number of leading political figures in Mali's capital, according to members of the opposition, raising questions about the intentions of the junta that seized power last month. A former prime minister, Modibo Sidibe, and a former finance minister, Soumaila Cisse, were among those arrested in a wave of overnight arrests, suggesting that the junta that seized power on March 22 is not yet ready to give it up despite a series of solemn promises.

California citrus trees, a cherished symbol of West Coast life, are endangered by citrus greening, a disease that has ravaged millions of trees as it has spread around the world from Asia in the last decade. The disease can be disastrous for farmers, and an outbreak that began in Florida in 2005 has already cost the citrus industry more than $1 billion. Infected trees die within about five years; there is no known cure. PAGE A12

HEADLINE: Revealing Prostate Cancer, Buffett Plays Down Effect

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED; Tara Parker-Pope, Azam Ahmed and Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett disclosed on Tuesday that he had prostate cancer, a development that would probably heighten the questions over his successor as the chief executive of his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway.
Yet Mr. Buffett, who will turn 82 this summer, also made clear that he would continue to run the company, writing to shareholders that the disease was in Stage 1 and that he had been told by doctors that it was ''not remotely life-threatening or even debilitating in any meaningful way.''
A diagnosis of Stage 1 prostate cancer means the disease has been detected very early and it has not spread beyond the walnut-size prostate gland. According to data from the National Cancer Institute, the 10-year survival rate for men with localized disease is 99.5 percent. 
The disclosure of the diagnosis was made just three weeks before Berkshire's annual meeting, when thousands of shareholders descend upon Omaha, Mr. Buffett's hometown, and for two days celebrate him as an investing giant. On Tuesday, the news did not appear to worry analysts and investors.
''Go to any actuarial table; a healthy, stress-free 81-year-old has a 12-year life expectancy, and I'll take the over on that,'' said Whitney Tilson, the managing partner at T2 Partners and a Berkshire shareholder.
Still, Mr. Buffett's letter was a reminder that he would eventually hand over the reins of Berkshire, a sprawling empire of insurers, a railroad operator and scores of other companies.
Over Mr. Buffett's nearly 50-year tenure as chief executive, Berkshire has grown into one of America's largest corporations, with a market value of nearly $201 billion. With operations that touch nearly aspect of the nation's economy, it is sometimes considered a proxy for the business health of the United States.
And the company's success has made Mr. Buffett one of the world's richest men and a spokesman for American capitalism. The Obama administration has even called its plan to raise tax rates on people with incomes above $1 million the ''Buffett Rule.'' (The measure was blocked in the Senate on Monday.)
Succession at Berkshire has long been a topic of fierce speculation on Wall Street, even as some elements of Mr. Buffett's plan have already been disclosed. His son Howard will become nonexecutive chairman of Berkshire, and two former hedge fund managers have been hired to eventually take over the company's vast investment portfolios. In February, Mr. Buffett told investors that he had selected a successor for chief executive, but he did not name the person.
The leading candidates are thought to be three of the company's top lieutenants: Ajit Jain, the head of Berkshire's vast reinsurance operations; Matthew Rose, chief of Burlington Northern Santa Fe; and Tad Montross, the leader of the General Re insurance subsidiary.
''The risk is not so much who takes over for Buffett,'' said Meyer Shields, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. ''It's the fact that whoever takes over won't be Warren Buffett. It will be a step down in perception and in reality.''
He told CNBC on Tuesday that he had not yet notified his chosen successor.
In Tuesday's letter, Mr. Buffett wrote that the diagnosis came on April 11 and that he had undergone several tests. Those tests are not expected to change his routine much.
''I feel great - as if I were in my normal excellent health - and my energy level is 100 percent,'' he wrote.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Buffett declined to comment beyond the letter.
Stage 1 prostate cancer is typically found as a result of a prostate specific antigen, or P.S.A., blood test that leads to a needle biopsy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against P.S.A. screening for men over 75, because even if cancer is detected during screening, its slow nature means the disease is unlikely to kill him and he will die of other causes.
Berkshire's class A shares fell 1.8 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday, to $119,100.
Berkshire of late has not maintained its longtime streak of outperforming the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Mr. Shields of Stifel Nicolaus pointed to both the question of succession and concern that the profitability of Berkshire's insurance operations had slowed down.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: One For The Country

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I had to catch a train in Washington last week. The paved street in the traffic circle around Union Station was in such poor condition that I felt as though I was on a roller coaster. I traveled on the Amtrak Acela, our sorry excuse for a fast train, on which I had so many dropped calls on my cellphone that you'd have thought I was on a remote desert island, not traveling from Washington to New York City. When I got back to Union Station, the escalator in the parking garage was broken. Maybe you've gotten used to all this and have stopped noticing. I haven't. Our country needs a renewal.
And that is why I still hope Michael Bloomberg will reconsider running for president as an independent candidate, if only to participate in the presidential debates and give our two-party system the shock it needs. 
President Obama has significant achievements to his record. He has done a solid job stemming the economic crisis he inherited and a good job managing national security and initiating important reforms -- from health care to auto mileage standards.
But with Europe in peril, China and America wobbling, the Arab world in turmoil, energy prices spiraling and the climate changing, we are facing some real storms ahead. We need to weatherproof our American house -- and fast -- in order to ensure that America remains a rock of stability for the world. To do that, we'll have to make some big, hard decisions soon -- and to do that successfully will require presidential leadership in the next four years of the highest caliber.
This election has to be about those hard choices, smart investments and shared sacrifices -- how we set our economy on a clear-cut path of near-term, job-growing improvements in infrastructure and education and on a long-term pathway to serious fiscal, tax and entitlement reform. The next president has to have a mandate to do all of this.
But, today, neither party is generating that mandate -- talking seriously enough about the taxes that will have to be raised or the entitlement spending that will have to be cut to put us on sustainable footing, let alone offering an inspired vision of American renewal that might motivate such sacrifice. That's why I still believe that the national debate would benefit from the entrance of a substantial independent candidate -- like the straight-talking, socially moderate and fiscally conservative Bloomberg -- who could challenge, and maybe even improve, both major-party presidential candidates by speaking honestly about what is needed to restore the foundations of America's global leadership before we implode.
Mitt Romney can't do that because of his ludicrous opposition to any tax hikes. President Obama, who has a plan to cut, tax and invest -- albeit insufficiently -- could lead, but, for now, he seems preoccupied with some rather uninspiring small ball, preferring proposals like ''the Buffett tax'' over comprehensive tax reform that would lower all rates, eliminate deductions and raise more revenue. Sebastian Mallaby, a global economy expert, was right when he wrote in The Financial Times last week that the rich should pay higher taxes, but ''a clever campaign gambit is a poor substitute for a serious proposal. By focusing his rhetoric on the Buffett tax, Mr. Obama is fumbling his best chance to win a mandate for intelligent reform -- reform, moreover, that ought to be the centerpiece of a second term.''
Bloomberg doesn't have to win to succeed -- or even stay in the race to the very end. Simply by running, participating in the debates and doing respectably in the polls -- 15 to 20 percent -- he could change the dynamic of the election and, most importantly, the course of the next administration, no matter who heads it. By running on important issues and offering sensible programs for addressing them -- and showing that he had the support of the growing number of Americans who describe themselves as independents -- he would compel the two candidates to gravitate toward some of his positions as Election Day neared. And, by taking part in the televised debates, he could impose a dose of reality on the election that would otherwise be missing. Congress would have to take note.
''The right kind of independent candidate would explain that the real question on taxes, once the economy is back on track, is this: Given that taxes have to rise, how should we raise the revenue we need in ways that are best for the economy?'' wrote the columnist Matt Miller in The Washington Post last week. ''The answer would involve lower taxes on payrolls and corporate income, and higher taxes on dirty energy and consumption.''
After his mayoral term is over in 2013, Bloomberg will apparently spend more time running his foundation. That's commendable. But the single greatest act of philanthropy he could do for the country is right now: run for president as an independent, at least long enough to participate in all the debates. If he doesn't, and this turns into a presidential race to the bottom, he could donate every dollar he has to fix things in America and they'd be wasted, or, more accurately, overwhelmed by our mounting problems. The most patriotic thing Bloomberg could do is become an unpaid lobbyist for the country -- and for the next generation of Americans.

HEADLINE: Sunnier Outlook for World Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund is more optimistic about the global economy after seeing faster growth in the United States and a coordinated effort in Europe to address its debt crisis. 
The monetary fund said Tuesday that the American economy should expand 2.1 percent this year. Europe will most likely shrink 0.3 percent and the world economy should grow 3.5 percent. All three of the I.M.F.'s estimates are slightly better than its January forecasts.
The organization praised European leaders for bulking up its bailout fund and taking other steps to address the crisis. The 17 member nations of the European Union that use the euro currency should emerge from a shallow recession later this year, the fund said.
The I.M.F. said the European debt crisis continues to be the biggest threat to the global economy.
''With the passing of the crisis, and some good news about the U.S. economy, some optimism has returned,'' the I.M.F.'s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said. ''It should remain tempered.''
The monetary fund's World Economic Outlook report came as the 187-nation organization and its sister lending institution, the World Bank, prepare to hold their spring meetings in Washington this week.
The report represents improvement from January, when fund officials warned that the global economic recovery was in danger of stalling.
Since then, European leaders have worked together on a plan intended to restrain deficit spending. New governments in Spain and Italy have committed to reforms and spending cuts. And the European Central Bank has lent more than $1 trillion to the region's banks. That has brought down borrowing costs in some of the most troubled countries.
In the United States, consumers are spending more, business investment has grown and the job market has shown ''signs of life,'' the report says.
Mr. Blanchard said that recent steps to increase Europe's bailout fund to about $1 trillion are important, but that this alone could not solve the crisis.
One important challenge for Europe is balancing the need to cut government budget deficits without choking off growth, he said. This is made more difficult by investors, who demand deficit cuts but react badly when such cuts reduce growth. Spain is struggling with this challenge at the moment, Mr. Blanchard said.
Governments need to make short-term cuts to establish credibility, he said. But they should primarily focus on long-term commitments that decrease trend spending and put in place rules that reduce deficits over time.
The risk that Europe's debt crisis could worsen remains high, Mr. Blanchard noted. And even if it does not, growth in most advanced economies is likely to remain slow.

HEADLINE: Strong Sales Lift Earnings At Coca-Cola

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Sales of the Coca-Cola Company's myriad beverages grew around the world in the first quarter, led by consumption in India, where volume soared 20 percent.
The growth pushed the company's earnings above analysts' expectations to $2.05 billion, or 89 cents a share, in the quarter that ended March 31, compared with 82 cents a share in the same quarter last year. 
Revenue grew 6 percent to $11.14 billion, compared with $10.5 billion in the first quarter last year, propelled by a 5 percent increase in sales volume driven by even larger increases in emerging markets. After India, China experienced the greatest growth, 9 percent, followed by a more modest 4 percent in Brazil.
''That says more than anything that we've been able to crack the calculus in this challenging environment,'' said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, whose brands include Fanta, Vitaminwater and Minute Maid juices.
Mr. Kent attributed the company's success to investments it continued to make during the economic downturn that are now paying off as the American economy shows signs of stabilizing and emerging markets gain even more steam.
He said Americans have begun traveling and eating out more, which increases sales of the company's products.
But sales in Europe remain weak and show little sign of improvement, Mr. Kent said.
Higher pricing also contributed to better earnings, a strategy that so far has helped all of the beverage companies weather last year's surge in commodity prices and lackluster demand for their core products.
Ali Dibadj, a stock analyst who follows the beverage industry at Sanford Bernstein, said he was worried the company might reconsider that tactic to preserve market share. ''It's been a positive thing both for the industry and for retailers, and so that it's looking like they may slow it down makes me a little nervous,'' Mr. Dibadj said. ''It would mean a new price war, which wouldn't be good for the industry.''

HEADLINE: Regulators to Ease a Rule On Derivatives Dealers

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
As federal regulators put the finishing touches on an overhaul of the $700 trillion derivatives market, a major provision has been tempered in the face of industry pressure.
On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to approve a rule that would exempt broad swaths of energy companies, hedge funds and banks from oversight. Firms would not face scrutiny if they annually arrange less than $8 billion worth of swaps, the derivative contracts tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and gas.
The threshold is a not-insignificant sum. By one limited set of regulatory data, 85 percent of companies would not be subject to oversight. After five years, the threshold would reset to $3 billion; it is the same amount suggested by a group of energy companies in a February 2011 letter, according to regulatory records.
When regulators first proposed the rules in late 2010, they set the exemption at $100 million. At that level, only 30 percent of the players would have been excused from the oversight, which was mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. It is unclear whether that data tells the full story. 
The agencies that wrote the rule covering so-called swap dealers note that their policy would oversee the largest derivatives players that pose a systemic risk to the broader economy. And despite exempting many companies from oversight, the rule still would capture the vast majority of swaps contracts because it applies to several big banks like Goldman Sachs that arrange most of the deals. Under the rule, the agencies also must study whether the $8 billion figure is appropriate. The agencies could change the figure if it proved too high or low.
Some watchdog groups, however, fear that regulators are carving out a significant loophole that will open the door to problems. The exemption, the culmination of wrangling among the regulators and a yearlong lobbying blitz, would excuse firms from having to post additional capital and file reports.
''That's bad for the markets, customers and the system as a whole,'' said Dennis Kelleher, president and chief executive of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocacy group.
The new rule comes as financial regulation takes center stage in Washington.President Obama called on Tuesday for more ''cops on the beat'' to monitor speculative commodities trading, which some experts blame for rising gas prices. In a speech in the White House Rose Garden, Mr. Obama invoked the Enron scandal, in which the energy firm amassed a major derivatives trading operation and skirted the law amid lax rules.
In the new rule set to be completed on Wednesday, the controversy lies in the so-called de minimis exemption, a sort of regulatory hall pass for firms that have insignificant derivatives holdings. At $8 billion, Mr. Kelleher said it amounts to a de maximum exemption.
The initial $100 million limit met harsh criticism from most derivatives players, who argued that a single swaps trade can carry a notional value of billions of dollars. The notional amount reflects the value of the underlying assets rather than the amount of money that changes hands. So, on the face of it, even the $8 billion level would be a blip for a market that is valued at $700 trillion.
But the regulatory fine print could allow many firms to whittle down the size of their activity to under $8 billion.
Under the rule, companies can exclude the swaps they use to hedge their business against risk like, say, interest rate fluctuations. And the rule would apply only to a company's swaps transactions, so firms would not need to count their other varieties of derivatives, like forwards and options. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission also scrapped a strict provision that would have prevented companies that are exempt from the rules from arranging more than 20 swap contracts in one year, regardless of the dollar amount.
As a result, some large banks and other players are expected to avoid regulatory scrutiny in swaps, based on data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Both Northern Trust and BOK Financial, the parent company of Bank of Oklahoma, which are listed among the top 25 banks in the derivatives business, could be exempt. Major energy firms like Constellation Energy are also expected to get a pass.
Such companies pushed regulators to relax the rules. A coalition of energy firms, including BP, Constellation Energy and Shell, sent regulators a letter that pitched a $3.5 billion threshold and even suggested specific wording changes to the rule. Another group, known as the Coalition of Physical Energy Companies, proposed a $3 billion figure, the threshold that regulators are set to adopt after five years.
The energy groups dominated the frenetic lobbying effort surrounding the rule and its exemption. Firms dispatched executives to testify before Congress, hired an army of lobbyists and lawyers to draft comment letters and held more than 100 meetings with regulators to discuss the rule, records show. The Coalition of Physical Energy Companies hired the law firm of the former New York City mayor,Rudolph W. Giuliani, to plead its case in Washington. The other group that included Shell and BP had more than 10 meetings with regulators.
That coalition, led by law firm Hunton & Williams, also hired a consulting firm and a former prominent regulator, Sharon Brown-Hruska, to study the rule. Ms. Brown-Hruska, who was acting chairwoman of the C.F.T.C. under PresidentGeorge W. Bush, concluded that ''the proposed expansive definition of 'swap dealer' is contrary to the public interest.'' The study said the rule would reduce liquidity in markets and cause energy companies to cede their business to riskier too-big-to-fail banks.
That concern was echoed by a trade group representing midsize banks, which urged regulators in a letter ''to closely examine and understand the low-risk nature of small dealers' businesses in connection with establishing the criteria for the de minimis exemption.''
Inundated with pressure and complaints from industry groups, regulators debated the proper size of the exemption for months. The trading commission scheduled several meetings to vote on the rule, only to delay the vote each time as both agencies reviewed the final draft.
Ultimately, regulators found only imperfect numbers to support their oversight effort surrounding swaps. The data, which showed that an $8 billion figure would exclude about 85 percent of the companies, is limited to one type of derivatives contract known as a credit-default swap. But the data also encompassed a broader group than necessary, most likely including pension funds and municipalities that are not subject to the federal regulatory crackdown. The S.E.C. relied on separate information that showed the exemption would affect a significantly smaller percentage of companies.
Regulators said they tried to strike a balance using the limited data as a guide. At the least, they argued, the new rules add transparency to a market that went unpoliced during the financial crisis.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 2 Republican Leaders Fall in Line for Romney

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
4:09 p.m. Updated House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio formally endorsed Mitt Romney as the Republican presidential nominee on Tuesday, throwing the weight of his office behind Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, roughly a month before the candidate can amass the delegates necessary to make it official. 
''It is clear now that Mitt Romney is going to be our nominee,'' Mr. Boehner said at a news conference that followed his weekly meeting with the House Republican Conference. ''I think Mitt Romney has a set of economic policies that can put Americans back to work and, frankly, contrast sharply with the failed economic policies of President Obama.''
Mr. Boehner promised to do ''everything I can to help him win.''
Later in the day, under questioning from reporters, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader in the Senate, also said he was backing Mr. Romney.
''Yeah, I support Governor Romney for president of the United States,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''And he is going to be the nominee. And as you have noticed, the party is in the process of unifying behind him. And I think it's going to be an incredibly close, hard-fought race. Everybody is banding -- bandying polls around, but just look at the Gallup tracking poll yesterday actually had Governor Romney with a two-point lead. I think it's going to be a very, very competitive election. We're all behind him and looking forward to the fall campaign, which is actually already under way.''
By tradition, the presumed nominee comes to Capitol Hill to rally the Republican troops once the delegate totals are secured. Because of an elongated primary calendar, that ceremony is likely to wait until May, Congressional liaisons said last week. In the meantime, the campaign is carefully coordinating and rolling out endorsements to show a unified Republican front.
Mr. Boehner had remained studiously neutral even as his lieutenants threw their lots in with the candidates. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, endorsed Mr. Romney on March 4, ahead of the Virginia primary.
Mr. Romney's embrace of the House passed budget plan, which sets an ambitious course to cut the size of government and lower personal and corporate income tax rates has put the presumptive nominee in sync with House Republicans on the issues they believe will shape the election - deficits, taxes and federal spending.
But on some smaller issues, he has strayed. Mr. Romney has vowed to declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office and draw up punitive tariffs, a move Republican leaders say would start a damaging trade war. Last week, his campaign said Mr. Romney would not change a Democratic law easing lawsuits claiming unequal pay for women, legislation Mr. Boehner has denounced as a ''bonanza'' for trial lawyers.

HEADLINE: Senate Budget Panel To Take Up Deficit Plan

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee said on Tuesday that he would introduce the blueprint of President Obama's bipartisan deficit reduction panel to his committee as the starting point for negotiations over a long-term debt plan.
But the committee chairman, Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, made it clear that he would not push the committee to vote on amendments to the plan from the Bowles-Simpson commission or on a final version until a bipartisan consensus was reached. 
''It's unlikely we will reach agreement until after the election,'' he said. ''That's just reality.''
Mr. Conrad's announcement surprised Republicans and Democrats, who were expecting him to produce a Democratic budget that, if passed by the committee, would have been the first detailed deficit reduction plan in three years. Mr. Conrad said that committee Democrats had tried to produce a marker for the budget debate, but that he had decided to fall back on his original plan, the Bowles-Simpson blueprint, named after the chairmen of the 2010 commission, the Democrat Erskine B. Bowles and the Republican Alan K. Simpson.
Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, denounced the introduction as a stunt that proved that Democrats were not ready to vote on any budget plan that would expose them to political heat before the election.
But Mr. Conrad and his allies said the move was one of several efforts to generate quiet bipartisan negotiations ahead of a lame-duck session of Congress this fall that could be one of the most momentous in years. On Jan. 1, the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire, which would raise income tax rates on virtually every household; increase estate, dividend and capital gains tax rates; and shrink popular deductions like the child credit. More than $1 trillion in across-the-board spending cuts would also kick in, creating what the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has called an $8 trillion ''fiscal cliff.''
''Everybody's waiting for the moment,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is negotiating with Senator Dan Coats, Republican of Indiana, to prepare a tax overhaul for the lame-duck session.
The Bowles-Simpson plan would reduce the deficit by $5.4 trillion over a decade, reducing the red ink to 2.5 percent of the economy by 2015 and 1.4 percent by 2022, from 7.6 percent now. Government spending would be stabilized at 21.9 percent of the economy by 2022, with spending at Congress's discretion falling to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product that year from 8.4 percent this year.
Unlike the budget plan passed in the House, Mr. Conrad's outline would not touch the president's health care law, but it would phase out the employer tax deduction for health care and include additional health care cuts. It would lay down parameters to overhaul Social Security to slow its growth. And it would set out prescriptions for a simpler tax code that eliminates or reduces scores of tax deductions, taxes dividends and capital gains as ordinary income, and lowers individual and corporate tax rates. The goal would be to raise revenues by $2.6 trillion over 10 years, Mr. Sessions said, something he could not accept.
In that sense, the Bowles-Simpson plan may be no more viable now than it was in late 2010, when it got the votes of some conservatives and liberals on the presidential panel but failed to receive the support of the most conservative and liberal House members on the committee.
As the budget debate intensifies, Democrats are on a war footing. House committees moved forward this week on legislation to meet savings demands in the House budget of $261.5 billion over 10 years, but Democrats denounced the emerging legislation as cruel. Democrats said that their Republican counterparts would move to eliminate the Community Services Block Grant to states, jeopardizing child care, Meals on Wheels services, child protective services and transportation assistance for millions of children and older people.

HEADLINE: Phony Mommy Wars

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Ann Romney is a good mom.
She's also a good pol.
And though her people skills are far superior to Mitt's, it turns out that Ann is just as capable as her husband of turning an advantage into a disadvantage.
After the liberal strategist Hilary Rosen clumsily mocked Mitt Romney for relying on Ann to tell him what issues women care about when ''his wife has actually never worked a day in her life,'' Ann smashed that lob back. 
Blasting out her first tweet, she said: ''I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.''
Shaken Democrats dived for cover and threw Rosen under the campaign bus. The media, worried about being perceived as favoring President Obama, jumped in on the side of the maligned Ann.
She pressed her advantage, scolding Rosen on Fox News. ''She should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble,'' Ann said. She alluded to her brave battles against breast cancer and multiple sclerosis: ''Look, I know what it's like to struggle.''
But at a fund-raiser at a private home in Palm Beach, Fla., on Sunday, the night before her 63rd birthday, Ann made it clear that she wasn't really aggrieved. She was feigning aggrievement to milk the moment.
''It was my early birthday present for someone to be critical of me as a mother, and that was really a defining moment, and I loved it,'' a gleeful Ann told the backyard full of Florida fat cats, sounding ''like a political tactician,'' as Garrett Haake, the NBC reporter on the scene, put it.
It's important when you act the martyr not to overplay your hand. If you admit out loud to a bunch of people -- including Haake, who was on the sidewalk enterprisingly eavesdropping -- that you're just pretending to be offended, you risk looking phony, like your husband. (It also doesn't fly to tell Diane Sawyer that your dog ''loved'' 12 hours in a crate on top of the car or that it's ''our turn'' to be in the White House.)
The candidate, meanwhile, continued to look phony by presenting a completely different side of himself to the wealthy Palm Beach donors who came in fancy cars to eat snapper and hear a snappier Mitt.
Rather than making bland pronouncements or parsing patriotic songs, as he usually does, Mitt gave a more specific vision of a Romney White House, including the possible elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which his dad once led, and vivisecting the Department of Education. He also talked about ways he might close tax loopholes for the affluent -- another matter he hasn't been too detailed about -- to pay for his cuts in tax rates.
Mitt offered a different view of the value of working parents in January when he talked about how he changed welfare rules as governor of Massachusetts:
''I said, for instance, that even if you have a child 2 years of age, you need to go to work. And people said, well, that's heartless. And I said, no, no, I'm willing to spend more giving day care to allow those parents to go back to work. It will cost the state more providing that day care, but I want the individuals to have the dignity of work.''
So the dignity of work only applies to poor moms?
This latest kerfuffle is piffle, but it is another instance of Republicans dragging women back to the past to re-litigate issues they thought were long settled.
Just as women had assumed their contraception rights were safe, they had considered the tiresome debate about working moms versus stay-at-home moms over. My mom stayed home to raise five kids, and she is my feminist role model.
For the most part, nobody's casting aspersions on anybody else's choices, which are often driven by economics. Women have so many choices that they're overwhelmed by the stress of so many choices.
The real issue is whether Mitt, a tycoon who has been swathed in an old-fashioned cocoon, understands the plight of working mothers and the rights of 21st-century women.
When the Romneys got married and moved to Boston in 1971 so Mitt could attend Harvard, they set up house in a suburb, befriended other young Mormon couples and kept to their cloistered, conservative, privileged, traditional, white, heterosexual circle.
Campuses were roiling with change -- feminism, civil rights, antiwar demonstrations -- but the Romneys were not part of that. They were throwbacks.
''The parental roles were clear,'' Michael Kranish and Scott Helman write in ''The Real Romney.'' ''Mitt would have the career, and Ann would run the house.''
We will see if these affluent, soon-to-be owners of a car elevator in La Jolla and members of the horsey set can relate to the economic problems of regular people.
Given how secretive and shape-shifting Mitt Romney is, we'll probably have to keep eavesdropping to find out.

HEADLINE: Presidential Election in France Raises New Concerns for Investors

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
PARIS -- To the list of worries about the euro zone, add one in bold: the fate of France as it heads into the first round of a closely contested presidential election this weekend.
After a long stretch in which President Nicolas Sarkozy grappled with the euro crisis, investors are now wrestling with the implications of a potential victory by the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande. Mr. Hollande's pledges of higher taxes on the rich, and higher government spending, are luring voters disenchanted by the austerity medicine Mr. Sarkozy has administered in hopes of protecting France from financial contagion.
Many investors, though, are questioning what a government run by Mr. Hollande would mean for France's economic competitiveness and its ability to keep clear of the financial turmoil that has once again lifted the borrowing costs of two other big euro zone countries, Spain and Italy.
A surprisingly successful bond auction by Spain on Tuesday at least temporarily buoyed the financial markets in Europe and the United States. But the underlying concerns for Spain and the region have not gone away. And with polls showing Mr. Hollande as at least an even bet to oust Mr. Sarkozy, a fog of financial uncertainty has enveloped France, Europe's biggest economy after Germany. 
''If you combine an election of Francois Hollande with a worsening economic situation, no improvement in Spain, and a possible new downgrade of France by the ratings agencies, there is a high likelihood'' that France's borrowing costs will also rise, said Evariste Lefeuvre, chief economist at the French investment bank Natixis in New York.
Such sentiments are viewed warily by many French voters, and Mr. Sarkozy's opponents, who are exasperated by what they see as a crass effort by financial players to browbeat France into accepting more of the type of austerity measures that have squeezed growth in Greece, Spain and other troubled euro zone countries.
The German derivatives exchange, Eurex, ignited a political furor in France when it began trading a futures contract Monday enabling investors to hedge their bets on French government debt. The apparent premise is that France's creditworthiness could slip if the government -- whether led by Mr. Sarkozy or Mr. Hollande -- backslides on efforts to cut its debt and deficit.
Executives at Eurex said the timing was a mere coincidence. But for the bristling French, there was no ignoring that it came just days before voters head to the polls this weekend to narrow a sprawling field of French candidates down to two, with a final presidential runoff scheduled to take place May 6.
Mr. Hollande blamed the German exchange for encouraging speculation on France's insolvency, and said that if he were elected, he would try to get the new Eurex contracts eliminated.
With the campaign heating up, Mr. Hollande accused Mr. Sarkozy of encouraging market speculation against France by playing up fears that Mr. Hollande's supposed tax-and-spend programs, together with his inexperience in dealing with the financial crisis, could push France's borrowing costs toward levels that would make it harder for the nation to pay down its debt.
France's government debt will near an estimated 90 percent of gross domestic product this year -- the fifth highest in Europe and well above Germany's estimated 78 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Mr. Sarkozy, for his part, has not been shy about sounding his own populist notes in counterattacking Mr. Hollande. On Sunday, the president raised eyebrows in financial markets, and in Germany, by telling a rally in Paris that if he were re-elected, he would open a debate on widening the European Central Bank's legal mandate to let it promote growth through monetary stimulus. It is a power that the Federal Reserve in the United States holds, but that is now largely off limits to Europe's central bank, which is supposed to focus mainly on controlling inflation.
Mr. Sarkozy's campaign promise irritated his German allies. A spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel publicly reminded the French president that the bank needed to remain independent, and that it was the duty of each euro zone country to manage its own finances.
A central plank of Mr. Hollande's platform revolves around restoring social equilibrium in France, which he says Mr. Sarkozy has upset by giving tax breaks to the wealthy, giving employers greater leeway in hiring and firing, and threatening the sanctity of the 35-hour workweek that an earlier Socialist government put in place.
Mr. Hollande also contends that the cuts to government and social programs made in the name of reducing the budget deficit have hit the working class too hard. Such rhetoric has strong appeal at a time when the country is facing a shallow recession, and unemployment remains above 10 percent, the highest level in more than a decade.
But investors are already alarmed by what they see as an erosion of competitiveness among French companies, a widening current account deficit and declining exports.
As a result, investors say France is drifting away from the ''core'' of strong European economies that include Germany and the Nordic countries. Instead, it is increasingly being lumped together with the weak large economies of Spain and Italy, along Europe's troubled southern rim.
To turn things around, Mr. Hollande and Mr. Sarkozy agree that France's budget needs to be balanced soon. Mr. Sarkozy says his program would get there by 2016. Mr. Hollande says his would reach the goal by 2017. Both agree to whittle the deficit down to 3 percent of gross domestic product next year from 5.2 percent last year.
But that is where the similarities end. Mr. Sarkozy plans to raise value-added taxes on consumer products. He would continue a program of reducing government employment by replacing only one of every two civil servants who retire. He would also reduce France's financial contribution to the European Union budget and to local authorities, as well as freeze spending on certain portions of France's health care system.
Such pledges do not worry the financial markets as much as Mr. Sarkozy's promises to introduce a minimum tax on large companies, or collect more taxes from income French companies earn abroad.
Mr. Hollande, in contrast, is pledging to increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for significant new spending intended to spur the economy. He promises to raise 29 billion euros (about $38 billion) in new revenue while lifting spending by 20 billion euros.
A main Hollande plank includes introducing a 75 percent marginal tax rate on individual income above 1 million euros and forgoing the planned increase in the value-added tax. And he has pledged to fill some of the slots left open by retiring public employees by hiring 60,000 civil servants and teachers. Mr. Hollande would also reverse changes to the pension system instituted under Mr. Sarkozy, by pushing the retirement age back to 60, from 62, for people meeting certain criteria.
That platform, Mr. Lefeuvre said, is why many foreign investors are hoping for Mr. Hollande's electoral defeat.
''If he does win, there will be a lot of concern,'' Mr. Lefeuvre said.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about investor concerns arising from the French presidential election described incorrectly an economic proposal by the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande. While he has proposed hiring 60,000 civil servants and teachers, he would do so by filling slots left open by retiring public employees; it would not be an expansion of the work force.

HEADLINE: Britain Presses for Information on Death in China

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
LONDON -- After months of soft-pedaling by British diplomats in the case of a British businessman believed to have been murdered in China, Prime Minister David Cameron and his government abruptly changed course on Tuesday, going to Parliament with a blunt demand that China ''expose the truth behind this tragic case'' and do so in a manner that ''is free from political interference.''
On a day when Mr. Cameron met with China's de facto propaganda chief at 10 Downing Street and pressed the case of Neil Heywood, the 41-year-old businessman found dead in his hotel in the southern city of Chongqing on Nov. 15, Foreign Secretary William Hague faced a barrage of angry questions from opposition lawmakers concerned that Britain had played down suspicions about the death as part of a push for a larger foothold in China's booming economy. 
Setting out a chronology of Britain's involvement in a case that has become enmeshed in a shadowy power struggle over China's next generation of leaders, Mr. Hague revealed that British diplomats in China had waited for several weeks before he ordered them on Feb. 7 to raise suspicions about the death with Chinese authorities. Those suspicions had first been put to the British Embassy in Beijing by ''the British expatriate community in China'' on Jan. 18, he said. He acted, Mr. Hague acknowledged, after receiving information about the death that was relayed to Britain separately by American diplomats.
In a statement, Mr. Hague confirmed what the State Department had announced, that a powerful Chinese police official had gone to the United States Consulate in the southern city of Chengdu on Feb. 6 and given a lurid account of Mr. Heywood having been poisoned in a financial dispute with a powerful Chinese official's wife. Mr. Hague said this was when he first learned of the case, explaining that he had ''immediately ordered'' officials to ''make urgent representations to the Chinese authorities and to seek an investigation into Mr. Heywood's death.''
He also disclosed that a junior British foreign minister who handles relations with China, Jeremy Browne, was in Chongqing on Nov. 15 and 16, a 48-hour period that included the discovery of Mr. Heywood's body and Chinese officials' formal notification of his death to the British Consulate in Chongqing by fax. Mr. Hague said that Mr. Browne met on the morning of Nov. 16 with Bo Xilai, the Communist Party boss in Chongqing who was officially purged last week for his involvement in the Heywood scandal. He confirmed, effectively, that Mr. Browne did not raise the Heywood death. Photographs of Mr. Browne that appeared in British newspapers at the time showed him at a panda reserve near Chongqing.
Mr. Hague told Parliament that this was the result of an internal slip-up by British diplomats who already knew of the death, not, as some opposition lawmakers have suggested, because Britain did not want to distract from its push for wider commercial opportunities in China. ''Ministers are not routinely told of the death of British nationals or other consular cases, as they are so numerous,'' Mr. Hague said. ''However, we need to make sure that they are told in relevant cases, and we will review our procedures.''
The Chinese authorities maintained until only last week that natural causes were to blame for the sudden death of Mr. Heywood, who had built a business career in China around a highly unusual but carefully screened relationship with the family of Mr. Bo, a fast-rising party boss with a base in the megalopolis of Chongqing. Chinese officials told British officials and the Heywood family at the time that Mr. Heywood's body had lain in a hotel room in Chongqing's hilly southern suburbs for as long as 24 hours before it was discovered, and that the Chinese authorities had concluded that the cause of death was ''overconsumption of alcohol,'' a sequence confirmed by Mr. Hague on Tuesday.
The foreign secretary said the next step, cremation of the body in Chongqing on Nov. 18, had been approved by the Heywood family, apparently a reference to Wang LuLu, Mr. Heywood's wife, who is reported to have traveled to Chongqing from their home in Beijing immediately after she learned of his death. Mr. Hague said a British diplomat attended the cremation but made no mention of the fact that it took place without a post-mortem, contributing to suspicions among Mr. Heywood's friends and associates in China. Nor did he mention that friends and associates of Mr. Heywood have said that he was a very light drinker, and was described by his family as having been in good health.
Mr. Bo, 62, an ambitious, hard-knuckle politician who was hoping to ride a reshuffle this autumn in Beijing to a seat on the all-powerful, nine-member Politburo standing committee, was abruptly purged on April 10 as the Chinese authorities shifted to a sensational version of the Heywood death that centered on an allegation that the Englishman was murdered on the orders of Mr. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai. Ms. Gu faces a death sentence if she is formally charged and convicted.
On Wednesday, Xinhua, the state-run news service, said Chinese leaders were committed to investigating the political scandal and ''related events,'' according to The Associated Press.
Mr. Cameron, who was in Beijing leading a trade delegation in November, only days before Mr. Heywood died, raised the Heywood case earlier on Tuesday in his meeting with Li Changchun, the fifth-ranking member of the top Chinese leadership, who was in Britain on a previously scheduled visit, officials at 10 Downing Street said. Mr. Li, potentially a central figure in China's handling of the businessman's death, met separately with Mr. Hague.
In the House of Commons, Denis MacShane, a prominent Labour Party gadfly, demanded from Mr. Hague more details of what American diplomats had told Britain after the Chongqing police chief, Wang Lijun, sought asylum in the Chengdu consulate. He also demanded information on Mr. Heywood's contacts with British diplomats -- a potentially crucial piece of the jigsaw, since Mr. Heywood is said to have told friends shortly before he died that he feared for his life as a result of a business fallout with the Bo family.
The lawmaker pointed to the Cameron government's vow to recast the Foreign Office to promote Britain's foreign trade as the reason for the diplomatic reticence in the Heywood case.
''When William Hague became foreign minister, he decided to depoliticize the Foreign Office and turn it into a giant chamber of commerce,'' Mr. MacShane said. ''He has a pretty mercantilist approach to foreign policy.'' He demanded that Mr. Hague release diplomatic cables relating to the case, and compared the government's approach to President Richard M. Nixon's in Watergate. ''It's the old question that bedeviled Nixon: what did we know, and when did we know it?''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 20, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Wednesday about the reluctant role of the United States in the corruption and murder scandal that has engulfed the Chinese government, misstated, in some editions, the name of the Beijing ministry from which an official had gone to an American consulate to collect another official who had knowledge of the scandal and had unsuccessfully sought asylum at the consulate. It is the Ministry of State Security, not public safety. The article also misstated, in some editions, the status of Gu Kailai, a principal in the scandal who has been tied to the murder of a British businessman, Neil Heywood. Ms. Gu is under investigation in Mr. Heywood's murder; she has not been charged.

HEADLINE: April 18, 1906 | Earthquake Destroys Much of San Francisco

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On April 18, 1906, an earthquake struck San Francisco and set off raging fires. 

 BODY:
On April 18, 1906, an earthquake struck San Francisco and set off raging fires. The quake had a magnitude between 7.7 and 8.3 on the Richter scale and came shortly after 5 a.m. in two shocks that lasted more than a minute.
The April 19 New York Times reported: "The people became panic-stricken, and rushed into the streets, most of them in their night attire. They were met by showers of falling bricks, cornices and walls of buildings. Many were crushed to death, while others were badly mangled. Those who remained indoors generally escaped with their lives, though scores were hit by detached plaster, pictures and articles thrown to the floor by the shock. It is believed that more or less loss was sustained by nearly every family in the city."
More than 3,000 people died and more than a quarter-million were left homeless. Tens of thousands of people were forced to live in tents, where they remained for months and even years after the earthquake. The unsanitary conditions of the tent cities contributed to an outbreak of bubonic plague in the city in 1907.
Before the earthquake, San Francisco had been the largest city in the American West and its financial and cultural center. The quake caused a shift in population; Oakland, situated across San Francisco Bay, saw its population double, while the countryside of Marin County north of the city grew into a populous suburb. The quake also caused a gradual shift of trade and population to Southern California; by the 1920 Census, Los Angeles had surpassed San Francisco as the West's largest city.
The leaders of San Francisco moved quickly to rebuild the city. They first considered plans from renowned architect and urban planner David Burnham for a city with large boulevards and classical structures, but instead opted for the far more practical solution of rebuilding the city largely where it had stood. They relaxed building codes to encourage a speedy rebuilding, and thousands of buildings went up in just a few years, creating a new, modern city.

In 2006, for the 100th anniversary of the earthquake, The San Francisco Chronicle compared the government response to the quake with that of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005. While the response to Katrina was marked by slow progress at the city, state and federal levels, the response to the quake, nearly a century before, had been, swift, forceful and somewhat reckless.
Gen. Frederick Funston of the Army oversaw the federal response to the quake. With water cut off, he ordered the use of dynamite to halt the fires, though this needlessly destroyed many buildings and may have spread the fires at some points. He also strictly maintained law and order, threatening to shoot looters. Dan Kurzman, author of "Disaster," said, "Whether his foes in Washington liked it or not, whether he would be court-martialed or not, General Funston was now the military dictator of a fascist-style San Francisco."
What lessons in emergency response do you think can be learned from the San Francisco and New Orleans disasters? In your opinion, what steps should the federal government take to ensure that neither inaction and neglect nor unnecessarily forceful martial law takes the place of effective safety and security measures? Why?

HEADLINE: The First Opium Win

BYLINE: DAN MORRISON


HIGHLIGHT: Want to undermine the Taliban, curb the heroin trade and boost supplies of medical morphine? Buy Afghanistan's opium crop. 

 BODY:
GHAZIPUR, India - Afghanistan's annual opium harvest is coming, and the Taliban are expecting this year's bumper crop to fund yet another season of political assassinations and coordinated attacks like the ones that struck Kabul and other Afghan cities this Sunday.
According to the United Nations' 2011 Afghanistan Opium Survey (pdf), Afghanistan's farmers earned $1.4 billion from opium in 2011, an increase of 133 percent over the year before. That's about 9 percent of the country's G.D.P.
Afghan opium is processed into heroin, which then floods the streets of cities, well, just about everywhere. The proceeds pay the Taliban's fighters and suicide bombers.
On the other hand they also keep Afghan farmers from starving (pdf). What to do?
We should buy Afghan opium.

I don't mean you and me as individuals. I mean Uncle Sam. If the United States and its partners bought all of Afghanistan's opium, a major source of corruption (pdf) in Afghanistan would disappear, violence in Taliban-affected areas would fall, world supplies of heroin would crash, and a global shortage of morphine - a source of much hidden suffering - could be alleviated.
The U.S. government spent roughly $4.7 billion (pdf) on poppy-eradication and antidrug programs in Afghanistan between 2001 and 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service. These efforts were largely futile. Partly realizing the problem, the U.S. government in 2009 suspended its eradication efforts and has since favored "alternative livelihood" programs to lure farmers to other crops. But this hasn't stopped the opium trade either: opium is easy to cultivate, and the money is good.
Spending even, say, a couple of billion dollars a year to remove this cash crop from the market would be a bargain, even if all the raw opium - an estimated 5,800 metric tons in 2011 (pdf) - were simply dumped into the Indian Ocean.
But those sticky narcotic bricks could be put to better use. Afghanistan's opium could help mitigate an ongoing shortage of morphine that is causing suffering in hundreds of thousands of homes, hospitals and hospices worldwide.
The World Health Organization estimates that 5.5 billion people (about 83 percent of the world's population) have "low to nonexistent access" to opioid painkillers. "In 2006, the world used 231 tons of morphine equivalents," Marie-Josephine Seya, of Temple University, and four co-authors wrote last year in the W.H.O.'s Journal of Pain & Palliative Care Pharmacotherapy. "If all countries increased their consumption to adequate levels, the required amount would be 1,292 tons, or almost 6 times higher."
Romesh Bhattacharji, India's former narcotics commissioner, believes Afghanistan should implement a licensing system like the one used in India. Here, opium is grown by accredited farmers and processed at government factories, such as the one in Ghazipur, a northern city on the banks of the Ganges. From here it is exported or processed into codeine and other medicines.
"Past eradication efforts . . . were a failure," Bhattacharji told me last year. "In contrast, opium licensing in Afghanistan makes real sense" because it would provide an honest living to Afghan farmers while meeting the medical needs of many others. "There will be some inevitable leakage into the illegal market," Bhattacharji conceded. But that would be progress: right now all of Afghanistan's opium is sold illegally.
Conventional efforts to cut opium production in Afghanistan haven't managed to dampen the heroin trade. Meanwhile, cancer and AIDS patients worldwide are living and dying in needless pain. So let's cut out the middlemen, the illicit processors and the kingpins, and simply buy Afghan opium ourselves, in bulk, year after predictable year.

HEADLINE: Conquering Food Deserts With Green Carts

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Programs to get fresh produce carts to areas with no access to healthy food work best when government and determined entrepreneurs team up. 

 BODY:
9:21 a.m. | Updated When we think of a "desert," we don't picture southwest Philadelphia or a small town in upstate New York. But that's the description given to areas of the United States that lack ready access to healthy food - like fresh fruits and vegetables. These grocery-store deprived zones have come to be known as "food deserts" and the federal government estimates that they are home to millions of Americans (pdf), including more than 23 million people who live in low-income neighborhoods that are more than a mile from a supermarket.
In rural areas, where the closest store selling fresh produce may be 10 miles away, or in the inner city, where it may be a 30-minute trip by bus, people often make do with what's available at the corner store, the convenience shop or the neighborhood bodega. That rarely means healthy eating.
This is a problem, particularly in low-income areas, where the lack of food access correlates with high rates of obesity and diabetes. Over the past 30 years, childhood obesity in the United States has tripled, and the problem is most severe in poor communities. Today, more than a third of adults in the country are obese.
Like many problems that disproportionately affect inner-city areas, food deserts can be traced back to the "white flight" of the 1950s and '60s. Along with the loss of middle class residents from the inner city came the loss of tax dollars for local schools, redlining from financial institutions and an exodus of businesses, including grocery stores.

Today, many groups are looking to bring healthy food back to these areas, and some of the more creative initiatives are in New York. It's not clear what, if anything, will work to tackle the obesity epidemic, but the problem of food deserts is less daunting. There are two ways to solve the problem: bring in new produce vendors, or add produce to existing vendors. In both cases, a key challenge is getting businesspeople and policy makers to move past the mistaken assumption that food deserts exist because people in low-income communities don't care about healthy eating.
One of the more intriguing models is New York City's Green Cart initiative. Since 2008, the city has made provisions to authorize 1,000 new permits for street vendors who can sell only raw fruits and vegetables in areas of the city that have been designated as in need of them. The idea is to harness the enterprise of small-business people to mitigate a social problem in a sustainable way.
Most of the 500 carts that are being operated today are run by immigrants - and they work very hard. Some succeed; some don't. Vendors wake up at 4 a.m., go to wholesale markets in Hunts Point in the Bronx or Canarsie in Brooklyn, before heading to their vending locations at the start of the day. Mary Mazzio, a filmmaker who documented the stories of several vendors struggling to make a go of it, as well as the political battle to start the Green Cart program in a film titled The Apple Pushers, noted that "seeing these first-time entrepreneurs slowly begin realizing a vision for a better life through the mechanism of a push cart" struck her as a story that "crossed the generations." (Her film can be seen in screenings around the country and will be broadcast nationally on May 6.)
The appeal of green carts is clear. The start-up costs are low - about $1,800 to $3,000 - and there is no brick and mortar required. But small business is risky - even if you're not restricted in what you can sell, and where you can sell it. To the city's credit, it has enlisted help from Acción USA, which provides low-interest loans to vendors, and the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund, which offers grant support to provide vendors with business consulting services, delivered by a company called Karp Resources. (The Illumination Fund also supported the film). Karp helps vendors learn how to construct profit and loss statements, understand the (byzantine) food cart regulations, fill out permits and tax forms, engage with customers, and build up support from peers. "A small entrepreneur with limited capital and a limited support system needs networks to be successful," says Karen Karp, the company's founder. "Green carts are no exception."
Success depends on several factors, but the most important seem to be the resourcefulness of the entrepreneur, the ability to secure a good location and the ability to build relationships with customers. Finding entrepreneurs who want to serve their own neighborhoods seems particularly helpful.
The city could make things easier for vendors - who are, after all, assuming risk while helping the city address a public health problem. Some complain of being repeatedly ticketed for minor infractions. They are not permitted to sell nuts, dried fruit or bottled water, which would make their businesses more viable. And others argue that the zones are needlessly restrictive. The city has addressed one problem: modifying a regulation to expand the number of places where green carts can be stored at night.
Despite the challenges, many vendors are succeeding and thousands have applied for permits, and the green cart model is being explored or taken up in a variety of areas including Santa Clara County, Calif., Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia.
Another channel to get fruits and vegetables into food deserts is to help the owners of corner stores and bodegas succeed in selling them. New York runs a Healthy Bodegas Initiative, which provides businesses with grants for refrigeration or shelving, and advice on marketing, provided they stock various categories of healthy food. (Our Fixes guest writer Sarika Bansal recently reported on this initiative in The Atlantic.) The Food Trust, in Philadelphia, a national leader in attacking food deserts, has started the Healthy Corner Store Initiative, which combines assistance to stores and health education in Philadelphia schools.
Then there are farmers' markets. The most vibrant of them are not just a source of food, they are a source of delight. Today, there are more than 50 greenmarkets in New York City, thanks largely to GrowNYC, a nonprofit organization that works closely with the mayor's office. Many inner city farmers' markets in New York rely on food stamps and the Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which provide coupons to low-income mothers and seniors that can be redeemed at markets. (Sadly, the federal government has proposed cutting this program by $1.3 million in 2012.) Most of New York's green markets also now accept a debit card that links with the government's Electronic Benefit Transfer (E.B.T.) system. This is an important convenience. When vendors at the Clark Park farmers' market in West Philadelphia were provided with terminals to accept E.B.T. transactions, they saw a 38 percent increase in monthly food stamp sales. (The market with the highest food stamp usage in New York is the Union Square market in Manhattan, which draws customers from around the city.)
New York also runs another incentive program, Health Bucks, through which families receive a $2 coupon for every $5 in E.B.T. sales at a farmers' market - a 40 percent increase in purchasing power. Philadelphia has adopted a similar approach with its Philly Food Bucks program. Detroit and other parts of Michigan have a Double-Up Food Bucks program. Boston's Bounty Bucks offers similar kinds of benefits.
The question remains: If there is real demand for fresh food in food deserts, why don't supermarkets open up there? Why don't they regard them as food emerging markets? Well, it takes two things: innovative businesspeople who are willing to pursue opportunities where others see only problems - and creative government subsidies to make the economics work.
Consider Highland Falls, N.Y., which has a population of about 4,000. Until this past September, local residents had had no supermarket for two years. They had to drive 11 miles to get to the nearest store. The mayor started a weekly bus service so people could shop. Then a local couple, Lisa Berrios and Albert Rodriguez, decided to open a supermarket, MyTown Marketplace, in the old location. However, the abandoned building needed extensive repairs to the roof, floor and parking lot. "Nobody wanted that store. Guys with a lot of stores don't want stores like this," Rodriguez told me. "It's not a store you're going to get rich off."
It would have been impossible to make it work without the New York Healthy Food and Healthy Communities Fund, which provided a $304,000 grant to subsidize the start-up costs. The store has been running for six months and Berrios and Rodriguez say that sales are increasing each week. It's a challenge - the couple says they practically live in the store. Prices for some items are lower at the big box store over the mountain, but local residents like that the store is clean and friendly - and now they can buy fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat and fish throughout the week.
Perhaps the leading innovator in this field is Jeffrey Brown, a fourth generation grocer from Philadelphia who operates 10 large ShopRite supermarkets, six of them in areas designated as onetime food deserts. The business model in the grocery industry favors size, luxury goods and homogenous stores. Brown's business model is to locate in densely populated urban areas, get high volume with lower priced food, and make sure that his stores keep in close contact with the neighborhood. He stocks foods that are in specific demand in each neighborhood. In each store, he also has a community meeting room and a community coordinator. He has a program to hire ex-offenders - now 100 of his 2,400 employees, he said. He's recently added a credit union, which will offer free A.T.M. and check-writing services for customers and a health clinic, with a nurse practitioner.
Brown says his stores all do well. "The profit margins on my urban stores are comparable to those in my suburban stores," he notes - but that's only because the initial investments in the urban stores were subsidized by a variety of financial and tax incentives. Start-up costs in an inner city location are higher than in a suburban store, particularly for employee training - and a lot of that has to do with differences in school quality. Brown has received grants and loans through Pennsylvania's Fresh Food Financing Initiative, which was the model for the Obama administration's Healthy Food Financing Initiative, as well as tax credits from the United States Treasury's New Market Tax Credit program.
In Brown's view, the biggest lever to attack the food desert problem is the New Market Tax Credits, which can cut capital investments significantly. The government issued $3.6 billion worth of these credits last year. They can be used for many investments in distressed areas, but historically supermarkets have gotten only a small percentage of them. Brown would like the government to commit a significant sum - say $1 billion a year - to subsidize start-up costs for grocery stores in low income areas. "If you did that for a number of years, you'd eventually fix this problem," he says. "It would be done. It would not be something you'd have to do forever."
And what about healthy food? What do local residents buy from Brown's stores? "If you take all my fresh merchandise sales in the six food desert stores - produce, seafood, poultry, anything fresh - and you look at it as a percentage of the business, it's almost identical to the suburban stores," says Brown. "People might buy more collard greens and less asparagus in an urban store, but that doesn't matter. The idea is to eat nutritious food."
Update: On April 17, Times published a story reporting on two new studies that challenge the assertion that many low-income neighborhoods are "food deserts" and questioning the "relationship between the type of food being sold in a neighborhood and obesity among its children and adolescents."
These studies must be considered against prior research that suggests that low-income neighborhoods do suffer from inequitable access to healthy food. As I noted, the United States Department of Agriculture reported in 2009 that "23.5 million people live in low-income areas that are more than 1 mile from a supermarket, which represents 8.4 percent of the total U.S. population." I'm reading the new studies, as well as reviewing the existing literature, and plan to devote a follow-up post addressing the subject shortly.

HEADLINE: Tijuana Rising

BYLINE: ADAM ELDER


HIGHLIGHT: The Xolos of Tijuana are in the running for the playoffs in the Mexican league and have become a symbol of the city's emergence from rampant drug violence. 

 BODY:
After dark years of drug-related terror, bloodshed and fear in Mexico, Tijuana has a lot to cheer about these days.
The bustling border city's first top-division soccer team, Club Tijuana Xoloscuintles, is on the verge of making the Mexican league playoffs in its first full season in the top flight. In the aftermath of receding violence, the city is rebuilding and redefining itself at the same moment that the wildly popular local club is surging.
After lastFriday night's scoreless draw at Chiapas, Tijuana rose to sixth in the Clausura season's table with two games remaining (the top eight teams advance to the playoffs in May). Xolos, named after a hairless, Doberman-like Aztec dog, boast the meanest defense in the league, allowing only 10 goals in 15 matches. Goalkeeper Cirilo Saucedo helped sustain that form with a highlight reel's worth of impressive saves on Friday.
Xolos's run is a stark contrast to the first half of the season, when the optimism of promotion was abruptly met with the reality of life in the Primera División. Tijuana struggled near the bottom of the standings, winless in its first five home games. Manager Joaquín del Olmo, who had guided Xolos up to the first division last May, was fired in September. The Argentine Antonio Mohamed was appointed in his place. The team finished the first half-season (the Apertura) in 15th, and its form has greatly improved in the second half.
"You have to grow up," said the Xolos sporting director Ignacio Palou of the team's turnaround. "Some players don't have the experience of the first division, so they have to play a few games, get their feet on the ground, and know how the first division is."
Xolos did, however, spend big on league veterans upon promotion, including Saucedo, the Argentine striker José Sand (their leading scorer), the Mexican international midfielder Fernando Arce, and the midfield anchor Egidio Arévalo, who won last summer's Copa América with Uruguay.
Their experience is complemented with a number of bright young talents. Perhaps no prospect is more exciting than the 21-year-old midfielder Joe Corona, a regular starter who grew up in San Diego and Tijuana and has triple nationality (in addition to the U.S. and Mexico, he is eligible to play for El Salvador, but has yet to accept a senior-level call-up from any of the three). Corona scored four goals in the United States' unsuccessful Olympic qualifying campaign on the U-23 squad in March. The American wing Edgar Castillo, 25, who received his first call-up by U.S. national team Coach Jurgen Klinsmann last year, is also a regular starter for Xolos.
Tijuana has had various incarnations of a local soccer team on and off for years. Xolos was founded in 2007 by Jorge Hank Rhon, a former mayor of the city and longtime owner of Caliente casino, one of Mexico's largest sports betting companies. His son, also named Jorge, serves as president of the team. The elder Rhon is well-known throughout Mexico: He cuts a figure not unlike Dos Equis' Most Interesting Man in the World, his reputation a blend of facts and conjecture. His huge property next to the Xolos' stadium, Estadio Caliente, includes a small zoo of exotic animals and several stables of horses. Caliente's hotel tower rises beyond the opposite side of the stadium, high above the glitzy casino and adjacent dog racetrack.
Xolos's success came at a pivotal time for the city of 1.5 million.
The well-documented drug violence and ransom kidnappings that have ravaged Mexico in the past several years hit Tijuana - where tourism is a significant part of the economy - especially hard. At its destructive peak in 2008, there were 850 murders in the city. Main tourist drags like Avenida Revolución, for years a noisy kaleidoscope of gringo bars, strip clubs and chintzy souvenir stands, had become a desolate stretch of closed doors and increasingly aggressive vendors.
Now in 2012, with crime down, Revolución and other parts of the city are starting to have a different flavor: Mexican-leaning businesses, upscale restaurants and nightlife catering more to locals, with new construction going up. The celebrated local chef Javier Plascencia was recently profiled in The New York Times and in "The New Yorker."
But most noticeably, Xolos mania has swept the city. Where once the only soccer gear you could find was largely Chivas de Guadalajara, Club América or Chicharito's Manchester United jerseys, the city is inescapably awash in the red and black of Xolo shirts, flags, hats and billboards, and Xolos stickers mark nearly every car.
"For a long time, Tijuana has been defined more by outsiders than by the people who actually live there," said Adrian Florido, a border reporter for KPBS public radio in San Diego. "In the face of the tourism vacuum that the drug violence has brought on, it created this opportunity for Tijuanans to redefine the city for themselves. And the fact that they now have a first-rate soccer team has given people the chance to redefine the image of Tijuana for Tijuanans as a truly Mexican city, and not a second-rate American city."
Like Tijuana, Estadio Caliente is a work in progress: A lone luxury box tower with exposed concrete and protruding rebar are signs of a planned expansion from its current 16,000 capacity to an eventual 33,333 (three is said to be a favorite number of Rhon). The stadium is filled every game - Palou estimates roughly 10 percent come from California. Nearly everyone wears the home team's red game jersey. Several supporters' groups keep the noise level high during open play, and when the stadium erupts after a Xolos goal, beer literally soars through the air. The mood remains festive even after the match as a live band performs on a concourse stage while spectators file out.
And perhaps only in Tijuana would the largest and noisiest supports' group have the self-awareness to call themselves La Massacre (the Massacre). Several hundred strong, their noise, red and black flags and drums don't stop for 90 minutes. Like most hardcore ultras groups in soccer, their chants waver between supportive and critical, depending on the team's performance.
Right now, they should have nothing to complain about. The playoffs beckon, but first Xolos travel to 16th-place San Luis on Saturday and then host Mexico City's UNAM Pumas, currently in 13th, on April 29.
For the team and its hometown, it is an impressive turnaround.

HEADLINE: Tribeca: This Festival Brought to You With the Help of Skype

BYLINE: MEKADO MURPHY


HIGHLIGHT: An interview with the new programming team for the Tribeca Film Festival. 

 BODY:
The Tribeca Film Festival returns to New York today with more than 90 features in tow and a variety of events that expand beyond the movie screen. Started as a project to help revitalize downtown neighborhoods after 9/11, the festival has evolved in several ways over the past decade. And making choices about the kinds of films the festival will show has always been an important factor in its growth.
This year, a new team is making those choices and brings significant experience from other festivals. The artistic director, Frédéric Boyer, was artistic director and chief programmer of the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes. Genna Terranova, who comes from an acquisitions background and was the festival's senior programmer, has been promoted to director of programming. And Geoffrey Gilmore, who was the longtime head of the Sundance Film Festival before taking over as chief creative officer at Tribeca in 2009, has expanded his programming role.
In an interview at their offices in Tribeca, they talked about the festival's identity, how they say no to filmmakers and how their selection process worked. Hint: Skype and a pet cat were involved. Below are excerpts from that conversation.
Q.
Frédéric, how has your process shifted from your role at Directors' Fortnight?
A.
Frédéric Boyer: At Fortnight we selected only 22 films. Here, we are able to select 90 films. And some kinds of films were impossible to bring to Fortnight. We could have one or two mainstream films, but we didn't bring a lot of genre movies. Here, we have Cinemania [devoted to those films]. So it's extremely different for me. But I learned how to say no to a filmmaker and to argue why the film would not fit at the festival, but still respect the filmmaker. The best quality to be a programmer everywhere is to be respectful of the film you are not selecting.
Q.
What would you say would best characterize the identity of the festival?
A.
Geoffrey Gilmore: We're a festival that has the benefit of being in New York. And the visibility that platform has gives you an enormous asset in terms of showcasing work. So the industry sees us as a real festival for acquisition and for launch. But it's also a festival about discovery and trying to expand film culture. I think the innovation of Tribeca, trying to open the festival up to younger audiences, using technology and outreach in ways that no other festival is using it, are ways of rethinking what a festival needs to become in the next decade.
Q.
How do films generally get chosen for the festival?
A.
Genna Terranova: We get random submissions every year and we also go out and look for movies all over the world. On our team we have both young programmers and ones who have been at other festivals and we all respect each other's opinion. We don't respect the idea of, "I like this, I don't like this." You have to explain why, almost as if you're looking at it as an academic evaluation.
But at the same time, you have to add that human observation: Were you moved? Were you scared? We highlight these movies with the evaluations and we filter what movies we're going to continue to talk about.
We had this really interesting programming process this year with Frédéric, when he was in France before he got his visa. A lot of communication was done on Skype, which was a challenge. But he could smoke throughout all the meetings.
Boyer: And I had my cat.
Q.
If you have a filmmaker who has a film that you want in the festival, but they are questioning whether or not they should bring it to Tribeca, how do you handle that?
A.
Terranova: It's really tricky, because you don't want to ever give a filmmaker advice on what you think they should do with a movie. You can only say, I love your film. We would love to play your film. And then you say, whatever decision you make, we'll respect it.
Gilmore: Filmmakers are the central point of a series of different advisers telling them what to do. And half a dozen of those advisers have different agendas.
I know a lot of people who have been told, "Don't go there, we're going to get to Cannes." And you know how dumb that is? Do you know how difficult it is to get an American film into Cannes? I mean, it's ridiculous.
But you have to let them make the decision. You don't ever downgrade somebody else's festival. You don't say, "Let me tell you what really happens at [South by Southwest]." You just tell them what you think. And surprisingly enough, when you're straightforward and honest, that communicates a lot to filmmakers about where they want to be.
I know a programmer who's burned so many bridges with filmmakers by being enraged that they didn't accept their invitation, that at a certain point, the reputation got around to a lot of people that this guy's a jerk.
Q.
What about the films you let go?
A.
Terranova: Sometimes there are movies that weren't ready for you and you did the right thing by not taking that movie because they needed three months to edit it. In that sense, you respect the filmmaker. There's a lot of moving parts in that decision process.
And there is a bit of a personal network between programmers and festival heads where we will recommend films to other festivals that didn't work for us. And I think that really helps the filmmakers.

HEADLINE: City App Contest Won by a Tool for Those Who Make Apps

BYLINE: JOSHUA BRUSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: The winner of the city's third annual Big Apps contest was NYCFacets, which helps web developers make use of public data. 

 BODY:
There were almost 100 entries into New York City's third annual Big Appscontest, grappling with urban issues like transportation, education and land use. In the end, the top prize went to a project whose main goal was to make it easy for developers to make more apps.
NYCFacets, the project that won best overall application, looks to help Web developers grapple with the deluge of public data being released by city agencies. It can be difficult to find out what is contained within these data sets. So Joel Natividad and Sami Baig created NYC Facets, which identifies over a million facts about the data and creates ways for developers to search through it.
The need to identify useful pieces of data is becoming increasingly important. The Bloomberg administration has focused on making large amounts of public data available in formats that can be used by computer programmers, and a recently passed open-data law could encourage even more data sets to hit the open Web.
The second-place prize went to Work+, an iPhone application that lets people find public places to work, searching by criteria like WiFi accessibility, or the availability of coffee. Work+ also won the Best NYC Mashup award, which recognizes apps that pull together disparate data sets in interesting ways.
There were 12 prizes given out in all, with $50,000 in prize money. The contest is largely financed by private sponsors. A mobile app called Embark NYC won the mobility award, while596 Acres, a Web site, won best green app. A full list of the winners is available on the Big Apps Web site.
The city sees its contest both as a way to encourage government transparency and as a way to support New York's burgeoning technology industry, which has been growing much faster than the city's overall economy. Employment in the technology industry has grown 28 percent between 2005 and 2010, a period in which private sector employment has grown only 3.4 percent, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation. Over the same period of time, the number of patents awarded to city residents has grown by 78 percent.
The technology industry has a reputation for helping people go from complete obscurity to unbelievable fame and fortune in a matter of months. The city highlighted the success of MyCityWay, whose NYCWay won several awards from the first Big Apps contest in 2010. MyCityWay quickly found funding and is now active in 70 cities across the globe. Its founders showed off a new version of their app at Tuesday's ceremony.
But winning the app contest has not been a guaranteed path to success. The creators of WayFinder NYC, which won the top prize in that first app contest, were found milling near the "investor bar" minutes before this year's winners were announced. They said that they were still plugging away at their creation between shifts at coffee shops in Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies, Hiring Abroad

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: American-owned multinational companies grew in 2010, but they mostly grew abroad, a new Commerce Department report finds. 

 BODY:
American-owned multinational companies grew in 2010, but they mostly grew abroad.
A new Bureau of Economic Analysis report shows that in 2010, the worldwide work force employed by United States-based multinationals grew 0.5 percent, to 34 million workers.
Within these companies, their foreign payrolls grew 1.5 percent, to 11 million overseas workers.
Their domestic payrolls, on the other hand, grew about 0.1 percent, to 23 million workers. That meager growth at home was still welcome news, though, considering that in the same year total private sector employment in the United States fell by 0.6 percent. The United States economy was still reeling from the financial crisis, and a lot of that job growth at home was likely enabled by sales growth abroad.
Over time, fast growth overseas coupled with stagnant growth or even losses at home mean that these international conglomerates are shifting a larger share of their talent base abroad.
As you can see from the chart above, in 1989, 79 percent of the labor force working for American multinational corporations was working in the United States. As of 2010, that share had fallen to 67.7 percent.
The United States may be looking relatively less attractive to multinationals based in foreign countries, too.
Foreign firms reduced the number of jobs in their American offices in 2010 to 5.2 million from 5.3 million. That's a decline of about 1 percent, and it follows a 6.1 percent decline a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Regulators Defend Derivatives Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators approved a rule on Wednesday that spells out the type of derivatives dealers that will soon face federal oversight, a crucial piece of the broader regulation for the market that played a major role in the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Regulators approved a rule on Wednesday that spells out the type of derivatives dealers that will soon face federal oversight, a crucial piece of the broader regulation for the market that played a major role in the financial crisis.
The rule, which defines the universe of so-called swaps dealers, has been one of the more contentious rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law. Dodd-Frank, passed in response to the crisis, sought to create new oversight and capital requirements on the firms that arrange swaps. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's five members approved the rule unanimously, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted 4 to 1.
In passing the rule, the agencies rejected criticism that the plan was too lax on the derivatives industry. The rule will exempt energy firms, banks and other companies that arrange less than $8 billion worth of swaps, the derivative contracts tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and gas. After five years, the threshold would reset to $3 billion. But when regulators first proposed the rules in late 2010, they set the "de minimis" exemption at $100 million.
 As DealBook reported onTuesday, one limited set of regulatory data suggests that 85 percent of companies would not be subject to oversight under the $8 billion exemption. 
But some regulators say that the number of exempt firms is largely irrelevant. Of greater importance, they say, is that their rule still would capture the vast majority of swaps contracts because it applies to the big banks like Goldman Sachs that arrange most of the deals. 
"As the swap dealing market is dominated by large entities, though, I believe that the final swap dealer definition will encompass the vast majority of swap dealing activity, as Congress had intended," Gary Gensler, chairman of the C.F.T.C., said at a public meeting in Washington on Wednesday. 
He then directed a statement at critics of the rule. "For those who question the level of the de minimis, we considered the threshold in the context of an overall $300 trillion notional swaps market," noting that $8 billion in hardly significant amid this massive market. 
The $8 billion threshold, he said, represents $32 million in notional value of derivatives trading per day. "Putting this in perspective, the interest rate swap market, transacts, on average, over $500 billion notional per day," Mr. Gensler said. "As further reference, this year the futures markets for crude oil traded, on average, $65 billion of notional per day."
Under the rule, the C.F.T.C and S.E.C. must study whether the $8 billion figure is appropriate. The agencies could change the figure if it proved too high or low.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the C.F.T.C. who supported the rule but sounded a note of caution about the $8 billion threshold being "aired on the high side,"welcomed the study as a way to add clarity to the debate. 
"We'll have the study," he said, and "we can do the right thing and we can come up with a more appropriate, fine tuned" rule down the road.

HEADLINE: It's Not About Winning the Game

BYLINE: KERRI MACDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Ruth Fremson photographed the girls' basketball team at a school for at-risk teens in a rural Tennessee region beset by high unemployment and prescription drug abuse. 

 BODY:
Ruth Fremson has photographed a number of schools over the years, but she's gained full access into only one, in 2007, at a high-achieving public high school in Massachusetts.
A school Ms. Fremson visited this year, in rural Tennessee, was different. Over the course of a month, she made several trips to Carroll Academy, a day school operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court for troubled teenagers in Huntingdon, Tenn.
Teenage girls are teenage girls, she realized. Despite geography. Despite background.
"These kids are not bad kids," said Ms. Fremson, a staff photographer for The New York Times.
"They have problems, behavioral problems, or attention problems, and they get in trouble."
Since Sunday, the Sports section has been publishing "The Lady Jaguars," a feature that includes multimedia and photographs of the nine players on the school's girl's basketball team. Some of the girls have problems with drugs and alcohol. Some have lived in abandoned houses without water or electricity. And most have little experience playing organized sports.
The Jaguars are not a winning team. This season, John Branch writes, the girls have lost with scores like 80-8 and 65-7. "Any school that has that kind of a losing streak, you sort of wonder what's going on, and who's the coach?" Ms. Fremson said.
But because Carroll Academy is a day program, most of its students - from about 70 to 100 at a time - are not there for long. There is little time to train. "By the time they even teach them how to catch a ball, they practically have one foot out the door," Ms. Fremson said.
Sports are used instead as a tool to help students learn about leadership, teamwork and discipline, and to build their self-esteem.
"When they come in, I tell them not to look at this as a punishment, because it's really not," said Patrick Steele, the school's director of security, in "Sentenced to Basketball," a video by Catherine Spangler that features Ms. Fremson's work.
The project also includes five slide shows with audio interviews - photographs of Destiny, a point guard; Summer, a forward; Tonya Lutz, a coach; Mr. Steele and Randy Hatch, the school administrator at Carroll Academy.
To help gain the trust of the girls, Ms. Fremson gave them pictures she took early on. "In a couple of cases there were girls who were not happy with the picture - they didn't want to show anyone else," she said. "So for some of the girls, it was an ice breaker. And for other ones I had to work a little harder to explain why I chose that picture, and that I thought they'd really like it."
The third day the journalists were there, Destiny was given a surprise drug test. "She failed," said Ms. Fremson, who was amazed that she was permitted to photograph the 17-year-old taking the test and apologizing to her teachers.
"That's unusual for a school," she said of the access.
Ms. Fremson stayed in Huntingdon - about 100 miles east of Memphis and 100 miles west of Nashville - for two weeks at the end of the season, hoping to follow some of the girls home on weekends.
"Some of the nicest moments were when the girls started to open up," said Ms. Fremson, who worked with the luxury of time. While a few of the girls were hesitant at first, most had warmed to her by the end of the project. So did the school.
"They opened their doors and they opened their arms to us," Ms. Fremson said. "And so to earn that trust and to treat them with the integrity they deserve, is something I felt pretty deeply."

HEADLINE: Regulators Defend Derivatives Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators approved a rule on Wednesday that spells out the type of derivatives dealers that will soon face federal oversight, a crucial piece of the broader regulation for the market that played a major role in the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
Regulators approved a rule on Wednesday that spells out the type of derivatives dealers that will soon face federal oversight, a crucial piece of the broader regulation for the market that played a major role in the financial crisis.
The rule, which defines the universe of so-called swaps dealers, has been one of the more contentious rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul law. Dodd-Frank, passed in response to the crisis, sought to create new oversight and capital requirements on the firms that arrange swaps. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's five members approved the rule unanimously, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted 4 to 1 in favor of it.
In passing the rule, the agencies rejected criticism that the plan was too lax on the derivatives industry. The rule will exempt energy firms, banks and other companies that arrange less than $8 billion worth a year of swaps, the derivative contracts tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and gas. After five years, the threshold would be lowered to $3 billion. But when regulators first proposed the rules in late 2010, they set the de minimis exemption at $100 million.
 As DealBook reported onTuesday, one limited set of regulatory data suggests that 85 percent of companies would not be subject to oversight under the $8 billion exemption. 
But some regulators say that the number of exempt firms is largely irrelevant. Of greater importance, they say, is that their rule still would capture the vast majority of swaps contracts because it applies to the big banks like Goldman Sachs that arrange most of the deals. 
"As the swap dealing market is dominated by large entities, though, I believe that the final swap dealer definition will encompass the vast majority of swap dealing activity, as Congress had intended," Gary Gensler, chairman of the C.F.T.C., said at a public meeting in Washington on Wednesday. 
He then directed a statement at critics of the rule. "For those who question the level of the de minimis, we considered the threshold in the context of an overall $300 trillion notional swaps market," he said, noting that $8 billion was hardly significant amid this huge market. 
The $8 billion threshold, he said, represented $32 million in notional value of derivatives trading per day. "Putting this in perspective, the interest rate swap market, transacts, on average, over $500 billion notional per day," Mr. Gensler said. "As further reference, this year the futures markets for crude oil traded, on average, $65 billion of notional per day."
Under the rule, the C.F.T.C and S.E.C. must study whether the $8 billion figure is appropriate. The agencies could change the figure if it proved too high or low.
Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the C.F.T.C. who supported the rule but sounded a note of caution about the $8 billion threshold's being "on the high side," welcomed the study as a way to add clarity to the debate. 
"We'll have the study," he said, and "we can do the right thing and we can come up with a more appropriate, fine-tuned" rule down the road.

HEADLINE: Greenhill Swings to a 1st-Quarter Profit

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The boutique investment bank said on Tuesday that it had earned 53 cents a share, far surpassing analysts' average estimate of 38 cents a share as advisory revenues surged. 

 BODY:
Greenhill & Company reported a $16.1 million profit for its first quarter, swinging from a loss a year ago as the firm benefited from a 51 percent surge in advisory revenue.
The firm said on Tuesday that it had earned 53 cents a share, far surpassing analysts' average estimate of 38 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Its profit leaped 70 percent, to $82.7 million.
The results from the boutique investment bank may augur an improving market for deals, as bankers await what they say is an inevitable uptick in mergers activity. That hope had often been tempered by a reluctance on the part of corporate boards to leap into potentially risky transactions amid a sluggish economy.
Greenhill said in its press release that it expects more deals to transpire this year, though much of that activity may come in the third and fourth quarters.
"Conditions seem ripe for a sustained improvement in M&A activity, although the timing and degree of that are obviously uncertain," Scott L. Bok, Greenhill's chief executive, said in a statement. "For us, today's results reflect a solid start to the year."
Among Greenhill's assignments that were completed in the first quarter -- meaning that the firm was fully paid for its work -- were the sale of American Dental Partners to JLL Partners and the merger of Pentair with Tyco International's flow control business.
Mr. Bok said that the prospects of deal activity appeared to be improving both in Europe, where economic turmoil has impinged upon mergers work, and in the United States.
Greenhill also said that it was continuing to work on restraining employee compensation, one of the biggest costs at an investment bank. The firm said that it had kept its compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of revenues at 50 percent. That is down significantly from the same time last year, though largely a function of this quarter's improved revenues.

HEADLINE: Women's Work

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: For the first time since three female Supreme Court justices have been sitting together, the court considered a sex discrimination claim. They ended up on the losing side. 

 BODY:
 We're accustomed to talking about a "divided" Supreme Court, riven with ideological conflict. But a mean little 5-to-4 decisionthat the court issued last month all but overlooked in the breathless run-up to the Affordable Care Act arguments, suggests another kind of divide as well: a gender gap.
For the first time since three female justices have been sitting together, the court considered a sex discrimination case. (I'm not counting last term's big Walmart case which, although it concerned a claim of sex discrimination, reached the Supreme Court as a case about class-action procedure.) And as the case turned out, the three women, along with the highly evolved Justice Stephen G. Breyer, were on one side - the losing side - while the remaining five men were in the majority.

Before anyone objects that I'm being too cute, and that this array simply maps onto the court's ordinary ideological alignment, I have to explain further. I'm calling the case, Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals, a case about sex discrimination, and it was, as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued powerfully in her dissenting opinion.
But the remarkable thing is that the justices in the majority didn't see it that way. In ruling that Congress acted beyond its constitutional authority when it opened the states to damage suits by their employees under a section of the Family and Medical Leave Act, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and his allies denied that this case had anything to do with sex discrimination. It was simply a case about state immunity from suit. The division on the court was thus not primarily one of ideology but of something even more fundamental: perception.
At issue was the "self-care" provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act, under which public and private sector employers must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to employees who can't work because of a health condition. A man who was denied the sick leave he requested sued his employer, the Maryland state court system.
States are generally immune from suits for damages unless Congress has invoked a valid basis for declaring otherwise. The claimed basis here was Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, which gives Congress the power to enforce through "appropriate legislation" the amendment's guarantees of equal protection and due process. The question in the case was whether allowing state workers to sue for damages for a denial of medical leave was "appropriate" Congressional action. Given the court's precedents, a positive answer to that question depended on a finding that the provision was aimed at preventing or curing a problem of constitutional dimension, namely sex discrimination by government employers.
Nine years ago, the court considered another provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the "family care" provision, which requires up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for an employee to care for a family member with a serious health condition. A Nevada state employee who was denied leave to care for his ailing wife had filed a lawsuit, and the state claimed that it was immune.
That case, Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs reached the court as Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was leading a narrow majority that appeared intent on curbing Congress's 14th amendment enforcement power; the court had recently ruled that states were immune from damage suits by their employees under the federal laws against discrimination on the basis of age and disability.
So nearly everyone was surprised when Chief Justice Rehnquist, declaring that the Hibbs case was different, delivered a robust majority opinion that affirmed Congress's power to authorize suits under the family-care provision. By making family leave available to men and women on identical terms, he said, Congress intended to combat "the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caring for family members is women's work." He explained that the stereotype caused women to be seen as less reliable and therefore less desirable employees, a situation appropriately remedied by allowing all employees, male and female, to sue for damages.
That was the background for the court's consideration of the self-care question in the Coleman case. Chief Justice Rehnquist, of course, is gone, and the insight he brought to bear in the Hibbs decision appears to have vanished with him.
Like the family-care provision, the self-care section of the Family and Medical Leave Act makes no reference to gender. Neither section mentions childbirth or pregnancy. Can it really be that Congress had sex discrimination in mind when enacting one provision but not the other? That women who suffer in the workplace from the assumption that they will stay home to take care of a sick baby don't also suffer from potential employers' recognition of the obvious fact that women, and not their male colleagues, will need some time off to recover from having the baby in the first place?
Congress debated the Family and Medical Leave Act for eight years before finally enacting it in 1993. Before and during that time, a debate was raging in feminist circles over how the law in general should treat pregnancy. In a 1974 decision, Geduldig v. Aiello the Supreme Court had come to the ridiculous conclusion that as a constitutional matter, discrimination against pregnant women in eligibility for insurance and other benefits was not discrimination on the basis of sex. The court in that case reasoned that distinctions on the basis of pregnancy were not distinctions between men and women but between pregnant women and all non-pregnant people.
So the issue had to be tackled legislatively. Some argued that the law should explicitly require pregnancy leave, recognizing women's special need. Others warned that this would enshrine a stereotype, labeling women as more expensive, less desirable employees while in fact men and women take medical leave at almost identical rates.
The ultimate decision was to make the "self-care" medical leave portion of the law gender-neutral, and the legislative history makes the reason clear. "A law providing special protection to women," the House report explained, "in addition to being inequitable, runs the risk of causing discriminatory treatment." In other words, the self-care provision was rooted in Congress's desire to protect women against pregnancy discrimination while at the same time not wanting to inflict a new vulnerability.
Justice Ginsburg explained all this in her dissenting opinion, portions of which she read from the bench when the decision was handed down on March 20. "Congress assiduously avoided a legislative package that, over all, was or would be seen as geared to women only," she said, adding that the Family and Medical Leave Act as a whole "thereby reduced employers' incentives to prefer men over women, advanced women's economic opportunities, and laid the foundation for a more egalitarian relationship at home and at work." The self-care provision was "a key part of that endeavor," she concluded.
Justice Ginsburg also said that "pregnancy discrimination is inevitably sex discrimination." The 1974 Geduldig decision was so "egregiously wrong" on this point that the court, she added, should now overturn it.
Not only did Justice Kennedy's opinion for the court not respond to that invitation, it failed to acknowledge Justice Ginsburg's main argument. The self-care provision "makes no reference to any distinction on the basis of sex," Justice Kennedy said, ignoring Justice Ginsburg's proof of why this was precisely the point. He continued, "There is nothing in particular about self-care leave, as opposed to leave for any personal reason, that connects it to gender discrimination." Since the provision was not, in this view, aimed at addressing a problem of constitutional dimension, it was not the "appropriate" legislation necessary to abrogate the states' immunity from suit.
What to make of this decision? I'd love to know how Rehnquist would have voted. Although his opinion in the 2003 Hibbs case addressed only the family-care provision, because that was all that was at issue, a fair reading of the opinion suggests that he saw the Family and Medical Leave Act as a whole, an appropriate response to "the states' record of unconstitutional participation in, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits," as he put it. The passage he cited from the legislative history - "Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities has been traceable directly to the pervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and workers second" - seems applicable across the board, to pregnancy as well as childcare.
During his 33-year tenure, William Rehnquist was unshakably conservative in nearly all facets of the court's jurisprudence. But he was open to persuasion on the question of sex discrimination. In 1996, he outraged Justice Antonin Scalia by writing an opinion concurring in the court's decision to invalidate the Virginia Military Institute's men-only admissions policy. Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in that case. With respect to the Hibbs case, she has joked that when she showed Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion to her husband, he asked whether she was the chief justice's ghostwriter.
Her fact- and history-laden dissent in the latest case was, it seems to me, about as persuasive as they come. Justice Ginsburg's typical writing style is spare, but here she spoke with a passion that she usually keeps in check. Some saw it as a kind of swan song, a summation of a life's work, but I don't see it that way at all. I saw it rather as a declaration that sisterhood on the Supreme Court is, if not powerful, at least keeping score.

HEADLINE: Margaret Atwood and Tax Reform

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: To effect change in how the nation tackles its deficit and overhauls its tax code, we need leaders willing to take on the powerful lobbies of interest groups and industries, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Writing recently in The Financial Times, the renowned novelist Margaret Atwood nailed the lasting effects of the recent - and some would say continuing - global financial crisis. "Those at the top were irresponsible and greedy," she wrote; consequently and with good reason, very few people now trust our banking elite or the system they operate.
Even Camden R. Fine, president of Independent Community Bankers of America, is now calling for the country's largest banks to be broken up.
But the distrust goes deeper and further, just as Ms. Atwood implies. Many people understand perfectly well that the government let the bankers take excessive risk. There was a high degree of group think among prominent officials in the United States and top banking executives in the run-up to the crisis of 2008. As chief economist at the International Monetary Fund from March 2007 through August 2008, I observed some of this firsthand.
And politicians are also tarnished. They appointed the officials who failed to regulate effectively. And in 2007-8 the politicians decided to save the big banks - and most of their managers, boards and shareholders - both under President George W. Bush and under President Obama.

Now attention turns toward the federal government's fiscal problems, including the complicated mess that is our tax system. Politicians say they want "tax reform," but can you trust them to do this in a responsible manner, without falling captive to particular special interests or to otherwise undermine the general social interest?
The latest indications from Mitt Romney are not encouraging. Mr. Romney is proposing a tax overhaul that he says would be revenue neutral. But his actual plans amount to cutting tax rates, particularly for high-income people, while not closing enough loopholes to make any difference (see this assessment by my colleague and co-author James Kwak, or this take by Matthew O'Brien of The Atlantic).
At the same time, President Obama is focused on increasing taxes for relatively well-off Americans. Mr. Obama wants to make the Bush-era tax cuts permanent for people earning less than $250,000, while not extending them for people with income above that level. What exactly will control the trajectory of deficits and debt in that scenario?
Perhaps we should trust our politicians to control future health-care spending, even though none of them can specify exactly how this should be done. But what is really likely to happen given that health-care providers - hospitals and doctors -- are a powerful lobby, while insurance companies may be even stronger?
All significant loopholes, including the tax exemption of employer-provided health benefits and the tax deductibility of mortgage interest payments, will be defended fiercely by powerful special interests.
Top military officials seem willing to curtail spending, but members of Congress frequently resist base closings and the cancellation of weapons programs. President Eisenhower famously warned against the military-industrial complex; perhaps we should update that to acknowledge that it's the industrial-political complex that's the danger.
The financial crisis blew a giant hole in our budget and, with good reason, greatly undermined confidence in our political elite. Gridlock in Washington has reached a new peak - President Obama proposed the Buffett Rule, which would have raised a very small amount of additional revenue by creating a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on all income over $1 million, and the Republicans immediately blocked consideration of it in the Senate. 
Most of what poses as "tax reform" in Washington today is actually tax reduction. With our public finances in their current state, this is the last thing we need. The idea that reducing taxes "pays for itself" through higher growth is just wishful thinking; in our new book, James Kwak and I debunk this in part by citing the research of Greg Mankiw, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush and a key adviser to Mr. Romney. 
Yet Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama are likely to compete in November partly on the basis of their tax-reduction proposals.
May we hope that there are ways to bring our national debt under control? Prospects are not so gloomy, for two reasons. 
First, if true gridlock prevails, the Bush-era tax cuts will expire at the end of this year. Whatever happens in the November general election, the Democrats and the Republicans would need to agree in order for these tax cuts to be extended. It is quite possible that this will not happen.
That's a big fiscal adjustment, to be sure. But it could well be buffered by a temporary payroll tax cut, linked to employment relative to population. As employment recovers, the payroll tax cut would fade away.
Second, one day soon the private sector will wake up to the fact that rising health-care costs are undermining the American economy, and making it much harder to earn a profit.
With money-driven politics, the only way to fight a lobby is with a bigger lobby. American businesses are typically reluctant to trespass into someone else's sector. But they will do it when their own bottom line is at stake - as, for example, when they resist various forms of protectionism.
Health-care costs are not under control; we pay more for the same or less-good services over time; this is like the worst kind of taxation. In 20 years, the adverse impact of health-care costs of businesses will be much worse than any negative effects of taxes.
But don't wait for the politicians to take this on. The problem is far too important and that route will take too long. Talk instead to private-sector executives and entrepreneurs. Persuade them that health-care costs need to be brought under control, and force them to think about how they can push the health-care industry in this direction. 
Don't leave banking regulation to be decided by the banks. And don't let the health-care industry control the discussion on what needs to be changed in cost of the delivering medical services.
Mr. Fine is now willing to take on the big banks; he should be commended and supported more broadly on this basis. By working on this issue at the highest political level, he can help restore grassroots confidence in community banking.
Who within the private sector is willing to take on the health-care lobby? Who will take the lead on restoring trust in our market-based economy more broadly?

Partner Exodus May Upend Firm's Loans | An accelerating wave of partner defections from the New York law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf is now threatening to violate the firm's loan agreements with its banks.
Dewey has been in turmoil after slashing its partners' salaries - many of them that had previously been guaranteed - after weak financial performance last year. With eight more partners announcing their departures from Dewey on Tuesday, at least 66 of 300 partners have now left the firm since January. Having lost more than 20 percent of its partners, the firm has run into problems with its banks, according to three people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
At issue are Dewey's loan agreements that require the firm to maintain a certain percentage of its partnership. It is unclear exactly what that percentage is for Dewey, but legal industry experts say that typically, a law firm's agreement with a bank requires it to maintain 75 to 85 percent of its partners. If it falls below that threshold, the firm is considered in default and the bank can demand repayment.

Regulators to Ease a Rule on Derivatives Dealers | As federal regulators put the finishing touches on an overhaul of the $700 trillion derivatives market, a major provision has been tempered in the face of industry pressure.
On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are expected to approve a rule that would exempt broad swaths of energy companies, hedge funds and banks from oversight. Firms would not face scrutiny if they annually arrange less than $8 billion worth of swaps, the derivative contracts tied to interest rates and commodities like oil and gas.
The threshold sum is not insignificant. By one limited set of regulatory data, 85 percent of companies would not be subject to oversight. After five years, the threshold would reset to $3 billion; it is the same amount suggested by a group of energy companies in a February 2011 letter, according to regulatory records.

HEADLINE: Apax Chief Sees Opportunities in Euro Zone Crisis

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The chief executive of the European private equity firm is not optimistic about the Continent's debt crisis, but says the current climate could provide an opportunity to pick up bargains. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Martin Halusa, chief executive of the European private equity firm Apax Partners, is not optimistic about the Continent's debt crisis. He believes Europe could face a lengthy period of low growth similar to what Japan has suffered for more than two decades.
But concerns about the Continent's future prospects may be good for his business. 
A number of potential sellers, particularly in the financial services sector, are looking to offload assets. That has forced prices down, and provided the chance to do deals despite broader questions about the European economy.
 "We are in a 10-year Japanese-style situation in Europe," Mr. Halusa, the 57-year-old son of a former Austrian ambassador to the United States, said in an interview with DealBook. "Companies that are looking to sell assets to deleverage their balance sheets are open for offers."
 Apax, which is based in London, has been looking to take advantage of the economic turmoil. Late last year, the firm agreed to buy the telecommunications company Orange Switzerland for 1.6 billion euros ($2.1 billion) from France Telecom, which has been looking to sell parts of its European operations.
Apax spent a combined 3.2 billion euros of its own cash on seven deals last year, including Kinetic Concepts, a San Antonio-based medical device company, and the Golden Jaguar restaurant chain in China. Apax is likely to spend an additional 2.5 billion euros this year.
Founded over 30 years ago, Apax started out as a venture capital firm, but shifted its focus into private equity beginning in the early 1990s. The firm has raised a combined $36.9 billion over that time period, and recorded a 19.5 percent net return on its investments for the ten years through 2010, the latest figures available.
Despite its European heritage, only 40 percent of the firm's investments are on the Continent, according to Mr. Halusa, who became Apax's chief executive in 2003. Another 40 percent are based in the United States, while 20 percent come from emerging markets.
That ratio is expected to change as companies from developing countries grow in size. Apax focuses on deals of 1 billion euros to 5 billion euros. Mr. Halusa says the firm's strategy limits its options in markets like China and India because many of the countries' companies are too small.
But with the engine for global growth continuing to shift to developing economies, Mr. Halusa expects more deals to come from these economies. Apax made its first investment in Brazil in 2010, and has opened offices in Shanghai, Mumbai and Hong Kong.
"The deal size in emerging markets may rapidly develop to the levels that we look at," he said.
The shift away from Europe could be a wise strategy. Economists expect the Continent's growth prospects to remain anemic, and many companies focused on the local markets have struggled because of a cutback in consumer spending. 
European banks also have pared back lending, as they try to improve their overstretched balance sheets. As a result, takeovers by private equity firms in Europe have totaled a combined $16.5 billion so far this year, a 17 percent drop compared with the same period in 2011, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters
Mr. Halusa says deals can still be done, though banks are becoming more wary about which transactions they will support. Apax focuses on five sectors, including health care, financial services and technology, and has a long track record of successful acquisitions and exits that it hopes will win over potential takeover targets and skeptical financiers. 
"Bankers will finance deals that they believe will close," Mr. Halusa said. "They don't want to be backing the wrong horse."
Apax will be hoping its luck continues as it looks to raise a new fund of approximately 9 billion euros. So far, the firm has tapped investors for 4.3 billion euros, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
Raising the remaining money may be more difficult. A number of other European private equity firms, including Permira and Cinven, also are starting new funds at the moment, and analysts say investors are unlikely to back all the companies hoping to open portfolios. Mr. Halusa declined to comment on Apax's fund-raising efforts.
To win future support, a lot will depend on how the firm's investments perform.
In October, Mattel agreed to buy HIT Entertainment, the owner of preschool brands like Barney and Thomas the Tank Engine, from an Apax-led consortium for $680 million. The firm also successfully listed Bankrate, a personal finance Web site, on the New York Stock Exchange last July.
Future exits could be tougher. Despite several initial public offerings in Europe this year, the Continent's capital markets remain jittery. And cash-rich companies may refrain from multibillion-dollar acquisitions because of fears that the deals will drain capital reserves.
Mr. Halusa acknowledges that market confidence is low, but says Apax is prepared for the uncertainty.
"We never rely on only one exit strategy; it's too dangerous," he said. "I don't see a big I.P.O. market heading our way any time soon."

HEADLINE: News Corporation Acknowledges Breach of Foreign Ownership Rule

BYLINE: AMY CHOZICK


HIGHLIGHT: The company said that foreign ownership had risen to 36 percent, higher than the 25 percent limit for broadcasters that is allowed under United States law. 

 BODY:
9:34 a.m. | Updated News Corporation said Wednesday it would suspend half of the voting rights of its non-American shareholders in order to comply with United States government regulations on foreign ownership.
The Federal Communications Act limits the ownership and voting power of foreign investors in broadcast stations to no more than 25 percent. In a breach of government rules, News Corporation's foreign investors owned 36 percent of the company's class B voting shares. The company's board said it approved an immediate suspension of 50 percent of foreign shareholders' voting rights.
The family of Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, which holds a 39.7 percent of the company's voting shares, has agreed not to vote with respect to a portion of its shares. All voting power in the Murdoch family trust is held by United States citizens, including Mr. Murdoch, a native of Australia who holds American citizenship.
Without the change, the Murdoch family "would increase their percentage of voting power from what it was prior to the suspension,"the company said.
Prominent foreign investors include Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who owns roughly 7 percent of voting stock.
In the process of renewing its broadcast licenses with the Federal Communications Commission, News Corporation conducted a survey of investors. The survey revealed the company had exceeded the legal limit for foreign ownership allowed United States broadcast operators.
The News Corporation board immediately implemented the decrease in voting rights announced Wednesday, so as not to violate compliance rules. The board could have forced its foreign shareholders to sell their stock. But reducing voting power lets investors hold on to dividends and other economic benefits. News Corporation has aggressively bought back stock in recent months.
News Corporation owns 27 television stations and Fox Broadcasting. In the fiscal year 2011, the company's television business brought in $4.8 billion in revenue and $681 million operating profit.

HIGHLIGHT: Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana who considered running for president this year, endorsed Mitt Romney, calling him the right man to address the nation's growing debt crisis. 

 BODY:
Mitch Daniels, the Republican governor of Indiana who considered and rejected the idea of running for president this year, endorsed Mitt Romney on Wednesday, calling him the right man to address the nation's growing debt crisis.
Mr. Romney announced his support of Mr. Daniels in a statement on Wednesday morning, adding to the growing list of Republican leaders who have concluded that Mr. Romney has effectively secured the nomination.
"The ruinous debts and anti-enterprise policies of today threaten more than our near-term economy; unaddressed soon, they will end the promise of upward mobility that our nation has always offered to its young and its poor," Mr. Daniels said in the statement.
He added that "Mitt Romney has proven that he understands what is at stake and is prepared to summon Americans to the changes that will restore the American dream and our national greatness."
Mr. Daniels has made a name for himself as a Republican governor who takes fiscal issues seriously, but he declined to run for president citing concerns about the impact on his family.
In the news release by Mr. Romney's campaign, the candidate said that Mr. Daniels "shares my background in business, and he has used the principles of the private sector in government. Indiana has been served well by his leadership based on fiscal discipline, smaller government, and a friendly environment for job creators."

HEADLINE: Income of Rulers vs. the Ruled

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Is today's socioeconomic gap between American politicians and their constituents really unusually wide? A look at inequality between leaders and those they lead, from Rome to the present. 

 BODY:
Washington is frequently accused of being elite and out of touch with ordinary Americans. Certainly the economic confidence numbers inside versus outside the Beltway support this charge.
But is the socioeconomic gap between American politicians and their constituents really unusually wide?
That's partly a quantitative question, and partly a philosophical one. Standards of living have obviously improved greatly over generations, making then-and-now comparisons difficult.
I tried to answer this question using a principle from Adam Smith, the granddaddy of economics: that a person "must be rich or poor according to the quantity of labor which he can command." In other words, I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation for how many workers (or households) today's political leaders can employ with their income each year. This is the same metric Branko Milanovic used in his book "The Haves and the Have-Nots" in a chapter about identifying the richest person who ever lived.
In 2011, the Obamas received a total income of $844,585, according to tax returns they released on Friday (that includes his presidential salary of $400,000).
That's looking pretty good compared to the rest of American households, whose tax returns were also due on Tuesday.
We don't yet have median total income data for all American households in 2011. The Tax Policy Center has estimated that the median tax unit had total cash income of $42,327 in 2011. "Cash income" is not exactly equivalent to "total income" as reported on your (or President Obama's) 1040; the latter doesn't include employer-paid health insurance premiums or the employer's share of payroll taxes, for example.
That means the Obamas' cash income is probably even higher than $844,585. So by a relatively conservative estimate, the Obama family made about 20 times more than the typical American family last year. (Mitt Romney has filed for an extension on his 2011 tax returns; earlier this year the campaign estimated that he had a total income of $20,908,880 in 2011, or nearly 500 times the median American household's cash income. )
If that sounds like a lot, consider that the leaders of plenty of other countries earn significantly higher salaries alone.
Two years ago The Economist looked at how salaries of presidents from around the world compared to their countries' gross domestic product per capita (which is similar to the average, rather than median, income per person).
In 2010, the American president's base salary of $400,000 was about eight times the country's gross domestic product per capita. The top political leaders in China and India received salaries that were less than five times their countries' per capita income, while Singapore's president received a salary that was more than 40 times that country's gross domestic product per capita.
Now consider what the differential was in earlier eras.
The Global Price and History Group at the University of California, Davis, has postedincome distribution data going back all the way to the Roman Empire. The numbers are far from comprehensive, and are generally snapshots from a single country in a single year.
A few highlights:

        
In France in 1788 -- just before the French Revolution and the resulting insistence on égalité -- the nobility and clergy earned about five times the mean per capita income. That's much lower than I'd expected, given that the country's social unrest grew out of its infamous lack of égalité. Of course, the mean per capita income doesn't capture the condition of the very poorest Frenchmen.
        
In England and Wales in 1759, the highest titled classes earned 67 times the mean per capita income.
        
In Byzantium in the year 1000, the nobility earned 56 times the mean income per capita.
        
In Rome in the year 14 C.E., senators earned a full 100 times (!) the mean income per capita.
Some individual Roman leaders did even better, according to the data on Rome (which also are cited in Mr. Milanovic's book).
The rich triumvir Crassus, who lived in the first century B.C., received an income of 12 million sesterces per year, whereas the mean annual income at the time is estimated to be 380 sesterces. That indicates Crassus received an income equal to that of about 32,000 average Romans.
Now of course, these calculations look at income only, and not the wealth accumulated by rulers versus those they rule.
For a more contemporary look at the socioeconomic gap between leaders and constituents using a wealth metric, check out this article by my colleague Eric Lichtblau about how the net worth of members of Congress and ordinary Americans changed from 2004 to 2011.

HEADLINE: Clean Technology on the Brink

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: American gains in clean energy could all be lost unless the federal government renews a variety of subsidies and production credits that have supported such technologies, a report warns. 

 BODY:
 Clean energy technology has grown robustly and come down in price in recent years, driven by hefty government stimulus spending, expectations of future regulation and substantial private investment. But that technology is going to fall off a cliff unless government steps in quickly to revitalize the solar, wind, nuclear, battery and clean vehicle sectors with new spending and federal policy, according to a new study from three research groups.
 The report, written by energy and technology experts at the Breakthrough Institute, the Brookings Institution and the World Resources Institute, says that renewable energy generation doubled from 2006 to 2011, the first new nuclear plants in decades are under construction, and prices for solar, wind and other clean energy technologies have fallen while employment in those sectors has risen by 70,000 jobs even during a deep recession.
 Those gains could all be lost unless the federal government at least temporarily renews and pays for a variety of subsidies and production credits that have supported those industries as they strive to compete with fossil-fuel based energy sources, the report states.
 The study notes that the tens of billions of dollars from President Obama's stimulus program are drying up, even as tax breaks that have supported wind and solar power generation are expiring. The result is an anticipated 75 percent decline in federal clean technology spending by 2014 from a peak of $44.3 billion in 2009.
 The authors recommend renewing some of the tax incentives and boosting federal spending, at least until those industries can compete on their own. "With the right reforms," they conclude, "the United States has the opportunity to be a leader in the invention and production of next-generation technologies for sale to an energy-hungry global market."

HEADLINE: New York Fed to Sell A.I.G. Assets

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Eight Wall Street banks have been invited to bid for collateralized debt obligations that were acquired as part of the $182 billion federal rescue of A.I.G. in 2008. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Wednesday that it was soliciting bids for once-troubled assets that the government inherited as part of its rescue of American International Group , the latest effort to unwind the government's huge bailout of the insurer.
In a twist peculiar to Wall Street, the potential suitors are some of the same banks that once held the assets. The securities are now held in a special entity that the New York Fed created as part of its rescue of A.I.G., which received a $182 billion federal lifeline.
The entity, known as Maiden Lane III, took on nearly $30 billion in assets from Wall Street banks at the height of the financial crisis. The banks, including Goldman Sachs, had bought insurance on the assets from A.I.G., but the insurer could not post sufficient collateral to honor the policies as it teetered on the brink. When Maiden Lane III stepped in, allowing the banks to avoid devastating losses on the securities known as collateralized debt obligations, the move was criticized as a backdoor bailout of Wall Street. 
Now, more than three years later, Goldman and other big banks are expected to bid on the securities called MAX C.D.O., bringing the actions full circle. The New York Fed invited eight banks over all to submit bids after the firms recently expressed significant interest in the holdings. The other banks are Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Nomura, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and Barclays. 
The New York Fed hired BlackRock Solutions, an arm of the giant asset manager, to conduct the bidding process. The solicitations are due on April 26, when the New York Fed will decide what securities, if any, to sell. The determination, the New York Fed said, will depend on the "strength of the best bid."
The move to purge A.I.G. assets stems from the insurer's own interest in buying back some securities last year. A.I.G. tried to recoup $15.7 billion in bonds, but the New York Fed instead opened up the auction to a broader audience. 
The New York Fed found a long line of eager bidders on Wall Street. In February, Goldman outbid others for assets with a face value of $6.2 billion.
The assets, held in another investment vehicle known as Maiden Lane II, were acquired in 2008 as part of the A.I.G. bailout. The New York Fed provided a $19.5 billion loan to the vehicle so it could absorb soured residential mortgage-backed securities sitting on A.I.G.'s books. 
The various assets sales are part of a broader effort to whittle down the insurer's government bailout. 
A.I.G. has taken a series of other steps to pay off its obligations to the government, which still holds a roughly 70 percent stake in the company, through buying back stock and other means. The Treasury Department recently sold $6 billion worth of A.I.G. stock and the insurer repaid $8.5 billion in other obligations to the government.

HEADLINE: Current TV to Hire Gavin Newsom, California's Lieutenant Governor

BYLINE: BRIAN STELTER


HIGHLIGHT: The politician is getting a second job: as a talk show host on Current TV, the progressive cable television upstart. 

 BODY:
12:13 p.m. | Updated Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant governor of California, is getting a second job: as a talk show host on Current TV, the progressive cable television upstart.
"The Gavin Newsom Show" will be shown weekly starting in May, the channel announced on Wednesday.
Mr. Newsom, who was formerly the mayor of San Francisco, where Current TV is based, took office as lieutenant governor in January 2011. He will remain in that post - creating a rare if not unprecedented mix of media and governmental jobs.
A Current spokeswoman said Mr. Newsom would be paid by the channel, but would not specify his salary. A representative for Mr. Newsom said that the payments would be donated to charity and would be disclosed in accordance with state law.
The talk show will be produced by Mia Haugen, formerly of CNN, The Street and Forbes. The time slot for the show is unknown, but it will most likely be replayed several times on Saturdays and Sundays, giving Current TV new programming for the weekends for the first time.
Current, which was co-founded by Al Gore, is best known for hiring Keith Olbermann, who was fired last month after less than a year on the job. Both with and without Mr. Olbermann, the channel has been moving aggressively to add liberal-themed programs in a bid to challenge MSNBC and create an identity for itself on cable television. In recent months it has started hourlong shows by two former politicians, Jennifer Granholm and Eliot Spitzer, but until now it has not employed any sitting politicians.
Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, is perhaps best known for being one of the most prominent political supporters of gay marriages, having authorized same-sex unions in San Francisco in 2004 despite a state ban at the time.
As lieutenant governor - a position he described as having "no real authority and no real portfolio" before taking it - he has promoted economic development, higher education and environmental protection.
In a statement, Mr. Gore said Mr. Newsom "touches many worlds - business, politics, entertainment and activism." He added, "We are honored that Current TV will be bringing his curiosity, intelligence, insights and enthusiasm to television."
While the mayor of San Francisco, Mr. Newsom hosted a local radio call-in show, much like Mayor Michael Bloomberg's weekly call-in show in New York City. Through Current, he will have a national outlet - though the channel is relatively low rated.

HEADLINE: Catholic Bishops Protest House Budget

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: House Republicans are finding that their embrace of Catholic bishops can have a political downside. 

 BODY:
House Republicans are finding that their embrace of Roman Catholic bishops can have a political downside.
Ever since the Obama administration ran afoul of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops over mandated contraception coverage, Republican lawmakers have used Catholic leaders as a cudgel in their efforts to paint the Obama administration as waging a war on religious freedom. But the group recently sent letters to chairmen of two House committees lambasting Republican efforts to cut government spending.
In particular, the bishops spoke out loudly against the budget blueprint passed by the House last month, as well as legislation passing through committees that would turn spending cuts into reality through changes to social welfare programs.
"Major reductions at this time of economic turmoil and rising poverty will hurt hungry, poor and vulnerable people in our nation and around the world," the Rev. Stephen Blaire, bishop of Stockton, Calif., and the Rev. Richard E. Pates, bishop of Des Moines, wrote for the conference. "A just spending bill cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor and vulnerable persons; it requires shared sacrifice by all."

For House leaders, the letters could sting. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is Catholic. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and the architect of the House spending plan, has said that his Catholic faith informed his decisions.
"I want them to take a bigger look," Mr. Boehner said on Wednesday of the bishops. "The bigger look is that if we don't make these decisions, these programs won't exist. And then they'll really have something to worry about."
But the call for shared sacrifice dovetails with Democratic talking points, amplified almost daily by President Obama. Along with the cuts in spending, the budget plan calls for significant reductions in corporate and personal income tax rates. Those tax cuts are supposed to be paid for by equal cuts to tax deductions and credits, a prescription some tax writers think will be impossible. But no matter what, Republicans oppose any increase in overall tax revenues.
In their letters, the bishops laid out "moral criteria to guide these difficult budget decisions: protect human life and dignity." They wrote that "the needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty, should come first," and that "government and other institutions have a shared responsibility to promote the common good of all, especially ordinary workers and families who struggle to live in dignity in difficult economic times."
On Wednesday morning, the House Agriculture Committee approved legislation to restrict eligibility to food stamps, cut nutrition aid to the states, and trim nutrition and obesity education grants. The action helps it meet its obligation under the budget to cut $33 billion in spending over 10 years. 
The Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday was set to pass legislation requiring a Social Security number to claim the refundable child tax credit and eliminating the Social Services Block Grant, which helps state programs like child care, Meals on Wheels for older people, and child protective services. The committee must produce $53 billion in savings over 10 years to help prevent across-the-board defense cuts set to take place in January.
"The House-passed budget reflects the tough choices necessary to get this country back on course," said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. "Republicans have made a commitment to reform Washington to strengthen our economy, create jobs and get our fiscal house in order."

HEADLINE: Do Romney's Favorability Ratings Matter?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's personal favorability ratings have been relatively poor throughout this election cycle. But how much does that tell us about his chances of victory? 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's personal favorability ratings have been relatively poor throughout this election cycle. In his best surveys, roughly equal numbers of Americans have said they hold favorable and unfavorable impressions of Mr. Romney while in other cases they have been substantially net-negative.
Because favorability ratings can fluctuate a lot from poll from poll and survey firm to survey firm, it is probably best to take a longer-term view of them. Since the start of the year (Jan. 1), across a few dozen surveys, an average of 36 percent Americans have said they hold a favorable view of Romney and 46 percent an unfavorable one. Mr. Romney's numbers were especially poor in February but have rebounded some since then.
But does any of this matter? Are candidate favorability ratings useful predictors of election outcomes?
Let's look at some data.
In the table below, I've listed the average favorable and unfavorable ratings for all presidential candidates since 1976 based on New York Times/CBS News polls conducted in January through June of the election year. I term these "early stage" favorability ratings; we will look at numbers in later phases of the election cycle down below.
One important thing to note before we proceed further: when looking at favorability ratings, it is especially important to compare candidates' numbers in the context of other surveys conducted by the same firm. New York Times/CBS News polls, for instance, typically include an option for voters to say they haven't heard enough a candidate to come to an opinion about them; most other polls do not explicitly invite the respondent to make this choice. This is, in my view, a perfectly sensible way to ask the question -- it may elicit more honest responses than polls that seem to force voters into one or another choice for candidates whom they barely recognize. (Contrast this with what you'll occasionally see from some automated polling firms, which sometimes implausibly find that 80 or 90 percent of voters have an opinion about an obscure senate or gubernatorial candidate months before an election.) This does mean, however, that both the favorable the unfavorable ratings tend to be lower in New York Times/CBS News poll than in those conducted by other news organizations. So we're looking at New York Times / CBS News data alone rather than melding different polls together.
On average over New York Times/CBS News polls conducted in January, February and March, Mr. Romney's favorable rating was 26 percent and his unfavorable rating was 37 percent, for a net-negative of 11 points. These figures are fairly poor historically but not unprecedented. Bob Dole had similar numbers in New York Times/CBS News polls in early 1996. Bill Clinton was not as well known in 1992 as Mr. Romney is this year, meaning that both his favorable and unfavorable ratings were lower, but his net score (negative 11) was the same as Mr. Romney's. And Jimmy Carter had very poor favorability ratings as an incumbent in 1980 (just as his approval ratings were poor).
Overall, these early-stage favorability ratings have had a mixed track record as a predictor of election outcomes. The candidate with the better net-favorable rating in the early-going won the election in 1976, 1980, 1984, 1996, and 2008. But Mr. Clinton won the election in 1992, despite making a poor first impression on voters. On the flip side, Michael Dukakis had very promising favorability numbers early in the 1988 cycle, but they deteriorated over the course of the election cycle and he took a clear defeat. (I'm not sure where you'd classify the 2000 election because of the split between the popular vote and the Electoral College, or 2004 since George W. Bush and John Kerry had essentially the same net favorability rating in the early going.)
If we look at favorability ratings in the stages of a presidential race, however -- as measured by an average of New York Times/CBS News polls conducted from September of the election year until the election date -- we find a much stronger relationship. Although there is not data on this for 1976, the candidate with the stronger net-favorable rating in the late stages has won every election since 1980, and there has been an almost-perfect correspondence between the margin of the favorability gap and his margin of victory or defeat in the popular vote.
This ought not to be terribly surprising -- by the time that October and November roll around, most voters will say they have a favorable impression of the candidate they plan to vote for and an unfavorable one of the candidate they plan to vote against.
Still, this leaves much open to interpretation: are favorability ratings an important causal factor in the vote or, instead, more just a correlate of them? If, for instance, elections are dictated by economic fundamentals, it is likely that voters will come to view the incumbent favorably when it is easier to find jobs. It might also be the case that they will come to view the challenging candidate less favorably under these circumstances since he will have a tougher argument to make and may have to resort more to negative campaigning and personal attacks.
If you like, you could place the favorability ratings along with other factors like economic performance and approval ratings into a regression analysis. If you run those numbers, it seems to suggest that they do matter to some extent, controlling for the other variables. However, this just isn't a very powerful test since these measures (particularly favorability ratings and approval ratings) are highly correlated with one another and since the sample size is very small. Testing 3 or 4 highly correlated measures on a sample of just 8 elections since 1980 is not remotely adequate for hypothesis-testing.
So we simply don't have a very good empirical way to answer this question; there isn't enough data. Nor, for that matter, do we have a good way to tell whether something like the decline in Mr. Dukakis's favorability ratings throughout 1988 was caused by George Bush running a superior campaign, or instead because he was challenging Mr. Bush amid a fairly strong economy.
And yet, it would also be a classic mistake of statistical inference to assume that just because we cannot "prove" a hypothesis to a high degree of confidence means that it should be ignored (or worse, rejected). It's certainly plausible that favorability ratings do matter some, and the relationships between favorability ratings and electoral performance have been positive historically, especially in the late-stages of a race.
Moreover, efforts to predict elections based solely on fundamental factors like the economy -- that is, without looking at public-opinion data and without considering factors related to the quality of the candidates -- have historically not gone very well. It is very likely that candidates and campaigns do matter some -- and perhaps even quite a bit. But whether we can quantify those effects after the fact, much less predict them beforehand, is a much more challenging question.
The most sensible takeaways, I think, are as follows:
1) Mr. Romney's mediocre favorability ratings at this early stage of the race are no death sentence. There have been clear reversals in favorability ratings in the recent past once the general election campaign got under way, such as in 1988 and 1992. At least one recent candidate (Mr. Clinton in 1992) won his election with similarly mediocre early favorability ratings. With that said, it would be foolish to suggest that this makes no difference at all. Mr. Romney would prefer to have a positive rating than a negative one. For that matter, Mr. Obama would prefer to have a clearly positive favorability rating than break-even numbers.
2) The favorability deficit between Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama is more likely to be meaningful the longer it persists. If, for instance, we still see this favorability deficit in July -- and certainly if we see it in September or October -- the odds are fairly good that Mr. Obama will perform more strongly than the economic fundamentals alone would dictate and could win an election that he is otherwise "supposed" to lose. Of course, this will probably be reflected in head-to-head polls between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney, which also become stronger predictors of the election outcome as November draws nearer.
My guess, for what it's worth, is that we will see some improvement in Mr. Romney's favorability numbers over the next month or two. It has not been uncommon in the past for a candidate's numbers to decline while he is actively engaged in a primary, but for him to go through a honeymoon period once he begins to wrap up the nomination.
We'll have a better sense for where Mr. Romney's numbers are likely to settle in, and whether they represent a real concern for him or just a transient annoyance, once the general election campaign has become more substantive a couple of months from now. For the time being, I'd consider them a negative but fairly minor factor when we evaluate his chances at victory.

HEADLINE: In a 'Prebuttal,' Romney Attacks Obama's Economic Record

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: "We're a trusting people, we're a hopeful people, but we're not dumb," Mr. Romney said. 

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE - Mitt Romney on Wednesday issued a withering dissection of President Obama's speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver four years ago, delivering a point-by-point rebuttal of what he said were his opponent's unfulfilled promises to revive the economy.
Standing in the shadow of Bank of America Stadium, where Mr. Obama will accept his party's nomination in September, Mr. Romney said that "on the measures the president himself indicated would determine whether we're making progress or not, he has failed."
"We're a trusting people, we're a hopeful people, but we're not dumb," Mr. Romney said, "and we're not going to fall for the same lines from the same person just because we're in a different place."
Mr. Romney's remarks, which aides described as a "prebuttal" to the Democratic convention here, offered a glimpse of a tactic that the Romney campaign is likely to employ with growing frequency in the general election: showing up at the location of coming presidential speeches and delivering well-publicized indictments of Mr. Obama's record.
Mr. Romney repeatedly quoted from lines in Mr. Obama's 2008 convention speech, telling the audience of about 200 people that they were unlikely to hear the president repeat them at the Democratic convention in September.
"But you'll hear it at ours, I'll tell you that," he said.
The president, Mr. Romney recalled, "said that Democrats like him measure progress by whether the average American family saw its income go up, not down. Well, let's look at what happened. What you're not going to hear is that during his term median income in America has dropped by $3,000. It's gone down, not up."
Mr. Romney continued: "In that speech he said, look, we're going to measure progress - Democrats do -- by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business. Well, how's that gone over the last few years?"
"Since he's been president the number of new businesses started per year has dropped by 100,000 per year," he said.
Mr. Romney said that the president is "over his head, and he's swimming in the wrong direction."
Mr. Romney took a playful swipe at the stagecraft of the Democratic convention four years ago, especially a row of giant white columns that stood behind Mr. Obama as he accepted his party's nomination.
"You're not going to see President Obama standing alongside Greek columns," Mr. Romney said. "He's not going to want to remind anybody of Greece."
Pointing to the nation's debt and unemployment rate, Mr. Romney said that Mr. Obama "does not want to remind anyone of Greece, because he's put us on a road to become more like Greece."

HEADLINE: NATO After Libya

 BODY:
NATO can be proud of the role it played in supporting the overthrow of Libya's murderous dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. But the alliance's own confidential assessment, reported in The Times on Sunday, pointed out that European members, who were among the first to call for military action, could never have pulled it off without extensive American involvement. 
The Libya campaign was supposed to be a demonstration of European leadership. But even Europe's most sophisticated militaries lacked the specialized aircraft and trained personnel needed to intercept Libyan government communications and verify potential targets, and they quickly ran short of precision-guided munitions.
The Pentagon stepped in to provide what Europe could not. But that experience is one more reminder that Europe is still not ready for prime time -- and, no matter how important the stakes, European militaries are unable to conduct sustained air operations on their own, even in their own neighborhood. Without urgent efforts to remedy these shortcomings, NATO faces a bleak future of military marginalization and trans-Atlantic rancor.
Europe has never shouldered its fair share of NATO's collective military burden. But, while Washington and the American taxpayer were prepared to put up with such free-riding during the cold war, patience is running out. Last year, the United States devoted 4.8 percent of its gross domestic product to military spending. European NATO members averaged only 1.6 percent. While the Pentagon needs to be far more disciplined in its own spending, the Europeans need to spend more on their militaries and spend it more rationally.
The operational failures in Libya grow directly out of Europe's chronic military underinvestment and out-of-date strategic priorities. Most European allies failed to invest adequately in military modernization when budgets were flush. And too much of what Europe did spend went to vanity projects like the independent nuclear deterrents maintained by Britain and France. Too little has been spent preparing for more realistic security challenges like combating transnational terrorist networks and deflecting the rampages of cornered dictators, like Qaddafi and, a decade before that, Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Military force is not always the best answer. But, when it is, Europe must be able to provide its share.
With all European governments committed to arbitrary and unrealistic deficit reduction targets, military spending is again being slighted. But by continuing to shortchange overdue military investments, Europe is undermining the alliance on which its security depends.
We are encouraged that earlier this year, NATO decided to acquire a new air-to-ground surveillance system and to expand member countries' aerial refueling fleets. That's a good start. But it won't be enough.
Next month's NATO summit meeting in Chicago will likely feature speeches celebrating the alliance's past glories. It must be accompanied by hard private bargaining about better burden-sharing and addressing the yawning gaps exposed in Libya. NATO's credibility is on the line. And that is a serious problem for Europe and for the United States.

HEADLINE: In Arizona, Immigrants Make Plans In Shadows

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Miguel Guerra has a wife, three children and a house. He has a car, but no driver's license. He has business cards, but no immigration papers. He got into the habit of keeping his cellphone close when he drives so he can quickly call a cousin, the only legal resident among his relatives in the United States, in case he gets pulled over.
If he does not call again within an hour, he said, the cousin knows to look for him at the county jail.
Mr. Guerra, 36, moved here 13 years ago, before Arizona made illegal immigrants a target, turning once mundane tasks like driving to the grocery into a roll of the dice. Protesting the state's strict immigration laws ''hasn't changed anything,'' he said, so one recent evening he took a more pragmatic approach. He filled out an affidavit designating his cousin to care for his children, his money, his house and everything else he owns should he be arrested. 
The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next week challenging the most controversial sections of an Arizona immigration law, known as SB 1070, which seeks to push illegal immigrants out of the state by making it hard for them to go about their lives and earn a living. Lower courts have prevented many of the most controversial provisions from taking effect, but that has not stopped a chill from seeping into the bones of the state's immigrants.
''Preparing for the worst is our best defense these days,'' Mr. Guerra said.
Here and elsewhere in Maricopa County, where one in three residents is Hispanic, illegal immigrants -- interviewed at car washes, outside dollar stores, in schools and at the offices of a grass-roots organization called Puente, where Mr. Guerra and others worked on their affidavits -- seemed almost indifferent to how the Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality of the law. Having lived through years of relentless enforcement of the state's anti-illegal-immigration measures by the hard-line sheriff, Joe Arpaio, they feel little can make life harder than it already is.
Mr. Guerra said he no longer risked taking his family on road trips to Disneyland in neighboring California. Maria Jesus, 55, who has a tire store that caters mostly to illegal immigrants, said she was on the verge of bankruptcy because most of her clients had either fled the state or were unemployed and broke. A man who said he recently spent time in a federal immigration detention center in Florence, Ariz., after he was pulled over for speeding, and who asked to remain anonymous to avoid more legal trouble, says he leaves home every morning afraid he will not come back. (He was freed on bail and has a date in court to decide whether he will be deported, he said.)
Seated across from him at Puente, a woman who would say only that her name was Leticia and that she was 27, interjected: ''The people who are home, waiting, are just as afraid. You leave, and we wonder if today is the day you're going to get arrested.''
The Department of Homeland Security estimated there were 360,000 illegal immigrants in Arizona as of January 2011, the fewest since 2000.
The downturn in the economy, which hit Arizona particularly hard, may offer only part of the explanation for the decline. In 2010, the number of births by Hispanic women fell below the number of births by white women for the first time in seven years, and it continued to fall at least through February, according to state statistics. The drop, 28 percent over all, is too steep to be explained by a decline in fertility rates alone; Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, said it might suggest that there were fewer Hispanic women of child-bearing age.
Since the bill cracking down on illegal immigration was passed by the State Legislature in May 2010, enrollment at the Balsz Elementary School District here in Phoenix, where 70 percent of the students are Hispanic, has dropped by 8 percent, and fewer parents volunteer to walk children to and from school, the superintendent, Jeff Smith, said.
''We think it's because they're afraid of being on the streets,'' Dr. Smith said.
It has not always been that way. In 2005, when Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senator John McCain of Arizona unveiled a bipartisan immigration bill, which would have provided a path to citizenship to certain illegal immigrants, about 50,000 people rallied here in support. They again took to the streets by the thousands, part of a wave of protests that spread across the country, as SB 1070 made its way through the Legislature.
Their battle quickly moved to the courts, where the law's most controversial aspects -- like giving law enforcement officers the authority to detain anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally and requiring them to determine the immigration status of people who have been arrested -- have polarized the political debate about immigration.
A rally has been scheduled here for the start of the Supreme Court's hearing. Organizers are hoping a few thousand people will turn out; in private, their estimates are less optimistic.
''The excitement of four years ago has turned into bitterness; hope has turned into fear,'' said Alfredo Gutierrez, a former state senator and radio host whose call-in show allowed immigrants -- illegal and otherwise -- to air their feelings in public in the early days after the bill was passed.
The measure ''was clearly an attempt to put the entire Latino community under siege, and to a certain extent it has succeeded,'' Mr. Gutierrez said.
At Puente, the law was an exclamation point of sorts at the end of one advocate's long explanation about the other state measures against illegal immigrants: an English-only law in 2002, propositions in 2004 and 2006 blocking their access to state benefits and their right to post bail, a requirement in 2008 that employers check their workers' immigration status.
It was Week 3 of Puente's six-week ''defense'' course, the first that the group has offered since opening in 2007 in response to Sheriff Arpaio's raids on Latino workplaces and neighborhoods.
''I don't need SB 1070,'' Sheriff Arpaio said last week. ''We've been arresting more illegals than we did in the past. We have enough state laws to do that.''
In their wallets, participants in Puente's course carried a paper that reads: ''I will not sign without a lawyer! Slide the warrant under the door!'' They also heard other tips: If you have a car, make sure it is registered to someone with a driver's license. If you have a job, make sure someone knows to collect your pay if you are not around. If you have children, make sure to authorize a legal resident to pick them up at school.
Mr. Guerra spoke of friends who had packed up and left -- to Utah, Nevada, Washington State -- only to come back after finding no jobs or running into laws much like the one that drove them from Arizona.
''I don't want to live a nomad,'' he said. ''So here I am, getting ready for what's to come.''

HEADLINE: Oregon Town Weighs a Future With an Old Energy Source: Coal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
BOARDMAN, Ore. -- A new link in the world's future energy supply could soon be built here on the Columbia River, and it would have nothing to do with the vast acres of wind turbines or the mammoth hydroelectric dams that give this region's power sources one of the cleanest carbon footprints in the nation.
Instead, Boardman is pursuing one of the oldest and dirtiest of fossil fuels: coal. The question is not whether to use it to produce new energy but whether to make what some say would be tainted new profits.
Even as coal-fired power plants are being phased out in Oregon and Washington, Boardman, an agribusiness outpost across the river from vineyards owned by the Columbia Crest winery and where the Department of Energy recently awarded $25 million to an innovative biofuel producer, is among at least half a dozen ports in the region weighing whether to ship millions of tons of coal to Asia from the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana. 
If all of the projects were built, as much as 150 million tons of coal per year could be exported from the Northwest, nearly 50 percent more than the nation's entire coal export output last year.
''There's no doubt the nation's moving in a direction of renewable energy,'' said Greg Smith, who runs an economic development firm near here that has been working for Ambre Energy, the Australian-owned coal company behind the Boardman project and one in Washington. ''But until the world fully develops those alternatives we still have to have economic development.''
Coal companies have been seeking port access in the region for well over a year, and they have had many setbacks. They were rejected outright by the Port of Tacoma, and they have met strong resistance in the Washington cities of Longview and Bellingham.
But with the appetite for coal still strong in Asia, and with the Powder River Basin holding far more coal than it can sell domestically, companies have continued to seek outlets and increasingly expanded their list of potential sites into less populated and more conservative areas, promising jobs and tax revenue.
They have been welcomed in Boardman, whose port -- formally called the Port of Morrow -- is just one piece of a rare combination of transportation assets for a place so small. Highways, a main freight rail line and a major waterway converge here as they do in Portland and Seattle. Yet the city's remote location also means it has little congestion, and little of the opposition that has risen up in other areas.
''The more business the better, as far as I'm concerned,'' said Leroy Quimby, the production manager for Oregon Hay Products, a federally approved hay fumigation warehouse that would be just a few hundred feet from the coal facility proposed here. ''And I don't think there will be any environmental impact anyway.''
Conservationists disagree. They say exporting coal will simply export greenhouse gases while also threatening air quality in the Northwest, particularly in places near rail lines. They have recently broadened their appeal, arguing that the federal government should review the different proposals as a whole for their potential environmental impact, in part because they would drastically increase coal-car rail traffic through a range of pristine areas, including bird refuges and habitat for endangered salmon.
Jan Hasselman, a lawyer in Seattle for Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law firm, said, ''For us, the real question for the region is not do we or don't we build in Boardman, but whether we become the coal exporting hub of North America.''
The government is also asking questions; at least four of the projects, including the one here in Boardman, would require permits from the Army Corps of Engineers.
''All of these projects -- and others like them -- would have several similar impacts,'' Kate Kelly, the director of the Office of Ecosystems, Tribal and Public Affairs for the Environmental Protection Agency in Seattle, wrote to the Army Corps of Engineers this month. ''Consider, for example, the cumulative impacts to human health and the environment from increases in greenhouse gas emissions, rail traffic, mining activity on public lands and the transport of ozone, particulate matter, and mercury from Asia to the United States.'' The latter refers to pollution from coal-fired plants in Asia potentially reaching the West Coast.
The Boardman proposal is considerably smaller than those in Longview and Bellingham, and its supporters say it would include unique environmental precautions. Open coal cars would be sprayed with a dust suppressant before leaving the Powder River Basin. Once in Boardman, trains would be offloaded in an enclosed area that is ventilated by filtered vacuums. The coal would be stored in warehouses, then transported on enclosed conveyor belts to covered barges on the river. Many miles west, closer to the mouth of the Columbia, it would be transported again on a closed conveyor belt to a larger oceangoing ship.
''We're trying to move this project forward the Oregon way,'' added Mr. Smith, who is also a Republican state lawmaker. ''That's being conscious of the environment and recognizing the need for economic development.''
Gary Neal, the general manager of the Port of Morrow, said that Ambre Energy expected to create at least 25 jobs, it had not asked for any tax incentives and it had promised to donate 10 cents to the public school system for every ton of coal exported, which could mean up to $800,000. Mr. Neal said the project would bring about $2 million in additional revenue to the port, which currently brings in about $33 million.
Mr. Neal said the project one day could be even bigger than the current plans. Ambre has the rights to a much larger piece of land that is next to the same rail spur, though it has no plans now to develop it.
The port handles about 60 trains a year, bringing a variety of commodities. The coal facility would add about 10 times that, or 600 more trains, Mr. Neal said.
''If this product doesn't go through here, it's going to go through Canada or the gulf or somewhere else,'' he said.
On Thursday, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, held a town-hall-style meeting at Riverside High School in Boardman, whose population is about 3,000. Not one of the more than 100 people in attendance asked about coal. Twice the senator encouraged the group to ask him about energy issues.
In an interview afterward, Mr. Wyden, who is in line to be the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee next year, said it would be premature for him to judge the Boardman project. But, noting that the country's recent surge in oil and gas production had made it a net energy exporter for the first time in six decades, he said coal should be included in a broader debate over forming ''a national energy export policy.''
Just outside Boardman, on a plateau surrounded by wind turbines and cattle ranches, a coal-fired power plant is still in operation, but not for much longer.
Under pressure from the public, Portland General Electric, which owns the plant, has announced that it will shut it down by 2020.
It is the only coal-fired plant still operating in Oregon.
The planned shutdown frustrated local residents who have been grateful for its cheap power and the jobs it provides. Many blame outside groups for the shutdown -- and they presume protesters eventually will appear here to fight the coal export facility.
''It won't be from within,'' said Chet Phillips, the mayor of Boardman.

HEADLINE: A Festival Brought To You by Skype

BYLINE: By MEKADO MURPHY

 BODY:
The Tribeca Film Festival returned to New York on Wednesday with more than 90 features in tow and a variety of events that expand beyond the movie screen. Started as a project to help revitalize downtown neighborhoods after Sept. 11, the festival has evolved in several ways over the past decade. And making choices about the kinds of films the festival will show has always been an important factor in its growth.
This year a new team is making those choices. The artistic director, Frederic Boyer (above right), was artistic director and chief programmer of the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes. Genna Terranova (right), who comes from an acquisitions background and was the festival's senior programmer, has been promoted to director of programming. And Geoffrey Gilmore (below right), who was the longtime director of the Sundance Film Festival before taking over as chief creative officer at Tribeca in 2009, has expanded his programming role. 
They spoke with ArtsBeat about the festival's identity and their selection process. Hint: Skype and a pet cat were involved. Below are edited excerpts from that conversation. MEKADO MURPHY
Q. Frederic, how has your process shifted from your role at Directors' Fortnight?
FReDeRIC BOYER At Fortnight we selected only 22 films. Here we are able to select 90 films. And some kinds of films were impossible to bring to Fortnight. We could have one or two mainstream films, but we didn't bring a lot of genre movies.
Here we have Cinemania [devoted to those films]. So it's extremely different for me. But I learned how to say no to a filmmaker and to argue why the film would not fit at the festival but still respect the filmmaker.
Q. What would you say would best characterize the identity of the festival?
GEOFFREY GILMORE We're a festival that has the benefit of being in New York. And the visibility that platform has gives you an enormous asset in terms of showcasing work. So the industry sees us as a real festival for acquisition and for launch. But it's also a festival about discovery and trying to expand film culture.
I think the innovation of Tribeca, trying to open the festival up to younger audiences, using technology and outreach in ways that no other festival is using it, are ways of rethinking what a festival needs to become in the next decade.
Q. How do films generally get chosen for the festival?
GENNA TERRANOVA We get random submissions every year, and we also go out and look for movies all over the world. On our team we have both young programmers and ones who have been at other festivals, and we all respect each other's opinion. We don't respect the idea of: I like this, I don't like this. You have to explain why, almost as if you're looking at it as an academic evaluation.
But at the same time you have to add that human observation: Were you moved? Were you scared? We highlight these movies with the evaluations, and we filter what movies we're going to continue to talk about.
We had this really interesting programming process this year with Frederic, when he was in France before he got his visa. A lot of communication was done on Skype, which was a challenge. But he could smoke throughout all the meetings.
BOYER And I had my cat.
Q. What about the films you let go?
TERRANOVA Sometimes there are movies that weren't ready for you, and you did the right thing by not taking that movie because they needed three months to edit it. In that sense you respect the filmmaker.
There's a lot of moving parts in that decision process. And there is a bit of a personal network between programmers and festival heads where we will recommend films to other festivals that didn't work for us. And I think that really helps the filmmakers.

HEADLINE: Papers Detail BP Settlement

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The estimated multibillion-dollar settlement between BP and lawyers representing individual and business plaintiffs in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill was fleshed out on Wednesday in hundreds of pages of motions and exhibits. 
The broad outlines of the agreement in principle reached last month, including an estimated $7.8 billion in payments for economic loss and medical claims, are unchanged in the papers filed in Federal District Court in New Orleans on Wednesday.
The agreements include total fees of $600 million for several hundred of the lawyers involved in the litigation.
''BP made a commitment to help economic and environmental restoration efforts in the Gulf Coast, and this settlement provides the framework for us to continue delivering on that promise,'' said Robert W. Dudley, the company's chief executive.
BP said that it had spent $14 billion responding to the spill and $8 billion in payments to individuals and businesses so far.
It had recorded a $37.2 billion charge in its financial statements concerning the spill, and announced in the statement on Wednesday that the settlement was ''not expected to result in any increase.''
Friday is the second anniversary of the spill, which killed 11 workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon rig and sent nearly five million gallons of oil into the gulf.
While the settlement could bring an end to civil litigation with private plaintiffs, civil litigation with the federal government and gulf states has yet to be resolved, and a criminal investigation is continuing within the Department of Justice.
The agreement, including the lawyer fees, will be submitted to Judge Carl J. Barbier of Federal District Court in New Orleans, who has presided over the litigation, for his approval.
The $600 million in lawyer payments will come directly from BP and not from client settlements, said Jim Roy, a leader of the lawyers' committee.

HEADLINE: Spain's Ills Spur Talk Of Bailout

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LUXEMBOURG -- The euro zone's rescue fund has already helped mount full-scale bailouts of three of Europe's smaller economies.
But concern over the health of Spain's financial institutions -- laid low by a festering home-mortgage crisis -- has fueled speculation that, for the first time, the bailout fund might be needed to help recapitalize the banks of a big country.
''I don't foresee the need for Spain to come, but there is a lot of money available,'' Klaus P. Regling, chief executive of the euro zone's current bailout fund, said here Tuesday at his staff headquarters. He added that there were ''lots of positive elements in Spain that are ignored at the moment but that, no doubt, over time will become clearer to everybody.'' 
Mr. Regling heads the European Financial Stability Facility, the emergency bailout fund that still has about --248 billion, or $325 billion, of its original --440 billion of lending power. In July, that fund is to be superceded by a permanent strongbox, the European Stability Mechanism, which will have a firepower of about --500 billion -- beyond the --192 billion already committed to Ireland, Portugal and Greece.
But while Mr. Regling says he does not expect Spain to need help bailing out its banks, other analysts do not necessarily share his optimism.
''They are going to have to do something in Spain's case,'' said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research institute. ''This is a big economy and the banks are holed below the water line.''
Spanish banks initially congratulated themselves for not having invested in the U.S. subprime mortgages that sparked the world financial crisis, but the subsequent Spanish property slump has proved to have a devastating effect on their balance sheets.
Over all, Spanish banks have accumulated --323 billion of property assets, of which --175 billion were labelled as ''problematic'' by the Bank of Spain last year. That proportion, however, has risen amid soaring unemployment that has left more people unable to meet mortgage payments.
This month , the Spanish central bank governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, also warned that banks would need more capital if the economy continued to worsen.
Officially, the administration of Mariano Rajoy, which came to power in December, has said it would not seek Europe's help for Spain's economy, in which budget deficits and 23.6 percent unemployment are among the other problems.
Mr. Rajoy and Luis de Guindos, Spain's economy and competitiveness minister, are no doubt aware that the governments of Greece, Ireland and Portugal -- the three euro countries that have requested international rescues -- were later ejected from power by angry voters.
So Spanish politicians might prefer to ask Europe for aid intended just for their sickly banks. And some creditor countries might see such a step as preferable to letting the European Central Bank intervene again in the Spanish debt market by buying up its government bonds, as it has done in the past.
''I think recapitalization of the banks or injections of funds into the banks is the most likely way of lancing the boil,'' Mr. Tilford said. But any help for Spanish banks would probably come with conditions. And it would, under current rules, still require that aid go to the government -- and not directly to Spanish banks.
Changing those rules would be difficult for the current fund that Mr. Regling runs -- requiring parliamentary consent in Germany as well as the approval of euro countries, for example. And it would be even harder, once the new permanent fund comes into operation in July. (The new fund's treaty is still being ratified by various euro zone member countries.) Before requesting help for its banking sector, Spain would have to ask shareholders in Spanish banks to raise new capital first, then demonstrate that the government could not fill the shortfall.
Even if euro zone ministers agreed to help with recapitalization, they would impose conditions. These would focus mostly on the banking sector, but might still be contentious. For example, they could force the opening of Spain's domestic banking industry to foreign ownership.
And Spain's failure to hit existing deficit-reduction targets under the euro zone's rules could also hinder the process. The guidelines for the current bailout fund state that any beneficiary country must ''demonstrate that it has a sound fiscal policy record.''
Any bank recapitalization plan would also have to be in line with European Union rules guarding against unfair state subsidies. The whole process could take several weeks, officials say. Perhaps the biggest downside of using Europe's bailout funds to prop up Spanish banks is the unsettling message it would send to markets. And some officials caution that such a step may not be enough if Madrid fails to hold the line.
''Spain is doing an adjustment and should continue to do so,'' said one euro zone finance official who was not authorized to speak publicly. ''If there were a general failure, the question is whether they come in for bank recapitalization only or for a market adjustment program. It is not clear. ''
Raphael Minder contributed reporting from Spain.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Forsaking Investment Banking to Turn Around a Family Business

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
Ten years ago, Jeffrey Braverman was living the dream of many business school graduates. With a freshly minted bachelor's degree in economics, he landed a job in 2002 at the Blackstone Group, a Wall Street firm specializing in private equity and investment banking.
Less than a year later, however, Mr. Braverman stepped away from Wall Street and returned to his family's New Jersey nut business, the Newark Nut Company. It struck some as an odd choice: the family-owned company, which had been started by Mr. Braverman's grandfather, Sol Braverman (known as Poppy), and had once employed 30 people, was down to two employees and two family members, Mr. Braverman's father and his uncle.
Located in an indoor mall in a desolate part of Newark, the nut shop's retail sales were fading and its wholesale business was, at best, stagnant. But Mr. Braverman harbored entrepreneurial ambitions.
At the beginning, he agreed to work with his father and uncle for a salary tied directly to how much new business he attracted. He focused on Internet sales and before long, they began to dwarf the existing business. 
Now based in Cranford, N.J., the company has grown to more than 80 employees with more than $20 million in revenue, 95 percent of it online. The following is a condensed version of a recent conversation.
Q.Who leaves investment banking to work at a struggling family nut company?
A. Only someone nuts, right? My dad and my uncle both thought I was crazy. I was making more than they were at the time.
Q.Then why?
A. Have you ever read the book ''Monkey Business''? It's a fairly accurate profile of what it's like to be in investment banking, at least at a junior level. You know, there's this economic concept called deadweight loss, and I think a lot of investment banking is like that: it doesn't really add anything to the world, to the economy. I just wanted to do more.
Q.I assume your father and uncle made you take a pay cut.
A. The one thing I did was, I didn't want to take anything away from them. I structured it so that my compensation was 100 percent based on incremental profit improvement. So from their perspective, there wasn't very much risk. I also got a small piece of the business. But at the time the business was worth nothing, book value. No one would have bought it.
Q.Did you have any experience in Internet sales?
A. In 1999, I was a freshman in college and I started our Web site, Nutsonline.com. I spent my second semester of freshman year working on that thing four or five hours a day. It kind of just trickled along. In 1999, very few people were buying from Amazon, so they certainly weren't going to buy from Nutsonline. In 2000, I remember I set a goal: I wanted to do 10 orders a day.
Q.Did your father and uncle like your ideas?
A. I started to do things with the business that they couldn't do and that they didn't understand. Around July 2003, I told them it's all about the Web. We're going to sell online and do a much better job. We got very aggressive with advertising online. My budget for advertising per day had been $3 and I raised it to like $100. That's nothing now, but then it was huge.
We flipped the switch on the site, with the new marketing campaign, and let's just say we suddenly started doing five times the orders in one day. My dad's response was, ''Shut it off, we can't handle it!''
I also realized that while we were working Saturdays, we were in Newark and we weren't doing much business on Saturdays. And I said, ''Guys, what are we making? One hundred dollars for our entire family?''
So I told them we're going to close on Saturday. And they said, ''No, no, no. Let's do half-days. We can't close. Poppy would never let us do this.'' My uncle told me he was so nervous he couldn't sleep the entire week. But we ended up doing it. They came in Monday, and they both said, ''This is the best decision we ever made.''
Q.What other changes did you make?
A. Investment banking taught me how not to run a business. People are only driven by one thing, money. People don't talk the right way, and they're not respectful. One of the first things I did was read all sorts of books on customer service, books like ''How to Win Friends and Influence People'' that dealt with how people want to be treated.
It's interesting, when you think from a business perspective what a core competency is, you think, it's cost, it's first-mover advantage, it's trademarks, it's brands. Often people will say, ''Customer service? Anybody can do it.'' But the truth of the matter is, not everybody can. We decided early on that we were going to try to be really great. The concept was underpromise and overdeliver. We ship into the evenings, we ship on the weekends, various things to get packages to people ahead of expectations.
Q.Did it work?
A. When I started, annual revenue was about $1.25 million and Internet sales were next to nothing. After that, the growth compounded at about 42 percent for four years, to over $5 million in 2006.
Q.And then it really took off in 2007 and 2008. What happened?
A. It was one of these very serendipitous things. We had gotten a few suspicious-looking orders -- one-pound bags of nuts going to CBS. There was a postapocalyptic show on CBS called ''Jericho'' and the network said it was canceled. During the show, this town Jericho was being attacked by a neighboring town and the leader of the neighboring town said, ''Surrender.'' And the leader of Jericho said, ''Nuts.'' So fans took this as their battle cry. They said, ''Let's go send nuts to CBS.'' This thing went crazy. At first we shipped U.P.S.
Then we did a few stunts. One day, I showed up with my uncle in our delivery van and dropped off 1,000 pounds. Then we hired a trucker, and I went and we dropped off 10,000 pounds. We ended up sending 40,000 pounds to CBS.
Q.That's a lot of nuts.
A. Forty thousand pounds of peanuts in 50-pound bags, floor to ceiling, is a whole 48-foot tractor-trailer.
Q.What happened to the show?
A. We got a lot of coverage and CBS brought back the show. They flew me out to go to the fall lineup party. I met the actors, went to the set. But then it was on for another seven episodes or so and then they canceled it.
Q.Sounds like it was better for you than for the show.
A. Yeah. We ended up getting a ton of Internet traffic. When we were on KROC Los Angeles, we got like over a million visitors from that. We sold a lot of nuts to the ''Jericho'' fans too, but the majority didn't come back. But with The New York Times and CNN, and the funny press, like The National Enquirer, you get all these visible, authoritative sources online, and they're linking to you. It does a lot for your credibility in Google's eyes.
Q. How big do you think your business would be if the ''Jericho'' thing hadn't happened?
A. I would like to think we would have gotten to the same place by now. But I have no idea.

HEADLINE: Tesco to Invest Heavily In a Domestic Revival

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British supermarket chain Tesco announced a $:1 billion investment program Wednesday that it hopes will revive earnings in its home market by expanding its online business while adding fewer large stores.
Tesco, the world's third-largest supermarket chain after Wal-Mart Stores and Carrefour, is trying to reverse a decline in profit in Britain, where it had been growing for 20 years. The spending program, the equivalent of $1.6 billion, follows criticism from investors that Tesco neglected its base as it focused on expansion abroad, including in the United States, where it started the Fresh & Easy chain of grocery stores.
Over the past two decades, Tesco grew into a retail behemoth and a darling of investors, with earnings increasing by at least 5 percent almost every year since 1994. But a recession in Britain, a costly expansion in the United States and China, and ventures into banking and selling used cars turned Tesco into the worst-performing stock on the FTSE 100 index this year. A shift in consumer behavior toward online shopping further hurt Tesco, which must maintain a network of large and costly stores. 
Traditional retailers are increasingly under pressure as online purchases erode their sales. Some, like Wal-Mart, have started buying small start-up companies or competing online retailers to better cope with the migration of customers to the Internet.
Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, said Wednesday that he planned to invest $:200 million to add more products to the company's online stores while reducing the pace of expansion for its brick-and-mortar stores. Tesco would add about 38 percent less retail space in Britain in the 2012-13 fiscal year than in 2011-12, he said. The company will also slow its expansion in the United States, Europe and Asia, where it has already decided to exit the Japanese market.
''As customers go more to convenience and online, we reduce our store expansion,'' Mr. Clarke said.
''The plan makes sense,'' said Freddie George, an analyst at Seymour Pierce in London. ''Over the last couple of years they've taken their eyes off the ball in the U.K.''
But some investors were not convinced and Tesco's shares fell 2.1 percent Wednesday in London. The retail environment in Europe remains difficult because of the continuing economic crisis and households are reluctant to spend, said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.
Following in Amazon's footsteps, Tesco has started to allow other retailers to sell their products through Tesco's Web site. Tesco has started out by allowing two retailers -- Crocus, which sells plants and gardening supplies and equipment, and Maplin, which sells batteries, electronics and electrical goods -- to sell their wares through Tesco.com. The strategy is intended to drive more customer traffic to the site, and Tesco gets a cut from every sale. Tesco said it planned to add more retailers.
The company said it planned to expand the products it sold online to 200,000 by the end of the year from 80,000 now. It also plans to increase the number of ''click and collect points'' -- locations where customers can collect purchases they have ordered online, rather than waiting for delivery -- to 1,600 by the end of this year from 770 now.
Although Tesco plans to slow its overseas expansion, Mr. Clarke said, the company is not giving up on its Fresh & Easy stores in the United States.
Tesco now expects the business to break even about a year later than initially expected, but the company projects that Fresh & Easy will have some profitable months in 2013.
''The U.S. is moving in the right direction but I'd like it to move faster,'' Mr. Clarke said. ''I need to demonstrate to shareholders, who have been very patient with us, that we can do it.''
When Tesco started its Fresh & Easy brand, it saw a chance to fill what it saw as a need for convenient grocery stores in certain areas of the Western United States. But about five years later, only 30 of the 186 stores are making a profit.
Mr. Clarke said losses at Fresh & Easy narrowed for the first time in fiscal 2012 but that Tesco would slow down the opening of new stores in the chain and be more cautious about how to expand the business. Instead, Tesco is remodeling the stores it has and will try to attract more customers with fresh flowers, wooden floors, closed refrigerator doors and in-store bakeries.
''There's undoubtedly frustration about what is happening in the U.S.,'' said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. ''Not pressing on as aggressively with store openings is positive but patience is being tested.''
Tesco also plans to slow the pace of its expansion in China, where it said it is not immune to the impact of rising wages. It is also halting the expansion of Tesco Bank, which offers financial products like credit cards and insurance. The company has already announced it will close Tesco Cars, which sells second-hand automobiles and began just a year ago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Vatican Reprimands a Group Of U.S. Nuns and Plans Changes

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
The Vatican has appointed an American bishop to rein in the largest and most influential group of Catholic nuns in the United States, saying that an investigation found that the group had ''serious doctrinal problems.''
The Vatican's assessment, issued on Wednesday, said that members of the group, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, had challenged church teaching on homosexuality and the male-only priesthood, and promoted ''radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.''
The sisters were also reprimanded for making public statements that ''disagree with or challenge the bishops, who are the church's authentic teachers of faith and morals.'' During the debate over the health care overhaul in 2010, American bishops came out in opposition to the health plan, but dozens of sisters, many of whom belong to the Leadership Conference, signed a statement supporting it -- support that provided crucial cover for the Obama administration in the battle over health care. 
The conference is an umbrella organization of women's religious communities, and claims 1,500 members who represent 80 percent of the Catholic sisters in the United States. It was formed in 1956 at the Vatican's request, and answers to the Vatican, said Sister Annmarie Sanders, the group's communications director.
Word of the Vatican's action took the group completely by surprise, Sister Sanders said. She said that the group's leaders were in Rome on Wednesday for what they thought was a routine annual visit to the Vatican when they were informed of the outcome of the investigation, which began in 2008.
''I'm stunned,'' said Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network, a Catholic social justice lobby founded by sisters. Her group was also cited in the Vatican document, along with the Leadership Conference, for focusing its work too much on poverty and economic injustice, while keeping ''silent'' on abortion and same-sex marriage.
''I would imagine that it was our health care letter that made them mad,'' Sister Campbell said. ''We haven't violated any teaching, we have just been raising questions and interpreting politics.''
The verdict on the nuns group was issued by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which is now led by an American, Cardinal William Levada, formerly the archbishop of San Francisco. He appointed Archbishop J. Peter Sartain of Seattle to lead the process of reforming the sisters' conference, with assistance from Bishop Thomas J. Paprocki and Bishop Leonard Blair, who was in charge of the investigation of the group.
They have been given up to five years to revise the group's statutes, approve of every speaker at the group's public programs and replace a handbook the group used to facilitate dialogue on matters that the Vatican said should be settled doctrine. They are also supposed to review the Leadership Conference's links with Network and another organization, the Resource Center for Religious Life.
Doctrinal issues have been in the forefront during the papacy of Benedict XVI, who was in charge of the Vatican's doctrinal office before he became pope. American nuns have come under particular scrutiny. Last year, American bishops announced that a book by a popular theologian at Fordham University, Sister Elizabeth A. Johnson, should be removed from all Catholic schools and universities.
And while the Vatican was investigating the Leadership Conference, the Vatican was also conducting a separate, widespread investigation of all women's religious orders and communities in the United States. That inquiry, known as a ''visitation,'' was concluded last December, but the results of that process have not been made public.

HEADLINE: U.S. and NATO Finalize Pacts on Ending Afghan War

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The United States and its allies in NATO finalized agreements on Wednesday to wind down the war in Afghanistan, paving the way for President Obama to announce at a NATO summit meeting in Chicago next month that the unpopular, nearly 11-year-old conflict is close to an end.
But many of the most critical details remained unresolved, chief among them who would pay billions of dollars a year to support the Afghan security forces. 
After a day of meetings at NATO headquarters here in Brussels, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said the allies had formalized three crucial commitments: to gradually move the Afghans into a lead combat role; to keep some international troops in Afghanistan beyond 2014, the year American forces are supposed to be home; and to pay billions of dollars a year to help support the Afghan security forces.
''The big picture is clear,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a joint news conference with Mr. Panetta. ''The transition is on track, the Afghans are increasingly standing up for their own security and future, and NATO remains united in our support.''
Although Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Panetta sought to display American and NATO solidarity, there was a great sense of war weariness here, as the NATO meetings on Afghanistan have now entered their second decade. Major concerns also remain over attacks like those mounted by the Haqqani network of the Taliban on Sunday, when dozens of attackers crossed hundreds of miles to strike at seven secured targets.
Mrs. Clinton characterized the attacks as part of the inevitable ''setbacks and bad days,'' and she praised the Afghan security forces' response as ''fast and effective.'' Nonetheless, questions intensified about who was actually going to pay for the forces. One thing was clear: The Afghans cannot afford the $4 billion a year that is expected to be needed to support their own army and police force.
''People realize that a bill of that size is well beyond the financial capacity of the Afghan government,'' the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
A tentative plan under discussion calls for the United States to contribute about $2.2 billion or more of the $4 billion, with the Afghan government contributing $500 million and donations from the allies covering the remaining $1.3 billion.
Mrs. Clinton said that she and Mr. Panetta were ''very encouraged'' by commitments to support the security forces pledged at the NATO meetings. But senior American defense officials traveling with Mr. Panetta to Brussels on Tuesday acknowledged that they were still short in allied pledges at a time when the financial crisis in Europe had led to cuts in defense budgets. The officials, who spoke anonymously because they were discussing internal NATO deliberations, would say only that they were making ''good progress'' in soliciting pledges. They declined several times to define that progress in numerical terms.
The $4 billion in spending is for after 2014, when the Afghan security forces are expected to shrink to 230,000 members, down from a peak of 352,000 they are to reach this year. American officials have acknowledged that the reduction is driven largely by financial constraints on Afghanistan and its allies. The United States and its partners now spend about $6 billion a year on Afghanistan's security forces.
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan threw a wrench into the deliberations over the cost of the security forces on Tuesday when he said in Kabul that he wanted a written commitment of $2 billion a year from the United States. Mr. Panetta quickly batted that aside. ''You have to deal with Congress when it comes to what funds are going to be provided,'' he said. ''And we don't have the power to lock in money for the Afghans.''
Also unresolved at the NATO meetings was how many international troops, both from the United States and its allies, would remain in Afghanistan after 2014. American officials and Mr. Karzai say they are committed to having United States forces there, but their number and role have to be negotiated.

HEADLINE: Bishops Blast G.O.P. Cuts To Social Programs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
House Republicans are finding that their embrace of Roman Catholic bishops can have a political downside.
Ever since the Obama administration ran afoul of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops over mandated contraception coverage, Republican lawmakers have used Catholic leaders as a cudgel in their efforts to paint the Obama administration as waging a war on religious freedom. But the group recently sent letters to chairmen of two House committees lambasting Republican efforts to cut government spending.
In particular, the bishops spoke out loudly against the budget blueprint passed by the House last month, as well as legislation passing through committees that would turn spending cuts into reality through changes to social welfare programs. 
''Major reductions at this time of economic turmoil and rising poverty will hurt hungry, poor and vulnerable people in our nation and around the world,'' the Rev. Stephen Blaire, bishop of Stockton, Calif., and the Rev. Richard E. Pates, bishop of Des Moines, wrote for the conference. ''A just spending bill cannot rely on disproportionate cuts in essential services to the poor and vulnerable persons; it requires shared sacrifice by all.'' For House leaders, the letters could sting. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is Catholic. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and the architect of the House spending plan, has said that his Catholic faith informed his decisions.
''I want them to take a bigger look,'' Mr. Boehner said on Wednesday of the bishops. ''The bigger look is that if we don't make these decisions, these programs won't exist. And then they'll really have something to worry about.''
But the call for shared sacrifice dovetails with Democratic talking points, amplified almost daily by President Obama. Along with the cuts in spending, the budget plan calls for significant reductions in corporate and personal income tax rates. Those tax cuts are supposed to be paid for by equal cuts to tax deductions and credits, a prescription some tax writers think will be impossible. But no matter what, Republicans oppose any increase in overall tax revenues.
In their letters, the bishops laid out ''moral criteria to guide these difficult budget decisions: protect human life and dignity.'' They wrote that ''the needs of those who are hungry and homeless, without work or in poverty, should come first,'' and that ''government and other institutions have a shared responsibility to promote the common good of all, especially ordinary workers and families who struggle to live in dignity in difficult economic times.''
On Wednesday morning, the House Agriculture Committee approved legislation to restrict eligibility to food stamps, cut nutrition aid to the states, and trim nutrition and obesity education grants. The action helps it meet its obligation under the budget to cut $33 billion in spending over 10 years.
The Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday was set to pass legislation requiring a Social Security number to claim the refundable child tax credit and eliminating the Social Services Block Grant, which helps state programs like child care, Meals on Wheels for older people, and child protective services. The committee must produce $53 billion in savings over 10 years to help prevent across-the-board defense cuts set to take place in January.
''The House-passed budget reflects the tough choices necessary to get this country back on course,'' said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ''Republicans have made a commitment to reform Washington to strengthen our economy, create jobs and get our fiscal house in order.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: News Corp. Reduces Rights Of Its Foreign Stockholders

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
9:34 a.m. Updated News Corporation said Wednesday it would suspend half of the voting rights of its non-American shareholders in order to comply with United States government regulations on foreign ownership. 
The Federal Communications Act limits the ownership and voting power of foreign investors in broadcast stations to no more than 25 percent. In a breach of government rules, News Corporation's foreign investors owned 36 percent of the company's class B voting shares. The company's board said it approved an immediate suspension of 50 percent of foreign shareholders' voting rights.
The family of Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, which holds a 39.7 percent of the company's voting shares, has agreed not to vote with respect to a portion of its shares. All voting power in the Murdoch family trust is held by United States citizens, including Mr. Murdoch, a native of Australia who holds American citizenship.
Without the change, the Murdoch family ''would increase their percentage of voting power from what it was prior to the suspension,'' the company said.
Prominent foreign investors include Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who owns roughly 7 percent of voting stock.
In the process of renewing its broadcast licenses with the Federal Communications Commission, News Corporation conducted a survey of investors. The survey revealed the company had exceeded the legal limit for foreign ownership allowed United States broadcast operators.
The News Corporation board immediately implemented the decrease in voting rights announced Wednesday, so as not to violate compliance rules. The board could have forced its foreign shareholders to sell their stock. But reducing voting power lets investors hold on to dividends and other economic benefits. News Corporation has aggressively bought back stock in recent months.
News Corporation owns 27 television stations and Fox Broadcasting. In the fiscal year 2011, the company's television business brought in $4.8 billion in revenue and $681 million operating profit.

HEADLINE: Speculators and the Gas Pump

 BODY:
No matter what Mitt Romney and other Republicans say, there are no easy fixes for rising gas prices. With the national average price hovering near $4 a gallon, Americans are understandably concerned, and President Obama was right to call for more scrutiny of the oil markets. 
Mr. Obama made clear that not even the president of the United States can repeal the law of supply and demand. But what federal officials can do is ensure that market manipulation and speculation do not drive gas prices higher than is warranted by economic fundamentals. The question is how to turn the talking points into policy.
Research presented in Congressional testimony, academicpapers, government and private studies indicate that excessive speculation, mainly by Wall Street index-fund traders, is needlessly driving up prices, with estimates ranging up to $1 a gallon in inflated gasoline costs. And Mr. Obama called on Congress to increase regulators' budgets and powers to police the oil markets and to increase penalties for manipulation.
Republicans may find it harder to block such efforts if American voters better understood the impact of trading that distorts the markets. That is why it is important that the administration's working group on oil and gas price fraud -- formed a year ago by Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. -- finally weighs in on the question of how, and how much, manipulators and speculators are pushing up prices. The group's silence raises questions about how serious the White House really is about addressing this issue.
Regulators already have some power to rein in abuses. The Dodd-Frank financial reform law directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to implement new ''position limit'' rules, which would curb speculation by limiting the share of the market that traders can control at any given time. Unfortunately, the rules recently proposed by the C.F.T.C. are weak, watered down by disagreements between the Democratic and Republican appointees on the commission. The new rules have already been challenged in court by industry groups that represent banks and derivatives dealers.
Obviously, Mr. Obama cannot directly influence regulators or the courts. But he can stiffen spines by sending a strong message to the American people, Congress and Wall Street that he will keep pushing for reform until strong rules are in place. He does not need to get into the details of derivatives. He needs to make it clear that lax rules can lead to higher gas prices.
Mr. Obama is right to challenge Republicans who claim that lower gas prices and energy security can be achieved simply with more drilling or more pipelines. And he is right to press for greater efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels. But speculation is also a problem that demands more attention and tougher rules.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Medicare Pushes Bids

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration said Wednesday that it would vastly expand the use of competitive bidding to buy medical equipment for Medicare beneficiaries after a one-year experiment saved money for taxpayers and patients without harming the quality of care.
The experiment represented a sharp break from the usual fee-for-service Medicare program, under which beneficiaries can choose any supplier or provider of goods and services. In the experiment, Medicare officials invited bids and awarded contracts to 356 suppliers of medical equipment in nine metropolitan areas, including Cleveland, Dallas, Miami-Fort Lauderdale and Riverside, Calif. 
Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the pilot program had reduced Medicare costs by 42 percent, or $202 million, by securing lower prices and curbing ''inappropriate utilization'' of personal medical equipment in the nine markets.
The bulk of the savings came from oxygen equipment, power wheelchairs and mail-order test strips for people with diabetes.
Jonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the switch to competitive bidding had not compromised beneficiaries' access to the items they needed.
''Moreover,'' Mr. Blum said, ''there have been no negative health care consequences to beneficiaries as a result of competitive bidding.''
Mortality rates for beneficiaries and their use of hospitals, doctors and nursing homes were closely monitored and were consistent with patterns seen in the rest of the nation, he said.
Medicare officials said they would expand the use of competitive bidding for medical equipment to 91 additional markets, or a total of 100 metropolitan areas, in the coming year. By 2016, they said, all areas of the country would benefit from either the competitive bidding program or lower rates based on the competitively bid rates.
Medicare's competitive bidding efforts got off to a rocky start. Many suppliers complained that the government had accepted low bids from companies that had little experience in the industry, while curtailing opportunities for family-owned businesses that had served their communities for many years. In addition, dozen of economists told the Obama administration that its initial plans for competitive bidding were seriously flawed.
The American Association for Homecare, a trade group, expressed concern that beneficiaries were not receiving necessary medical equipment and services. The group said that it had received complaints from hundreds of Medicare patients who reported difficulty finding local suppliers or experienced delays in obtaining equipment.
Michael Reinemer, a vice president of the association, said: ''The bidding program steeply and artificially reduces the number of home medical equipment providers allowed to serve Medicare patients. Cutting spending yet again in this one sector will translate into greater spending in other areas -- more emergency room visits, longer hospitalizations and more nursing home admissions.''
Mr. Blum, the federal official, said however that Medicare had received few complaints from beneficiaries in the last year -- only 151 calls that expressed dissatisfaction with the program and could not be resolved by a call center operator.
''This is a minute fraction of the 2.3 million fee-for-service beneficiaries residing in the nine competitively bid metropolitan areas for 2011,'' Mr. Blum said.
Representative Glenn Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican who has introduced a bipartisan bill to repeal the bidding program, said: ''I don't doubt Medicare's claims of savings over the last year. However, the perceived savings will come at a much greater cost when this flawed program goes nationwide.''
He has argued that the bidding program would force smaller suppliers from the market and threaten the quality of care.
But Medicare officials said that 51 percent of the companies that submitted winning bids were small suppliers, defined as those with annual gross revenue of no more than $3.5 million.
Beneficiaries are typically responsible for 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount paid for home medical equipment. When Medicare secures lower prices, it shares the savings with beneficiaries.
Medicare officials estimated that competitive bidding for home medical equipment would save more than $42 billion in the next 10 years -- $17 billion for beneficiaries and $25.7 billion for the Medicare program.
Ms. Sebelius said the savings showed the value of the health care overhaul signed into law by President Obama in 2010.
The competitive bidding program was established, with support from many Republicans, under a 2003 law that added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. In 2008, Congress temporarily delayed the program and terminated supplier contracts that were in effect. The 2010 law expanded the program.
Medicare has historically used a fee schedule to pay suppliers. Officials gave this example of the savings: Under the fee schedule, Medicare would have paid $2,080 for an oxygen concentrator last year, and the beneficiary would have paid 20 percent, or $416. By contrast, with competitive bidding, Medicare paid about $1,395, and the beneficiary paid $279.

HEADLINE: Economic Doubts Offer an Opening to Romney Camp

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ALLISON KOPICKI; Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A rising number of Americans see improvement in the economy, but a persistent wariness about their own financial circumstances is allowing Mitt Romney to persuade voters that he could improve their economic prospects more than President Obama, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
Even as the nation rebounds from the recession, its lingering effects are reflected in the adversities facing families. Nearly two-thirds of people are concerned about paying for their housing, the poll found, and one in five people with mortgages say they are underwater.
Four in 10 parents say they have had to alter expectations for the type of college they can afford for their children. And more than one-third of respondents said high gas prices had created serious financial hardships.
The general election match between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney is opening with evidence that economic conditions are providing ammunition for both candidates. For Mr. Obama, there is a gradually growing perception that the general outlook is turning brighter, and for Mr. Romney, there are those individuals who still do not feel substantial improvement in their own lives. 
The poll found that the two men are locked in a tight race, with each gathering 46 percent of the support. Nearly an equal number of voters say they are as confident in Mr. Romney's ability to make the right decisions on the economy and to be commander in chief as express confidence in Mr. Obama.
As many voters thought they would do better under Mr. Romney as under Mr. Obama, but slightly more said they would do worse if the president was re-elected.
With less than seven months before Election Day, a furious scramble is under way by Democrats to define their opponent. Mr. Romney's bruises from the Republican primary fight are evident -- only 29 percent of voters have a favorable view of him -- but more than one-third say they have yet to form an opinion, creating a chance for him to introduce himself as a fix-it man who can improve the economic circumstances of Americans.
''We need a president who has a business background, and Mitt Romney's business background is tremendous,'' Michael Larson, 55, a salesman and independent voter from Minneapolis, said Wednesday in a follow-up interview. ''He has a vision that will bring the country back to economic strength.''
While the poll shows that Mr. Romney has a significant entree with voters who are frustrated at the direction of the country, Mr. Obama may have the upper hand when it comes to economic policy debates. A majority of voters say upper-income Americans pay less than their fair share of taxes, while half say capital gains and dividends should be taxed at the same rate as income from work -- a disparity highlighted by Mr. Romney's own effective tax rate of about 15 percent.
A week after dispatching his chief Republican rival, Rick Santorum, Mr. Romney has solidified support within his party. A majority of Republican primary voters, 54 percent, say they want to see Mr. Romney become the nominee, including a plurality of evangelical Christians, a group that formed Mr. Santorum's base of support.
The poll highlighted a lack of strong excitement among some Republican voters for Mr. Romney's candidacy, with just one in three saying they would enthusiastically support him in November. While that is hardly a resounding endorsement, it may be a temporary shortcoming that can be overcome by the fierce resistance among conservative Republicans to Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney also faces considerable hurdles as he begins presenting his views to a wider audience. The poll found that more than 6 in 10 voters think Mr. Romney says what people want to hear, rather than what he believes. The opinion of Mr. Obama is more closely divided, with 46 percent saying he says what he believes and 51 percent saying he says what people want to hear.
Mr. Romney's wealth also creates an uneasy relationship with many voters. Only about one in seven voters say he cares a lot about the needs and problems of people like them, compared with one-third of voters who think Mr. Obama cares a lot about their needs and problems. Only one-third of voters say they can relate to Mr. Romney, while nearly half say they can relate to Mr. Obama.
The nationwide poll was conducted from last Friday through Tuesday on land-line telephones and cellphones with 957 adults, including 852 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and voters.
Nearly 4 in 10 Americans say they have been falling behind financially, an 11-point increase from four years ago. About one-quarter of people say the future of the next generation will be better, while nearly half say it will be worse. Nearly the same percentage of Americans expressed a bleak outlook in early 1992, when the first President George Bush faced re-election and ultimately lost to Bill Clinton.
Mr. Obama has an approval rating of 48 percent, the poll found, and 6 in 10 respondents say the country is on the wrong track. Those and other findings in the poll offer a clear warning for a president seeking re-election and trying to cast the race as a choice between him and Mr. Romney, rather than a referendum on his first term in office.
''I want to give the business guy a chance,'' said Craig Lemoine, 47, a Republican from Las Vegas who drives a U.P.S. truck. ''No one wants to put the C.E.O. in there. Everyone thinks he'll just make the rich people richer and the poor people poorer. ''But how do you know if you don't give him a chance?''
The first week of the head-to-head campaign between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney has been dominated by a debate about the role of women and working mothers, after primary fights over insurance coverage for contraception and other women's health issues. The survey found that voters do not place a priority on some of these issues when choosing a candidate, focusing instead on jobs and the economy.
Over all, the poll found that Mr. Obama led Mr. Romney 49 percent to 43 percent among women, and that they are more likely than men to express confidence in the president's ability to deal with economic issues. Among men, Mr. Romney held a similar advantage over Mr. Obama.
For now, the economy is the central focus of the campaign, with income inequality and economic populism strong themes of the president's re-election pitch.
Americans are showing gradual signs of optimism: 33 percent say the economy is getting better now, compared with 14 percent who said the same last October. But only 27 percent of voters said Mr. Obama had changed the country for the better, compared with 20 percent who said he had changed it for the worse and 47 percent who said he had not changed it at all.
The survey offers a snapshot of the landscape as the race takes shape. Democrats have put a particular focus on Mr. Romney's wealth, and this could already be influencing some voters.
''I'm fairly confident that should he get into office he would push to ensure that the upper class continues to get even more benefits while the lower class gets fewer,'' said Gillian Gallentine, 57, an independent voter and retiree from El Paso. She added, ''I think Romney would try to reverse a lot of what Obama did and try to give things back to the rich.''

HEADLINE: Bank of New York Mellon Earnings Slip

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Bank of New York Mellon reported Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings fell 1 percent as revenue lost from the sale of a unit and lower foreign-exchange trading offset gains from rising asset levels. 
The bank said its net income fell to $619 million, or 52 cents a share, from $625 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected Bank of New York Mellon to report a profit of 51 cents a share, according to the average of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
''They put up decent numbers in a challenging environment,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ''When interest rates finally go up, this bank and its competitors should see some relief.''
Bank of New York Mellon said revenue from foreign-exchange trading, the subject of lawsuits against the bank, declined 21 percent from a year earlier. The bank's chief executive, Gerald L. Hassell, who in November outlined expense cuts aimed at saving as much as $700 million before taxes by 2015, said some savings are already materializing as compensation and software expenses fell.
''We are seeing the early results of our operational excellence initiatives as we generated significant positive operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Hassell said in a statement.
In August, the bank said it planned to cut 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent, of its work force. Its competitors, State Street of Boston and Northern Trust of Chicago, have taken similar steps.
Bank of New York Mellon, which earns fees on assets it manages and oversees for clients, was helped by a 12 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in the first quarter.
Assets under custody and administration rose 4 percent to a record $26.6 trillion, and assets under management climbed 6 percent to $1.3 trillion, also a record, the bank said.
Fees from investment services fell 3.6 percent as a result of the fourth-quarter sale of the shareholder services business to Computershare. Investment management fees dropped 2.4 percent because of higher money-market waivers, the bank said in its statement.
Earnings per share climbed as the number of shares outstanding declined.

HEADLINE: Voters in Ohio Feeling Uneasy About Choices

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JEFF ZELENY; Sabrina Tavernise reported from Elyria, and Jeff Zeleny from Washington.

 BODY:
ELYRIA, Ohio -- The battle for Ohio is on, but for many voters here choosing between President Obama and Mitt Romney is like trying to decide between liver and brussels sprouts -- a selection they would rather not have to make.
As it does every four years, Ohio is again unfolding as a crucial battleground in the presidential election, its 18 electoral votes critical to the equations of both candidates. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama made his fourth trip to the state since January; Mr. Romney is expected to arrive on Thursday, his first trip here since becoming the presumptive Republican nominee.
But putting together a winning strategy in Ohio will be a mighty challenge for both men, given that more than half of the state's electorate -- about 54 percent, according to the Brookings Institution -- is white and working class, a group that both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have had a particularly hard time connecting with.
''Ohio is really ground zero for the white working-class voting bloc,'' said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at Brookings. ''That's the key in Ohio.'' 
The sentiments of this group, loosely defined as whites without a four-year college degree in the middle and lower parts of the country's earnings bracket, reflect feelings of economic uneasiness nationwide even as the overall economic picture in the country brightens. Many have not felt the effects of the modest recovery that has lifted the economy here in recent months, leaving them unenthusiastic about the president. At the same time, Mr. Romney is seen as awkward, unsympathetic and distant, a fundamentally uninspiring alternative.
Speaking of Mr. Obama, Patrick Cain, an employee of a utility company from the nearby town of Brecksville, said: ''There's just no way I can vote for him. He talked about change, but has it been for the better? No.''
Yet Mr. Romney ''comes from money and corporate America, a typical Republican,'' said Mr. Cain, an independent. ''I'm not going to say I like him.''
Elyria, a gritty city about 40 miles west of Cleveland where Mr. Obama spoke at a community college on Wednesday afternoon, is dotted with scenes of industrial decline. Lorain County, which includes Elyria, has lost more than 11,000 jobs over the past decade, most in manufacturing.
''It's hard being out of work, especially when you're midcareer when you have to change jobs,'' Mr. Obama told an audience of students from Lorain County Community College, some of them dislocated workers. ''In this country, prosperity does not trickle down. It grows from the bottom up. It grows from a strong middle class out.''
Still, fresh signs of life in the automobile industry, along with new jobs in the energy sector, have lifted Ohio's economy recently and pushed the unemployment rate down to 7.6 percent, lower than the national average. A Ford factory in the county has plans to produce a new line of trucks, and a steel plant, which was nearly dead, is now planning new production, with a boost from fresh purchases from the natural gas industry. Indeed, Ohio gained more jobs than any other state in February, said a spokesman for Gov. John Kasich, a Republican.
Economic improvement will be critical to Mr. Obama's argument that he deserves re-election. But the economy is still considerably weaker than several years ago, many people are still unemployed, and Mr. Romney is likely to try to make those truths a central issue of the campaign.
''People don't feel it,'' said Senator Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who has been talked about as a potential vice-presidential candidate for Mr. Romney. ''There is still a lot of concern. Even folks who have jobs are nervous. People are not satisfied with the status quo.''
Mr. Obama carried Ohio by four percentage points four years ago, but his advisers concede that the state will most likely be even more competitive this time. For the past year, his campaign has been working to rebuild its statewide organization; it opened its 17th office this week. Mr. Obama's struggles in Ohio have led his advisers to plot ways for him to win without it, like winning Florida or some combination of Virginia, North Carolina and Western states.
For Mr. Romney, winning without Ohio would be even harder, given that no Republican has ever taken the White House without it, and his campaign acknowledges that it is starting from behind organizationally. His narrow defeat of Rick Santorum in the primary was a sign that he has work to do shoring up evangelical as well as working-class voters, though his supporters argue that his strength in the suburbs gives him a head start among swing voters like Mr. Cain who will decide the election.
''If this is a choice between Mr. Romney and the president, the president wins,'' insisted former Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat who is national co-chairman of the Obama campaign and said he would travel across the state with a succinct message: ''Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.'' But he conceded: ''If the Romney folks are successful in diverting attention away from his positions and if the economy were to turn south, that would be an incredible challenge for the president.''
The issue of race still lurks. In two dozen interviews in Lorain County, four working-class people cited the fact that Mr. Obama is black as a reason they did not like him.
Mr. Obama is trying to broaden his appeal by pressing an argument of economic fairness and questioning whether a rich candidate like Mr. Romney can understand people's challenges.
''I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth,'' Mr. Obama said in his speech at the community college. ''Michelle wasn't. But somebody gave us a chance.''
For some working-class voters, the case against Mr. Romney seemed to be working.
''He has a foreign bank account,'' said Carol McMahon, a hotel receptionist and an independent voter, who said she would vote for Mr. Obama. ''That can't be a good thing.''
But other voters were repelled by the president. Kevin Gillespie, a medical equipment salesman who is a Democrat, said he believed Mr. Obama had presided over a drastic expansion of government, giving entitlements to the poor and forcing through a health care law that Mr. Gillespie did not like. His business has been booming since Mr. Obama was elected -- he just bought a new Ford S.U.V. -- but he said that was not a reason to vote for the president.
''People say, 'It's going so well, what's your beef?' '' Mr. Gillespie said. As for Mr. Romney, he said: ''Do I want to vote for him? No.'' Still, he said gloomily that Mr. Romney was ''a consolation prize.''

HEADLINE: Tunnel and Dredging Work To Aid Big Ships in Harbor

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
The Panama Canal was more than 2,000 miles away, but very much on the minds of the officials who stood next to a hulking machine on Staten Island on Wednesday to announce a project that involves building a water tunnel to Brooklyn and dredging New York Harbor to make room for deeper cargo ships.
The officials said all the work would be finished by 2014. That is the same year that larger locks are scheduled to go into operation on the Panama Canal, clearing the way for ships whose cargo capacity is 260 percent as large as the ones that the canal can handle now. 
The officials, who included Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, want New York to be ready to handle them, too.
They said the $250 million, nearly two-mile-long tunnel -- officially, a water transmission main known as a siphon -- was an infrastructure investment with a rapid payoff for New York, the nation's third-busiest port.
''If we want New York City's economy to stay competitive,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, ''we must accommodate new megaships.''
Mr. Foye said his agency had set aside $1 billion for the dredging project, which is separate from the cost of the tunnel.
Officials said the channel would be deepened to approximately 50 feet, from the current depth of 45 feet. The Port Authority and the Army Corps of Engineers will be responsible for the dredging.
The city and the Port Authority are splitting the cost of the tunnel project, with the city's Economic Development Corporation managing the project. The dredging necessitated the replacement of two existing tunnels, one that dates to 1917, the other to 1925. They are 56 and 60 feet below the surface, respectively, and would be too close to the channel bottom after the dredging, officials said. The new tunnel will be 100 feet below the surface.
Like the old tunnels, the new ones will provide only a backup source of drinking water for Staten Island. Staten Island -- as do all of the city's boroughs -- draws water that originates in reservoirs upstate. Most of the water that ends up in the sinks and tubs of Staten Island gets there through a 42-year-old tunnel from Red Hook, Brooklyn.
If that conduit ever failed, the new tunnel would be able to pump up to 150 million gallons a day, the officials said. Under normal conditions, it would deliver five million gallons a day, or about 10 percent of Staten Islanders' demand for drinking water.
The tunnel-boring machine that will dig the new siphon was so big that it dwarfed the officials, and they stood on a raised platform. It is 300 feet long, officials said, and weighs 110 tons.
The officials said the machine would do its work by building the new tunnel four feet at a time, crawling along on its own as crews lay train tracks for transporting workers and equipment -- and hauling out the dirt that it digs up.
The officials said crews had already begun digging a shaft on Staten Island that the tunnel-boring machine would go into, and that they would eventually build a shaft in Brooklyn where it would come out. The plans also call for a chlorination station on Staten Island for water purification, and more than 1.5 miles of new water mains in Staten Island and Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Looking Back at New York's Dick Clark

BYLINE: JAMES BARRON


HIGHLIGHT: He didn't live here, but Dick Clark will forever be as much a part of New York as anyone who was born here. 

 BODY:
 Dick Clark had a commuter's relationship with New York - a long-distance commuter's relationship. He did not arrive on a train from the suburbs; he arrived on a plane from the West Coast.
 For the man who kept Times Square in the national consciousness in the 1980s and 1990s, New Year's Eve was a one-night-a-year broadcast and home was 2,500 miles away. 
For nine years as the host of the "Pyramid" game show - "The $10,000 Pyramid" until, in inflationary times, it became "The $20,000 Pyramid" - he spent two days a week in Manhattan. He arrived in time to be at the studio on West 58th Street at 8 a.m. on Tuesday. He taped five shows, returning on Wednesday to tape five more. Then he was off to catch a flight to Los Angeles.
 "Here is the incredible thing," Mike Gargiulo, who was the show's director, recalled on Thursday, one day after Mr. Clark's death. "In nine years, we had only one day when he missed his 6 o'clock plane at J.F.K."
 So he was here but not here. Dick Clark's New York was transitory, almost ephemeral, the New York of appearances on television, of parties for other television types, of business meetings. In a stopover in Manhattan in 2000, he said he had flown more than nine million miles, produced more than 7,000 hours of television programs and signed more than 800,000 autographs. 
Then he added two postscripts. The first was, "That estimate was made three years ago." The second was, "Thank God I have a short name."
 It was a name everyone seemed to know. Jane Rothchild, a producer on "The $20,000 Pyramid," remembered a night when she and Mr. Clark went out for a drink after the day's tapings. "We passed a guy who was lying drunk in the gutter," she said. "Dick lifted him up and leaned him against a parking meter. As he was teetering with drunkenness, he barely opened his eyes, but did so, focused on who had lifted him, and said, 'Thanks, Dick.' You knew he'd be thinking the next day, 'Did Dick Clark really lift me out of the gutter last night?'"
 For television viewers, he lifted Times Square out of its seediness, just by sticking with his New Year's Eve show. 
"He really understood that New Year's Eve in Times Square could be a vehicle for changing the perception of Times Square," said Gretchen Dykstra, who was the president of the Times Square Business Improvement District from its creation in 1991 through 1998. "He and his producers were very amenable to accepting from us suggested scripts that he could include. We would write short pithy paragraphs that he could plug in throughout the evening about a new day coming to Times Square."
 Times Square is a 20-minute walk from the Elysee Theater, where the "Pyramid" shows were videotaped. Mr. Gargiulo said Mr. Clark was unflappable. Did Tony Randall, a guest panelist, say a word you can't say on television? In the control room, Mr. Gargiulo was frantically figuring out a do-over. On the set, Mr. Clark stayed cool.
 "It was like the ball coming down in Times Square," Mr. Gargiulo said. "He didn't get overly excited when people were winning, he didn't get under-excited when they were losing. He had his own choreography that worked for him." 
In 2006, Mr. Clark auctioned off memorabilia he had collected presiding over "American Bandstand" and "New Year's Rockin' Eve" and producing made-for-television movies and specials. On the block were such items as his hand-held microphone from "American Bandstand." 
"It saw every famous rock 'n' roller that was ever born," he said.
 Guernsey's, the auction house that handled the sale, arranged to have the auction in the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center, in the Time Warner Center. Arlan Ettinger, the president of Guernsey's, remembered a moment from the night before the sale, when he and Mr. Clark walked outside.
 "He was saying how he had grown up in Mount Vernon, you know, a suburb," Mr. Ettinger said, "and had these visions that someday he hoped he could have an influence on people. We could see down Broadway, and he said, 'Just think, here I am in this greatest of all cities, and now they all look at me on New Year's Eve.'"
"He was very humbled," Mr. Ettinger said. "He wasn't saying it in a braggadocio style. He was saying how wonderful to have had an impact on so many lives, how lucky he was. It was very touching."

HEADLINE: Supercomputing Rented by the Hour

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Cloud computing is opening up supercomputing to smaller players, beyond government agencies and large corporations. A drug-discovery simulation, testing 21 million compounds in less than three hours, announced on Thursday, is proof of the trend. The cost of computing, done on a 50,000-core cluster in several Amazon Web Services data centers, was less than $4,900 an hour. 

 BODY:
The supercomputer game has traditionally been the playground of giants -- government agencies and a handful of major corporations.
But cloud computing is leveling even this elite realm of technology, a development underlined by an announcement at a conference on Thursday. A 20-person company, Cycle Computing, a leader in supercomputer software, recently lashed together a massive supercomputing cluster, with 50,000 processors, on Amazon Web Services to do drug compound simulations. Its software was essentially the operating system, tapping resources from several Amazon data centers.
The simulation applications for drug discovery created by two other small companies, Schrodinger and Nimbus Discovery, ran on top of Cycle's cluster-managing software. That software bundle performed a daunting simulation of 21 million chemical compounds to see if they would bind with a protein target. That run ate up the equivalent of 12.5 processor years, but it was completed in less than three hours. The computing cost was less than $4,900 a hour.
"This enables small companies and any researcher that has a grant to do science that they could never do before," Jason Stowe, chief executive of Cycle Computing, said in an interview.
The economics are striking, but so is the new approach to scientific discovery and exploration. In the past, even major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with internal computing clusters, would typically develop models that virtually tested some portion of the possible chemical combinations and protein targets -- not the 21 million, as in the Cycle-Schrodinger-Nimbus collaboration. "The technology allows researchers to leave no sample unconsidered," Mr. Stowe said.
The project announcement was made at the Amazon Web Services conference in New York. It is further evidence of the remote computing -- or cloud -- advance into a field known for its centralized supercomputer centers. Last fall, an Amazon Web Services cluster ranked 42 in the annual top 500 supercomputers in the world.
Supercomputing, according to Mr. Stowe, is undergoing a rapid evolution that echoes the transformation in data analysis, made possible by the accelerating surge in digital data and new computing tools. Government science officials emphasized that trend at a Washington conference last month, in which several federal agencies announced research initiatives.
Data analysis has been opened up to finding new patterns and insights in the so-called Big Data. Supercomputing focuses on simulations, but the two are related and that, Mr. Stowe says, represents a next stage in the march of Big Data.
Data analysis, Mr. Stowe said, looks for correlations and patterns in the data. Noticing a surge in a subject or sentiment in Twitter messages, for example.
The next step, Mr. Stowe said, is going to be "how to get a Twitter avalanche going, how to make people have this sentiment about my brand. That's a simulation problem."

HEADLINE: Giving Shareholders a Voice

BYLINE: LUCIAN BEBCHUK


HIGHLIGHT: Despite strong and expected criticism from the usual suspects, shareholders should welcome and support efforts to have companies do away with staggered boards. 

 BODY:
Staggered boards have long been a key mechanism for insulating boards of publicly traded firms from shareholders. This year, several institutional investors and a program working on their behalf have used shareholder proposals to move a large number of publicly traded firms away from such structures. Despite strong and expected criticism from the usual suspects, shareholders should welcome and support this work. 
The Shareholder Rights Project, a clinical program that I run at Harvard Law School, assists public pension funds and charitable organizations in improving corporate governance at publicly traded companies. During this proxy season, we represented and advised five such clients - theIllinois State Board of Investment, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, the Nathan Cummings Foundation, the North Carolina State Treasurer, and the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System - in connection with their submission of proposals for a vote at the annual meetings of more than 80 companies on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
The proposals urge companies with a staggered board, which allow shareholders to replace only a few directors each year, to place all board members up for election every year. Such a move to annual elections is viewed by investors as a best practice of corporate governance. By enabling shareholders to register their views on all directors each year, annual elections make boards more accountable to shareholders.
Staggered boards, also known as classified boards, certainly have their staunch supporters. As DealBook reported, the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz recently denounced the work undertaken on behalf of institutional investors by our program. Wachtell's sharply worded memo, titled "Harvard's Shareholder Rights Project Is Wrong," was signed by four of the firm's senior partners, including the founding partner and inventor of the poison pill, Martin Lipton. 
What particularly drew Wachtell's ire were the results of the proposals, which Steven Davidoff called "stunning" in a recent Deal Professor column. Following active engagement, many of the companies receiving shareholder proposals entered into agreements to bring management declassification proposals that would require all directors to stand for election each year. As of today, 44 Standard & Poor's 500 companies - over one-third of the S.&P. 500 companies that had staggered boards at the beginning of this proxy season - have entered into such agreements, and 35 companies have already disclosed management declassification proposals made in accordance with such agreements. 
Wachtell, the go-to legal counsel for incumbent directors and managers seeking to insulate themselves from removal, has been a strong advocate for rules and practices that facilitate such entrenchment. It is thus unsurprising that Wachtell and some of its clients may have a negative view of the large-scale move away from staggered boards taking place in corporate America. This change, however, serves the best interests of shareholders. 
Investors' support for annual elections is consistent with a significant body of empirical evidence. A studyby Alma Cohen and myself documented that staggered boards are associated with lower firm valuation, and this finding was subsequently confirmed in a study by Prof. Olubunmi Faleye of Northeastern University and another study by Michael Frakes of Cornell. Incumbents opposing declassification proposals often cite a study reporting that targets with staggered boards capture a larger slice of the surplus created by acquisitions, but even this study confirms that, over all, staggered boards are associated with lower firm value. 
Furthermore, studies find that firms with staggered boards are associated with lower returns to shareholders in the event of an unsolicited offer, are more likely to make acquisitions that decrease shareholder value, tend to provide executives with pay that is less correlated with performance, and exhibitlower association between chief executive replacement and performance. Indeed, having a staggered board is a significant element of two "poor governance" indexes that have been used in hundreds of studies by financial economists: the G-Index and the E-Index. 
Despite such studies, Wachtell claims that "there is no persuasive evidence" on the value of annual elections. Wachtell does not back up its claim with any empirical evidence or analysis, but merely asserts that "it is our experience that the absence of a staggered board is harmful to companies that focus on long-term value creation." Investors, however, have formed a decidedly different view of the value of moving away from staggered boards: during the last two proxy seasons, shareholder proposals to declassify at S.&P. 500 companies received an average level of support exceeding 75 percent of votes cast. 
In criticizing the Shareholder Rights Project's work, Wachtell quotes the statement of Chancellor Leo Strine of the Delaware Chancery Court that "stockholders who propose long-lasting corporate governance changes should have a substantial, long-term interest that gives them a motive to want the corporation to prosper." However, Wachtell overlooks that the five institutional investors represented by our program are exactly the type of long-term shareholders that Chancellor Strine views as desirable proponents.
Although Wachtell professes general support for a "robust debate" on staggered boards, the firm would prefer to have fewer shareholder proposals on the subject. Yet shareholder proposals are the very mechanisms that the securities laws (and, in particular, S.E.C. Rule 14a-8, known as the "town hall meeting" rule) provide for conducting debate at publicly traded firms. Both a shareholder who puts forth a proposal to eliminate a staggered board and the board members themselves make their case in the proxy materials sent to voting shareholders, who then cast votes to indicate which position they support. 
In recent years, supporters of staggered boards have been on the losing side at an overwhelming majority of votes on shareholder proposals urging board declassification. Two proposals submitted by our program's clients recently passed with large majorities. Additional such proposals are expected to go to a vote this spring at more than 30 other companies, and defenders of staggered boards are expected to continue losing such votes. 
Preferring therefore to discourage such proposals, Wachtell also claims that it is "inappropriate" for a law school's clinical program to assist clients that are not "impoverished or underprivileged." However, as the Columbia law professor Jeffrey Gordon explained in a response to this claim, clinics that advance the contested agendas of clients who are neither impoverished nor underprivileged are (for good educational reasons) are standard at law schools nationwide. These clinics do not represent the views of the law schools in which they operate but only those of the clients and, in some cases, of faculty and students who choose to work in a particular clinic. 
Rather than seeking to discourage our program from representing institutional investors submitting shareholder proposals, Wachtell should focus on engaging in a substantive debate about the merits of staggered boards. I welcome such a debate. 
In the meantime, shareholders should continue to be given the chance to vote on whether to eliminate staggered boards at companies - and boards should take those preferences into account. Doing so would serve the long-term interests of shareholders and the economy.

HEADLINE: 'It's More Than a School': Proposing Programs to Meet Student Needs

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Considering the sports series about a girls' basketball team at a school operated by a juvenile court, then thinking about the needs of the students in their own school and proposing new programs to meet those needs. 

 BODY:
Overview | What needs do various school populations have? How do schools meet those needs? Students consider the story of Carroll Academy, a Tennessee school run by a juvenile court, and how the school uses compulsory participation in basketball to provide structure for its female students. Then they think about the needs and existing programs at their own school, and then propose new programs to serve unmet needs. 
Materials | Computers with Internet access, projector, student journals.
Warm-Up | Show, without explanation or introduction, the video "Sentenced to Basketball" (above). Alternatively, project or post around the room images from the related slide shows.
If necessary, remind students to be respectful of the students and faculty featured in the articles, photographs and videos, and to defer judging them by factors like their offenses and past decisions.
Before discussing what they saw, give students a few minutes to write in their journals. Prompt writing with these questions: What did they notice? What stood out most? What surprised them? What seemed familiar to them?
Have students share aloud their observations, and discuss their impressions of Carroll Academy. Ask: How is Carroll Academy like, and different from, our school? What do you think its goals are? How do you think the students came to be enrolled there? What's the point of playing basketball on a team that hasn't won a game for years? Why do you think the coach tells her players to "lay down or give it your best, even when it hurts"? How do you think that advice resonates in the players' lives, based on what you have seen about them? How does that advice resonate for you? 
Related | In the article "'It Ain't About the Record,'" Part 1 of a five-part series, John Branch introduces the students and staff of Carroll Academy:
Carroll Academy is in Huntingdon, about 100 miles east of Memphis and 100 miles west of Nashville in West Tennessee. It is a strictly run day school with about 80 students operated by the Carroll County Juvenile Court, filled with teenagers trying to work their way back to their home schools with the velvet-hammered guidance of parole officers and people like Lutz, Hatch and Steele.
Among the nine girls on the Carroll Academy basketball team, only one lives with both her mother and her father. A seventh grader, she lived with her parents and two younger siblings at a grandmother's house, having been evicted from one trailer and waiting to move into another.
A few of the players moved more than once during the season. A couple have lived for weeks or months in abandoned houses without water, electricity or heat. Few of the parents have steady jobs, and at least one is in jail.
One girl spent time in rehabilitation for alcoholism. At least one regularly smoked marijuana with her mother at one house and her father at another. Two worried aloud about their mothers' regular use of homemade methamphetamine, in a county where the judge signs two or three search warrants each week to break up meth labs. Most of the girls are on medication themselves, for attention-deficit disorder, bipolar disorder or depression. Some say their parents sometimes take the pills instead.
Few had played team sports. Fewer still had played on a basketball team. Most did not know one another, their lives scattered across small, depressed towns and rolling hills in West Tennessee.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below. If possible, read the other four articles in the series as well.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Why was Destiny given a drug test?
        
How do students get enrolled at Carroll Academy?
        
What does the headline of the article mean, in light of the team's record?
        
If the team, or the story, about the girls isn't about the record, what is it about? Why?
        
Other than a juvenile record, what do many of the girls have in common?
Activity | Pose the following questions: What do you think the students at Carroll Academy need to learn, grow and thrive? How is the school trying to meet those needs? Rather than discuss these questions as a group, direct students to create T-charts in their journals with the headings "What the Students Need" and "What Carroll Academy Provides," and then scan the article or entire series looking for details to put in these columns as appropriate. They might work in pairs to complete their charts, sharing details they find and ideas about what the students' needs are. 
To get them started, you might want to provide them with examples of needs, like motivation, accountability or community, as well as examples of what the school provides, like random drug tests, strict dress codes and required participation in basketball. Remind them that they can also work on their lists backwards, first listing something the school provides and second, the benefits or qualities of participating in it. 
You might also have students look at Carroll's Student Rules and other policies, and consider the effect of posting the rules on the school's Web site, where students and others can view them. How does this code compare with that at your school? 
Have pairs share their lists, and create a group T-chart on the board with ideas contributed by all the pairs. 
Next, work together to identify needs and offerings at their own school, creating a new T-chart on the board. Then step back and look at both charts as a class. Ask: What similarities and differences do you notice? How many of the needs, and offerings, are academic? How many are character-based? What other categories would you put these items in? Does it seem to you that the needs are being met by the school? What gaps can you identify? How can Carroll Academy, and our school, provide further opportunities for learning, direction, personal or spiritual growth or community building? 
Next, have each pair form a team with another pair, and explain that these teams will each work to propose a program for their school that seeks to meet an unmet need or provide a new way to meet a need currently being underserved. 
They should consider curricular and vocational course offerings as well as clubs, athletic teams, community service, peer mentoring or support, conflict mediation, student government or judiciary, journalism, creative writing, arts, theater, internships, tutoring, diversity, community building and so on. Encourage them to be creative as well as practical about the feasibility of implementing their ideas. 
As possible, they should draw on research to develop their ideas and back them up in terms of viability and efficacy. They should also research the cost of their proposed program, including extra time from teachers and staff. You can give them a budget they must be followed or let them present the cost, justifying it with the benefits.
Students also decide on the rules. Provide the following list of questions to guide proposal development: 

        
Is the program required? If so, for all students or for some? How will that requirement be enforced?
        
If it isn't required, how will participation be encouraged? 
        
How much will the program cost?
        
Beyond financing per se, what does the program need - teachers, mentors, equipment, space and so on - to succeed? 
        
How will success be defined? 
        
What challenges might the program face, and how will they be overcome? 
        
What benefits will the program provide?
At all points, the groups should focus on how the ideas they propose are beneficial to the students or the school.
When proposals are ready, each group takes turns presenting in a "round robin" format: The first two groups face off in a competition in which only one advances to the next round of consideration, as voted on by the rest of the class. Each will have a turn presenting and then pointing out the limitations of one another's proposal. Finally, they defend their proposal. In the next round, the winners again debate in groups of two the merits of the proposals, continuing in this manner until a winner emerges.
Students then revisit other groups' ideas to see which, if any, should be adopted. They work together to write up a final proposal, complete with information about rationale, cost, logistics, challenges and benefits. They might then request an audience with the principal, superintendent or other administrators to pitch their ideas.
Going Further | Students research the juvenile justice system in their state, finding the laws, precedents and policies that guide it. They might compare their system to that in Tennessee, where Carroll Academy is located, in a neighboring state in their region, or in other states of their choice. They research what happens after a juvenile is arrested, what programs or facilities he or she might be assigned to, for how long and with what goals in mind. They learn how repeat offenders are handled and what the classes of offense are. 
Students then look into whether there are schools like Carroll Academy in their state or county. They research one facility run by or in partnership with the juvenile justice system: How is it funded? What is the philosophy in working with the students? They write their findings in the form of researched essays to be shared in class. After all presentations, discuss with them how they think juvenile justice in their state is working and what may need improvement.
Alternatively, students examine the photos by Ruth Fremson that accompany the article series and then take photos of their own, imitating Mr. Fremson's style, of scenes in their school and community. They display their photos and give a "gallery talk" about the qualities exemplified in the images. 
Another alternative is to take inspiration from the video "Sentenced to Basketball" and make videos about their own school.

HEADLINE: Rise in City's Jobless Rate Continues to Outpace Hiring

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: The unemployment rate's growth has confounded economists and elected officials, who keep pointing to the simultaneous increase in jobs as evidence that the city's economy is recovering from the financial crisis. 

 BODY:
 No matter how much hiring companies in New York City do, the city's unemployment rate keeps rising.
 It rose again in March, to 9.7 percent, from 9.6 percent in February, and is now nearly as high as it was at the depth of the recession. But, at the same time, the State Labor Department said, the number of jobs in the city continued to rise at a healthy pace.
 The city added more jobs last month than it typically does in March, with hiring especially strong in education, health services and business and professional services, said James P. Brown, principal economist for the New York State Department of Labor. Still, Mr. Brown added, the city's unemployment rate has risen each month of 2012, while the national rate has fallen to 8.2 percent.
 "The unemployment rate continues to trend upward and, at this point, the increase is significant," Mr. Brown said. "It's gone up pretty steadily this year."
 The rising unemployment rate has confounded economists and elected officials, who keep pointing to the simultaneous increase in jobs as evidence that the city's economy is recovering from the financial crisis. In the last 12 months, employment in the city's private sector has increased by 68,700 jobs, or 2.1 percent, the Labor Department reported. That was slightly faster than the national growth rate of 2 percent for the year through March.
 Indeed, New York City and the entire state now have regained all of the private-sector jobs lost during the recession, Mr. Brown said. But the city has continued to attract job-seekers, an influx that can push up the unemployment rate until the newcomers find work. Another complication is that the unemployment rate is calculated from a survey of city residents, while the jobs data comes from a survey of employers.
 The reported gain of more than 42,000 jobs already this year would be one of the biggest increases in any three-month period in the last 12 years, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist with Eastern Consolidated, a real estate services firm in Manhattan. That growth appears out of line with the recent activity in the office-leasing market, which has been quite weak, she said.
 "This third month in a row of sizable gains is not only remarkable but confounding," Ms. Denham said. "While some anecdotal evidence has indicated that employers are feeling more confident about economic conditions, plenty of other statistics suggest that headwinds continue to weigh on the economy: the national employment trend has decelerated, the stock market declined this month and many are still concerned about the situation in Europe."
 Ms. Denham, who performs her own calculations each month to adjust the city's jobs data for seasonal fluctuations in hiring, estimated that the city added 13,100 private-sector jobs in March. Wall Street shed about 800 jobs last month, but has still gained over all in 2012.
 Mr. Brown said employment on Wall Street "is gradually declining, but I think it's above the levels people were expecting six months ago." 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sought to emphasize the positive aspect of the latest economic news. "It's encouraging that our private sector continues to add jobs,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, "which is the most reliable sign that New York City's economy continues to grow."

HEADLINE: Test Scores and Housing Costs

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: Parents hoping to enroll their children in the best public schools have long known that where you live matters. A new study quantifies the difference in housing costs between areas with high- and low-performing schools. 

 BODY:
Parents hoping to enroll their children in the best public schools have long known that where you live matters and that housing prices can be dictated by the quality of the nearby schools.
A new study from the Brookings Institution quantifies that price gap, and the differences between the cost of living near a high-scoring public school and a low-performing one are striking.
The study, by Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research analyst in the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings, found that housing costs in the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas were an average of 2.4 times as high - a difference of $11,000 a year - for homes near schools whose average test scores put them in the top fifth of schools in the area, compared with schools in the bottom fifth.
That means that a family would have to pay more per year to move into a good public school zone than for their children to attend some private schools. Translated into an average home price, the gap works out to an average of $205,000 more for a home near a high-performing school.
"We think of public education as being free, and we think of the main divide in education between public and private schools," Mr. Rothwell said in an interview. "But it turns out that it's actually very expensive to enroll your children in a high- scoring public school." Mr. Rothwell said that in the New York metropolitan area, for example, annual housing costs are $16,000 higher on average in neighborhoods near high-performing schools than in neighborhoods near low-performing schools, compared to the average annual tuition at Catholic schools of around $6,000.

The study also found that the average low-income student - defined as a student who is eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches - attends a school that scores in the 42nd percentile on state tests. In other words, well over half of the schools in the state have higher average test scores than schools attended by poor students. By contrast, the average middle- or high-income student (one not eligible for free or reduced-price school lunches) attends a school whose average state test scores put it at the 61st percentile.
Mr. Rothwell said that the study could not determine whether the average test scores at schools attended by low-income students fell below the average test scores at schools attended by higher-income students because low-income students had less academic support at home or because the quality of teaching was worse. But he noted that other studies showed that when students from low-income backgrounds attended schools with higher-income students and higher average test scores, those lower-income students improved their own test performance.
The study also found that within metropolitan areas, those with higher levels of economic segregation between neighborhoods and school zones had even wider gaps between average test scores. Of the 10 metro areas with the widest gaps in average test scores, six were in the Northeast, including Hartford, Buffalo and Philadelphia.
Zoning may play a role in excluding lower-income families from neighborhoods where there are high-performing schools. The study found that in areas where zoning codes prohibited the development of multifamily rental units or smaller houses, the cost of living near a high-performing school was even higher than in places where affordable housing units were sprinkled in with more expensive housing stock.

HEADLINE: Competition Apparently Up Slightly for Private Schools

BYLINE: JENNY ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: Most schools do not disclose the number of applications they receive, but a clue comes from the number of children taking an intelligence test they use for admissions, and the number rose just 1.4 percent this academic year. 

 BODY:
For a few years, the news on private school admissions has been grim. It was harder to get into some of New York City's top schools than to gain entry to Harvard. Once in, the tuition bill could be higher (not counting room and board, that is).
Not much has changed. On Thursday, theEducational Records Bureau disclosed that the number of students taking the intelligence tests required for admission at most private schools rose a modest 1.4 percent in the 2011-12 academic year. That followed a 7.7 percent increase the year before. 
Since most schools do not disclose the number of applications they receive - some schools, like Dalton, claim that disclosing it will exacerbate parental anxiety rather than assuaging it - the number of children taking the tests, known as the E.R.B.'s, is often taken as a proxy for admissions competition.
The Educational Records Bureau, which administers the test, said that in 2011-12, 4,418 students took the tests used for entry to prekindergarten to fourth grade.
Antoinette DeLuca, executive director of the early childhood admissions assessment at the bureau, said the numbers were "a testament to the long-standing reputation" of the private schools, given the general economic climate.
Parents can take comfort that last year was not a repeat of 2007-8, when the number of students taking the test skyrocketed 12 percent, to 4,334 from 3,853, before a modest drop in the following two years. But the overall number is now higher, suggesting another hard year for getting into kindergarten at competitive schools like Brearley, Trinity and Dalton.

HEADLINE: Life, Interrupted: A Young Cancer Patient Faces Infertility

BYLINE: SULEIKA JAOUAD


HIGHLIGHT: Last spring, I found out I had leukemia. Before the horror of the news even had time to sink in, I had to absorb a second shock: The chemotherapy treatments that could save my life would also make me infertile, writes Suleika Jaouad. 

 BODY:
The family minivan idles at the intersection of 59th and York in Midtown Manhattan. My boyfriend swabs my midriff with alcohol as he steadies the needle. My parents look on from the front seat, quietly studying their 22-year-old daughter and the young man they've known for only a month. The needle is filled with gonadotropin, a hormone that stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs. I'm late for my checkup at the fertility clinic.
How in the world did I get here?
Last spring, I found out I had leukemia. Before the horror of the news even had time to sink in, I had to absorb a second shock: The chemotherapy treatments that could save my life would also make me infertile.
Leukemia is an emergency, and oncologists are the first responders: They are trained to beat cancer; everything else must take a back seat. It was only after I asked about fertility that the doctors told me about the available options.
This is one of the challenges of being a young woman with cancer. In many ways, I am still a child myself, relying on my parents to take care of me. But I have an adult disease. Most patients with my type of cancer, a form of acute myeloid leukemia, are long past their childbearing years. While my oncologists are intent on saving my life -- and I am forever indebted to them for this -- preserving my chance to be a mother some day just didn't seem to be on their radar.
A few days after my diagnosis, I was sitting at the table at home in upstate New York. My father was cooking fresh squid on the grill, his childhood favorite. I should have been savoring my last days before a long hospitalization, but I was agitated from the fertility drugs. I looked across the table at my boyfriend. We had met only eight months earlier, and here we were, considering the benefits of freezing embryos with his sperm (the option with the greater chance of success) versus freezing only my eggs. It was awkward territory.
A social worker cautioned me about embryos, citing the unforeseeable legal and emotional obstacles that could arise down the road. My boyfriend was open to creating embryos, but told me the choice was ultimately mine. But how could I plan to have a child with him when I didn't even know if I was going to survive myself? I put off the decision as long as possible, but now a nurse was waiting for my answer, and I had to decide in minutes. With some reluctance, I told them to freeze only my eggs.
At the fertility clinic, the walls are bare except for a sign that says "No Children Allowed." Several women, some with husbands or boyfriends, are sitting in plush chairs, waiting for the lady in the lab coat to call the next name. I guess that most of them are paying full price to be here. Fertility treatment can cost $25,000, and is rarely covered by insurance. In my case, I was lucky to get a scholarship from Fertile Hope, a program from the Livestrong Foundation that provides support and information on fertility options to cancer patients and survivors.
In most doctors' offices, it's hard to know why the stranger next to you is there, but everyone is in this waiting room for the same reason. No one is talking, but everybody seems to be sizing one another up. Most of the women here look to be in their mid-30s, and a few might be approaching 40. Based on how they are dressed, I would guess that they have jobs to return to after their appointments. I am wearing my college sweatshirt emblazoned with "Class of 2010," and I am feeling out of place. My boyfriend and I are both unemployed and in our 20s, with only one thing to do today. And now we are looking at our shoes.
The timing in all of this, like everything else these days, is out of sequence. But this is my new reality as a young adult with cancer. These women may not have cancer, but I am linked to them. My breasts, like theirs, have swelled from the hormone injections. Our bodies are sending us signals to get ready for pregnancy even though none of us can be certain it will happen. And although I'm not planning for a baby anytime soon, preserving my ability to have children feels like my only lifeline to an uncertain future. All of us are together and alone in this room. Hoping for life.

HEADLINE: Focus, People!

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: We worry too much over trivial flare-ups while forgetting the seriousness of the questions the 2012 election will decide. 

 BODY:
The general election is off to an inauspicious start.
We are already lost in the weeds of the inconsequential.
Like kittens chasing a spot of light on the floor, the public and the press are jumping about with excitement and outrage over ancillary issues. Even there we are doing so by creating false equivalencies.
For instance, an Obama supporter, Hilary Rosen, made an unfortunate remark about Ann Romney's being a stay-at-home mom, and the president quickly distanced himself even though Rosen apologized.
On the other hand, one of Mitt Romney's supporters, the inflammatory Ted Nugent, made despicable and threatening comments about the president's re-election, and Romney only soft-pedaled away from him, even though Nugent never apologized.
This is what we're discussing - a manufactured mommy war and a rhetorical warmonger.
And while we're distracted, recent polling suggests that the race is tightening.
This all makes me want to grab every American by the shoulder and say, "Focus, people!"
This will be a long election fought with hundreds of millions of dollars over relatively few voters in the middle. There is unlikely to be a knockout punch or a trump-card issue. There will be many ups and downs, faux pas and faux issues. But we shouldn't lose sight of what really matters - what this and every presidential election is really about.
It is about the size and function of government in our lives - whether we value social safety nets or social Darwinism.
It is about how the government collects and spends money and whether those activities are ruled by a spirit of fairness or disproportionately favor the most well off.
It is about whether rhetoric criticizing the size and influence of government ends where individuals' bodies begin. Whether you believe, as I do, that all liberty begins with personal liberty. That none of us has the right to impose our beliefs and values on others. That each of our bodies is sovereign, to be governed as we so choose, without the interference of government, so long as our individual choices don't impede or encumber the liberty of others.
This is about each of us being able to love, and marry, whomever we chose.
This is about women having unfettered and unfiltered access to a full range of reproductive options, which is most fundamentally about the physical and economic well-being of both them and their families.
This is about how we prioritize and provide direction and incentives for our educational system so that we produce citizens who are well equipped to compete in a tightening global job market.
This is about the judges the winner of the election would nominate, particularly to the Supreme Court, and how those nominations might balance or further skew the justice system.
This is about war philosophies: how easily a president is willing to commit troops to war, how he might execute a war once it commences and how willing he is to end it.
It is also about whether we will deal humanely with people who are in this country illegally, many of whom have been here for decades, many of whom work and are otherwise law abiding, many of whom have been raised and educated here.
When you consider the gravity of the real issues, the minor ones drift away like the seeds of a dandelion.
Neither candidate is perfect on every point, but they are not equal. Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, the Democrats and Republicans, have radically divergent views about the direction of the country. One is progressive; the other is regressive.
Romney and the Republicans are running a campaign of opposition and retrenchment. They want to repeal, restrict, restructure, reclaim and restore. They want to take the country back to a reality that exists only in their imaginations - and to a world that will never exist again - and freeze us there.
But that's utterly unrealistic. There are no cryogenic chambers for countries. The world is dynamic, and as a country we must be dynamic in it. There is no going backward to get ahead. This is not a board game.
Social mores are changing. The global economy is changing. World security is changing. We need a president who understands and appreciates those changes and can articulate a core conviction about how to guide us forward through them.
That man simply isn't Mitt Romney.
I have no personal gripe with Romney. I don't believe him to be an evil man. Quite the opposite: he appears to be a loving husband and father. Besides, evil requires conviction, which Romney lacks. But he is a dangerous man. Unprincipled ambition always is. Infinite malleability is its own vice because it's infinitely corruptible by others of ignoble intentions.
Not only has he at some point in his political life been on both sides of more issues than I have energy to list here, he has made clear during the primaries that he is willing to shift to the far right on far too many issues to be the right president for modern America.
He has signaled that war with Iran would be on the table. He has said that he would seek to take financing away from Planned Parenthood. He embraced the Paul Ryan budget. He has called Arizona's draconian immigration law a "model" for the country. He has said that he would "propose and promote" a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
He said this week that he might eliminate the Department of Housing and Urban Development and trim down the Department of Education.
He has said that he "favored justices like Roberts and Alito, Scalia and Thomas" for the Supreme Court and found the nomination of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic on the court, "troubling." He has said that he would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned.
Romney's willingness to shift so far right would set us too far back.
We need a president who understands the winds of change, not one who simply twists in them.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The economy provides ammunitionfor both Mitt Romney and President Obama, Jeff Zeleny and Allison Kopicki write, analyzing responses to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. For Mr. Obama, there is a gradually growing perception that the general outlook is turning brighter, and for Mr. Romney, there are those individuals who still do not feel substantial improvement in their own lives. The poll shows Mr. Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, in a tight race with the president as the general election campaign begins.
How the economy will affect voters' decisions is a key question in the crucial battleground state of Ohio. Sabrina Tavernise and Jeff Zeleny write about the importance of the white, working-class voters who are unenthusiastic about Mr. Obama because they haven't felt the economic recovery but aren't too keen on Mr. Romney, either.
Election-year skirmishes over female voters are playing out in the halls of Congress, Jennifer Steinhauer writes. In the Senate, Democrats are seizing on Republican opposition to two women-friendly measures--a bill to reauthorize and expand a domestic violence law and another to strengthen enforcement of federal equal-pay laws-- to send a message that they hope women will remember at the polls.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected Wednesday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., existing home sales for March and weekly mortgage rates at 10.
At 11 a.m., the space shuttle Discovery will be officially received by the Smithsonian and placed on permanent display, replacing the shuttle Enterprise in a branch of the National Air and Space Museum near Dulles Airport.
Also at 11, several members of Congress will join Holocaust survivors in a remembrance ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda.
In the afternoon, President Obama will meet with the 2011 college football national champions, University of Alabama Crimson Tide, at the White House.

TOP STORIES 
Morgan Stanley Reports Loss, but Beats Estimates | Morgan Stanley reported adjusted earnings on Thursday that beat analyst estimates, driven by stronger-than-expected trading revenue. Including charges, however, the firm had a first-quarter loss of $94 million, or 6 cents a share. That compares with a profit of $968 million in the year-ago period.
The results were affected by one-time accounting charges related to the firm's credit spreads. Excluding those one-time items, the firm had a profit of 71 cents a share. That handily beat the 44 cents a share estimates of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. 
Morgan Stanley's first-quarter revenue fell 8 percent to $6.9 billion, down from $7.57 billion in the year-ago period. Excluding the accounting charges, revenue was $8.9 billion, up from the $7.8 billion in the same quarter a year ago.

Bank of America Earnings Fall to $653 Million | Bank of America reported Thursday that its net income fell to $653 million, or 3 cents a share, in the first quarter, partly because of one-time expenses.
The bank reported that its revenue for the quarter was $22.5 billion, which was down 17 percent from the same period a year ago. The top and bottom line were affected by accounting charges for how the bank's debt is valued, as credit spreads tightened.
Excluding those charges, the company's revenue was down 2.5 percent to $27.3 billion while its profit was up 34.8 percent to $310 million. The bank's operating income was 31 cents a share and was ahead of analyst estimates of 12 cents a share. Its revenue met expectations.

HEADLINE: In Latest Pay Rebuke, Investor to Oppose Goldman Director

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: In a letter to clients this week, the managers of Sequoia Fund announced plans to vote against director James A. Johnson, former chief executive of Fannie Mae, and urged other shareholders to do the same. 

 BODY:
In the latest rebuke of eye-popping pay packages on Wall Street, a major institutional investor is taking the rare step to oppose the re-election of a Goldman Sachs board member who approves compensation for many of the bank's top executives.
The managers of Sequoia Fund announced plans this week to vote against James A. Johnson, a longtime Goldman director and a former chief executive of Fannie Mae, and urged other shareholders to follow suit. The push comes days after Citigroup shareholders rejected the bank's $15 million payout to its chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit.
The critique of the Goldman director also coincided with an unusual announcement by Barclays, the big British bank, which said on Thursday that its executives would forfeit portions of their bonuses if the firm failed to meet certain profitability goals.
 The moves echo the concerns among regulators, lawmakers and others that bank executives continue to emphasize their own compensation over the well-being of the institutions more than three years after the financial crisis.
That displeasure now appears to be broadening to include even mainstream investors like the Sequoia Fund. The $5.7 billion fund, which is an investor in companies like Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has long been one of Wall Street's best performers. And in the case of Citigroup, the nonbinding "no" vote on pay came at the hands of major institutional investors.
"A garden-variety investment manager doesn't typically step out like this," said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. He said that shareholder uprisings more often come from outspoken corners of the financial industry - groups like public pension funds and activist investors with social agendas. But, he said, "When you see mediocre results and large pay, you're going to see some complaints."
As one of the most powerful names on Wall Street, Goldman has come under fire before over pay, even as it seeks to rein in compensation. The firm recently announced that its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, earned $12 million for his work in 2011 - roughly a 35 percent decline from 2010 - though the bank's stock declined more than 45 percent last year. Over all, the firm's compensation was 39 percent of net revenue, which is not outsized compared with competitors.
Still, 27 percent of shareholders voted to reject the bank's compensation plan at the firm's annual meeting last year. While well short of the votes needed to issue a nonbinding rebuke, it was a strong showing.
Now the focus has turned to Mr. Johnson, who has faced criticism for sitting on boards that dole out big paydays. In 2006, Barron's called him "Mr. Generosity."
A Goldman spokesman said in a statement, "The board has recommended shareholders re-elect Mr. Johnson. He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to do so."
But in a letter to clients this week, the managers of Sequoia Fund called on shareholders to oust Mr. Johnson at the firm's annual meeting on May 24. The managers voted against his re-election last year, as well.
Citing his tenure as chief executive of Fannie Mae, the shareholders outlined a broad critique of Mr. Johnson's corporate career.
"As chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the mortgage giant Fannie Mae from 1991 through 1998, Johnson lobbied Congress relentlessly to relax Fannie's underwriting standards and lower the capital requirements put in place to protect taxpayers from losses in the event of a downturn in the housing market," they said in the April 18 letter.
The letter was reported earlier by The Financial Times and Politico. Mr. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
The managers of Sequoia Fund who wrote the letter, Robert D. Goldfarb and David M. Poppe, are influential investors. Morningstar named them domestic stock managers of the year for 2010.
Mr. Goldfarb and Mr. Poppe's firm owns Goldman shares for both the Sequoia Fund and separately managed accounts. By the end of 2011, they held 1.4 million shares.
It is unclear whether the letter will gain traction among other investors, but Mr. Poppe said on Thursday that he had received strong support.
"The feedback has been very positive and people know there is a serious problem," he said.
Their letter also invoked Mr. Johnson's time as a director of United Healthcare and KB Home, both of which became embroiled in controversy over executives who backdated stock options. Mr. Johnson was not accused of any wrongdoing.
"Mr. Johnson has been at the center of several egregious corporate governance debacles," the Sequoia managers wrote. "We believe Mr. Johnson's history should disqualify him from service on the board of any public company."
In particular, they questioned why Mr. Johnson, who was paid $523,000 last year for serving on the Goldman board, is chairman of the bank's compensation committee.
In the letter, the investment managers acknowledged the rarity of their actions. "In the normal course of business we shouldn't need to vote against management's recommendations on proxy issues, because we trust management to act in our best interest," they said.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Group Misses Earnings Expectations

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Blackstone Group's first-quarter profit fell 24 percent from a year ago, as the value of the private equity giant's holdings grew at a slower rate. 

 BODY:
Business for private equity firms may be improving, but it was not enough to lift the Blackstone Group's first-quarter profit.
The investment titan on Thursday reported a 24 percent drop in earnings from a year ago, as its holdings grew at a slower rate. That is despite its stores of investor capital jumping 27 percent, to a record high of $190 billion.
Blackstone's results highlight the dilemma currently confronting private equity firms. Such shops have not posted the outsize growth that made their names and fortunes. And yet they continue to draw money from limited partners casting about for sorely needed higher yields.
"Over all, we're seeing more money going to alternatives," Hamilton E. James, Blackstone's president, said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. "But it's pretty tough for private equity in general today."
Shares in Blackstone tumbled 4.7 percent on Thursday, to $14.14.
Thursday's results could set the tone for earnings results from other alternative asset managers, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is scheduled to report next week.
Blackstone's profit, reported as economic net income after taxes, amounted to $432.3 million for the quarter. That figure includes unrealized gains from investments, and is considered by the private equity industry to be an accurate reflection of a firm's profitability. Its earnings of 39 cents a share fell short of the 40 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Based on generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone reported a gain of $58.3 million for the quarter, up 37 percent. On that basis, revenue fell during the quarter to $952 million, from $1.2 billion in the same quarter a year ago.
Blackstone officials attributed their troubles to continued economic uncertainty in the United States and in Europe, as well as political flare-ups around the world. All have contributed to what Mr. James said was a reality that fell short of the stock markets' gains in recent months.
Still, Blackstone has continued to benefit from a robust debt market with easy access to the financing that underpins its private equity and real estate investments. But executives added ruefully that easy money has made deals more expensive, as buyers are compelled to pay more for their acquisitions.
The firm said that it still saw opportunities for investment, and that it had ample ammunition to invest, with $37.8 billion in "dry powder," or uninvested capital, at the end of the quarter.
While Blackstone's core private equity and real estate divisions reported drops in revenue, its other business showed improvement. Its hedge fund and debt investment arms grew by double digits, while its advisory unit benefited from an increase in merger and restructuring assignments.

HEADLINE: Goldman Executives Reappear on Real Estate Scene

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A number of former Goldman Sachs executives who worked at the firm's real estate investment arm Whitehall have found second acts in private equity. 

 BODY:
There was a time when Goldman Sachs's real estate investment arm was one of the banking giant's crown jewels. The unit, which largely operates under the Whitehall brand, raised billions of dollars, earning profits for the firm's partners and investors. 
But then the financial crisis struck. The Whitehall funds, which had aggressively invested at the top of the real estate market, suffered enormous losses. Goldman has largely dismantled its Whitehall team and no current plans to raise another fund, according to people briefed on the firm's strategy. 
Where has Whitehall's leadership gone? A check of the headlines this week shows that -- please excuse the cliché -- there are second acts in private equity real estate investing. 
 On Thursday, the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts announced its first real estate investment in the United States. The firm closed on a roughly $200 million investment in Yorktown Center, a Chicago-area mall, purchasing the property with several co-investors. 
Leading the deal was Ralph Rosenberg, a former co-head of Goldman's Whitehall unit, who K.K.R. hired last year to head its new real estate effort. Mr. Rosenberg left Whitehall in 2004, before much of its problems arose. He headed another Goldman investment for two years before leaving in in 2006. 
K.K.R., along with the other large, publicly traded private equity firms, are pushing into new businesses to diversify their revenues. In real estate, K.K.R. (as well as Apollo Global Management, another big firm with a nascent property-investing business) is playing catchup to the Blackstone Group, the dominant private equity real estate investor. Blackstone manages about $37 billion in real estate funds. 
Another firm trying to build a real estate investment business is AllianceBernstein. The money manager, whose chief executive, Peter Kraus, is a former Goldman banker, announced Wednesday that it closed its first private equity real estate fund with commitments of $680 million. 
Co-heading AllianceBernstein's fund is Brahm Cramer, a longtime Goldman partner and former co-head of its Whitehall group. He is running the fund with Jay Nidick, the former president of real estate company iStar Financial. Working closely with Mr. Cramer at AllianceBernstein is Adam Brooks, who led Goldman's real estate mezzanine investing arm. 
In a statement, Mr. Cramer said, "As a first time fund, we are thrilled with the success of our capital raise within a very difficult fundraising environment."

President Obama plans to renominate a member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission whose term expires in June despite opposition from Harry Reid, leader of the Senate's Democratic majority, an official says.

HEADLINE: Lead by Example, Clinton Tells Sustainability Forum

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Saying that the nation was too wedded to habit, former President Bill Clinton urged a crowd to embrace small steps toward sustainable development and energy efficiency. 

 BODY:
"Chill out - sometimes this stuff takes years." 
That was Bill Clinton's wry observation on Thursday as he addressed a sustainability conference in New York City, expressing frustration over how long it is taking for the country to move forward on clean energy and energy efficiency.
Appearing before a crowd of around 250 at the annual Sustainable Operations Summit at the Hilton New York in Midtown Manhattan, the former president said there had been some progress but that the upfront costs of adopting better technology -- especially in shaky economic times -- and a cultural resistance to change remained significant obstacles.
"We are too wedded to the way we've done things," Mr. Clinton said, waving his reading glasses for emphasis as he spoke. "It's psychological as well as financial. We have to liberate ourselves from that."
Mr. Clinton, who sees upgrades as a way to create jobs and boost the economy, has made a cause of retrofitting buildings to conserve energy through his Clinton Climate Initiative and President Obama's Better Building Challenge, which promotes public and private investment in energy efficiency projects. He encouraged his audience of business and environmental executives to lead "by argument and example" to convince people that sustainable growth is the only kind of growth that makes sense in the long run.

"Keep doing the little things that add up," he said.
In a brief question-and-answer session, Mr. Clinton also touched on politics and the Trayvon Martin shooting case in Florida. He did not address the Florida case directly other than to say that the so-called Stand Your Ground statute "is not a good law" and that tighter gun control laws would ultimately come about only at the behest of voters, for example, by organizing a referendum vote.
Looking sharp in a dark suit and red tie, Mr. Clinton drew laughter when he referred to Eric Fehrnstrom, the Mitt Romney aide who got into trouble last month for saying that once the primary phase was over, the Romney campaign could reset the campaign message, comparing it to shaking an Etch A Sketch. 
"He told the truth," he said. "Sometimes that's the worst sin you can commit in politics." Mr. Clinton then made the point that, out of the heat of the primaries, the presidential candidates could engage in a different debate about controversial issues like health care. 
 Mr. Clinton said he stood firmly behind President Obama in the coming election.
"Most of his policies have moved the country in the right direction," he said. "I personally think we're making a pretty good comeback."

HEADLINE: 'Fraternity' at Holy Cross Runs Deeper Than Greek Life

BYLINE: DANIEL E. SLOTNIK


HIGHLIGHT: Elite alumni of the College of the Holy Cross share their experience of being a minority on campus during the 1960s and '70s. 

 BODY:
The College of the Holy Cross's graduating class of 1972 included a number of particularly distinctive alumni: a National Football League running back who won a Super Bowl with the Miami Dolphins in 1973, then established a successful legal career; a writer who received the Pulitzer Prize; even a justice of the Supreme Court.
None of them would have attended Holy Cross without the efforts of the Rev. John Brooks, a theology professor. The men - Eddie Jenkins Jr., Edward P. Jones and Clarence Thomas, respectively - are all African-American. Father Brooks, who is white, recruited them in 1968, when Holy Cross was a predominately white campus (nowadays, roughly a quarter of the student body is made up of racial minorities). He served as a confidant and guide, a sympathetic ear and a liaison to the school's management during their time at Holy Cross. The Businessweek editorDiane Brady chronicles the story of Father Brooks and these students in her book "Fraternity." Ms. Brady describes Father Brooks's sense of responsibility to his recruits:
It wasn't a responsibility for their success; the choice to study and do the work was theirs alone, as it was for every student. It was a responsibility to acknowledge that the college experience might not be as comfortable for the black students, that they didn't have the role models in the classroom or the easy comfort of being in the majority.
We at The Choice thought that the story of Father Brooks, the alumni and their thoughts on the experience would be helpful for prospective students.
Father Brooks said he thought that the economic demands of a college education outweighed racial concerns, even more now than in the 1960s. Though "there may be a bias," he said, "if I identify a bright high school student, African-American, the biggest challenge is gathering the scholarships and the assistance to enable them to attend." 
Mr. Jenkins and Stanley Grayson, an alumnus who is now the chief operating officer of M.R. Beal & Company, an investment bank, agreed that economic concerns were crucial, and that Holy Cross's intense academic program was a major challenge. But the two men thought social pressures were a problem: even students who did not face overt acts of racism "were under extra scrutiny, as if people were waiting to see them fail," Ms. Brady writes.
"It was a culture shock at first," Mr. Jenkins said of going to Worcester, Mass., which had a negligible black population, from Queens, N.Y.
"The hardest part probably was the isolation," he continued. "You had to create a home in a foreign land."
"One of the hard parts was the music," joked Mr. Grayson. "I think for a lot of people, when I got there in '68, I and my colleagues represented the first real contact they had with people of color." The two men spoke of tension underlying everyday interactions.
The black students formed their own ties on campus. They created a Black Student Union, which staged a successful walkout in 1969 when its members were disproportionately disciplined following a protest against General Electric recruiters. Later, they successfully lobbied for a "black corridor," a residence area dedicated to black students (students of other racial backgrounds were allowed to live there, and some did).
Mr. Grayson called the corridor "one of the things that allowed me to survive at Holy Cross back in 1969 and '70."
The corridor drew accusations of hypocrisy from students who felt their black classmates were avoiding integration.
Mr. Jenkins defended the hall. "We wanted the refreshing feeling of coming home and sharing stories," he said.
Mr. Grayson said a black corridor would probably be less important on a campus now, even though many schools offer lodgings for students with shared backgrounds.
The two men thought that engaging with the environment and classmates was crucial in making the most of college.
"Get involved and get engaged with the college," Mr. Grayson said. "I think when you've done that the adjustment becomes easier."
Mr. Jenkins thought current students might lack a common cause, like the civil rights struggle, to draw them together.
"Students today say what is our purpose, and you have to find that purpose," he said. "Today, you have to identify what is the major obstacle you have to overcome, and I think it's economics."
Both were thankful for the friends they made at Holy Cross, black and white, and for Father Brooks, who stayed close even after graduation. But perhaps another alumnus, quoted by Ms. Brady, said it best.
"I wasn't part of some program to Father Brooks," Justice Clarence Thomas said. "I was a kid."

HEADLINE: American Nuns, Conscience and the Vatican

 BODY:
The Vatican is reining in the leadership conference that represents 80 percent of American Catholic nuns, accusing the group of ''serious doctrinal problems'' and promoting ''radical feminist themes.'' That seems a misreading of the very fine work in schools, charities, prisons and impoverished neighborhoods being done by about 60,000 nuns across the nation. 
These nuns and their leaders continued to bolster the reputation of the Roman Catholic Church even as it suffered one of its greatest scandals in the sexual abuse of schoolchildren by rogue priests and the cover-ups by diocesan authorities.
The Vatican has now appointed a bishop to oversee the operations of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious -- the 1,500 superiors who run the sisters' communities -- citing individual nuns at conference gatherings challenging church teaching on homosexuality and the male-only priesthood. The announcement also accused the group's leaders of focusing too much on poverty and economic injustice while allegedly keeping ''silent'' on abortion and same-sex marriage.
A crucial focus in the inquiry appears to be the fact that dozens of American nuns involved in the conference and in antipoverty and hospital work provided prominent support to President Obama's health care reform. Conference leaders said Vatican investigators had pointedly raised the issue and the fact that the conference had split with American bishops, who opposed reform.
The sisters' leaders said they reaffirmed their opposition to abortion but also claimed the right to speak out on a ''moral imperative'' like health care, just as the bishops had.
The nuns clearly are caught in a classic crossfire of church doctrine, politics and hierarchical obedience. It would be a tragedy, far beyond the church, if their fine work and their courageous voices were constrained.

HEADLINE: Big Investor to Oppose A Goldman Director

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS; Susanne Craig contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In the latest rebuke of eye-popping pay packages on Wall Street, a major institutional investor is taking the rare step to oppose the re-election of a Goldman Sachs board member who approves compensation for many of the bank's top executives.
The managers of Sequoia Fund announced plans this week to vote against James A. Johnson, a longtime Goldman director and a former chief executive of Fannie Mae, and urged other shareholders to follow suit. The push comes days after Citigroup shareholders rejected the bank's $15 million payout to its chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit. 
The critique of the Goldman director also coincided with an unusual announcement by Barclays, the big British bank, which said on Thursday that its executives would forfeit portions of their bonuses if the firm failed to meet certain profitability goals.
The moves echo the concerns among regulators, lawmakers and others that bank executives continue to emphasize their own compensation over the well-being of the institutions more than three years after the financial crisis.
That displeasure now appears to be broadening to include even mainstream investors like the Sequoia Fund. The $5.7 billion fund, which is an investor in companies like Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, has long been one of Wall Street's best performers. And in the case of Citigroup, the nonbinding ''no'' vote on pay came at the hands of major institutional investors.
''A garden-variety investment manager doesn't typically step out like this,'' said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware. He said that shareholder uprisings more often come from outspoken corners of the financial industry - groups like public pension funds and activist investors with social agendas. But, he said, ''When you see mediocre results and large pay, you're going to see some complaints.''
As one of the most powerful names on Wall Street, Goldman has come under fire before over pay, even as it seeks to rein in compensation. The firm recently announced that its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, earned $12 million for his work in 2011 - roughly a 35 percent decline from 2010 - though the bank's stock declined more than 45 percent last year. Over all, the firm's compensation was 39 percent of net revenue, which is not outsized compared with competitors.
Still, 27 percent of shareholders voted to reject the bank's compensation plan at the firm's annual meeting last year. While well short of the votes needed to issue a nonbinding rebuke, it was a strong showing.
Now the focus has turned to Mr. Johnson, who has faced criticism for sitting on boards that dole out big paydays. In 2006, Barron's called him ''Mr. Generosity.''
A Goldman spokesman said in a statement, ''The board has recommended shareholders re-elect Mr. Johnson. He has served them well since 1999 and will continue to do so.''
But in a letter to clients this week, the managers of Sequoia Fund called on shareholders to oust Mr. Johnson at the firm's annual meeting on May 24. The managers voted against his re-election last year, as well.
Citing his tenure as chief executive of Fannie Mae, the shareholders outlined a broad critique of Mr. Johnson's corporate career.
''As chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the mortgage giant Fannie Mae from 1991 through 1998, Johnson lobbied Congress relentlessly to relax Fannie's underwriting standards and lower the capital requirements put in place to protect taxpayers from losses in the event of a downturn in the housing market,'' they said in the April 18 letter.
The letter was reported earlier by The Financial Times and Politico. Mr. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.
The managers of Sequoia Fund who wrote the letter, Robert D. Goldfarb and David M. Poppe, are influential investors. Morningstar named them domestic stock managers of the year for 2010.
Mr. Goldfarb and Mr. Poppe's firm owns Goldman shares for both the Sequoia Fund and separately managed accounts. By the end of 2011, they held 1.4 million shares.
It is unclear whether the letter will gain traction among other investors, but Mr. Poppe said on Thursday that he had received strong support.
''The feedback has been very positive and people know there is a serious problem,'' he said.
Their letter also invoked Mr. Johnson's time as a director of United Healthcare and KB Home, both of which became embroiled in controversy over executives who backdated stock options. Mr. Johnson was not accused of any wrongdoing.
''Mr. Johnson has been at the center of several egregious corporate governance debacles,'' the Sequoia managers wrote. ''We believe Mr. Johnson's history should disqualify him from service on the board of any public company.''
In particular, they questioned why Mr. Johnson, who was paid $523,000 last year for serving on the Goldman board, is chairman of the bank's compensation committee.
In the letter, the investment managers acknowledged the rarity of their actions. ''In the normal course of business we shouldn't need to vote against management's recommendations on proxy issues, because we trust management to act in our best interest,'' they said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.
- Rez Abbasi Quintet (Friday and Saturday) Born in Pakistan and reared in Southern California, the guitarist Rez Abbasi specializes in a worldly take on chamber jazz that's hyperdetailed but with room to breathe. He almost always works with musicians of quick reflex and individual style, and that's especially true of his band mates here: Dave Binney on alto saxophone, Matt Mitchell on piano, Johannes Weidenmueller on bass and Dan Weiss on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $20 cover, includes one drink. (Nate Chinen) 
Cyrille Aimee (Friday through Sunday, Wednesday through April 28) A jazz singer of unforced cosmopolitanism -- born in France, of French and Dominican parentage -- Ms. Aimee put in a strong showing at the 2010 Thelonious Monk International Jazz Vocal Competition, shortly before recording her most recent album, ''Live at Smalls'' (SmallsLive). After wrapping up this week's run at Birdland, she resurfaces at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola with the group she calls her Surreal Band. Friday and Saturday at 8:30 and 11 p.m. and Sunday at 6 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40, $25 on Sunday, with a $10 minimum. Wednesday and Thursday at 11 p.m., April 27 and 28 at 12:45 a.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $10 to $20 cover, $5 to $10 for students, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
- Ambrose Akinmusire Quintet (Thursday through April 29) An earnest young trumpeter with a bracingly original style -- shadowy tone, sure attack, surprising turns of phrase -- Ambrose Akinmusire made one of last year's best jazz releases, a smart dispatch from the new postbop frontier. The album, ''When the Heart Emerges Glistening'' (Blue Note), features this working band with the tenor saxophonist Walter Smith III, the bassist Harish Raghavan and the drummer Justin Brown; the group's piano chair, previously held by Gerald Clayton, now belongs to Sam Harris. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 cover. (Chinen)
Wess Anderson Sextet (Friday through Sunday) Wess Anderson, known in jazz circles as Warmdaddy, is an alto saxophonist with a tart sound and a bluesy, charismatic style. A charter member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, he returns to friendly turf with a young band featuring Aaron Diehl on piano, among others. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set on Friday and Saturday, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $40 cover, with $15 for students in select sets, and a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
- The Bad Plus (Tuesday through April 29) Since forming just over a decade ago, this acoustic power trio -- Reid Anderson on bass, Ethan Iverson on piano, David King on drums -- has been known for its canny twists on the pop repertory, though the group has also developed an impressive book of original tunes, with each member pitching in. The band seems likely to draw here from ''Made Possible,'' its forthcoming eighth studio album, which makes this engagement a sneak preview for some typically brave new material. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; $25 cover at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
- Han Bennink 70th Birthday Concert (Saturday) If you've been listening to WKCR, 89.9 FM, this week, you know that Mr. Bennink, the eminent Dutch jazz drummer, just turned 70; you also know that his art is as much about flourish as it is about tempo (though he can swing on a dime). This concert, the culmination of WKCR's marathon birthday broadcast, will feature him in the company of some prominent collaborators, including the multireedist Michael Moore, the keyboardist Richard Teitelbaum, the trombonist Ray Anderson, the trumpeter Thomas Heberer, the violinist Mary Oliver, the bassist Mark Dresser and the pianist Uri Caine. At 7:30 p.m., Italian Academy at Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, Morningside Heights, (212) 352-3101, cuarts.com/calendar/view/type/4/event--id/13300; $25. (Chinen)
David Berkman Trio (Thursday) David Berkman, a pianist drawn about equally to logic and discovery, leads a trio with two strong partners, the bassist Ed Howard and the drummer Colin Stranahan. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; no cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
BossaBrasil Festival 2012 (Tuesday through April 28) Paula Morelenbaum, a vocalist formerly associated with Antonio Carlos Jobim, joins the songwriter Marcos Valle in headlining this minifestival of Brazilian music, produced by Pat Philips and Ettore Stratta. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton , (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
- Regina Carter (Friday through Sunday) Ms. Carter, the violinist, has explored timbres both rustic and cosmopolitan throughout her career. Her current preoccupation -- and the subject of her most recent album, ''Reverse Thread'' (eOne) -- is folkloric music of Africa, stamped with her own improvisational flair and helped along by an ace band featuring kora, accordion, bass and drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30 cover. (Chinen)
Central Brooklyn Jazz Festival (Friday through April 30) This homegrown, community-supported festival, now in its 13th season, continues with bookings in and around the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. Among the highlights this coming week are the venerable alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, on Friday at Jazz 966, 966 Fulton Street, at Grand Avenue; Reggie Nicholson Concept, led by Mr. Nicholson, a drummer, on Saturday at Sistas' Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue; and a Brooklyn Jazz Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, on Wednesday at Sugar Hill Supper Club, 609 Dekalb Avenue. For a full schedule and more information, visit cbjcjazz.org. (Chinen)
'ChamberWorks' (Saturday) Works, the collective trio composed of the flutist Michel Gentile, the pianist Daniel Kelly and the drummer Rob Garcia, serves as the brain and central nervous system of this concert, part of the Brooklyn Jazz Wide Open series. The compositions will feature Works alongside a chamber orchestra stocked with artists like the bassoonist Sara Schoenbeck, the violinist Mazz Swift and the cellist Marika Hughes. At 8 p.m., Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, 58 Seventh Avenue, at Lincoln Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 622-3300, bqcm.org; $10. (Chinen)
George Colligan Quartet (Tuesday) Last year the pianist George Colligan released a hard-nosed but melodically minded trio album, ''Living for the City'' (Steeplechase), with different partners than the ones he has here. But he seems likely to make some reference to it, in a band with Lonnie Plaxico on bass, Clarence Penn on drums, Debbie Deane on vocals and, as a featured guest, the alto saxophonist Jaleel Shaw. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)
Eli Degibri-Kevin Hays Duo (Thursday) Mr. Degibri, a saxophonist, and Mr. Hays, a pianist, have worked together in numerous formats, but this duo -- also documented on ''One Little Song,'' a self-released album from 2006 -- best captures their close rapport. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $15 cover, or $10 for members in the first set, $10, or $5 for members in the second set. (Chinen)
- Kurt Elling Swings Sinatra (Wednesday) Frank Sinatra probably isn't the first touchstone that comes to mind when you apprehend the style of Kurt Elling, a jazz singer of nimble instinct and literary flair. (You might think first of Mark Murphy, then Jon Hendricks.) But Mr. Elling has long shared Sinatra's gift for cutting to the quick and for delivering a lyric in a way that projects vulnerability beneath the poise. All of which is reason to look forward to this tribute, with a quintet that, as the man used to say, is aces: Laurence Hobgood on piano, Brandon Lee on trumpet, Joel Frahm on tenor saxophone, Clark Sommers on bass and Lewis Nash on drums. At 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; $55 to $75, or $25 for 35 and under. (Chinen)
Endangered Species: The Music of Wayne Shorter (Wednesday through April 29) Leading up to a highly anticipated Jazz at Lincoln Center appearance by the saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter (next Friday and April 28), Endangered Species plays a five-night booking featuring his music exclusively. Led by the trumpeter David Weiss, a skilled arranger for large ensembles, the ensemble features Ravi Coltrane and Marcus Strickland on tenor and soprano saxophones and Jeremy Pelt on trumpet, with an ace rhythm section. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $40 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. (Chinen)
- Wayne Escoffery Quintet (Friday and Saturday) On ''The Only Son of One'' (Sunnyside), his ambitious and soulful new album, the tenor saxophonist Wayne Escoffery finds inspiration in his own back story, notably the early childhood in London that preceded a hopeful journey to the United States. He celebrates the album's release with a quintet featuring the pianist Aruan Ortiz, the keyboardist Deron Johnson, the bassist Ricky Rodriguez and the drummer Darrell Green. At 8, 10 and 11:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $30 cover. (Chinen)
- Fund-Raising Concert for Clark Terry (Monday) It's staggering to consider the amount of good will generated by the trumpeter Clark Terry over the course of his 91 years. A prolific recording artist who served time in the Duke Ellington and Count Basie orchestras, among many others, he recently published ''Clark: The Autobiography of Clark Terry'' (University of California Press), a memoir about as vibrant as his career. He also recently underwent major surgery, which is the impetus for this concert, presented by St. Peter's Church and several nonprofit jazz organizations. Produced in part by his wife, Gwen, it will feature dozens of musicians -- like the saxophonists Jimmy Heath and Lou Donaldson, the bassists Ron Carter and Rufus Reid, and the pianists Barry Harris and Mulgrew Miller -- with proceeds going toward his expenses. At 7 p.m., St. Peter's Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, between 53rd and 54th Streets, (212) 935-2200, saintpeters.org; $25 suggested donation at the door or at jazzfoundation.org/clarkterry. (Chinen)
- Kenny Garrett Quintet (Thursday through April 29) Intensity has long been a hallmark for the alto saxophonist Kenny Garrett, and that remains true on ''Seeds From the Underground,'' his new album on the Mack Avenue label. It's a platform for a batch of strong new compositions -- probably Mr. Garrett's most tuneful effort since ''Songbook,'' from 1997 -- and a showcase for the same sort of acoustic postbop band that Mr. Garrett leads here. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
- Jim Hall Quartet (Friday through Sunday) Jim Hall's economical style and harmonic command have made him a quietly imposing hero of jazz guitar -- and, at 81, a certifiable legend. He appears here not only with the sturdy rhythm team of Scott Colley on bass and Joey Baron on drums, but also with a wunderkind, Julian Lage, one of countless younger jazz guitarists to swear by his influence. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592 bluenote.net; $45 cover at tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
Roy Hargrove Quintet (Tuesday through April 29, May 1 through 6) Hard bop has an able-bodied, contemporary ambassador in Roy Hargrove, a trumpeter who manages to inhabit the style without rigidity or stifling nostalgia. He's also a shrewd bandleader with an unfailingly disciplined crew; his roster currently includes the saxophonist Justin Robinson, the pianist Sullivan Fortner, the bassist Ameen Saleem and the drummer Quincy Phillips. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Dick Hyman-Ken Peplowski Duo (Friday and Saturday) Upholding a reverence for jazz tradition and a knack for digital dexterity, Mr. Hyman, a sagacious pianist, teams up with Mr. Peplowski, a perspicacious clarinetist and saxophonist. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)
Jon Irabagon Trio (Friday) The intrepid young saxophonist Jon Irabagon has done some fine work in a trio format, with bass and drums puttering behind him. Here his drummer is Rudy Royston; in lieu of a bassist, there's Sean Wayland, on electric organ. At 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; $12 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
- Rudresh Mahanthappa: Samdhi (Saturday) At heart Mr. Mahanthappa, an alto saxophonist of slashing clarity, has long been a proponent of fusion, at least in the cross-cultural sense of the word. His most recent album, ''Samdhi'' (ACT), evokes another usage, with a driving electro-acoustic band featuring the guitarist David Gilmore and the bassist Rich Brown, who both appear here, along with the drummer Gene Lake and the mridangam player Anantha R. Krishnan. At 10 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $39 to $50. (Chinen)
Now vs. Now / Third World Love (Thursday) This double bill, presented by 92YTriBeCa in conjunction with ''The Checkout,'' a program on WBGO, 88.3 FM, features two bands united in their pursuit of a groove-based jazz globalism. Now vs. Now has Jason Lindner on keyboards, Panagiotis Andreou on bass and vocals and Mark Guiliana on drums; Third World Love consists of the trumpeter Avishai Cohen, the bassist Omer Avital, the pianist Yonatan Avishai and the drummer Daniel Freedman. At 8 p.m., 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, 92ytribeca.org; $12 in advance, $15 day of show. (Chinen)
Linda Oh (Friday and Saturday) Ms. Oh, an ambitious young bassist and composer, presents a commissioned piece for double quartet, though it isn't necessarily billed that way. The core of her group features Greg Ward on alto and soprano saxophones, Sam Harris on piano and Ted Poor on drums; joining them is the dynamic Sirius String Quartet, whose roll call includes jazz-literate musicians like the violinist Gregor Huebner. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, or $10 for members. (Chinen)
- Playing Our Parts: A Benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America (Tuesday) This fourth annual benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America, a nonprofit support organization for jazz musicians, will feature a profusion of talent, including the guitarist John Scofield, the saxophonist Joe Lovano, the pianist Brad Mehldau and the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire. From 7:30 to 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $125, includes a complimentary glass of wine and passed hors d'oeuvres. All proceeds support the Jazz Musicians' Emergency Fund. (Chinen)
Noah Preminger Trio (Saturday) The prepossessing young tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger has worked often with his partners in this trio, who share a penchant for shifting in and out of abstraction while preserving a clear picture. Both musicians -- the guitarist Ben Monder and the drummer Matt Wilson -- are older and more experienced than Mr. Preminger, but they're also selfless accompanists who have backed him well on record and in more than a few concerts like this. At 8 p.m., Church for All Nations, 417 West 57th Street, Clinton, (917) 757-9297, jazzundergroundnyc.com; free. (Chinen)
- Joshua Redman Trio (Friday through Sunday) Joshua Redman has lately put his tenor and soprano saxophone to work in the context of James Farm, a superarticulate postbop quartet, with strong direction from all four of its members. He returns to a more ostensibly hierarchical trio format here, with Gregory Hutchinson on drums and Matt Penman, one of his fellow James Farmers, on bass. The results should be sleek and full of silvery digression. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $30 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
- The Paul Simon Songbook (Friday) The songs of Paul Simon, wry and questioning and musically savvy, provide one hook for this concert program, featuring Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Another hook, naturally, is Mr. Simon himself, performing with the band. Also aboard for good measure is the New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville, who has done fine work with ''Bridge Over Troubled Water.'' At 8 p.m., Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; sold out, but limited tickets may become available. (Chinen)
Esperanza Spalding (Saturday) To call Ms. Spalding the most talked-about jazz musician in a generation seems almost like an understatement, and beside the point: she's a phenomenon in human form, unbound by the usual strictures of style. She's on tour in support of ''Radio Music Society'' (Heads Up International), a crossover pop album that features her vocals front and center, against the rhythmic flutter of her bass playing, mainly on an electric bass guitar, which brings her down to earth a bit. Her band has backup singers and a horn section: a good amount of diversionary firepower, though it's obvious where your attention will be drawn. At 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600, websterhall.com; $40 in advance, $45 day of show. (Chinen)
- 'To Duke, With Love' (Friday) The Duke Ellington Society, a nonprofit organization devoted to the mission of Ellingtonia in all of its forms, presents its annual concert, named after a song by its featured artist, the pianist Barry Harris. As a repertory tribute, it should feature more than the usual resonance, given that Mr. Harris is an inheritor to the Maestro in several respects: his articulate pianism, his enlightened sense of play and his all-around edifying approach to the art. At 8 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $40, or $35 for students. (Chinen)

PERSON: Levon Helm 

HEADLINE: Levon Helm, Drummer and Rough-Throated Singer for the Band, Is Dead at 71

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Levon Helm, who helped to forge a deep-rooted American music as the drummer and singer for the Band, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 71 and lived in Woodstock, N.Y.
His death, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, was from complications of cancer, a spokeswoman for Vanguard Records said. He had recorded several albums for the label.
In Mr. Helm's drumming, muscle, swing, economy and finesse were inseparably merged. His voice held the bluesy, weathered and resilient essence of his Arkansas upbringing in the Mississippi Delta.
Mr. Helm was the American linchpin of the otherwise Canadian group that became Bob Dylan's backup band and then the Band. Its own songs, largely written by the Band's guitarist, Jaime Robbie Robertson, and pianist, Richard Manuel, spring from roadhouse, church, backwoods, river and farm; they are rock-ribbed with history and tradition yet hauntingly surreal. 
After the Band broke up in 1976, Mr. Helm continued to perform at every opportunity, working with a partly reunited Band and leading his own groups. He also acted in films, notably ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' (1980). In the 2000s he became a roots-music patriarch, turning his barn in Woodstock -- which had been a recording studio since 1975 -- into the home of down-home, eclectic concerts called Midnight Rambles, which led to tours and Grammy-winning albums.
Mr. Helm gave his drums a muffled, bottom-heavy sound that placed them in the foundation of the arrangements, and his tom-toms were tuned so that their pitch would bend downward as the tone faded. Mr. Helm didn't call attention to himself. Three bass-drum thumps at the start of one of the Band's anthems, ''The Weight,'' were all that he needed to establish the song's gravity.
His playing served the song. In ''The Shape I'm In,'' he juxtaposed Memphis soul, New Orleans rumba and military tattoo. But while it was tersely responsive to the music, the drumming also had an improvisational feel.
In the Band, lead vocals changed from song to song and sometimes within songs, and harmonies were elaborately communal. But particularly when lyrics turned to myths and tall tales of the American South -- like ''The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,'' ''Ophelia'' and ''Rag Mama Rag'' -- the lead went to Mr. Helm, with his Arkansas twang and a voice that could sound desperate, ornery and amused at the same time.
In a 1984 interview with Modern Drummer magazine, Mr. Helm described the ''right ingredients'' for his work in music and film as ''life and breath, heart and soul.''
Mark Lavon Helm was born on May 26, 1940, in Elaine, Ark., the son of a cotton farmer with land near Turkey Scratch, Ark. In his 1993 autobiography, ''This Wheel's on Fire: Levon Helm and the Story of the Band,'' written with Stephen Davis, Mr. Helm said he was part Chickasaw Indian through his paternal grandmother. He grew up hearing live bluegrass, Delta blues, country and the beginnings of rock 'n' roll; Memphis was just across the river.
His father gave him a guitar when he was 9, and he soon started performing: in a duo with his sister Linda and in a high school rock 'n' roll band, the Jungle Bush Beaters. He also played drums in the Marvell High School band.
Mr. Helm was in 11th grade when the Arkansas-born rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins hired him as a drummer. He traveled with Mr. Hawkins to Canada, where the shows paid better, and Mr. Hawkins settled there and formed a band. Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks played six nights a week in Ontario and had a number of hit singles, like ''Mary Lou.'' They performed on Dick Clark's TV show ''American Bandstand.''
By 1961 Mr. Hawkins had assembled the lineup that would become the Band: Mr. Helm, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Manuel, Rick Danko on bass and Garth Hudson on organ. ''He knew what musicians had the fire,'' Mr. Helm said of Mr. Hawkins. The others had trouble pronouncing Lavon, so Mr. Helm began calling himself Levon.
In 1963, weary of Mr. Hawkins's discipline, the five Hawks started their own bar-band career as Levon and the Hawks. The blues singer John Hammond Jr. heard them in Toronto and brought Mr. Robertson, Mr. Hudson and Mr. Helm into the studio in 1964 to back him on the album ''So Many Roads.''
Bob Dylan had famously brought an electric band to the 1965 Newport Folk Festival, and after its members had made other commitments, he hired Mr. Robertson and Mr. Helm for a summer tour.
At their first rehearsals, Mr. Helm recalled, his reaction to Mr. Dylan was, ''I couldn't believe how many words this guy had in his music, or how he remembered them all.'' Before playing their first show, at Forest Hills Tennis Stadium in Queens, Mr. Dylan told the band, ''Just keep playing, no matter how weird it gets.''
They polarized the audience -- those wanting to hear only Dylan's folk music booed -- and while a subsequent concert at the Hollywood Bowl was better received, another band member, the keyboardist Al Kooper, chose to leave. At that point Mr. Helm told Albert Grossman, Mr. Dylan's manager, ''Take us all, or don't take anybody.'' The Hawks became Mr. Dylan's band.
They backed Mr. Dylan on a studio single, ''Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,'' and toured with him through the fall, still getting booed. Mr. Helm quit the band late in 1965. ''I wasn't made to be booed,'' he wrote.
Mr. Dylan's motorcycle accident in 1966 ended his touring with the Hawks. While he recuperated in Woodstock the Hawks, who were on retainer, rented a big pink house in a neighboring town, West Saugerties, for $125 a month. For most of 1967 the Hawks, with Mr. Manuel playing drums, worked five days a week on music: writing songs with and without Mr. Dylan, playing them at his home and at the house they called Big Pink, and recording them on a two-track tape recorder in the basement. Songs sent to Mr. Dylan's publisher were soon bootlegged.
In the winter of 1967, the band summoned Mr. Helm to rejoin them. With Mr. Manuel on drums, Mr. Helm picked up mandolin, though he would soon return to drums.
Mr. Grossman got the Hawks their own recording contract with Capitol in February 1968, initially as the Crackers, a name Capitol didn't like. There was no band name on the LP label or front cover of ''Music From Big Pink,'' the group's debut album, which simply had a painting by Mr. Dylan as its cover. (The songs had been written at Big Pink but recorded in professional studios.) The LP label listed all the musicians' names, while inside the double-fold cover the musicians were listed under the words ''The Band.'' ''The name of the group is just our Christian names,'' Mr. Robertson insisted in an interview. But the band became the Band.
Released on July 1, 1968, a year after the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' ''Music From Big Pink'' was ''rebelling against the rebellion,'' Mr. Helm wrote. There were no elaborate studio confections, no psychedelic jams, no gimmicks; the music was stately and homespun, with a deliberately old-time tone behind the enigmatic lyrics. Sales were modest, but the album's influence was huge, leading musicians like Eric Clapton and the Grateful Dead back toward concision. The Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.
Adding to its mystique, the Band didn't tour until 1969 because Mr. Danko broke his neck in an auto accident. It made its concert debut as the Band at Winterland in San Francisco in April 1969.
By then, the Band was well into recording its second album, simply titled ''The Band,'' which would include the group's only Top 30 single, ''Up on Cripple Creek.'' The album was universally hailed, and the Band played a summer of huge pop festivals, backing Mr. Dylan at the Isle of Wight and performing in August at Woodstock. In 1970, Mr. Helm and the songwriter Libby Titus had a daughter, Amy Helm, now a member of the band Ollabelle; she survives him, along with his wife since 1981, the former Sandra Dodd, and two grandchildren.
The Band would never match its two initial masterpieces. By the time the group started recording its 1970 album, ''Stage Fright,'' members were drinking heavily and using heroin, and there were disputes over songwriting credits and publishing royalties, of which Mr. Robertson had by far the greatest share. The collaborative spirit of the first two albums was disappearing. But the Band's career had momentum; it produced several more studio albums, toured internationally, and a live album, ''Rock of Ages,'' reached the Top 10 in 1972. In 1973, the Band, the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers were the triple bill for the Watkins Glen festival, which drew 600,000 people to upstate New York -- larger than Woodstock. In 1974, the Band made an album with Mr. Dylan, ''Planet Waves,'' and toured with him. ''The Basement Tapes,'' a collection of songs with and without Mr. Dylan from the Big Pink era, was released in 1975.
In September 1976, Mr. Robertson decided to declare the end of the Band's touring career with a grand finale: ''The Last Waltz,'' an all-star concert at Winterland on Thanksgiving 1976. Recorded for an album, it was also filmed by Martin Scorsese and released under the same title. Mr. Helm hated the film, believing that it glorified Mr. Robertson and slighted the rest of the Band. After ''The Last Waltz,'' the original Band lineup returned to the studio for one last album, the desultory ''Islands,'' which completed its Capitol contract.
Mr. Helm had already embarked on a solo career. He also branched out into acting, playing Loretta Lynn's father in ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' as well as roles in ''The Right Stuff'' and in a television movie with Jane Fonda, ''The Dollmaker.''
But Mr. Helm wanted above all to be a working musician. In the early 1980s he toured with his fellow Band members, minus Mr. Robertson. They were on the road in 1986 when Mr. Manuel committed suicide at 42. But Mr. Helm, Mr. Danko and Mr. Hudson continued to work together as the Band, with additional musicians and songwriters, releasing three albums during the 1990s. Mr. Danko died in 1999 at 55. Meanwhile, Mr. Helm's barn studio became a hub for musicians from Woodstock and beyond, often with Mr. Helm and Mr. Hudson sitting in. Mr. Helm, a heavy smoker, contracted throat cancer in the late 1990s, and for months he could not speak above a whisper. A tumor was removed from his vocal cords, and he underwent 28 radiation treatments. Medical bills threatened him with the loss of his home. Partly to raise money, he began hosting the Midnight Rambles at his barn in 2004. More house parties than concerts, they featured unannounced guest stars and a band of his own that delved into Americana as well as the Band catalog.
His voice strengthened, and the core of his Midnight Ramble bands became a touring and recording group; it performed in 2009 at the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock Festival on its site in Bethel, N.Y., although Mr. Helm was unable to sing that night. Mr. Helm's 2007 and 2009 studio albums, ''Dirt Farmer'' and ''Electric Dirt,'' won Grammy Awards, as did his 2011 ''Ramble at the Ryman,'' recorded live in Nashville and broadcast on PBS.
Nearly to the end, Mr. Helm spent his life on the bandstand. ''If it doesn't come from your heart,'' he wrote, ''music just doesn't work.''

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause for rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707-1857' (through May 6) This exhibition covers the late reign of the rich and powerful Mughals, from whom we derive the word mogul; it tracks their decline, which coincided with the rise of British rule in India. Wall texts describe imperial intrigue and violence, while paintings depict serene landscapes and interiors and exquisitely drawn courtly figures. There are British colonial patrons called ''White Mughals'' because they had Indian families and adopted local customs, and a final section in which the gruesome narrative told in the texts fuses with the images, in the medium of photography, in works like ''Zafar in Captivity,'' which shows the last Mughal emperor as a profoundly defeated man. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Juan Downey: The Invisible Architect' (through May 20) In the wilder moments of his career, Mr. Downey, who died of cancer in 1993 at 53 and is getting his first United States museum retrospective here, reversed the traditional dynamic of sculpture, examining how humans could affect objects rather than the other way around; administered oxygen to pedestrians on the street in New York in ''Fresh Air'' (1972); and cohabitated as a kind of gonzo anthropologist -- or early implementer of art as social practice -- with the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela. Central to his vision, which drew on Frederick Kubler, critical theory and hallucinogenic states of mind, Mr. Downey also developed a concept of ''invisible architecture,'' which he described in 1973 as ''an attitude of total communication within which ultra-developed minds will be telepathically cellular to an electromagnetic whole.'' 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Keith Haring: 1978-1982' (through July 8) Heavy on the party photographs and punk-to-New Wave soundtrack, this show repackages the mythic Haring -- club kid, Warhol protege and maker of friendly street art -- for a younger generation. But other Harings emerge in rarely seen early drawings, collages, journals and, especially, in short performative videos like ''Painting Myself Into a Corner'' and ''Tribute to Gloria Vanderbilt.'' 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Rachel Kneebone: Regarding Rodin' (through Aug. 12) Ms. Kneebone, a British artist, has been invited by the Brooklyn Museum to riff on Rodin and chose 15 works from the museum's permanent collection to show with her own porcelain sculptures. She is drawn to Rodin's maquettes, or the smaller models on which larger sculptures were based. Some works recall wedding cakes and Baroque or Rococo fountains. Chef d'oeuvre of the show, ''The Descent'' (2008), recalls Rodin's ''Gates of Hell'' and is comprised of dozens of little figures descending into a cauldron-shaped pit. That Ms. Kneebone's project is installed in the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art might suggest that you're going to get a feminist flogging of Rodin, but Ms. Kneebone does not head down that path. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (through April 29) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Francesca Woodman' (through June 13) Francesca Woodman, the photographer who at 22 took her own life in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures she made -- mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked -- project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art. Viewing this riveting survey of her sadly abbreviated career, it is hard to shake off the admittedly absurd notion that she was too pure an artist for this muddy world. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion, the work of his competitors and peers, the evolution of tabloid journalism and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Japan Society: 'Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945' (through June 10) This beautiful, surprising and sociologically intriguing exhibition reveals how Japanese artists, designers and craftsmen cultivated their own version of Art Deco, that excruciatingly suave style of art, design and decor that prevailed in Europe and America during the 1920s and '30s. The 200 paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, jewelry, fashion and printed ephemera on display seamlessly blend East and West and old and new. You could almost believe it was the Japanese who invented Art Deco. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Kehinde Wiley / The World Stage: Israel' (through July 29) After earning a master of fine arts at Yale in 2001, Kehinde Wiley began exhibiting his large, figurative oil-on-canvas portraits of young black men in hip-hop apparel. With their emphasis on bright, acid colors and ghetto-fabulous outfits, the paintings borrowed heavily from the work of Barkley Hendricks, although Mr. Wiley's contribution was to push things in a more bombastic direction, hijacking the format of old master portraits. Mr. Wiley's work hasn't changed much over the last decade, although his scope has gone global. This exhibition, which focuses on Ethiopian Israeli Jews, is shown alongside historic paper cuts and textile works he selected from the museum's collection. The result is a fusion of Pattern and Decoration painting with figuration, a mash-up or sampling of historical styles and references. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition' (through July 8) Concluding the Met's series of Byzantine art blockbusters, this show tells the story of the Byzantine Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean, from Syria through Egypt and across North Africa, as it made contact with (and lost ground to) the emerging Islamic world between the seventh and ninth centuries. Loans from Egypt could not be secured, because of the continuing turmoil of the Arab Spring, but important pieces from Jordan, Greece and Georgia are among the show's highlights. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Dawn of Egyptian Art' (through Aug. 5) The predynastic roots of the grand dynastic Egyptian art that we all know and sometimes love are exposed in this sublime, view-changing show. The most riveting and least familiar offerings are a selection of small objects, painted pottery and figures in clay or ivory that date from 3900 to 3100 B.C., quite a few of which are usually on view in the Met's Egyptian galleries. Here they are supplemented by extraordinary outside loans and elegantly displayed in the Robert Lehman Wing. Sometimes it takes an exhibition. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Naked Before the Camera' (through Sept. 9) This resonant, illuminating if sometimes fraught exhibition traces the progress of the naked, mostly female body through photography from its early years nearly to the present with some 90 images, all owned by the Met. In works variously artistic, erotic, scientific, ethnographic, forensic and experimental, we see a medium stretched by human use and imagination. The male gaze is often relentless, but as time passes, individual faces, personalities and relationships come into focus on all sides; consciousness rises and oppressiveness decreases, which is a relief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (through May 20) This lovely small show, focused on self-portrait paintings and prints, proposes that Rembrandt was a greater influence on Degas than has generally been recognized. Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects. But a group of four captivating self-portraits at the heart of the show -- two by each artist painted at age 23 -- suggests that the men were temperamentally about as alike as a cat and a dog. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt at Work: The Great Self-Portrait From Kenwood House' (through May 20) This late, magnificently plain-spoken self-portrait finds the artist in his studio, brush and palette in hand, contemplating his homely visage. Surrounded by, and generally overshadowing, several of the Met's own Rembrandts, it is among the high points of European painting, not the least for the pale background wall where two drawn circles echo, abstractly and much enlarged, the painter's intent gaze. Its emotional gravity and psychic complexity underscore why Rembrandt is often likened to Shakespeare in his epoch-changing grasp of human interiority. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16mm film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped Modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' -- five hand scrolls never before shown together -- is a must-see. And the show's second rotation of fragile treasures is every bit as good as the first, perhaps better, with even more in the way of radiant color and an added demon or two. Return visits are rewarded. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: 'Frances Stark: My Best Thing' (through April 30) ''My Best Thing,'' a 99-minute film that Los Angeles presented at the 2011 Venice Biennale, features digitally animated, childlike figures isolated on green-screen backgrounds. In computer-generated voices, they candidly converse about art, literature and sex to improbably engaging effect. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Dan Flavin: Drawing' (through July 1) The artist Dan Flavin (1933-96) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find that Flavin was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper. The Morgan's show includes drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School and will completely change the way you see his art. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design' (through Aug. 12) From the department of unsolicited advice for aspiring artists: avoid dust, dirt, ashes, soot, smoke, sand, mud and lint, especially if you want to make a statement about life, death, history and the ephemerality of it all. The dangers are well-illustrated in this 25-artist show. While formally various, almost every piece trades on stereotypical associations with the entropic end to which we all are destined. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration' (through July 9) This entertaining little show includes five products of the Surrealist parlor game ''exquisite corpse'' and rustles up other examples of distorted or disjointed figuration from MoMA's permanent collection. There's much here to amuse, provoke and titillate, though the curators don't include more performance-based forms of collaboration. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-2 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props, masks and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Douglas Huebler: 'Crocodile Tears' (through April 28) Works from the 1980s here revolve around a satiric screenplay about the art world called ''Crocodile Tears,'' which the pioneering Conceptualist Mr. Huebler wrote. Several plotlines having to do with money, power and ambition emerge from the mix of photographs, texts, drawings, comics and painted imitations of works by Cezanne, Mondrian and de Chirico. Sadly, the movie was never made. Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Johnson)
'Virginia Overton' (through May 6) Made from detritus scavenged from the Kitchen's basement, Ms. Overton's Post-Minimalist sculptures generate an air of excruciatingly sophisticated decorum. On a squarish wall, a single, 17-foot-long pipe reaches diagonally from one corner to its opposite. Wedged between opposite walls, a set of eight, scuffed, white pedestals seems to levitate. The floor of one room is entirely covered by two-by-four scraps. Viewing these works is like browsing through an issue of Artforum magazine from about 1970. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Johnson)
Public Art
Josephine Meckseper: 'Manhattan Oil Project' (through May 6) Two pristine, full-size oil pumps seemingly toiling away in an empty lot of the theater district are intended to raise alarm about waste and the environment, but mainly they exemplify Surrealist cliche, highlight public sculpture's all-too frequent role as light entertainment and -- highlighted with red on black -- are presentable enough to appear on the Broadway stage, perhaps in an update of ''Oklahoma!'' Eighth Avenue, at 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 966-0193, artproductionfund.org. (Smith)
Out of Town
- 'Colorful Realm: Japanese Bird-and-Flower Paintings by Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800)' (through April 29) This miraculous exhibition presents for the first time outside of Japan all the pieces of a famous suite of scroll paintings that Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) created for a monastery in Kyoto. Three representing enthroned Buddhist deities are comparatively dull, but the 30 depicting flowers, trees, birds, insects, seashells and much more are astoundingly beautiful. Formally virtuosic and magically realistic, they will leave you helplessly enchanted. National Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (through April 29) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Rosenberg)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. 26th Street at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Phillips Collection: 'Snapshot: Painters and Photography, Bonnard to Vuillard' (through May 6) The focus on Bonnard, Vuillard and a few other post-Impressionists -- among the earliest adopters of the hand-held camera -- brings some order to an unwieldy topic: the competitive relationship between painting and photography at the dawn of the 20th century. And throughout this exhibition's more than 200 photographs and 70 paintings, prints and drawings press us to think about our own fast-changing photographic culture. (You wonder what these artists would have done with Instagram.) 1600 21st Street NW, Washington, (202) 387-2151, phillipscollection.org. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
- 'The Brucennial 2012: Harderer. Betterer. Fasterer. Strongerer.' (closes on Friday) Organized by the collective of anonymous artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation, this jampacked, multifloor exhibition displays paintings, sculptures, videos and more by close to 400 artists. A radically inclusive survey of what artists in New York really are doing outside the filtering systems of galleries, museums and curators, it is by turns exhilarating, numbing and depressing. Don't miss it. 159 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, thebrucehighqualityfoundation.com. (Johnson)
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (closes on Sunday) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
'Giverny': E. V. Day and Kembra Pfahler (closes on Tuesday) Few have treated Monet's garden at Giverny as irreverently as the sculptor E. V. Day and the performance artist Kembra Pfaler, known for her signature look: naked body painted in lurid colors, dominatrix boots, Kiss-style makeup and giant mass of teased black hair. Here, Ms. Day's surreal photographs of Ms. Pfaler in costume posing against verdant backdrops at Giverny are displayed in an installation that replicates the garden in miniature, complete with grassy Astroturf, live flowers, gravel paths and a wooden bridge. The Hole Gallery, 312 Bowery, East Village, (212) 466-1100, theholenyc.com. (Johnson)
Paul Graham: 'The Present' (closes on Saturday) This latest series by the British photographer Paul Graham was shot entirely in high-traffic areas of Manhattan (Penn Station, Times Square and 125th Street, among others). Its 16 diptychs and 2 triptychs have a simple premise: They show two or three views of the same intersection, taken seconds apart and from more or less the same angle. People go out of focus or disappear entirely and are replaced by new pedestrians doing pretty much the same thing. Cabs speed by, cellphone conversations end, attentions are diverted and street photography is reinvented for an age of perpetual distraction. The Pace Gallery and Pace/MacGill, 545 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Oded Hirsch: 'nothing new' (closing on Sunday) In the mesmerizing video art of Oded Hirsch, who is now having his first solo exhibition in New York, the communal labors of the kibbutz become haunting performances. In the 10-minute ''50 Blue'' (2009), a young man struggles to push an older man in a wheelchair through a swampy landscape to an elevated viewing platform. And in ''Tochka'' (2010), men in blue shirts and white peasant hats cross a field and set to work on a mysterious construction project, which turns out to be a bridge to nowhere. Thierry Goldberg, 103 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 967-2260, thierrygoldberg.com. (Rosenberg)
- 'Christiane Lohr' (closes on Friday) In her debut, this German artist bends delicate stalks of grass into minuscule arbors, piles ivy seeds into topiary-like mounds and gathers thistle seeds and tree blossoms into luminous clouds. The results of this Minimalist naturalism may rank a little too high on the Faberge scale of exquisite twee-ness, but their ephemeral modesty mitigates. At least momentarily, Ms. Lohr's efforts can take your breath away -- a good thing, too, because they could easily be blown over. Jason McCoy Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 319-1996, jasonmccoyinc.com. (Smith)
Michael Mahalchick: 'It' (closes on Sunday) Fashioned from all kinds of detritus and discarded whatnot, the assemblage wall pieces and sculptures here descend more from Edward Kienholz than Joseph Cornell and were purportedly put together in a performance on the show's opening night. How much planning was involved is anyone's guess, but the success rate varies tremendously. In some instances trash remains trash; in others, it is transformed into something more, and an almost devotional sense of deliberation shines through the veneer of superficial slovenliness. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork.com. (Smith)
Sam Moyer: 'Slack Tide' (closes on Sunday) Sam Moyer's beguiling, expansive pictures oscillate astutely between the sublime and the decorative. Mounted on panels whose dimensions range from about 5 to 10 feet, they resemble much-enlarged, black-and-white, aerial photographs of mountainous topographies, possibly on another planet. They also are like giant, dark photocopies of profusely wrinkled bed sheets. But they are entirely made by hand. Rachel Uffner Gallery, 47 Orchard Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com. (Johnson)
Museum of the City of New York: 'Cecil Beaton: The New York Years' (closes on Sunday) A British dandy in the Wildean mold, Beaton photographed fashion for Vogue and Vanity Fair; made photographic portraits of rich, famous and glamorous people; drew and painted cartoons, caricatures, fashion illustrations and theatrical sets with a deft hand; published six volumes of his diaries; and won two Oscars for his costume and set designs, for the Hollywood movies ''Gigi'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' He spent much time in New York, and this entertaining exhibition surveys what he did here during his five-decade career. Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (closes on Sunday) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Noguchi Museum: 'Civic Action: A Vision for Long Island City' (closes on Sunday) Several artists suggest their visions for the future of Long Island City, ranging from site-specific to silly. Natalie Jeremijenko's ''feral robots'' sniff out pollutants in contaminated soil, and she suggests hula hoops filled with wildflower seeds. Rirkrit Tiravanija proposes growing ''drivable'' grass along a section of Broadway, and Mary Miss focuses on four giant smokestacks that tower over the area and imagines them as an eco-feedback center registering environmental changes visible to the community. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Schwendener)
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Zoe Strauss: Ten Years' (closes on Sunday) In 2001 the artist Zoe Strauss came up with an unusual idea for an exhibition. It would take place under an elevated section of Interstate 95, in her home city, Philadelphia, and would consist of photographs mounted on the columns that supported the highway. It would be a recurring event, appearing yearly over a decade, and would be free and accessible to the public. That series, ''I-95,'' is at the core of ''Zoe Strauss: Ten Years,'' an engaging, parameter-expanding exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and on billboards around the city. In it, the highway links sweeping literary ambition and local interest, lyrical and documentary photography, portraiture and the urban landscape. Benjamin Franklin Parkway and 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Spirit Level' (closes on Saturday) This exhibition takes its title from the device used to ensure that paintings hang evenly on the wall, though its metaphysical wordplay is clear from the outset. Spectral Madonnas painted by the self-taught Swiss artist Hans Scharer (1927-97) guard the foyer of the gallery's 21st Street branch, closing ranks around the viewer. The work at 24th Street is no less spellbinding (though the installation grows dense in places) and includes Ann Craven's paintings of the moon, limned with spiraling strokes of a wide brush, and a phalanx of polymorphous, silver-glazed ceramic vessels by Andrew Lord. Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street and 530 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Frances Stark: 'Osservate, Leggete Con Me' (closes on Saturday) Conversations about art, movies, literature, philosophy and sex and expressions of excitement accompanying simultaneous masturbation -- all transcribed from Skype dialogues between Ms. Stark and anonymous Italian men -- are video projected in two separate rooms, as lines of text accompanied by music. Prepare to be teased. Gavin Brown, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: NEW MUSEUM: 'THE UNGOVERNABLES: 2012 NEW MUSEUM TRIENNIAL': (closes on Sunday) The second edition of this survey of young talent is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light, formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit.

HEADLINE: In a Midmarket Gallery, Imagining a Perfect City

BYLINE: By ANDY WRIGHT. 
awright@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The last time Erick Lyle was part of a huge undertaking on Market Street, he ended up handcuffed in his underwear.
Mr. Lyle, a writer and activist, first arrived in San Francisco in 1993, where he joined a vibrant underground publishing culture and began putting out his own zines. He left briefly and returned in 1997, to the dot-com boom. In 2001, after the bubble had burst, Mr. Lyle and a group of collaborators commandeered an empty building at 949 Market Street. They made art, cooked free food for whoever wanted to eat it and were eventually ejected by the police.
Mr. Lyle's latest project, Streetopia, is a legal and more ambitious version of the 949 Market Street takeover. 
Streetopia began as an art show to complement a book Mr. Lyle was working on about sidewalk etchings in San Francisco, the unauthorized drawings and words carved in wet cement. The book was put on hold after Mr. Lyle's computer was stolen, but the modest show has ballooned into a free multisite event featuring more than 80 artists, lectures, film screenings and workshops. The show, which is running in and around downtown from May 18 through June 23, asks participants to imagine a utopian city.
''The reason I got so ambitious was because I'd never done anything like this before,'' Mr. Lyle said. ''I didn't know how much work it was going to be.''
Streetopia arrives at a time when there is a lot of chatter about the quality of the Central Market neighborhood, a crime-plagued area where vacancy rates are higher than in surrounding neighborhoods. The city has long been promising a Mid-Market revamp, hoping to lure arts organizations to the neighborhood and offering Twitter a tax break to relocate its offices to the area. Grey Area Foundation for the Arts, the Black Rock Arts Foundation and S.F. Camerawork are the most recent additions to the neighborhood.
''What we're talking about with this show is art that will improve the neighborhood instead of creating art for a future imagined neighborhood,'' Mr. Lyle said. ''I think the conversation has to be about what are we doing for the people that are already here.''
Mr. Lyle began organizing the show in earnest about a year and a half ago with Chris Johanson and Kal Spelletich, both artists. The three have been friends for nearly 20 years.
''I suppose we had similar politics and lifestyle. People find each other in that town,'' said Mr. Johanson, who was a high-profile member of San Francisco's Mission School art movement in the 1990s and showed his work at the Whitney Biennial in 2002.
Streetopia's home base is the Luggage Store Gallery, a nonprofit organization that has had a storefront on Market Street since 1991, as well as an annex in the nearby Tenderloin neighborhood. The gallery provides the surrounding community with everything from a restful garden to free clothing repair.
Darryl Smith, co-founder of the gallery, said that at one point he had encouraged Streetopia organizers to look elsewhere. As part of the project, Mr. Lyle and his collaborators plan to build a mini-city within the gallery and a free cafe in the Tenderloin annex, and Mr. Smith wondered if they would have enough space. Mr. Lyle insisted he wanted to work with the gallery, whose history with the neighborhood spanned decades, and Mr. Smith eventually agreed.
''Not to use an overly used term, but the show took on a viral nature,'' Mr. Smith said, ''Someone told another person, and someone told another person.''
The show is partially financed through grants obtained by the gallery but is largely a volunteer effort. Free labor will build the miniature city, local building owners are lending the use of their empty storefronts, and grocers are being called on to donate food to the free (volunteer-staffed) kitchen.
Ivy Jeanne McClelland, a crisis mental health counselor and artist, will be leading free workshops on herbal medicine making as part of Streetopia. She, too, was part of the 949 Market Street squat.
Ms. McClelland said she planned to reach out to downtown residents and tailor her classes to suit their needs.
''I get to see up close just how little to no access to comprehensive health care and preventative medical care affects communities,'' she said. ''What would it look like if we could take health and well-being into our own hands?''
Organizers hope that initiatives like Ms. McClelland's will last beyond the art show. There will be a bread-making workshop, and even a workshop in which participants will be given redwood tree seeds and planting instructions.
''Theoretically,'' Mr. Lyle said, ''there could be a skyline of trees years from now.''
As for what a utopian San Francisco would look like, Mr. Lyle said he did not have the answers.
''This show is not a sci-fi vision where if we build a certain kind of building and have jet packs, everything will be better,'' he said. ''Market Street is a crucible for the vast disparities of wealth being played out in our society right now.''

HEADLINE: Marketing Hotels as Places Full of Fun and Discovery

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
RENAISSANCE, a hotel brand owned by Marriott International, and Revel, a new resort and casino in Atlantic City, are running lifestyle campaigns intended to attract young, hip guests.
To develop these campaigns, the hotels have turned to agencies that specialize in lifestyle advertising. Renaissance hired Anomaly -- an outfit based in New York that is controlled by MDC Partners and has worked with Converse, Budweiser and Diageo -- instead of the New York office of McGarryBowen, an agency that is part of Dentsu and employed by most other Marriott brands. Revel hired Mother New York, which has worked with Stella Artois, Tanqueray and Target, because it wanted ''someone not tied to hospitality, gaming, who would bring a fresh approach,'' said Sid Yu, Revel's senior vice president for brand and revenue.
Marriott, which bought Renaissance in 1997, has done no major advertising for the brand, even though Renaissance now includes 151 four- and five-star hotels in 34 countries -- about 8 percent of all hotel rooms offered by Marriott International's 17 brands. According to Dan Vinh, Renaissance's vice president of marketing, Renaissance hotels aim to offer ''a noncookie-cutter, unique experience, targeting travelers who are looking for more than a place to be productive or get work done. They are stimulated by their environment. They want to experience things.'' 
To cater to these guests, most of whom are traveling for business, Renaissance introduced in 2010 a ''Navigator'' program to provide tips about the hotels' surroundings. Employees designated as navigators -- not necessarily concierges -- are available at the hotels to give advice about local activities. Online information provided by W Cities, an Internet database, has also been available to guests. Beginning May 3, Navigator advice will be available on Renaissance's new Web site and redesigned Facebook and Twitter channels.
In 2010, Renaissance began offering musical events by local and national artists like Bruno Mars and Janelle Monae.
One print ad in the campaign -- whose tag line is ''Live life to discover''-- shows a guest in his room at the Renaissance Paris Arc de Triomphe, and urges readers to ''stop by Carette Patisserie, just a short stroll from the Renaissance,'' for its blackberry macaroons, which are also depicted.
Print ads are to run in the spring and fall issues of American magazines like The New Yorker, Travel & Leisure and Esquire; they will run from June through August in the Asian editions of publications like Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal. Similar ads will appear in airports in China and India and on BBC TV in Asia.
In Europe, Renaissance is running a contest to identify one band to perform as the ''best band in the house'' on the MTV European Music Awards broadcast in November. Renaissance is also promoting the Navigator program on TripAdvisor.
The budget for this campaign is $15 million through December.
Revel, a $2.4 billion, 47-story resort built on 20 acres of beachfront property in Atlantic City, has almost 1,900 guest rooms; 14 restaurants; two theaters; two nightclubs; 10 swimming pools; a 32,000-square-foot spa; and a 130,000-square foot casino. Its soft opening was April 2; it will formally open Memorial Day weekend.
Print advertising is also a main thrust of Revel's campaign, including regional ads in the April issues of magazines like Bon Appetit, ESPN The Magazine and Men's Health, and recent regional ads in newspapers like USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. In addition, the resort recently ran a 20-page insert in Washingtonian, New York and Philadelphia magazines depicting objects representing experiences available at Revel, like dice, a snorkeling mask and goggles, and barbecue tongs. These provide ''a distinct, fun way to get across the different journeys you can have at the resort,'' said Andrew Deitchman, a partner of Mother New York.
A 30-second TV spot, which will run through May in New York and Philadelphia, features buff, often barely clad, young men and women suggestively posing at various places around Revel. Radio advertising is also running through December in Philadelphia and Atlantic City and Monmouth County, N.J.
Mr. Yu said the Revel campaign -- budgeted at $15 million to $20 million -- is directed at the over 40 million potential leisure travelers, age 21 and older, who live within a five-and-one-half-hour drive of Atlantic City. ''We're focusing on lifestyle passions,'' he said, adding that Revel is ''for people who dine and shop in the meatpacking district in New York and care about Fashion Week.''
Andrew Sacks, president of AgencySacks, a New York branding and marketing agency, praised the Renaissance advertising for discussing ''a little patisserie down the street from the hotel'' rather than ''vaguely talking about being local. It makes it believable.''
Mr. Sacks and Henry Harteveldt, co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group, said Revel's campaign was reminiscent of advertising by the Cosmopolitan, a Las Vegas resort that opened in 2010. Both try ''to mix naughtiness and nice, and are emphasizing the lifestyle aspects of a stay,'' Mr. Harteveldt said.
Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, predicted that Revel would ''attract more upscale, affluent visitors'' to Atlantic City, a destination not necessarily favored by such travelers.
''This will be a positive step for Atlantic City, and it will be interesting to see just how positive,'' he said.
On Monday, the Atlantic City Alliance, a new, nonprofit corporation that markets Atlantic City tourism, introduced its own $20 million campaign -- created by Euro RSCG New York, part of Havas--to ''move the area,'' it said, ''beyond a gaming center to a premier, year-round destination.''

HEADLINE: Threat of Credit Downgrade Persists for Morgan Stanley

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley's rebuilding efforts are starting to take hold, as it posted one of its strongest quarters since the financial crisis.
The bank showed healthy gains in core areas like wealth management and equity sales. Bond trading - the great profit machine on Wall Street - also kicked into high gear. In all, first-quarter profit surged 27 percent to $1.4 billion, excluding one-time accounting charges.
The results were proof, chief executive James P. Gorman told analysts during a conference call on Thursday, that Morgan Stanley was ''on the right track.''
But a cloud still looms over the bank: the threat of a credit rating downgrade that could hurt its huge derivatives business. 
The group, which facilitates trading in the complex securities, may lose business and have to come up with billions of extra dollars if Morgan Stanley's credit rating is cut.
Moody's Investors Service, which is considering whether to downgrade 17 large financial companies, said Morgan Stanley's rating could decline by as much as three notches to a level below that of the bank's chief rivals.
Morgan Stanley cannot easily protect itself from this potential blow.
In 2008 at the height of the financial crisis, the investment bank kept its derivative business in its core operations rather than shifting it into a subsidiary that enjoyed greater taxpayer protection and a higher credit rating. If Morgan Stanley had made that move as Goldman Sachs did, a ratings cut would not have the same sting.
Morgan Stanley might not have that option anymore. With the financial system more stable, bank regulators are unlikely to allow Morgan Stanley, or any other bank, to move large parts of its derivatives business into a taxpayer protected subsidiary, where the government could be on the hook for potential losses.
Morgan Stanley has played down the effect of a downgrade, saying only 8 percent of its derivative contracts have rating triggers that could immediately prompt customers to move their business. And, Morgan Stanley notes, clients look at other data, including the bank's ratings by agencies, when picking trading firms.
Mr. Gorman has also been emphasizing that the bank has taken steps in the last three years that should help buoy its credit rating. It has ended or reduced its presence in certain high-risk trading operations and expanded into wealth management, a lower risk business that tends to produce steadier results.
The latest financial results reflect some of the changes.
In the first quarter, Morgan Stanley reported earnings of 71 cents a share, handily beating analysts' estimates. Its institutional securities group, which includes stock and bond trading, reported revenue of $5 billion, excluding the accounting charge. That is up from $3.76 billion a year earlier. Revenues in the global wealth management division, which includes Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, were essentially flat.
Shares of the bank rose 2.3 percent on Thursday to close at $18.07.
''We have done a lot to narrow the impact of any potential ratings change,'' Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley's chief financial officer, said during the conference call. Despite significant improvements, Morgan Stanley executives still face questions about the threat of a downgrade, and how it affects business. A big concern is the derivatives book, which is the third largest among American banks, according to figures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
Derivatives are big business on Wall Street. Banks, pension funds and other big investors use them to bet on the direction of stocks, bonds, interest rates and commodities.
Those customers pay close attention to the credit rating of the bank executing the derivatives trades, because they need to be certain the bank can pay what it owes. If a bank loses its credit rating, clients may opt to move their business elsewhere. Or they could demand the that bank post more cash to back its derivatives trades. Either can be costly.
''Definitely, Morgan Stanley's credit rating is a pressing issue for the bank right now,'' said Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with the brokerage firm CLSA Asia Pacific Markets.
Morgan Stanley's derivatives business is even more vulnerable than those of its rivals. In the financial crisis in 2008, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs converted to bank holding companies. While the designation came with added regulation, it also allowed the companies to take advantage of the government's bailout funds and other perks.
A few months later, the Federal Reserve exempted Goldman from a rule intended to stop a financial company from using a deposit-taking bank subsidiary with taxpayer backing to support other parts of the company.
With the waiver, Goldman was able to move much of its derivatives business into an insured bank, where it remains. Normally, a strict limit on the size of such transfers would have prevented Goldman from making the shift.
Goldman now warehouses $44 trillion of its derivatives - 92 percent - in that subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA, according to figures from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The credit rating on the insured bank is one notch higher than on Goldman's parent company because the subsidiary has the backing of the government.
Morgan did not make the same choice. While it received the exemption from the Fed, it mainly shifted other types of assets into its insured bank. Ms. Porat said Morgan Stanley had been slowly moving derivatives into the insured bank. But only 3 percent of Morgan Stanley's $52 trillion of derivatives are at Morgan Stanley Bank N.A., the insured subsidiary.
''It really surprises me that Morgan Stanley didn't move all its derivatives into the bank,'' said Saule T. Omarova, a professor at University of North Carolina School of Law who has written about exemptions the Fed granted to banks in the crisis.
Morgan Stanley declined to explain why it did not shift its derivatives like Goldman.
The bank does not have many options now. It could move a large amount of derivatives into a higher-rated nonbank affiliate. But it probably would need to raise or transfer a lot of capital to support the rating of the subsidiary, which would be costly.
If Morgan Stanley asked the Fed for an exemption to shift the derivatives into the government- insured bank, Morgan Stanley might meet with resistance from regulators and lawmakers.
Last October, several members of Congress wrote to bank regulators to express their concern that Bank of America had moved derivatives from its Merrill Lynch subsidiary into an insured bank.
While the Fed did not mention any specifics about Bank of America in its response a month later, it highlighted the rule that caps the amount of business that can be transferred into, or transacted with, an insured bank. The transferred business is not permitted to exceed 20 percent of the insured bank's capital.
That cap could severely limit how much business Morgan Stanley could move.
Its insured bank had $8.8 billion of capital at the end of 2011, according to a regulatory filing, and 20 percent of that is $1.76 billion. That sum probably would be exceeded if Morgan Stanley transferred a large part of its derivative business, given the size of its book.
The overhaul of financial regulation makes it even harder for banks to move large amounts of derivatives.
Part of the Dodd-Frank legislation, effective in July, allows the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a bank regulator, to deny a transfer, even if the Fed approves one. And even if both regulators give waivers, a bank could face scrutiny from Congress.
''We passed Wall Street reform to equip regulators with the tools they need to protect American taxpayers and ensure the soundness of our financial system,'' said SenatorSherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, who was behind the letters sent to regulators in October about the Bank of America derivatives transfers.
''If the very agencies charged with preventing unnecessary risk in our financial systems are approving huge exemptions, I'm committed to addressing that.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
9 P.M. (CMT) JENNIE GARTH: A LITTLE BIT COUNTRY More than 20 years ago Jennie Garth (above with her daughters Fiona, left, and Lola) left rural Illinois for Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. The result was a role as Kelly Taylor in the hit series ''Beverly Hills, 90210.'' Now she has decided to return to her roots by moving her three daughters and her personal assistant to a seven-acre farm north of Santa Barbara. But the simple life isn't always as easy as it appears. ''Melissa & Tye,'' at 9:30, follows the former ''Bachelorette'' Melissa Rycroft and her husband, Tye Strickland, as they navigate a long-distance relationship between Dallas and Los Angeles. These two new series are ushered in by the Season 5 premiere of ''Singing Bee,'' at 8. 
9 A.M. (Nickelodeon) MAX & RUBY The bunny siblings Max and Ruby and other characters in this network's preschool series, including those from ''Franklin and Friends,'' ''Fresh Beat Band'' and ''The Penguins of Madagascar,'' pay tribute to Earth Day on Sunday. Between the shows, Victoria Justice and Leon Thomas III of ''Victorious'' will offer tips on things children can do to help the environment.
5:20 P.M. (MoreMax) BLACK SWAN (2010) Natalie Portman, below, in the role that earned her an Academy Award, stars as Nina, a ballet dancer teetering on the verge of insanity as she tries to break out of the corps and into the dual lead of ''Swan Lake'': the Swan Queen and her villainous black swan twin. Mila Kunis is Lily, the sultry newcomer who is everything the increasingly tormented Nina is not, as their company's artistic director, Thomas (Vincent Cassel), insists on pointing out. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mother, a former dancer who desperately wants her daughter to achieve everything she never could. The result is ''a witchy brew of madness and cunning,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times about this film from Darren Aronofsky, which also received Oscar nominations for best director, best picture and others.
6 P.M. (HBO) SOMETHING THE LORD MADE (2004) In this adaptation of a true story, Alan Rickman plays Dr. Alfred Blalock, who pioneered open-heart surgery. Mos Def is Vivien Thomas, a janitor who became Dr. Blalock's technician and, as a black man in the Depression-era South, saw his medical insights go largely uncredited. The movie ''is supposed to be an uplifting tear-jerker about two men who defy racism to accomplish miracles,'' Virginia Heffernan wrote in The Times. ''Fortunately, it's much, much better than that.''
7 P.M. (GSN) $25,000 PYRAMID During five hours of episodes the Game Show Network honors Dick Clark, a former host of the show.
7:30 P.M. (BET); 8 P.M. (Centric) I AM TRAYVON: A FAMILY'S FIGHT FOR JUSTICE ''BET News'' follows the family members of Trayvon Martin as they campaign for justice and inspire a national movement. Emmett Miller, the show's host, also looks at developments in the case.

In ''Real Time With Bill Maher,'' at 10, Todd G. Buchholz, an economist and the author of ''Rush: Why You Need and Love the Rat Race''; Thomas Frank, a journalist and the author of ''Pity the Billionaire''; and Chrystia Freeland, the editor of Thomson Reuters Digital, are seated at the round table. Ross Douthat, a columnist for The Times and the author of ''Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics,'' is interviewed.
10 P.M. (ABC) STRANGE ARRANGEMENTS: THE NEW SEX ''20/20'' looks at nontraditional sexual behavior; Elizabeth Vargas interviews E. L. James, the author of ''Fifty Shades of Grey.''
10 P.M. (NBC) DATELINE NBC Amy Robach reports on the case of Besham Sugrim, who was sentenced on April 9 to life in prison without chance of parole for the 2003 murder of Linda Kay Gibson, a prostitute. Ms. Robach also interviews Mr. Sugrim's wife, Bernadette. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: Ann Romney's 'Choice'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Phony Mommy Wars,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, April 18): 
Ann Romney's statement that she made a ''choice'' to stay home and raise five boys highlights the Romneys' insensitivity to the plight of 21st-century families.
Mrs. Romney's ''choice'' is a fantasy for most mothers. Most mothers have fewer choices than Ann Romney regarding working outside the home versus taking care of the children. Instead, they struggle with other choices -- like whether to buy food or medicine, clothes or gas, or whether to pay college tuition or the rent/mortgage.
We do not need to wait to see if the Romneys ''can relate to the economic problems of regular people,'' as Ms. Dowd puts it. We already know the answer to that question. The answer is a resounding no.
DIANE GOLDSTEIN TEMKIN New York, April 18, 2012
To the Editor:
I wish there had been no reaction to Hilary Rosen's comments. It would prove what I believe many of us feel: the debate is trite, irrelevant and way past its sell-by date.
No mother knows the fine detail of the life another mother faces each morning. We aren't entitled to judge one another. It's a waste, too, of the energy we could use to cheer one another on.

HEADLINE: Hiccup in Most Important Meal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Daniel Krieger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is an innovative, intuitive and increasingly common way to ensure that food reaches the mouths of hungry children from low-income families: give out free breakfast in the classroom at the start of each school day.
The results, seen at urban districts across the country, are striking. Without the stigma of a trip to the cafeteria, the number of students in Newark who eat breakfast in school has tripled. Absenteeism has fallen in Los Angeles, and officials in Chicago say children from low-income families are eating healthier meals, more often.
But New York City, a leader in public health reform, has balked at expanding the approach in its own schools, and City Hall is citing a surprising concern: that all those classroom Cheerios and cheese sticks could lead to more obesity. 
Some children, it turns out, may be double-dipping.
The city's health department hit the pause button after a study found that the Breakfast in the Classroom program, now used in 381 of the city's 1,750 schools, was problematic because some children might be ''inadvertently taking in excess calories by eating in multiple locations'' -- in other words, having a meal at home, or snacking on the way to school, then eating again in school.
But this week, the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, pushed back against those claims, joining children's advocacy groups in demanding that New York follow other cities in making in-classroom breakfast available at many more schools with children from low-income families. They say hunger and poor nutrition are serious problems in a city where more than a quarter of residents under 18 are below the poverty line.
The breakfast battle echoes a national debate over the nutritional content of free and reduced-price school meals, a favored cause of the first lady, Michelle Obama. And the standoff leaves New York City's policymakers in an uneasy place: trying to tackle children's hunger while combating what has seemingly become a national epidemic of childhood obesity.
''They are both incredibly important, and so you have to constantly be in search of solutions where you can succeed in both, without disadvantaging the other,'' said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services. She noted that about 40 percent of New York's elementary- and middle-school students were considered overweight or obese.
Outside Public School 180 in Harlem, one of the schools that offer breakfast in classrooms, several parents expressed surprise on Thursday that their children might be eating two morning meals. Abraham El Bey said his son, Noah, 8, usually eats breakfast at home, but Noah immediately volunteered that he ate breakfast at school, too.
''You can't tell a kid, 'No, you can't have it,' '' Mr. El Bey said with a shrug. ''They need the fuel. I'm in favor of a child being able to eat in school.''
But Anne Morrison, whose son, Jude, 5, attends the same school, said she had adjusted what she fed him at home, knowing he would eat again at school.
''At school, it's usually a muffin, a cheese stick and juice,'' she said, adding, ''I'm not so happy about the juice.''
New York offers breakfast at all its school cafeterias, but children generally have to show up before school starts to eat, and some are embarrassed to come forward for the free meal. When breakfast is served in the classroom, educators say, there is less stigma attached to it, and many more children accept it.
The concept of serving breakfast in the classroom, rather than in the cafeteria before the start of the school day, has gained traction in the past decade among educators and nutrition experts. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced New York City's version of the program in 2008, as one of a series of measures intended to help poorer New Yorkers weather the impact of the then-new recession.
The Education Department assigned a staff member to coordinate the program and promote its benefits to principals around the city. The city chose the initial schools based on interest from a principal and a high percentage of students who qualified for free and reduced-price meals. Breakfasts can include yogurt, honey graham crackers and cinnamon-raisin bagels.
Since then, however, the coordinator has moved to a new position and the post has remained unfilled. There are no current plans to expand the program to additional schools.
Last year, when the City Council asked why the program had stalled, city officials cited the obesity risks uncovered by the health department study, which looked at the experience of elementary school students in 2010. More students were eating breakfast under the program, the study concluded, but about 21 percent of students were possibly eating two breakfasts.
In a letter to the city mailed this week, Ms. Quinn attacked the study's methodology, saying it counted small items, like a slice of toast or a piece of a candy, as a wholly additional breakfast, and noted that it advocated further evaluation, not a halt to the program's expansion. ''While the prevention of obesity and diet-related disease is extremely important, it cannot be achieved at the expense of hungry children,'' Ms. Quinn wrote.
Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, described the report in blunter terms. ''It's like you're studying chemotherapy, and your only research question is whether it produces nausea, not whether it prevents recurrence of cancer,'' said Mr. Berg, who dismissed the findings as ''cockamamie.''
Ms. Gibbs, the deputy mayor, defended the study and its methodology, saying that it had used nationally accepted research methods and that no other group had produced a comparable analysis. ''Nobody else, quite frankly, has the quality of information that we produced,'' she said. She said the city was continuing to monitor the current program.
Other cities that have adopted the approach do not report major issues with obesity. To prevent double-dipping, the Newark public schools, which rolled out citywide classroom breakfasts in 2005, have a large outreach effort to ensure parents know about the free breakfasts and what will be on the menu.
J. Michael Murphy, a psychology professor at Harvard Medical School who has studied free classroom breakfasts, said that he considered obesity to be only a minor concern with such programs. But he conceded that well-meaning policymakers, trying to feed as many children as possible, could face a dilemma.
''What are you going to do?'' Dr. Murphy asked. ''Have a scale and say you can't have the free breakfast because you're already overweight?''

HEADLINE: Drug War on Doorsteps All Over Ciudad Juarez

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Charlie Minn's documentary ''Murder Capital of the World'' is a briskly paced, pessimistic examination of the drug war that has ravaged Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, since 2008. The statistics speak for themselves. The number of murders in this border city of over one million residents skyrocketed from 44 in 1990 to more than 3,000 in 2010, according to the film. 
The total dipped a little in 2011 after the arrival of a tough new police chief, Julian Leyzaola, whose military tactics have made some headway, but his critics assert that he ignores human rights and uses torture to extract confessions. The crime wave is still so overwhelming that 95 percent of the murders in Juarez are not investigated.
Heartbreaking stories of families who have lost loved ones alternate with the voices of experts from academia, law enforcement and politics who give their views on the causes of the crisis. All seem to agree that widespread poverty and a lack of opportunity are at the root of it. A counterculture that glorifies gang leaders as role models has grown, even though a job working for a cartel is probably a death sentence.
As Charles Bowden, the author of ''Murder City: Ciudad Juarez and the Global Economy's New Killing Fields'' and the most outspoken commentator, observes bitterly, ''The poor bastards are being ground up by a society that doesn't care about them since the day they were born.'' Kidnappings, rampant extortion and drug-related murders have driven many small business out of the city.
Because much of the heavy weaponry wielded by the cartels comes from the United States, which is a major destination of the drugs passing through Juarez, American policy is sharply criticized.
Besides Mr. Bowden, who shares a despairing cynicism about Mexico's future, the most outraged individual in the film is the Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, whose son was killed by drug traffickers. He is heard challenging President Felipe Calderon of Mexico to redirect his resources from fighting the cartels to strengthening the country's youth and social services programs.
Murder Capital of the World
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Produced and directed by Charlie Minn; edited by Yota Matsuo and Aaron Michael Thomas; music by Kyle Hildenbrand; designed by Sal Lomedico. In Manhattan at the AMC Empire 25, 234 West 42nd Street. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Profit Drops Despite Rise In Assets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Business for private equity firms may be improving, but it was not enough to lift the Blackstone Group's first-quarter profit.
The investment titan on Thursday reported a 24 percent drop in earnings from a year ago, as its holdings grew at a slower rate. That is despite its stores of investor capital jumping 27 percent, to a record high of $190 billion. 
Blackstone's results highlight the dilemma currently confronting private equity firms. Such shops have not posted the outsize growth that made their names and fortunes. And yet they continue to draw money from limited partners casting about for sorely needed higher yields.
''Over all, we're seeing more money going to alternatives,'' Hamilton E. James, Blackstone's president, said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. ''But it's pretty tough for private equity in general today.''
Shares in Blackstone tumbled 4.7 percent on Thursday, to $14.14.
Thursday's results could set the tone for earnings results from other alternative asset managers, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which is scheduled to report next week.
Blackstone's profit, reported as economic net income after taxes, amounted to $432.3 million for the quarter. That figure includes unrealized gains from investments, and is considered by the private equity industry to be an accurate reflection of a firm's profitability. Its earnings of 39 cents a share fell short of the 40 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Based on generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone reported a gain of $58.3 million for the quarter, up 37 percent. On that basis, revenue fell during the quarter to $952 million, from $1.2 billion in the same quarter a year ago.
Blackstone officials attributed their troubles to continued economic uncertainty in the United States and in Europe, as well as political flare-ups around the world. All have contributed to what Mr. James said was a reality that fell short of the stock markets' gains in recent months.
Still, Blackstone has continued to benefit from a robust debt market with easy access to the financing that underpins its private equity and real estate investments. But executives added ruefully that easy money has made deals more expensive, as buyers are compelled to pay more for their acquisitions.
The firm said that it still saw opportunities for investment, and that it had ample ammunition to invest, with $37.8 billion in ''dry powder,'' or uninvested capital, at the end of the quarter.
While Blackstone's core private equity and real estate divisions reported drops in revenue, its other business showed improvement. Its hedge fund and debt investment arms grew by double digits, while its advisory unit benefited from an increase in merger and restructuring assignments.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: State Tax Collections Surpass 2007 Peak

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
State tax collections, which during the recession experienced their steepest and longest drop since at least the Great Depression, have been climbing back for the last two years and finally surpassed their previous peaks as 2011 drew to a close, according to a report issued on Thursday. 
The total amount of tax revenue collected by the states was 3 percent higher than it was during the last quarter of 2007, when the recession hit, according to the report, by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, in Albany. But the recovery has been uneven: 17 states collected less in taxes in the last quarter of 2011 than they did four years earlier.
Surpassing the 2007 peak in collections was an important milestone for the states, which have struggled mightily to balance their budgets in recent years. But huge challenges remain, as their populations and the cost of providing services have continued to rise, and the growth in tax collections has begun to soften.
''You could say that the glass is half-full, but we have to be aware that the glass is still half-empty, and states still have a long way to go before full recovery,'' said Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the institute, who wrote the report.
The outlook varied by region. The Plains region had the biggest gains, with states there collecting 12.5 percent more in taxes in the last quarter of 2011 than they did during the same period a year earlier, followed by the Great Lakes region, which had an increase of 8.9 percent.
The only region that had a decline was the Far West, which had a 3.9 percent decrease, driven by an 8.3 percent decline in California, where several temporary tax increases lapsed.
While the outlook for states has improved, local governments continue to struggle as property tax collections are hurt by declines in home values. The report warned that ''services and functions that are largely funded by local governments, such as education and public safety, are likely to be under severe fiscal pressures for some time if current trends continue.''
Even as tax collections climb back, states are a long way from providing the kinds of services that they did before the recession, according to another report issued on Thursday, by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research and advocacy group based in Washington.
That report found that states have made $290 billion in spending cuts over the last five years -- nearly three times what they raised through tax increases -- and that state and local governments have shed more than 600,000 jobs since the recession began.
These cuts, in addition to payment reductions to vendors and nonprofit organizations, have put a drag on the nation's economic recovery.
''There are long-term effects as well,'' the report by the center warned.
''By diminishing the quality of elementary and high schools, making college less affordable and reducing residents' access to health care, the cuts threaten to make the U.S. economy less competitive in coming decades,'' it said.

HEADLINE: Lynas Answers Critics Of Its Rare Earth Plant

BYLINE: By LIZ GOOCH and KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
KUANTAN, MALAYSIA -- The Australian company building a rare earth refinery in Malaysia sought to counter critics who are concerned that the plant could pose radioactive hazards, laying out detailed responses on Thursday that it said refuted the many ''false allegations'' made about the plant.
The company, Lynas, said the first phase of its project would be ready to open in two weeks. But it is unclear when the plant will begin operations, as the Malaysian government has withheld the company's temporary operating license while it hears appeals from people opposed to the facility. 
The plant, which has been plagued by delays and protests by residents worried about possible health and environmental risks, is designed to help break China's stranglehold on the production of rare earths. Another project is under construction in the California desert near Death Valley.
China mines and processes more than 90 percent of the world's current supply of rare earths, minerals that are used for a wide range of high-technology products, including smartphones, smart bombs and electric cars. They are found in nature with radioactive contaminants that must be separated and disposed of during refining.
Lynas says its ore, mined in the Australian desert, has a lower concentration of these contaminants than many rare earth deposits elsewhere.
On Thursday, journalists were given a rare glimpse inside the plant, and Mashal Ahmad, managing director of Lynas Malaysia, offered a detailed presentation intended to answer more than 20 allegations, many relating to the safety of the plant and the radiation expected to be produced.
Mr. Mashal said the company had carried out testing to ensure that the plant met international safety standards and that the waste produced in the refining process would be well within the levels considered safe. He said an air monitoring system had been installed on the site and that the results would be available online. ''We have nothing to hide,'' he repeatedly said.
Responding to critics who have asked why Lynas was not building the plant in Australia, Mr. Mashal said the company had received a license to build a plant in Perth but had decided to come to Malaysia for economic reasons.
The company had planned to complete the plant by last September, but it was confounded by construction delays.
A person familiar with the project, who requested anonymity because of the controversy associated with it, said Wednesday that electrical wiring at the project had still not been completed.
Part of the problem is that some components were ordered late and could not be manufactured quickly, the person said, although Lynas has denied that. It would be very difficult, although not impossible, to run the refinery while continuing to install further wiring.
The plant has received a temporary operating license from the Malaysian Atomic Energy Licensing Board, but activists are calling for the license to be revoked. Maximus Ongkili, the science, technology and innovation minister, heard an appeal Tuesday by applicants who want the government to withdraw the company's permit.
In a statement released after the meeting, the ministry said Mr. Ongkili would study the documents submitted and weigh the applicants' arguments. ''He will also consult related experts and authorities before making a decision on the appeal as soon as possible,'' the statement read.
The Kuala Lumpur High Court had previously dismissed an application by 10 residents seeking judicial review of the temporary license. The judge ruled that it would be premature for them to do so when they could still appeal to the minister.
Mr. Mashal, the Lynas Malaysia managing director, said he had not received any indication from the government when a decision would be made on the license. He said further delays would have a ''serious commercial impact'' on Lynas, its suppliers and its customers.
He added: ''I have every confidence the country, the government, the people, the authorities will respect the rule that has been established, the rules that make us want to come and invest in this country.''
The plant has also encountered strong resistance from the Malaysian political opposition, which announced last month that it would boycott a parliamentary committee set up by the government to investigate public concerns about the safety of the project.
Critics have derided the committee, which was intended to be bipartisan, as an attempt to ''whitewash'' concerns about the plant before elections that are widely expected to be held in June.
Tan Bun Teet, who is involved in the appeal to the minister and is the chairman of the lobbying group Save Malaysia Stop Lynas, said the government should withdraw the company's license. ''We will take court action if the minister does not revoke the license,'' he said.
In February, activists held demonstrations in several Malaysian cities, including Kuantan and Kuala Lumpur. They are planning another protest in the capital April 28.
Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, Three Planned Parenthood Branches Fight Back by Merging

BYLINE: By EMILY RAMSHAW. 
eramshaw@texastribune.org

 BODY:
ADDISON -- Texas Planned Parenthood advocates have been outspoken about the hits they have taken from state lawmakers in the last year -- including major cuts to family-planning financing, a new abortion sonogram law and being kicked out of a Medicaid health program for poor women.
They have been far quieter about one of their plans to fight back: merging three regional Planned Parenthood branches (North Texas, Austin and Waco) into one $29 million-per-year, 26-clinic mega-organization. 
The merger -- approved by all three boards Wednesday -- will create Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, the eighth-largest affiliate of the nation's most ubiquitous reproductive health and abortion provider.
Publicly, Planned Parenthood leaders say the merger, which has been under discussion since 2009, is about creating a leaner, more efficient organization, especially in the face of reductions in state and federal financing. Less brazenly, they suggest that joining forces is the best way to defend against an onslaught of anti-abortion legislation -- and to connect the fund-raising powerhouses concentrated in North Texas with endangered clinics throughout the 58,000-square-mile region and beyond.
''For us, it's a strategic merger, an opportunity to pull together three very strong operations into one,'' said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the Waco-born daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards. ''It will help on the advocacy side and, more important, on the health care delivery side.''
Mergers of affiliates are nothing new. In 2006, Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas teamed with Planned Parenthood Louisiana to form Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which operates 13 health centers across two states.
What sets Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas apart is its size, in both geography and scope. Its reach will extend from southern Austin up to Denton, from Tyler in East Texas west to Fort Worth. In 2013, its 26 clinics -- four will provide abortions -- expect an estimated 180,000 patient visits. They will provide birth control for 103,000 people, perform 8,500 abortions and screen tens of thousands of women for breast and cervical cancer and sexually transmitted infections, Planned Parenthood officials said.
''We will be a $30 million organization with no debt and reserves. I believe we will be able to raise even more with a balance sheet that strong,'' said Ken Lambrecht, the current head of Planned Parenthood of North Texas, who will be the Dallas-based president and chief executive of the new operation when the merger takes effect in September. ''Already, funders are lining up, recognizing this new strength we bring to the table, to help us weather the storm.''
Texas abortion opponents call the merger a sign that the organization is scrambling to maintain its reputation in the face of targeted budget cuts. In 2011, the three Planned Parenthood branches that are now merging received more than $5 million combined from the state family-planning budget; in 2013, they expect no money.
''They are desperate to stay relevant, to keep up their false image of being a valid women's health provider,'' said Elizabeth Graham, director of Texas Right to Life.
''They are still fighting to get their money back, to keep their hands in the pockets of taxpayers,'' she added. ''How much money do you need to run an abortion industry?''
Planned Parenthood officials acknowledge that they have been hit hard. Though none of their clinics that received public financing performed abortions, Republican lawmakers still slashed Texas' family-planning budget in the last legislative session, meaning millions of dollars in cuts to Planned Parenthood.
''The Texas Legislature has overwhelmingly spoken in support of life, creating laws to help prevent tax money from supporting abortion providers and their affiliates,'' Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry, said in a statement.
These clinics are poised to lose more money -- up to $3 million in North Texas alone -- in the coming months as the state begins enforcing a rule banning Planned Parenthood clinics from a five-year-old contraception and cancer-screening program, even though clinics that participated were prohibited from performing abortions. Planned Parenthood branches have closed a dozen clinics statewide since the cuts took effect.
Yet this week's merger vote creates a regional branch that looks robust. Mr. Lambrecht said all three branches are healthy. They have been around for roughly 75 years, they do not have debt, they have cash reserves, and they own many of their buildings across the region. With headquarters in Dallas, the new organization taps into North Texas' old-money fund-raising families, including some prominent Republican women who have maintained their allegiance to Planned Parenthood.
The merged organization, budgeting for roughly $24.5 million in private donations, fund-raising events and client fees in 2013, is already rolling out the latest in electronic health records technology. And it absorbs the fruits of the North Texas branch's recent five-year capital campaign, including an Addison health center that tripled in size with a recent relocation and a new $6.5 million health care clinic, administrative facility and abortion clinic under construction in Fort Worth.
Mr. Lambrecht said he hopes the merger means the state's six Planned Parenthood branches could form an even closer partnership to prevent future clinic closings.
''Planned Parenthood has served proudly in the state of Texas for 75 years, and we'll be here for 75 years more,'' he said. ''We stand resolute. We're not going anywhere.''
Although Mr. Lambrecht said the size of Texas made it unlikely that all six branches would someday become one, future mergers would not surprise him. Melaney Linton, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said there were never serious conversations about her organization joining the North and Central Texas merger, but ''who knows'' what the future will hold.
''If we can reduce administrative costs and improve economies of scale, then we can provide more health services to more women and families,'' she said. ''Clients don't care if you're Planned Parenthood of XYZ or ABC. They just want you to be there for them.''

HEADLINE: Tax Benefit In Asset Sale Lifts Profit At Times Co.

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
The New York Times Company reported a large gain in first-quarter net income on Thursday, driven mainly by the sale of its regional newspapers, the sale of part of its stake in a New England sports group and an increase in circulation revenue at its flagship newspaper.
Net income for the quarter was $42.1 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $5.4 million, or 4 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Nearly 70 percent of the company's net income in the quarter came from the sale of its Regional Media Group, which yielded the company a large tax benefit. 
Despite gains in paid digital subscriptions at the company's largest newspapers, first-quarter operating profit declined 24.3 percent, dragged down by an 8.1 percent drop in advertising revenue. Income from continuing operations was $13 million, or 9 cents a share, up from $2.3 million, or 2 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, exceeding Wall Street's expectations.
Total revenue declined 0.3 percent, to $499.4 million.
Total print advertising revenue decreased 7.2 percent, while digital advertising revenue fell 10.3 percent, largely because of continued weakness in cost-per-click and display ads at the company's About Group. Revenue at the About Group fell 23.1 percent.
At the company's News Media Group, which includes The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune, revenue increased 1.3 percent, buoyed by higher circulation revenue.
Print advertising declined 7.2 percent and digital advertising revenue fell 2.3 percent in the group, driven in part by continued softness in real estate-related classified ads and national display ads. The company said that digital advertising revenue fell at The New York Times Media Group, which includes the flagship newspaper and The International Herald Tribune.
''The uneven U.S. economic environment and uncertain global conditions continued to present challenges to the advertising marketplace,'' Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Times Company, said in a statement.
Mr. Sulzberger stood by the company's strategy of expanding its print newspaper assets into subscription-based digital entities. ''Our readers have embraced our digital strategy, which has provided a successful model for the industry,'' he said.
Paid subscribers to the Web site, e-reader and other digital editions of The Times and The International Herald Tribune reached about 454,000 as of March 18, up 16 percent from the end of the fourth quarter of 2011. Paid subscriptions to The Boston Globe's e-reader and replica editions and BostonGlobe.com were up 13 percent, to about 18,000.
But those gains have come as newspapers across the country continue to experience declines in advertising revenue, while network television advertising continues to rebound. According to the Newspaper Association of America, advertising revenue industrywide was down 9.2 percent in 2011, an improvement from the 28.6 percent drop in 2009 but still far below prerecession levels.
The company continues searching for a chief executive to succeed Janet L. Robinson, who left late last year after seven years in the post. Ms. Robinson's total compensation package when she left in December was about $24 million, according to the Times Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Those costs did not factor into the company's first-quarter results.
In a conference call with analysts and reporters on Thursday, Mr. Sulzberger said the company had hired the executive search firm Spencer Stuart to look for a replacement for Ms. Robinson, both inside and outside the company.
''We will take the time necessary to find the right person,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. He said he had no plans to continue doing the job himself, adding, ''I have no doubt that we will find the right candidate, and I'm looking forward to that.''

HEADLINE: After Improvements, Home Sales And Hiring Turn a Little Sluggish

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Momentum in hiring and home sales appears to be slowing, according to data released on Thursday.
The average number of people seeking unemployment benefits over the last month is at a three-month high. And fewer Americans bought previously owned homes in March after mild weather helped lift sales in the previous two months. 
The Labor Department reported that weekly applications declined by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 386,000. That was only after the department raised the previous week's data to show that 8,000 more people had applied for benefits than first estimated.
The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose last week by 5,500, to 374,750. That is the highest level in three months, although it is still 9 percent lower than the level from September.
Unemployment benefit applications have started to tick up in recent weeks after months of steady declines. When applications fall below 375,000, it generally suggests hiring will be strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
Home sales have also lost some vitality from the start of the year.
The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes fell 2.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.48 million. That is down from a revised 4.6 million sold in February.
In healthier markets, sales typically are closer to 6 million.
Two other reports Thursday suggested modest growth in the coming months.
The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said that manufacturing output in the mid-Atlantic region slowed a bit from the previous month. Its general economic index decreased to 8.5, the lowest level since January, from 12.5 in March.
Finally, the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators rose 0.3 percent in March after a 0.7 percent increase in the previous month. The index is intended to anticipate economic conditions in three to six months.

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Debt Levels Are Falling

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
The bursting of the real estate bubble and the ensuing credit crisis forced American consumers to do something that they had little experience in trying: reduce their debt.
It has been a painful process both for borrowers, who have faced foreclosures and bankruptcies, and for lenders, whose have had to take losses vastly in excess of what they thought possible.
But the process is working far faster in the United States than in countries like Britain and Spain, which also faced plunging real estate prices. And now it appears to be contributing to an economic recovery that has gained a little momentum, despite facing headwinds from the European debt crisis. This week's report that retail sales grew faster than expected in March was the latest sign that consumers -- or at least a substantial number of them -- are growing more optimistic.
One measure of the financial health of householders is the level of financial obligations, like required mortgage and credit card payments, to disposable income. By the fall of 2007, those obligations took up 14 percent of disposable income, more than at any time since the Federal Reserve began calculating the statistic in 1980. 
But now the situation has turned around. The latest figures, for the final quarter of 2011, show that required debt service payments now make up just 10.9 percent of disposable income, the lowest proportion since 1994. A broader measure -- which adds in such obligations as property tax and insurance premiums for homeowners, and rent for those who do not own their homes -- has fallen to the lowest level since 1984.
There is little mystery in how that happened. First, debt levels have fallen. Over all, households owe about $13.2 trillion, nearly $600 billion less than in late 2008. Second, low interest rates mean that servicing that debt costs less. The Commerce Department says that mortgage interest payments, in dollars, are lower than at any time since 2005.
Getting those debt levels down was not a simple matter of making payments, of course. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that about two-thirds of the reduction came from the cancellation of debt, through write-offs and foreclosures.
But the benefit is appearing. This week's report of surprisingly strong retail sales in March may in part be because of warm weather. However, it also owes something to the fact that money that once went to mortgage payments may now be available for other things.
To get some idea of what needs to be done now -- and what the result will be -- the McKinsey institute points to two incidents in the early 1990s that got little attention at the time in the United States. Those were the bursting of real estate bubbles in Sweden and Finland. Details differ, but in each country there were two distinct phases of deleveraging.
''In the first,'' the McKinsey institute said in an analysis published early this year, ''households, corporations and financial institutions reduce debt significantly over several years, while economic growth is negative or minimal and government debt rises.'' That is certainly what has happened in the United States.
The second phase is the good part, the institute said. ''Growth rebounds and government debt is reduced gradually over several years.''
In this country, the deleveraging process has some way to go, with many foreclosures still pending, but it is at least possible that economic growth is beginning to accelerate. It is clear that the United States has made a lot more progress in cutting consumer debt than has been made in either Britain or Spain, two other countries that suffered from falling real estate prices.
To get the deleveraging process under way, it is important for lenders to face reality, admit losses and deal with them. For banks, and their regulators, there is a great temptation to obscure losses, hoping that the market will recover. That was a little harder to do in the recent cycle, thanks to new mark-to-market accounting rules. Those rules were weakened after they were denounced by banks, supported by their regulators, but they still had some effect.
Perhaps more significantly, many of the worst loans -- and the ones that most needed to be dealt with -- were generally not on bank balance sheets. The vast majority of home mortgage loans had been sold to investors in mortgage securitizations, many of them guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and others privately issued. Securitizations must regularly report on how many loans are not performing. As a result, the losses could not be hidden -- and the recovery process delayed -- as happened in Japan during the decade after its bubble burst in 1990.
The McKinsey report identifies six markers of success that are useful in assessing a nation's deleveraging process. A stable banking system must emerge. After the inevitable surge in government debt, there needs to be a credible plan for long-term fiscal sustainability. Structural reforms may be needed to make economies more competitive. Exports need to rise, as does private investment. Finally, the housing market needs to stabilize.
Susan Lund, the director of research for the McKinsey institute, says the two areas where the United States is weakest are in coming up with a credible fiscal plan and in stabilizing the real estate market. Home prices continue to fall in some of the hardest hit areas, where debts continue to be high relative to income. I'd add in private investment. Corporations are generating a lot more cash than they are willing to invest. To some extent, that may simply reflect the trauma of the crisis, when cash was king, and it may take time to solve it.
There are plenty of reasons to doubt that the current economic recovery will become self-sustaining, starting with Europe's problems and including the threat that American fiscal policy will shut off growth by imposing too much austerity too soon.
Ms. Lund points out that from 2003 to 2007, American homeowners took out $2.2 trillion from home equity loans and mortgage refinancings, a source of economic stimulus that will not return anytime soon. ''Compared to the much-debated government fiscal stimulus, this was more than twice the size,'' she noted. She thinks the household deleveraging process will continue for two more years.
But who would have forecast that the burden of household debt -- at least in much of the country -- would by now have been reduced so far that consumers are again a source of growth? That fact is a reminder that the outlook is seldom as bleak as it seems in the immediate aftermath of a calamity.
Online Correction: April 19, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column referred to household debt of $13.2 trillion as being nearly $600 billion less than in 1998. The correct year is 2008.

GRAPHIC: CHART: Household Debt Payments Hit 17-Year Low: The Federal Reserve estimates that the household debt service ratio, a ratio of debt payments to disposable personal income, fell to 10.9% in the final three months of 2011 as a result of low interest rates and reduced debt levels. That was the lowest reading since 1994. Total financial obligations, which add in rent payments, homeowners insurance and property tax payments, were 16 percent, the lowest since 1984.

HEADLINE: Rejecting 'Buffett Rule,' House Passes Business Tax Cut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday passed a $46 billion tax cut that would benefit almost every business in the country, after a class-conscious debate that highlighted the gulf between the parties as the sluggish recovery drags on.
The Republican majority pressed its one-year 20 percent cut to taxes on businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Democrats countered with the Buffett Rule, a $47 billion tax increase on the nation's richest households. 
In the conservative House, it was no contest. The tax cut won, 235 to 173, with 18 Democrats voting yes and 10 Republicans voting no. The Buffett Rule lost, 234 to 179, with five Democrats opposing it.
The House's tax cut is not likely to go far. Senate Democratic leaders unveiled their own much more limited tax incentive for hiring, which will probably come to a vote late next month. That measure would give a 10 percent tax credit for new hiring this year and extend an expired break that last year allowed businesses to deduct immediately the cost of new plants and equipment.
Senate Democratic leaders said they would welcome House and Senate negotiations on the two small-business tax cuts if theirs could overcome the 60-vote filibuster hurdle.
But the House debate over taxes neatly encapsulated the stakes of the November election. Democrats labeled the House business tax cut as a multibillion-dollar giveaway to the rich just as Republicans are moving ahead with deep cuts to programs for the poor. Republicans accused Democrats of waging class warfare and of supporting economic policies that would mire the nation in economic decline.
''We are for fairness, but in a different way,'' said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. ''Fairness comes from getting a job.''
The House measure is drawn broadly, allowing any company with fewer than 500 employees to shield 20 percent of domestic business income from taxation. That would apply to more than 99 percent of businesses, including most law firms and sports franchises, as well as partnerships like lobbying firms and hedge funds. Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, said the socialite Paris Hilton would qualify, because she lists five employees in her Beverly Hills company. He also asserted that Larry Flynt's pornography empire would benefit.
''This isn't about Paris Hilton or Larry Flynt,'' countered Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas. ''It's not about celebrities. It's about small businessmen.''
The debate between the business tax cut and the Buffett Rule, which would set a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for households earning at least $1 million a year, had little to do with economic growth. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said the tax cut's impact on the economy would be ''so small as to be incalculable.'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, commissioned Gary Robbins, who created Herman Cain's 9-9-9 tax plan, to analyze the business tax cut, which Mr. Cantor drafted. The conclusion was that in the year it would exist, it would create 39,000 jobs, at a cost in tax revenue of $1.2 million per job.
Much of the debate was on Democratic grounds: Who benefits? The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that 49 percent of the $46 billion in tax breaks would go to households earning more than $1 million.
But in a sluggish economy, Republicans said that was the price to pay for bringing relief to struggling small businesses.
''To say you can't help the middle class because somehow there will be beneficiaries above the middle class doesn't make sense to me,'' Mr. Cantor said.
The gulf between the two parties darkened the push for overhauling the tax code, which Republicans and Democrats say must be done soon. Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, began planning sessions with the Republican rank-and-file this week on a tax overhaul, amid a growing clamor from freshman conservatives demanding progress on tax simplification.
And Republicans are in talks about pushing a bill to extend the Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 before the November election, and ahead of their expiration in January, said Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, the chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on taxes.
In that sense, the fight between the Buffett Rule and the business tax cut was a sidelight, informed more by the election than by the coming tax effort, Mr. Tiberi conceded.
''We're in a transition period between now and the election,'' he said. ''Both of these issues are not permanent issues.''

HEADLINE: Battle Looms On Low Rates For U.S. Loans For Students

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
President Obama begins an all-out push on Friday to get Congress to extend the low interest rate on federal student loans, White House officials said, an effort that is likely to become a heated battle along party lines. If Congress fails to act, the interest rate on the loans, which are taken out by nearly eight million students each year, will double on July 1, to 6.8 percent.
White House officials said the president was planning a sustained effort through the spring: On Friday, Education Secretary Arne Duncan will discuss the issue at a White House briefing, and on Saturday in his weekly address, the president will call on Congress to pass legislation preventing the rate hike. 
Next week, Mr. Obama will again hammer the issue -- during visits on Tuesday to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Colorado at Boulder, and on Wednesday at the University of Iowa. The White House also plans a social media campaign through Facebook, Google+ and Twitter, using the hashtag #DontDoubleMyRate.
At a time when Americans owe more on student loans than on credit cards -- student debt is topping $1 trillion for the first time -- and the Occupy movement has highlighted the rising furor over spiraling student debt, the issue has moved higher on the political agenda. But the question of what to do about the looming interest rate increase has landed deep in the chasm separating Democrats from Republicans, who accuse the president of using the issue in a fiscally irresponsible way, in an attempt to buy the youth vote.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a one-year freeze on the interest rate for subsidized Stafford loans would cost $6 billion.
''Bad policy based on lofty campaign promises has put us in an untenable situation,'' said John P. Kline Jr., the Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
The low interest rate stemmed from the 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act, which reduced interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans over the following four academic years -- from 6.8 percent to the current 3.4 percent -- with the proviso that the rates would revert to 6.8 percent this July. Extending the low rate would be too costly, Mr. Kline said. ''We must now choose between allowing interest rates to rise or piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers,'' he said. ''I have serious concerns about any proposal that simply kicks the can down the road and creates more uncertainty in the long run -- which is what put us in this situation in the first place.''
Mr. Kline, who earlier this year called the interest-rate hike a ''ticking time bomb set by Democrats,'' said he was exploring other options in hopes of finding a solution that served borrowers and taxpayers equally well.
When the 2007 law was passed, 77 Republicans -- most of whom are still in Congress -- voted for it. But in the current climate of fractious partisanship, new legislation introduced by Representative Joe Courtney to extend the lower rate has 127 co-sponsors, all of them Democrats.
Mr. Courtney said he was hopeful that some Republican support would be forthcoming as the political stakes became more apparent.
''The visibility of this issue is going to continue to grow as we get closer to the deadline,'' he said. ''The response of students and parents is one of disbelief that interest is going to double at a time when interest rates are so low, and I think it's very politically dangerous for Republicans to stonewall this.''
Rich Williams, the higher education advocate for U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said he thought about 14 moderate Republican senators might support the effort to keep the interest rates down.
''This should be a bipartisan issue,'' he said. ''It's something everyone gets.''
Outside Congress, even some of the strongest student-aid advocates debate the question. While nearly everyone is in favor of the broad goal of college affordability, some experts wonder whether it is worth risking cutbacks in the Pell program for low-income students, a possible result of using more federal money to keep interest rates low on the Stafford loans, which are in wide use by middle-income students.
But student advocacy groups say it is wrong to view financing for Pells and Staffords as a zero-sum competition.

HEADLINE: Fears Rise That Recovery May Falter in the Spring

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Some of the same spoilers that interrupted the recovery in 2010 and 2011 have emerged again, raising fears that the winter's economic strength might dissipate in the spring.
In recent weeks, European bond yields have started climbing. In the United States and elsewhere, high oil prices have sapped spending power. American employers remain skittish about hiring new workers, and new claims for unemployment insurance have risen. And stocks have declined.
There is a ''light recovery blowing in a spring wind'' with ''dark clouds on the horizon,'' Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said Thursday, at the start of meetings here that will focus on Europe's troubles and global growth. Ms. Lagarde implored world leaders not to become complacent. 
Forecasters have said that the trends point to a moderation of economic growth in the United States, but they still expect the recovery to continue this year. The slowdown in part reflects an unusually warm winter, which pulled forward economic activity, making January and February seem artificially good and perhaps making recent weeks look worse than they truly were.
Still, the breadth of the recent weakening of activity shows that the economy remains fragile, as is typical in the years following a financial crisis.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had been generally rising from last summer through March, but has fallen more than 3 percent since early April. Initial jobless claims had been on a long, slow fall since 2011, but have jumped about 6 percent in the last three weeks, according to a Labor Department report released Thursday.
Persistent economic worries -- about both a potential slowdown in the near term and almost certain sluggish growth in the long term -- have formed the backdrop for the annual spring meetings of the monetary fund and the World Bank. Finance ministers and central bankers are convening in Washington to discuss how to lift growth and reduce unemployment.
The fund this week upgraded its estimate of global growth in 2012 and 2013 from estimates made in January, but did so with major caveats. ''An uneasy calm remains,'' said Olivier Blanchard, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist. ''One has the feeling that any moment, things could well get very bad again.''
Europe remains the central concern. In a report released this week, the fund's economists said that financial institutions in the European Union would shrink their balance sheets by up to $2.6 trillion by the end of next year, reducing the availability of credit for businesses and households by as much as 1.6 percent.
Private analysts have also warned of weakness in Europe, despite the European Central Bank's effort to quiet markets by providing financial firms with unlimited low-cost, short-term loans -- a policy credited with pulling down bond yields this winter.
Policy makers in Washington also have domestic worries. Speaking on Wednesday at the Brookings Institution, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner noted that the recovery had been slow and cautioned that headwinds remained.
Europe and the United States together account for about a third of global trade flows, and their financial systems are inextricably linked. For that reason, Mr. Geithner has urged European leaders to keep up efforts to bring down bond yields and bolster growth.
''It's very important to get that balance right'' between growth and austerity, he said. ''You're undermining the prospects for some stability in growth'' by cutting too fast, he added.
But some domestic indicators have weakened in recent weeks as well.
First, there are signs that the sharp decline in the unemployment rate -- which fell to 8.2 percent in March from 8.9 percent in October -- might be over, with economic growth not robust enough for employers to continue adding jobs so rapidly.
In March, employers added just 120,000 new jobs, the fewest since November. The recent rise in new jobless claims has raised worries that the April report will also be disappointing, although some forecasters say the jobless-claims statistics have been affected by the timing of Easter.
In addition, oil prices remain stubbornly high, though they have dropped in recent days. Nationwide, gas prices are about $3.90 a gallon, up from $3.85 a month ago and $3.84 a year ago. That has cut into household's budgets and hit consumer sentiment, which had been rising. Falling industrial production and home sales also point to a spring slowdown, as occurred in 2010 and 2011 as well.
A third straight year of economic disappointment could have major political implications, hurting President Obama's re-election campaign and helping Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee, make the case against Mr. Obama.
Economists are divided over the import of the recent slowdown, with many saying it is more likely to seem like a blip than a major change.
''After a few months of good data, people got more aggressive with their expectations,'' said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics. ''The data are having a brief pause, or a consolidation. The consensus forecast had gotten stronger, so it's easy to overshoot.''
Moreover, recent signals have been mixed. Retail and auto sales, for instance, have posted significant gains. And oil prices have moderated, partly as a result of an effort by the White House and its international partners to talk prices down and bring new sources of oil on line, with major exporters increasing production.
Nevertheless, the United States is forecast to grow at a relatively sluggish pace of about 2.5 percent this year. And the global economic picture remains characterized by anemic growth and high unemployment.
The leadership of the monetary fund and the World Bank will underscore these problems at the meetings in Washington. Officials plan to warn low-income countries not to depend on investment from debt-soaked advanced economies, and caution that aid and remittances may fall this year. They will also urge cash-rich middle-income countries, like China, to ensure a soft landing if their economies cool off.
Most of all, officials will urge Europe to bolster economic growth in countries like Italy and Spain, while raising new lending capacity for the monetary fund itself. ''With the anxieties late last year, I think the E.C.B.'s extraordinary actions were appropriate, but I think some misled themselves because they only bought time,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, the outgoing head of the World Bank, on Thursday. ''Further actions are going to be called for.''
Domestically, most analysts still see an economy with a self-sustaining recovery, if not a spectacular one. ''These things just don't go up in a straight line,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. ''It is a tango.''

HEADLINE: Romney's Tight Ship Prepares to Take On More Hands for the Fall Campaign

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Mitt Romney's nondescript base camp on the outskirts of the North End of Boston has until now seemed too large for his presidential campaign -- roughly 15,000 square feet of space on the first floor has sat largely empty and unused, even during Mr. Romney's first presidential bid in 2008.
But that cavernous area, which once housed a Roche-Bobois furniture store, will soon fill with the speed of a hot high-tech start-up as Mr. Romney, now the presumptive Republican nominee, prepares for the general election. His staff of 87 full-time employees will balloon to more than 400 people in the coming weeks, aides said, and his convention team of 55 will nearly triple to 150 full-timers by the actual event in Tampa, Fla., in late August.
In short order, the campaign will need to raise money aggressively, build up offices in swing states, reach out to conservatives and moderates and hone its anti-Obama message while introducing Mr. Romney to large swaths of the country. 
Mr. Romney has sold himself to voters as a problem-solver and an experienced executive, and some of those skills will be put to the test in a matter of weeks as he transforms his insular, tight-knit political team into a full-scale national campaign prepared to compete with President Obama's vaunted political operation. Mr. Romney's headquarters, for instance, looks spendthrift compared with Mr. Obama's campaign office, at the prestigious address of One Prudential Plaza in downtown Chicago. The Obama offices, covering about 50,000 square feet on a floor with views of Lake Michigan, had to be in a secure location under guidelines adopted by the Secret Service.
The Romney campaign's challenge will be to handle an increasingly complicated operation while maintaining the famously lean and disciplined shop that served it so well in the primaries. The next phase of the campaign will force it to bring on some outsiders from inside the Beltway, people who do not necessarily share the Romney team's loyalty or foxhole mentality.
''We're not giving up our desire to run an efficient and effective campaign,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney adviser.
In the campaign headquarters last week, top aides held back-to-back days of meetings, grappling with general election strategy. On Thursday, they showed Mr. Romney a PowerPoint presentation, ''Looking Ahead: Framing Obama and the General Election,'' which outlined the fund-raising effort, the state office buildup, a schedule and an expanded role for the family. (Mr. Romney's wife, Ann; their five sons, especially Tagg and Josh; and possibly Mr. Romney's grandchildren will become more visible in the campaign.) Large rallies and town-hall-style meetings will give way to daily fund-raisers and smaller campaign events designed to push out the candidate's message.
With the exception of Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who joined the team as a senior adviser this month, Mr. Romney's top leadership will remain largely unchanged, aides said.
But the communications shop will need to beef up to meet the demands of the growing press corps following Mr. Romney, and other departments will expand as well. Austin Barbour, 36, who joined the campaign early on as a national finance chairman and is a nephew of Haley Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi, will move to Boston to work as a deputy to Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist.
Additional hires -- a mix of volunteers moving into full-time salaried positions, friends of the campaign, Capitol Hill types and seasoned Washington hands -- will be layered in below, which the campaign hopes will help maintain its tight-lipped message discipline. Aides have been collecting resumes for several weeks, and are partial to people with whom they already have strong relationships, often from past campaigns.
Richard Grenell, who was the communications director for the United States at the United Nations, will be the spokesman on national security and foreign policy. Sarah Pompei, most recently the communications director for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority whip, will become the deputy communications director for regional press.
The campaign has identified 14 to 16 battleground states where it will open offices and reactivate networks from the primaries. Though the campaign will add regional directors, as Senator John McCain did in 2008, the overall structure will be flatter, with each state director reporting directly to Boston.
And in a nod to Mr. Romney's weakness among certain voters, the campaign plans in the coming weeks to create coalitions for various groups, including women and Hispanics. While ramping up, the campaign must also tie up the loose ends of the primary campaign.
In his Boston office, where large posters of the five April 24 primary states and their media markets hang on a wall, Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director, identified Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New Mexico as three swing states with primaries yet to come.
''We still have to take care of business and win the rest of these states,'' Mr. Beeson said. But, he added, the contests could be used as a launching pad for the general election.
''Now with these target states, whether it's Pennsylvania or New Mexico, you can start taking the longer view, and set up ground operations knowing that you're not going to have to pivot everyone right away to the next primary,'' he said.
Mr. Romney knows he must shore up his base, and to that end, he will deliver the May commencement address at Liberty University, the evangelical institution founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.
Behind the scenes, Peter Flaherty, a senior adviser, has reached out to social and religious conservatives, relaying Mr. Romney's desire to run an ''inclusive'' campaign. Within 24 hours of Rick Santorum's departure from the race last week, Mr. Flaherty had made nearly a dozen calls to conservative leaders like Tony Perkins and Gary Bauer, many of whom backed Santorum.
''With many of these leaders, it's a reunion as opposed to an introduction,'' said Mr. Flaherty, whose longstanding relationships with social conservatives often predate even Mr. Romney's 2008 campaign.
The campaign believes that anger at Mr. Obama will help bring out grass-roots Republicans. ''There is not a single greater uniter of the Republican Party than Barack Obama,'' Mr. Beeson said.
Over all, the Romney campaign will focus on winning over moderates and independents. The basic blueprint, which was rolled out during a recent dispute over female voters, is to turn any attack by the Obama campaign back on the president, with an economic twist.
The mood in the headquarters has remained largely focused and serious, even after big moments like Mr. Santorum's announcement of his withdrawal. Neil Newhouse, the campaign's pollster, pointed to a photograph hanging in his office, showing several staff members gathered around a television, calmly watching Mr. Santorum bow out.
''There was no huge celebration,'' Mr. Newhouse said. ''We may have had an extra drink that night, but that's it. There's just a focus on what's ahead of you.''

HEADLINE: A Tarnished Standing For Europe

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY and JACK EWING; Annie Lowrey reported from Washington, and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt. Nicholas Kulish contributed from Berlin.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Europeans may discover this week that the debt crisis is not only threatening the euro zone economy and the integrity of the common currency, but also diminishing Europe's influence in world affairs.
For a second consecutive year, Europe's problems are the major preoccupation as government officials and monetary policy makers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which run through Sunday.
Europe is the ''epicenter'' of potential global storms, said Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F. and a former French finance minster.
On Thursday, in advance of the meetings, she expressed support for the measures that European leaders have taken to stem contagion. But she also called on European leaders to spark economic growth and to be willing to use the region's bailout fund to recapitalize banks, while predicting that nations would contribute more money to the I.M.F. to build a ''stronger global firewall'' to contain further crises. 
The failure of European leaders to convince the rest of the world that they have a grip on the crisis is more than just embarrassing, some policy makers said. It may also give them less weight in debates on other issues and hasten the shift of power away from developed countries and toward cash-rich and fast-growing emerging nations, like China, India and Brazil.
''Certainly the crisis in Europe has unveiled a structural shift of power,'' said Thomas Mirow, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which lends to countries in the former Eastern bloc as well as newly democratic Arab nations. ''This is one of the big themes of the 21st century.''
Outside Europe, there remains concern that the Continent's problems are undercutting world growth, and that there are shortcomings in the response by European policy makers.
In a measure of how widespread the concern is, one question at an I.M.F. briefing this week came from a reporter from Jamaica who asked whether Europe's problems could spread to the Caribbean, where Spanish companies own many hotels.
The monetary fund and the World Bank have repeatedly chastised European leaders for acting too slowly to quiet markets and for cutting budgets too quickly, weakening economic growth around the world and contributing to an unemployment crisis across the Continent.
European elected officials do not seem to be enjoying the attention being directed at them, or the advice that comes with it.
Olivier Blanchard, the I.M.F.'s chief economist, said this week that euro zone members should consider issuing bonds backed by all members, a proposal unpopular among Germans who do not want to underwrite borrowing by countries like Italy.
Ms. Lagarde is pressuring Europe to make changes to its bailout fund so that it can lend to financial institutions, not just countries, as I.M.F. economists warn that rapid deleveraging by banks might destabilize financial markets in the next 18 months.
The bailout fund, as currently structured, ''could actually help in terms of recapitalization anywhere in the euro zone,'' Ms. Lagarde said on Thursday. ''What we are advocating is that this be done without channeling through the sovereigns.''
German representatives, in particular, are likely to hear unwelcome advice in Washington. They will be told that they should moderate their insistence that euro zone countries like Spain and Greece adhere to strict austerity programs.
Traditional stimulus programs are probably out of the question because most governments simply do not have the money, many economists and officials said.
A senior German finance ministry official, speaking with reporters in Berlin on Tuesday, dismissed the notion that Europe needed a stimulus.
''We don't see the need that perhaps other countries see to stimulate growth through further spending increases,'' said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in keeping with ministry policy.
German officials plan to point out what they believe are policy failings by the United States and other powers. For example, the senior official said that Germany would urge other nations to stay the course on the regulation of banks and financial markets.
But Europe may have less moral authority to press its views on such issues given that it is also asking the I.M.F. for more money to protect against a deepening of the euro zone crisis.
This winter, the I.M.F. agreed to raise new lending resources -- but only if European leaders bolstered the euro zone bailout fund comparably. In March, European leaders agreed to increase the lending capacity of their fund.
That opened the door for other countries to contribute new resources to the I.M.F., with the goal of raising $400 billion for loans to ailing countries in the euro zone and other trouble spots in the world. Countries in the euro zone had already pledged about $200 billion. This week, other I.M.F. members, including Japan, Norway, Sweden and Denmark, joined them.
Big emerging economies are expected to make contributions as well. That is a sharp break from past practice, when emerging countries were usually borrowers from the I.M.F. and richer countries were the lenders.
It will inevitably sharpen the debate about the role of emerging nations in managing the I.M.F. and the World Bank, both of which have traditionally been dominated by the United States and Europe.
''It will be impossible to have this discussion without thinking about broader governance,'' said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Cash-rich emerging economies like China and Brazil have withheld new contributions to the I.M.F. firewall, believing that new money should come with increased voting power.
Europe has made progress since the I.M.F. and World Bank meetings a year ago.
Then, some officials spoke of the euro zone's being on the brink of dissolution. There was fear of a chaotic default on Greek debt or the collapse of a major bank. Greece has since agreed on a debt-reduction plan with creditors, and the European Central Bank has eased concern about banks by lending them 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion).
But other problems have grown worse, like the unemployment rate, which is at a record 10.8 percent in the euro zone.
''Compared with autumn last year, there has certainly been a gradual improvement,'' Mr. Mirow said. But compared with early 2011, he said, ''things have not improved and maybe have even darkened.'' The crisis has spread further into Eastern Europe because most banks there are owned by hard-pressed Western European institutions.
The unemployment problem can be fixed by increasing the potential for countries like Spain and Italy to grow and compete on world export markets. Europe's allies understand that remaking an economy takes time, said Mr. Kirkegaard, but they can be expected to push the Continent to pick up the pace of change.
''There is an increasing realization that the kinds of issues the Europeans are dealing with are not something you can fix in a couple of months,'' he said. ''That doesn't mean the Europeans won't be told they need to do a lot more to improve the short-term growth outlook.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Joining G.O.P. on Pipeline

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is finding himself increasingly boxed in on the Keystone pipeline fight as more Congressional Democrats are joining Republicans in backing the project, which has strong labor support and could generate significant numbers of jobs in economically hard-hit states.
On Wednesday, the House passed a short-term transportation bill that included a provision that would pave the way for the construction of the next stage of the oil pipeline, a measure that Mr. Obama has said he would veto. The bill passed 293 to 127, with 69 Democrats supporting it. 
It is the fourth time the House has passed a measure to expedite the project; one failed narrowly in the Senate only after Mr. Obama personally lobbied some Democrats to vote no. With the House vote, Mr. Obama finds himself, for the first time in his presidency, threatening a veto on a significant piece of legislation that enjoys the support of an increasing number of Democrats, as well as the vast majority of Republicans in Congress.
With gas prices sticking near $4 a gallon, unemployment high in many states and demonstrable support for the project in numerous polls, many Democrats -- especially those from states where pipelines are commonplace -- are beginning to sound almost indistinguishable from Speaker John A. Boehner, who called Mr. Obama ''increasingly isolated'' in his opposition to expanding the project.
Representative Dennis Cardoza, a California Democrat who voted for the House measure, said he would be happy to vote to override a veto if needed. He said: ''I think the president has made a very serious mistake here. I'm still supporting the president. But we have to do what's right.''
The pipeline expansion was deemed suitable last year after extensive review by the State Department, but it was prevented because of concerns in Nebraska -- including those pressed by Gov. Dave Heineman, a Republican -- over the proposed route. Mr. Heineman called a special session of the Legislature that resulted in a law requiring a modified route, but the Obama administration, facing continued protests from environmental groups that are resistant to new pipelines period, said it would delay a decision on the new route until after the election.
Republicans were enraged, arguing that the project could begin while a new Nebraska route was cobbled together, and passed various bills to circumvent the administration.
Wednesday's vote came the day after Mr. Heineman signed a bill to review a new version of the project quickly.
In addition, TransCanada, the company behind the project, said this week that it had created a new route through Nebraska that would avoid the environmentally sensitive Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Aquifer. But the State Department, which has some measure of control over the project because it crosses international borders, would still need to review a new submitted plan.
All year, House Republicans have made it a central goal to win approval of the pipeline, which would stretch from oil sands formations in Alberta, Canada, to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The number of jobs that could be created by the Keystone expansion -- supporters say 20,000 -- is disputed. But many companies and unions around the country have been clamoring for the extension.
Now that the House has approved a transportation bill that differs from one passed in the Senate, the two chambers must go to conference. Because of the pressure on both parties to pass a highway measure, the thirst for compromise will be high.
Central to the theater will be Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, and the Democrat who is co-author of the Senate highway bill, Barbara Boxer of California.
''At the end of the day,'' said Matt Dempsey, a spokesman for Mr. Inhofe, ''people really want the highway bill done. Keystone has gotten overwhelming bipartisan support in both chambers. So that puts President Obama in an awkward spot where these two things match up together.''
Ms. Boxer, who has called for a ''truly bipartisan'' bill, would not comment on the prospects for the conference committee. And Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the minority whip who supports the project, would not be thrilled if House Democrats were to have to deal with a veto.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was noncommittal on Thursday in a news conference. ''It's pretty clear now how we stand on this issue,'' he said. ''We've voted on it a number of times. But maybe somebody will come up with some magic formula that will allow us to do more.''
Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, did not dig in one way or the other on Thursday. ''They seem to have taken a step in Nebraska to meet requirements set by the Nebraskan Legislature,'' Mr. Carney said. ''And as the president said when he was in Oklahoma, we anticipate a submission by TransCanada in the future, and we'll judge it accordingly.''
But Democrats like Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania say they would support a highway bill with a Keystone pipeline provision. ''I would vote for it, yes,'' Mr. Casey said.
Democrats beyond Washington -- including those who run unions, build pipeline parts and run cities or states -- have also been big supporters of the project. ''Cool down, cowgirl,'' said Gov. Brian Schweitzer, Democrat of Montana, when told about the current situation in Congress. ''I am a very large advocate of Keystone, and it disgusts me that instead of solving the issue, the people in Washington just fight.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 21, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about President Obama's opposition to the Keystone pipeline referred incorrectly to a new route through Nebraska that Trans Canada has proposed. Nebraska environmental officials say no final decision has been made on the route and whether it will cross the environmentally sensitive Ogallala Aquifer. It is not the case that a new route through the state will indeed avoid the aquifer.

HEADLINE: For Democrats, Maps Toughen Race for House

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
CONCORD, N.C. -- Representative Larry Kissell slid into a diner booth here and sought to explain -- with no small amount of irritation, since he has apparently been asked many times -- his decision to run in his newly configured House district, in contrast to two fellow North Carolina Democrats who retired rather than risk defeat in districts reshaped by Republicans.
''Those are decisions they had to make on a personal level,'' said Mr. Kissell, whose district outside Charlotte has gone from being mildly Republican in his first election in 2008 to 12 percentage points in favor of the opposition party now. ''I really view this as being a job of serving the public. It's not a campaign for me; it's just doing our job. And if we do a good job, the results will go our way.'' 
Republicans have a different view. They see North Carolina as the state that stands between Democrats and their dreams of retaking the House.
Congressional redistricting, a decennial process that generally allows the party in legislative power in each state to draw new lines, has not created many opportunities for new seats for Republicans, as the party's leaders once expected. But it has forced multiple House Democrats, viewing their odds in new districts as slim, into retirement. Many of those districts are now either in play or solidly Republican, making the climb for Democrats all that more onerous.
On paper, Democrats need a net gain of 25 seats to take back House control. In reality, the number is closer to 30 or even 35, since the party is likely not only to lose the seats of retiring Democrats in North Carolina, but also to face tougher odds in Arkansas, California, Oklahoma, Indiana, Illinois and perhaps in Arizona, in the district once served by former Representative Gabrielle Giffords.
Over all, 15 Democrats have announced their retirements from the House, compared with 10 Republicans. Seven Democrats and eight Republicans have also opted to run for other offices. Among the lot, Republicans leave far more safe seats behind than their Democratic counterparts.
Of the seats where members are not seeking re-election, just two -- one in Illinois and the other in California -- have the potential to flip from Republican to Democrat, said David Wasserman, House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, while at least six seats held by Democrats are at risk of falling to Republicans, thanks to new lines. Among those are the North Carolina seats being vacated by Representatives Heath Shuler and Brad Miller.
''Democrats are at a disadvantage because of these retirements,'' Mr. Wasserman said. ''Those retirements have hamstrung their requirements of picking up the 25 seats they need.''
Between the retirements and new office seekers, members who have already been picked off in primary battles and the addition of new Congressional seats in some states via redistricting, 56 House seats are now left without incumbents, the highest number since 1992, Mr. Wasserman said. This has led both parties to study maps obsessively, looking for new places to eke out victory. Both will find them, but Democrats will find fewer on balance.
''Democrats are feeling the Tar Heel blues in North Carolina and across the country, with Democrats choosing to retire rather than be saddled with the albatross of a failed Obama economic agenda,'' said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''These retirements serve as a cautionary sign of the troubles House Democrats face with Barack Obama on the ballot in November.''
The retirements of Mr. Shuler and Mr. Miller, both veteran lawmakers who won in tricky political terrain, have been a blow to Democrats here in North Carolina, and Mr. Kissell and Representative Mike McIntyre have been pressed into districts with steep Republican advantages.
All the Democrats running for re-election here know they are laboring in a state that Republicans feel is their Illinois -- the one state where Democrats had a firm hand on redistricting and used it to cause Republicans potential harm -- and often hear discomforting words like ''bloodbath'' describing their prospects here.
But the party is not going down without a fight. Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Kissell are both well known in their districts, even the newer parts, in a state where voters are sometimes known to vote Republican for president and Democratic for the House. Mr. Obama's re-election efforts will be in full force here -- the Democratic National Convention will be in Charlotte -- and all Democrats will benefit from his team's get-out-the-vote efforts among base voters in a state he carried in 2008.
''I am a firm believer and still have confidence in North Carolina voters,'' said Hayden Rogers, the longtime chief of staff to Mr. Shuler who, after failing to persuade his boss to run again, decided to go for the seat himself. ''I think they are looking for candidates who are rational, and they are less inclined to vote by political affiliation.''
Finally, Democrats here are used to running uphill.
''I am not going to sugarcoat it,'' said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''It is always hard to lose a valued colleague, but we're not going to concede North Carolina. Our incumbents survived the toughest climate in recent political history: 2010. They know how to win independents, they know how to win Republicans, they are battle tested, they are field ready, they did it before and they'll do it again.''
Richard Hudson, a former Congressional staff member, smells opportunity. He is running among a handful of others in the Republican primary in the Eighth District, where Republicans hope to pick off Mr. Kissell. ''Part of the challenge is name identification,'' Mr. Hudson conceded. ''My name ID is 10 percent. Larry Kissell's is 70 percent.''
But, Mr. Hudson said, under redistricting, Mr. Kissell ''does not match the district.'' For instance, Mr. Hudson said, while Mr. Kissell voted against the health care law, he did not vote for repeal.
As he walks around the district, Mr. Hudson applies the rules he has learned on the trail. Do not step on lawns; use the walkway. Never sneak up on someone mowing the grass. Do not be too pushy.
''I'm aware of your face!'' exclaimed one resident of Concord as he slipped into her yard. Mr. Hudson seemed pleased.

HEADLINE: BRICS Agitate for a Seat at the Table

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A BRICS bank, an idea proposed by India, to address the needs of the fast-growing emerging economies could pose a challenge to the world financial order. 

 BODY:
"Do the world's powerful emerging markets need their own development bank? If China has anything to say about it - and it has quite a lot - the answer is a resounding yes," Didi Kirsten Tatlow writesin The New York Times.
The spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank take place this year against the backdrop of a potentially bold challenge to the world financial order: "a BRICS bank to address the needs of the fast-growing emerging economies," Ms. Tatlow writes.
Economists caution that the idea, proposed by India, is still in early stages, and that significant issues - "notably of governance - need to be worked out," she writes.
But with Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa signing new financial cooperation agreements at their fourth annual meeting in New Delhi in March, the countries are signaling discontent at their lack of influence over decision-making within the world's existing financial institutions, and exploring steps to do something about it.
In theory, a BRICS bank would gather resources and provide financial support to infrastructure projects in member countries as well in as other developing markets.
Backers of the idea hope that a bank geared toward extending credit within the developing world in local currencies would be a sign of shifting global power relations that could one day counter the influence of the United States and Europe in the global monetary and financial system.

HEADLINE: Haitong Raises $1.7 Billion in Hong Kong Share Sale

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Chinese brokerage firm Haitong Securities has raised $1.7 billion through the sale of shares in Hong Kong, the largest public offering in the world so far this year. 

 BODY:
The Chinese brokerage firm Haitong Securities has raised $1.7 billion through the sale of shares in Hong Kong, the largest public offering in the world so far this year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The firm, which already is publicly traded in Shanghai, sold approximately 1.23 billion shares at 10.60 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.37, each, according to the term sheet obtained by DealBook on Friday.
The pricing of Haitong's Hong Kong sale represents a 16.6 percent discount to the firm's closing share price in Shanghai on Friday. It also was at the bottom end of firm's price range of 10.60 Hong Kong dollars to 11.18 Hong Kong dollars. 
 The company's stock will start trading in Hong Kong next Friday. The firm is expected to use the money to expand its brokerage business in China.
Haitong's listing comes at a difficult time for the broader Chinese economy, whose growth slowed to 8.1 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the fifth-consecutive slowdown in the country's quarterly growth, as fears mount that the Chinese economy will not be able to maintain its rapid expansion.
The company follows rival Chinese brokerage house Citic Securities in listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Last October, Citic raised $1.7 billion through its own listing.
As the largest public offering so far this year, Haitong's floatation is a bright spot for the widely depressed global equity capital markets. Concerns about Chinese growth, as well as lingering questions about the European debt crisis and the United States economy, have made the markets jittery since the beginning of the year. 
Other companies to raise money in the public markets in 2012 include the Dutch cable operator Ziggo and the Swiss trade and marketing company DKSH, which raised a combined $2 billion dollars earlier this year. 
Allison Transmissions, a commercial vehicle transmission maker based in Indianapolis also raised $690 million in March.
Haitong and JPMorgan Chase were the joint underwriters of the offering. The firms, along with Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and UBS, also were global coordinators for the listing.

HEADLINE: As States Lock In to Movie Stars' Taxes, California Tries to Cope

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: A large share of celebrities' income tax has been slipping off to places like Georgia, Louisiana and Massachusetts as those states and others use film production incentives to lure some of Hollywood's most-expensive movie shoots. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Movie stars are a famously mobile group. Their tax dollars have been moving around, too.
By and large, the biggest stars still live here. Whether seen on TMZ.com or in the clubs on Sunset Drive, Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr., Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and perhaps two-thirds of the film industry's top earners appeared to spend enough time in Los Angeles - their Manhattan townhouses and getaway homes in Belize notwithstanding - to be domiciled here for tax purposes.
But a large share of their income tax has been slipping off to places like Georgia, Louisiana and Massachusetts. Those states and others have used film production incentives to lure some of Hollywood's most-expensive movie shoots, including "Iron Man 3," which will be partly shot later this year in North Carolina. As much as 60 percent of Southern California's location work has been moved to other locales since the 1990s.
In return - with some variation in the way laws are structured and enforced around the country - the host states get to tax what the stars and others are paid for their time working there. And some of those states are keeping a sharper eye on movie income.
Beginning next January, for instance, Georgia will insist that production companies withhold money for state taxes from payments made to stars and filmmakers through their personal corporations. "They have always been required to pay," said Stefanie Paupeck, a spokeswoman for Georgia's department of economic development. But by withholding taxes, the new law makes sure the rich and famous don't forget that requirement when they are back on the beach in Malibu.
So what's left for California? Leftovers.
Though facing enormous budget shortfalls, Hollywood's home state gets to collect only the difference between its own tax rate - which tops out at 10.3 percent on annual income of more than $1 million - and those of the states or foreign governments that are siphoning off location work. The celebrities contacted for this article either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to provide details on their salaries and taxes.
If Ms. Aniston, for instance, paid 6 percent of her salary to the State of Georgia for the time she spent there working on "Wanderlust," then California, where she lives, got no more than 4.3 percent. If George Clooney sent 11 percent of his salary for location work on "The Descendants" to Hawaii, which had the country's highest state tax when the film was shot there in 2010, California got none of it.
That might change if a state tax proposal endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown gets signed into law. The measure, whose backers are gathering signatures for a ballot measure, would assess sharply higher taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, with the rate on incomes of more than $1 million reaching 13.3 percent. It would be the nation's highest state tax rate.
In theory, the new rate would guarantee California at least a chunk of every Hollywood-based superstar's salary - even after other states get their cut. In fact, California's former governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, could pay New Mexico 4.9 percent for his work there on "The Last Stand," an action movie set for release by Lionsgate next year, and still have 8.4 percent - more than the top income tax in 43 states - left for California.
All high earners, not just movie stars, would be affected by the tax. So it's unlikely Mr. Brown had celebrities in mind when he agreed last month to join the backers of a tax plan pushing for an ultrahigh rate on the wealthy, while adding a quarter percent to the state sales tax, which is already the nation's highest at 7.25 percent (there is also an additional rate that varies among local jurisdictions).
After all, collecting an additional 3 percent on the income earned by the entertainment industry's 25 top-paid stars, which was just under $700 million from May 2010 to May 2011, according to Forbes Magazine, would add only about $21 million to California's coffers. That is about 0.3 percent of the $7.6 billion in revenue the proposal's backers say it will raise annually, or about 0.4 percent of a smaller take predicted by the state's legislative analyst.
There is risk, too, that the high rate will nudge a few more of the high earners to establish residency elsewhere, though California's taxing authorities are "very aggressive" in making sure that any change of homes is not simply a tax dodge, said Michael H. Starler, a tax specialist in Los Angeles with the Greenberg Traurig law firm.
"They hate losing taxpayers," said Mr. Starler, who added that spending nine months a year here created an automatic presumption that California was home.
Still, Sandra Bullock, estimated by Forbes to have earned $15 million for the year that ended in May 2011, has a home in Texas, where there is no income tax. A spokeswoman for Ms. Bullock did not respond to a query as to whether the actress is a legal resident of Texas.
And Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who made $50 million between them by the Forbes count (which tries to best assess what remain closely guarded numbers), have a home in Louisiana, where the tax rate is 6 percent.
"There's nothing more mobile than rich people," said Kris Vosburgh, the executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the new rates.
To date, stars have figured only marginally in the politics of the tax debate. Even Mr. Schwarzenegger so far has not taken a position on the tax, said his adviser, Adam Mendelsohn. But Hollywood endorsements were generally missing from a long list of supporters that includes public employees and teachers unions, church groups and immigrant advocates, among others.
Representatives of Governor Brown did not respond to queries.
That is not to say the stars will not rally behind Mr. Brown, who enjoyed considerable support from Hollywood in his 2010 election campaign.
Then, again, they may just follow Ben Stiller.
More than a year ago, Mr. Stiller moved back to New York, to work on Broadway and enjoy life in the suburbs.
There, the locals may complain about high taxes, especially when New York City levies are thrown in. But with its income tax rate of just under 9 percent- a third lower than what is proposed in the Golden State - the State of New York could soon be viewed as a tax haven.

HEADLINE: Bill Would Expand Insurance for Crops

BYLINE: RON NIXON


HIGHLIGHT: A new farm bill under consideration by the Senate agriculture committee would end direct subsidies to farmers for not growing crops. 

 BODY:
For decades, farmers have been able to receive government money for not growing crops.
The Senate agriculture committee on Friday began laying the groundwork to change that, as it worked on a half-trillion-dollar farm and food bill.
Currently, farmers who grow corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and other crops receive about $5 billion annually in subsidies. The payments have become harder to justify as farm income has risen to historic levels. According to the Agriculture Department, net farm income was a record $101 billion last year. The price of farmland has reached record highs. 
The bill now under consideration would replace direct subsidies with various insurance programs that would aid farmers in the event of bad weather or natural disasters.
One program, called the "shallow loss" program, would cover modest yields or declines in prices. For more catastrophic losses, farmers would receive crop insurance subsidies. 
The government already helps farmers get some crop insurance through private companies, with the government paying about 62 percent of the premiums, plus administrative expenses. According to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office, the cost of that insurance was $7.3 billion last year; by comparison, in 2000, the cost was $951 million, or about $1.2 billion adjusted for inflation. A Congressional Budget Office study cited in the report estimates that the total cost of subsidizing the premiums from 2012 through 2016 will be about $39 billion -- about $7.8 billion a year.
Some conservation groups are less than pleased with the proposed bill.
"Rather than simply ending the widely discredited direct payment program, the Senate Agriculture Committee has created an expensive new entitlement program that guarantees most of the income of farm businesses already enjoying record profits," said Craig Cox, senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources at the environmental working group. "Replacing direct payments with a revenue guarantee program is a cynical game of bait-and-switch that should be rejected by Congress."
In a letter to the agriculture committee, several farm groups said they support the proposed bill and its emphasis on insurance programs to protect farmers.
"Crop insurance is the core risk management tool used by our producers, and the current program should serve as the foundation for providing additional protection against loss," said the groups, which include the American Farm Bureau Federation and the American Soybean Association.
The full committee is to vote next week on the bill, which also combines several conservation programs, stops lottery and gambling winners from getting nutritional assistance and helps family farmers sell locally by increasing support for farmers' markets. The current five-year farm bill, passed in 2008, expires at the end of September. 
The Senate proposal cuts about $23 billion from farm programs to aid in deficit reduction. The Obama administration, which has also called for ending direct payments, wants to cut $32 billion from farm programs. House Republicans want a $30 billion cut.

HEADLINE: Anthony Marx, New York Public Libary President, Answers Reader Questions

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The general public has its own questions about the plan to renovate the Fifth Avenue main building. Anthony Marx, the library's president, agreed to answer a few of them, selected by The New York Times. 

 BODY:
When the New York Public Library announced plans in 2008 to renovate its Fifth Avenue main building, the project sounded glamorous and exciting: it would be designed by the prominent British architect Norman Foster. For the first time, the landmark would become a circulating as well as a research library, with abundant computers, ample public space - even a cafe. 
Now the project - which languished because of the recession and was recently revived -- has raised serious concerns among scholars and writers. They worry that the project will essentially turn the main branch from an important research center to a glorified Starbucks, that the retrieval time for books will lengthen and that the projected $300 million cost would be better spent on rejuvenating the many branches in disadvantaged neighborhoods.
 The general public, too, has its own questions about the project. Anthony Marx, the library's president, agreed to answer a few of them, selected by The New York Times.
Q.
In light of the mixed public reactions to the Central Library Plan, is NYPL's leadership planning to hold a town hall meeting to discuss this plan with New York City residents and other interested parties? Are you personally in favor of such a meeting? If not, what are your reasons for opposing it? 
A.
Feedback is critically important in shaping the future of our system, and I strongly support garnering as much public opinion about our plan, in as many formats as possible. As a first step, we have set up a Web site with an online forum where users can submit comments and questions, and are now actively working to address concerns that have been raised, via blogs, news outlets and so on. These efforts, all aimed toward increasing public awareness about our goals, will allow us to continue hearing what our users from across the city and everywhere want and need from their libraries.
As for town hall meetings, we are planning to visit community boards in the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island in the coming months to discuss various developments throughout our library system, including the Central Library Plan. These meetings will be open to the public, and I hope a great many people will attend and share their input. Plus, as the plan moves forward, there will be additional opportunities for members of the public to share their opinions; updates will be posted at nypl.org/yourlibrary.
We are already meeting with various NYPL constituencies to address specific issues early on, including scholars' concerns, suggestions for English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, university research needs and more. We also continue to hold systemwide meetings for staff to discuss the plan.
Q.
Has the Midtown Library building been sold and to whom? Has it been sold in opening bidding ? For what price? Money upfront or paid out? 
A.
The Mid-Manhattan Library is not currently for sale and will not be for sale until the new Mid-Manhattan at 42nd Street is ready, which will be several years from now. Our goal is to have a smooth transition with ideally not a single day of lost service for the 1.5 million patrons a year who rely upon the largest-circulating library in the country.
The sale process, while years away, will be managed to ensure the best possible sales price for the library. We anticipate that the sales of the Mid-Manhattan Library and the Science, Industry and Business Library (SIBL) and their incorporation into 42nd Street - together with city financing and further private fund-raising - will provide for the cost of the Central Library Plan while also resulting in an additional $10 million to $15 million per year (from sale proceeds and operating efficiencies). These are critical funds we would otherwise not have, which will be spent on library priorities. These include hiring more curators and librarians, and adding to the research collections, financing for which has declined dramatically over the last decade.
Q.
With the influx of many more people each year into the main library, what measures will be taken to ensure that scholars and researchers who are there to engage in serious work -- that is reading books, not surfing the internet -- will be able to do so in peace and quiet? Will reading areas be distinctly separated from cafe-oriented spaces? And will the special reading rooms currently in operation -- the art-history reading room, for example -- remain untouched?
A.
Preserving quiet spaces - for researchers and writers who come to work at the Library, for users who want peaceful places where they can read and for visitors hoping to immerse themselves in our exhibitions and more - is of utmost importance. As we open up rooms that are currently off-limits to the public, the redesigned building will have more quiet areas, in both our historic spaces and the inspiring new ones.
Clear delineations of space will be made throughout the building. Research areas will be on the upper floors of the building. The third floor's treasured and majestic Rose Main Reading Room, as well as the special reading rooms you mention, will remain as they are. The second floor will have expanded spaces for scholars and writers (with the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers remaining the crown jewel), who have been working with essentially unchanged facilities for well over a decade. Now, in addition to new open desk and carrel areas, we will provide personal shelves for researchers to hold their books, skilled librarians who can suggest materials to open up even more research possibilities, a researchers' lounge, and more. We expect to accommodate at least 400 writers and researchers who will benefit from these enhanced offerings.
More highly trafficked areas - like those containing the circulating collections, public programming spaces and a cafe should there be one - would be on the lower floors. In addition, the new circulating library will have its own street-level entrance separate from the Fifth Avenue entrance. A key focus of the overall design will be the incorporation of traffic flows that accommodate all of our visitors and their diverse needs.
Q.
At the NYPL Performing Arts research site in Lincoln Center, there has been a decimation of specialized librarians and curators over the past few years, and materials have been moved off-site, with waiting times for retrieval of up to a week. There is also talk that NYPL may give up that location entirely. Would you speak to this, either to confirm or deny?
A.
The New York Public Library is proud to be at Lincoln Center, and there is absolutely no plan to move from that space. The library for the Performing Arts (LPA) serves students of all ages whose study includes the performing arts, those whose profession is to research and interpret the arts, and those who are producing new works of art, as well as those who are interested in the arts. LPA works to ensure that the performing arts are well documented, and we are committed to acquiring, exposing, preserving and animating those collections so users can continue to be inspired and new knowledge can be created and shared.
The Central Library Plan benefits researchers and the collections of all of our research centers, including LPA, by financing the long-term preservation of physical objects, by providing better inventory control of collection items, and by improving the library's online catalog. For starters, readers will have the ability to order materials online in advance of their visit to the library.
The library is already improving its systems for requesting and delivering those collection materials now housed off-site. We will be increasing the number of retrieval staff and instant downloading options; and we have just added Saturday delivery for off- site materials. Most important, it is our goal to guarantee 24-hour delivery of requested materials, even before the completion of the Central Library Plan.
Researchers at LPA, SIBL and the Schomburg Center will also benefit from the extra resources generated by the Central Library Plan, which can be used for a range of Library priorities. All units of NYPL have experienced staff reductions in these difficult times. Thus, one of our key priorities is to increase the number of specialist staff - curators and experts who can assist researchers with their in-depth knowledge of the collections, at LPA and elsewhere.
Q.
Though both research libraries and circulating branches are financed with public money, doesn't the bulk of the financing for the research libraries come from private donations, whereas the circulating branches exist solely by public funding? If this is true, wouldn't putting a large circulating component in the 42nd Street library offset the need to always search for private funds? 
Although the Central Library Plan will generate substantial financial benefits for NYPL (see question 2), helping to restore much of what we have had to cut back, we still depend on and will have great need for private support and endowment building (our endowment is far, far below those of other great research and university libraries of the world) to maintain and enhance the resources and services we provide.
While, as you say, the bulk of research library financing comes from private donations, a substantial amount - 21 percent - does come from the city. Conversely, private financing also contributes significantly to the branch libraries, particularly for enhanced programming for children and teenagers as well as adult literacy.
To clarify, the breakdown of funding sources goes beyond the uses of a given library building. So, even with a circulating library in 42nd Street, there are research functions like curatorial staffing and research acquisitions, that cannot be paid for by City branch funds.
Q.
You have mentioned that preservation is a concern in the current research stacks. How much would it cost to update the stacks, maybe installing high-density stacks with the appropriate technology? Also, I had trouble finding books at the research library and a librarian said that they were already being moved offsite to make way for your plan. Does that mean that the plan is already underway? 
A.
It is critical that the library updates the way it preserves materials. The above-ground stacks were considered state of the art in 1911, but are now woefully outdated. A stable environment for the preservation of paper-based materials cannot be achieved in the central stacks as they are constructed, so it is not a matter of updating them with newer technology. The most cost-effective and efficient way to preserve our materials properly is to ensure that they are safeguarded in modern, specially designed preservation and access facility.
Already, about a half of our research collections are located offsite, for both space and preservation reasons. The reality is that we have a finite amount of space in our 42nd Street building. Because we are always acquiring new materials - an essential function of any world-class research facility - items must continually be moved offsite to make room. We constantly evaluate our holdings for titles that are never requested, as well as those easily available elsewhere or digitally.
As for the books you had trouble finding, it is possible you requested them during a one- time processing period when volumes are moved. In these cases it may take up to two weeks for books to become available again; a due date is cited in the online catalog.
Q.
Currently, nothing leaves the 42nd Street building. I'm concerned about protecting the research collections from theft, etc., once there's a circulating library in the same building. One of the wonderful things about the place is its openness -- the building is now open seven days a week and anyone from anywhere can request and use its resources. The NYPL's Library of the Performing Arts has both circulating and research collections, but you have to make an appointment to use the research materials; hours for researchers are limited; and personal items must be checked before entering the reading room. How could you protect 42nd Street's resources without imposing similar restrictions there? 
You raise an excellent question we identified early in the planning process. Rather than simply replicating the bag-search security process we have in place now at 42nd Street and at our major circulating libraries, we intend to use the design process to explore whether we can use new processes or technologies to both improve security measures (for research and circulating collections) and make them less invasive for patrons.
As stated above (question 4), the delineation of spaces within the building will assist with the security of the collections. At the same time, opening up more public space will enhance the openness you describe. Additionally, while in use, research collections will continue to be charged out to individual researchers. Rare and unique works that are in the Library's special collections will continue to be kept safe and secure while remaining accessible to those who need them on-site.
Q.
What do you define as the mission of the NYPL in an era where there is increasing access to information. Since the role of libraries as repositories of information will, and perhaps even should, decline as a information access becomes more open, is the role of the NYPL to: a) serve the needs of those who don't have internet access b) teach people how to access and evaluate information c) help organize information so it is easier to find and connect to other information? 
A.
We remain committed to the core mission of the library - to provide all New Yorkers and library users with free, open access to the world of information and knowledge. However, in today's rapidly changing world of new technologies, how we fulfill that mission must expand.
As you note, we play an increasingly crucial role in providing computers and Internet access to patrons who have no other alternatives for getting online. In addition, we are exploring how to increase the availability of free content for all: books for digital reading, unparalleled collections in digital formats, databases for research and job help, and more.
Our computer skills courses are filled to capacity, and our goal is to offer many more classes throughout our branches. In addition, we are working on providing tools to help users better navigate online resources; catalog interfaces allowing students in public schools, some without libraries, to order books from our system; and numerous other web improvements.
Especially in today's sea of content, NYPL's curatorial expertise is critical. Whether it's in physical libraries or through our Web offerings, we serve a vital role as the trusted source people everywhere can depend on. Thus, librarians are more important than ever to help patrons find the information they seek as well as the information they didn't even know existed. And our libraries are more important than ever as active centers of learning, ideas and inspiration, where people of all ages and economic backgrounds can come together to find the resources and tools they need to find their way, whether through the Library's archives and collections, exhibitions, public computers, eBooks, community programs, free ESOL classes, or homework help.
Our charge is clear: NYPL must remain - even as we evolve - the essential provider of free educational resources for New Yorkers and people the world over.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Files Charges Against Father and Son, and Twin Brothers

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: The Securities and Exchange Commission brought two separate fraud cases on Friday that involved family members, including one in which twin brothers claimed they had a stock-picking robot named Marl. 

 BODY:
Securities fraud cases, at least on Friday, were a family affair. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission said it has charged a Boston-based father and son, both hedge fund managers, and their firms with securities fraud for misleading investors about their investment strategy and performance. 
On Friday, the agency also said it has charged twin brothers from England with defrauding thousands of investors through an Internet-based pump-and-dump scheme in which they used two Web sites to promote a fake "stock picking robot" named Marl that the twins claimed could spot hot penny stocks. 
In the latter case, the S.E.C. alleges that Alexander John Hunter and Thomas Edward Hunter started the stock promotion business in 2007, when they were 16 years old. The two claimed they had a robot that was developed by a programmer connected to the now-defunct Global Alpha Fund, a Goldman Sachs fund that relied on computer-driven trading strategies. Instead, the S.E.C. claims, the brothers were simply pumping up stocks they were being paid to promote. 
"Their claims were persuasive as the Hunters received at least $1.2 million from investors primarily in the U.S. who paid $47 apiece for annual newsletter subscriptions," the S.E.C. said. 
However, the agency says that the twins created another Web site, Equitypromoter.com, where they marketed their newsletter subscriber list to penny-stock promoters, claiming they could promote stocks to this list. "The Hunters were consequently paid at least $1.865 million in fees from known or suspected stock promoters, and they did not disclose to their newsletter followers the conflicting relationship between their two businesses," the S.E.C. said. 
A lawyer for the twins did not return a call for comment. 
In the father-and-son case, the S.E.C. alleged that Gabriel Bitran and Marco Bitran raised millions of dollars for their hedge funds through GMB Capital Management and GMB Capital Partners by "falsely telling investors they had a lengthy track record of success based on actual trades using real money. In truth, the Bitrans knew the track record was based on back-tested hypothetical simulations." 
In its complaint, the agency said that over three years, the Bitrans raised more than $500 million for eight hedge funds and various managed accounts. But GMB hedge funds were investing predominantly in other hedge funds, including ones that had invested with Bernard L. Madoff, the Ponzi scheme operator, according to the S.E.C. The funds suffered huge losses, the SEC said, leaving investors holding the bag. Their hedge funds were founded in 2007, just a year before the onset of the financial crisis. 
The Bitrans agreed to be barred from the securities industry and pay $4.8 million to settle the SEC's charges. A lawyer for Gabriel Bitran said his client was "pleased to have a settlement with the SEC is able to put this matter behind him." A lawyer representing Marco Bitran and the GMB entities made similar comments.

HEADLINE: The Challenges in Hedging Tail Risk

BYLINE: ALAN GERSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Alan Gerstein of BlueMountain Capital Management notes that fewer and fewer market participants are willing or able to sell long-term put options despite demand from investors. 

 BODY:
If there's one word investors use to describe the markets over the past few years, it's unpredictable. Unforeseen events were everywhere. 
Last year we had the Japanese tsunami and the Arab Spring, followed by the debt ceiling standoff in the United States and the subsequent credit rating downgrade. Even for a "predictable" event, like the European sovereign debt crisis, each twist seemed to catch investors off guard. 
What will take us by surprise in 2012? Will it be military conflict in the Middle East, a slowdown in growth in China, continued stress in Europe, or something else we are not yet thinking about? 
This uncertainty is unwelcome to those still recovering from the financial crisis, which not only frayed investors' nerves, but left many portfolios in a precarious state. Some investors, like underfunded pension funds, have limited ability to withstand another market shock. Given this backdrop and these fears, "tail risk" hedging, or protecting investment portfolios against extreme negative moves in the market, has been a frequent topic of conversation among market participants.
Buying put options is currently the most popular form of "tail risk" hedging. Despite the growing demand to buy long-term put options from both institutional and individual investors, fewer and fewer market participants are willing or able to sell these options. Whereas an option buyer's risk is limited to the premium they pay, an option seller has much greater risk. 
With the coming arrival of the Volcker Rule, which seeks to reduce excessive risk at banks, banks need to decrease the amount of long-dated options they will sell. In addition, regulatory changes have increased the amount of collateral required for these trades, further constraining the number of option sellers. One example is Berkshire Hathaway, which has historically been a significant seller of long-dated put options on the United States equity markets. Berkshire stated in its annual letter than it plans to stop selling options because of regulatory changes.
The increased demand to buy put options (which are priced in terms of implied volatility), coupled with a lack of people willing and able to sell them, has led to excessively high volatility prices, especially in longer-dated maturities. 
With the increase in the price of volatility, the cost of portfolio protection has also increased, causing prospective hedgers to often overpay for this insurance. Consider the price of general insurance (home, medical, car, flood, etc.) as a simple example. People buy this type of insurance to protect against the loss from a particular event. Typically, buying it is not expensive because the insurance will be paid out infrequently, if at all. 
In the event of the loss, however, the insurance buyer can expect to be paid much more than the annual cost of the insurance. Unfortunately, we cannot currently say the same thing about insuring a stock portfolio against a major loss. For instance, it would cost nearly 4 percent in premium to buy a put option that starts to pay off after the market falls 15 percent over a one-year period. Because of this high cost, the option would lose money until the market fell by 19 percent. And even if the market falls further and the option pays off, the return on premium will be much lower than in the example of general insurance.
As another example of the high cost to buy portfolio protection, consider the price of call options (which benefit from a market rally) relative to the price of put options (which benefit from a market crash). For the same amount of premium, an investor could buy 10 call options on the Standard & Poor's 500 index expiring in six-months with a strike price that is 15 percent above current levels, or just one put option at strike price 15 percent below the current levels.
For investors trying to reach a certain return target, this high cost can be a constant drag on returns, preventing them from meeting return expectations. As seen in the example above, imagine reducing your returns by 4 percent every year to pay for this down-side protection. These types of investors would be better off finding other ways of reducing portfolio risk. Indeed, there are ways for investors with long-dated capital to sell volatility in a protected manner, thereby earning the high premium themselves.
As we continue to experience bouts of volatility in the market, investors will keep searching (unsuccessfully) for the "silver bullet" for hedging tail risk in the financial markets. But when volatility is high, like it was last year, and options become expensive, investors need to pay attention to the costs of protection they are buying. Otherwise, they risk paying too much and missing their return targets even in a rallying market.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $12,600,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: A five-bedroom duplex, on the seventh and eighth floors, has many classic details, including a 28-foot-long foyer. 

 BODY:
A 13-room Park Avenue co-op that sold for $12.6 million was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records.
The transaction at 941 Park is a reminder of the continuing allure of Old World properties at classic addresses, even as flashier new condominiums downtown and on the West Side hit record prices week after week.
At the time 941 Park Avenue was built, in 1928, it represented the height of opulence. In terms of space and details, it can hold its own against many of the newer offerings around the city.
"A private elevator vestibule opens to a stately 28-foot-long foyer leading to a magnificently proportioned living room with a wood-burning fireplace," the listing read. "Currently, the master bedroom suite is combined with the adjacent bedroom and is used as a custom-fitted dressing room."
The owners of the apartment, Morad Ghadamian, a carpet importer, and his wife, Sima, sought $12.9 million when they listed their five-bedroom home, a duplex on the seventh and eighth floors.
The buyers were Lance Rosen, a hedge fund manager, and his wife, Diane, according to city records. 
Dolly Lenz, a top broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, handled the sale. She said the Rosens had considered good karma to be an important element in the sale. Sellers and buyers met and liked each other, which helped to seal the deal.
"They saw the happiness in the family that was selling," Ms. Lenz said. "And they only wanted to buy something where there was not a negative story attached, like a divorce or something."
In the past, 941 Park has attracted some of the city's wealthiest and most influential people, including the NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw and the Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein, both of whom recently sold their homes in the building.
Meanwhile, although the $12.6 million deal was the week's largest sale of an apartment to a new owner, another transaction topped it.
Clementina S. Flaherty, an author who recently went through a high-profile divorce from William Flaherty, a zinc magnate, secured control of the couple's duplex apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue for $13 million.
Considering that the two, when still together in 2008, had briefly listed the 10-room apartment in the Rosario Candela building for $43 million, it seems that Ms. Flaherty's $13 million investment could be worth her while, should she decide to move on.

In Today's Times:

        
While Congressional redistricting has not created many new districts for Republicans, it has given them a boost in another way: by forcing several Democrats into retirement in the face of tough battles in newly drawn districts. With 56 House seats left without incumbents, both parties have turned to the maps, searching for potential victories, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Global finance leaders meet in Washington this weekend to talk unemployment, oil prices and other economic issues amid growing anxiety that the recent, fragile recovery could fall apart, Annie Lowrey reports.

        
Adjusting to Mitt Romney's status as the presumptive Republican nominee, his campaign is poised for a major expansion of its outreach and manpower. But with that growth comes the challenge of keeping Mr. Romney's famously disciplined operation running smoothly, Ashley Parker reports.

        
With many Congressional Democrats joining Republicans in support of the Keystone pipeline, President Obama finds himself threatening to veto legislation embraced by more and more members of his own party, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Senator Marco Rubio of Florida appealed to the conscience of his Republican colleagues Thursday, asking them to back a compromise that would offer young illegal immigrants a path to legal status, as the party worries it could lose Hispanic voters in November, Jonathan Weisman reports.

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Speaking this week at a forum organized by Fortune magazine in Southern California, Alan R. Mulally, president and chief executive of Ford, said the automaker expected its coming Focus Electric to sell in low volumes initially, but to gain buyers as public attitudes toward E.V.'s shifted. During a Q&A period, Mr. Mulally said that 23 kilowatt-hour battery packs typically used for purely electric vehicles cost "around $12,000 to $15,000." He did not say that the price range applied specifically to the pack used on the Focus Electric. (Fortune)
 Infiniti announced Friday that it would produce two undisclosed models in China beginning in 2014. The luxury arm of Nissan has had a presence in the Chinese market since 2007, but has assembled its vehicles outside the country. The models will be produced at a plant shared with Nissan's joint partner in China, Dongfeng Motor. (Infiniti)
 The Motorcycle Industry Council, a nonprofit trade association, reported that sales of road-going scooters and motorcycles increased nearly 9 percent in the first quarter of 2012 relative to the similar period last year. Recovering sales lost to the recession, however, would be a lengthy process. Just 441,000 off-road and road-going cycles were sold in 2011, compared with nearly 950,000 in 2007, the group noted. (The Los Angeles Times)
 New York City is expected to adopt a new version of the yellow wheel boot used to disable vehicles that have accumulated a significant number of unpaid traffic or parking violations. The PayLock SmartBoot would be deactivated by a motorist after the offender payed outstanding fines over the phone with a credit card, or in person at a payment center. The motorist would be responsible for returning the boot to a payment center or face further penalties. (The New York Daily News)

HEADLINE: As States Lock In to Movie Stars' Taxes, California Tries to Cope

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: A large share of celebrities income tax has been slipping off to places like Georgia, Louisiana and Massachusetts as those states and others use film production incentives to lure some of Hollywood's most-expensive movie shoots. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Movie stars are a famously mobile group. Their tax dollars have been moving around, too.
By and large, the biggest stars still live here. Whether seen on TMZ.com or in the clubs on Sunset Drive, Will Smith, Robert Downey Jr., Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and perhaps two-thirds of the film industry's top earners appeared to spend enough time in Los Angeles - their Manhattan townhouses and getaway homes in Belize notwithstanding - to be domiciled here for tax purposes.
But a large share of their income tax has been slipping off to places like Georgia, Louisiana and Massachusetts. Those states and others have used film production incentives to lure some of Hollywood's most-expensive movie shoots, including "Iron Man 3," which will be partly shot later this year in North Carolina. As much as 60 percent of Southern California's location work has been moved to other locales since the 1990s.
In return - with some variation in the way laws are structured and enforced around the country - the host states get to tax what the stars and others are paid for their time working there. And some of those states are keeping a sharper eye on movie income.
Beginning next January, for instance, Georgia will insist that production companies withhold money for state taxes from payments made to stars and filmmakers through their personal corporations. "They have always been required to pay," said Stefanie Paupeck, a spokeswoman for Georgia's department of economic development. But by withholding taxes, the new law makes sure the rich and famous don't forget that requirement when they are back on the beach in Malibu.
So what's left for California? Leftovers.
Though facing enormous budget shortfalls, Hollywood's home state gets to collect only the difference between its own tax rate - which tops out at 10.3 percent on annual income of more than $1 million - and those of the states or foreign governments that are siphoning off location work. The celebrities contacted for this article either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to provide details on their salaries and taxes.
If Ms. Aniston, for instance, paid 6 percent of her salary to the State of Georgia for the time she spent there working on "Wanderlust," then California, where she lives, got no more than 4.3 percent. If George Clooney sent 11 percent of his salary for location work on "The Descendants" to Hawaii, which had the country's highest state tax when the film was shot there in 2010, California got none of it.
That might change if a state tax proposal endorsed by Gov. Jerry Brown gets signed into law. The measure, whose backers are gathering signatures for a ballot measure, would assess sharply higher taxes on those earning more than $250,000 a year, with the rate on incomes of more than $1 million reaching 13.3 percent. It would be the nation's highest state tax rate.
In theory, the new rate would guarantee California at least a chunk of every Hollywood-based superstar's salary - even after other states get their cut. In fact, California's former governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, could pay New Mexico 4.9 percent for his work there on "The Last Stand," an action movie set for release by Lionsgate next year, and still have 8.4 percent - more than the top income tax in 43 states - left for California.
All high earners, not just movie stars, would be affected by the tax. So it's unlikely Mr. Brown had celebrities in mind when he agreed last month to join the backers of a tax plan pushing for an ultrahigh rate on the wealthy, while adding a quarter percent to the state sales tax, which is already the nation's highest at 7.25 percent (there is also an additional rate that varies among local jurisdictions).
After all, collecting an additional 3 percent on the income earned by the entertainment industry's 25 top-paid stars, which was just under $700 million from May 2010 to May 2011, according to Forbes Magazine, would add only about $21 million to California's coffers. That is about 0.3 percent of the $7.6 billion in revenue the proposal's backers say it will raise annually, or about 0.4 percent of a smaller take predicted by the state's legislative analyst.
There is risk, too, that the high rate will nudge a few more of the high earners to establish residency elsewhere, though California's taxing authorities are "very aggressive" in making sure that any change of homes is not simply a tax dodge, said Michael H. Starler, a tax specialist in Los Angeles with the Greenberg Traurig law firm.
"They hate losing taxpayers," said Mr. Starler, who added that spending nine months a year here created an automatic presumption that California was home.
Still, Sandra Bullock, estimated by Forbes to have earned $15 million for the year that ended in May 2011, has a home in Texas, where there is no income tax. A spokeswoman for Ms. Bullock did not respond to a query as to whether the actress is a legal resident of Texas.
And Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who made $50 million between them by the Forbes count (which tries to best assess what remain closely guarded numbers), have a home in Louisiana, where the tax rate is 6 percent.
"There's nothing more mobile than rich people," said Kris Vosburgh, the executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, which opposes the new rates.
To date, stars have figured only marginally in the politics of the tax debate. Even Mr. Schwarzenegger so far has not taken a position on the tax, said his adviser, Adam Mendelsohn. But Hollywood endorsements were generally missing from a long list of supporters that includes public employees and teachers unions, church groups and immigrant advocates, among others.
"All Californians have a stake in making sure our schools have adequate funding, and recent studies show that tax increases on wealthy individuals in other states did not result in an emigration of millionaires," said Gil Duran, a spokesman for Jerry Brown. "Besides, the commute from Cheyenne, Wyo., to Sunset Boulevard is long, lonely and inconvenient."
That is not to say the stars will not rally behind Mr. Brown, who enjoyed considerable support from Hollywood in his 2010 election campaign.
Then, again, they may just follow Ben Stiller.
More than a year ago, Mr. Stiller moved back to New York, to work on Broadway and enjoy life in the suburbs.
There, the locals may complain about high taxes, especially when New York City levies are thrown in. But with its income tax rate of just under 9 percent- a third lower than what is proposed in the Golden State - the State of New York could soon be viewed as a tax haven.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. National Committee Warmly Embraces Romney

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is not yet the official nominee, but the Republican National Committee treated him that way on Friday. 

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- If any crowd would be expected to noisily receive Mitt Romney, it is the 50 leaders of the state Republican Parties -- stalwarts careful not to make an endorsement during the primary season, but whose every fiber is tied to the success of the nominee. 
At a gathering of the Republican National Committee here on Friday, they stood and cheered for long minutes when Mr. Romney entered a hotel meeting room and took his seat at a lunch table, even before he was formally introduced. 
The pomp of the convention is months away. But Mr. Romney was welcomed in every way as the official Republican nominee by his party's leaders, and he responded in kind, commending former rivals in the primaries "who had the courage to run for president on our side of the aisle this year.''
Even while acknowledging that "some are still running,'' Mr. Romney went on to thank each by name. 
"You know their names,'' he added, but went on to mention them, after pulling out a piece of paper. "It's such a long enough list that I wrote it down,'' he said. "Michele Bachmann and Tim Pawlenty, Jon Huntsman and Herman Cain and Rick Perry and Ron Paul and Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich -- thank you to this extraordinary team.'' 
Mr. Romney gave a 30-minute version of his stump speech, a preview of how he will forcefully campaign against President Obama, saying he has failed to improve the lives of middle-class Americans. He cited statistics about high unemployment, job losses by women, a decline in the median income and record levels of Americans on food stamps. 
He portrayed the president as well meaning but out of his depth. 
"Now I happen to have met him, four or five years ago at a dinner in Washington, D.C., where we were both invited to tell some jokes about our respective parties,'' he recalled. "And I found him to be a nice guy. I think he's a nice person; I just don't think we can afford him any longer.''
The economic indicators that Mr. Romney cites do suggest distress, but in most cases the numbers have been gradually getting better, and the general election is likely to come down to whether Americans feel that the country is on a sustained upward arc. 
Senator John McCain, the party's failed 2008 nominee, acknowledged this in introducing Mr. Romney. He predicted a razor-close election. "I believe we're going to be up late on election night,'' he said. 
Mr. McCain, who endorsed Mr. Romney the day after the Iowa caucuses in January, urged the party leaders to work hard to get out the vote. 
"Every day we're not out there campaigning, rounding up folks for Mitt Romney to be president, is a day lost,'' he said.

HEADLINE: DealBook's Week in Review: A Rising Debate on Inequality

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES


HIGHLIGHT: A look back on eye-popping pay packages and more in our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
Beating profits estimates is no longer enough for Wall Street chiefs looking to earn million-dollar raises. That was the message delivered this week from Dallas, New York and London. 
Rebukes against the giant paychecks handed out inside financial firms have been gathering momentum from sources beyond the Occupy Wall Street protesters. Citigroup shareholders, the managers of Sequoia Fund and the big British bank Barclays all took steps to limit the compensation of top bank executives. 
 Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Nelson D. Schwartz reported that companies should brace for more shareholder denunciations. Bank of America, whose shares have struggled, holds its annual meeting May 9.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Accord In Lawsuit Is Challenged

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Lawyers leading a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan against the directors of Bank of America over its purchase of Merrill Lynch have agreed to settle the matter for $20 million even though damages in the case could reach $5 billion, according to plaintiffs in a parallel suit against the bank's board in Delaware.
Calling the settlement grossly inadequate and the result of collusion, the lawyers in the Delaware case have asked P. Kevin Castel, the judge overseeing the New York matter, to order the parties agreeing to the deal to justify its terms. 
If the settlement is approved by the Manhattan court, all damage claims made in the Delaware suit would be extinguished. That matter is scheduled to go to trial in October.
The settlement was struck privately on April 12 by lawyers representing two public employee pension funds that had sued the directors of Bank of America for breach of fiduciary duty. The funds are the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System and the Hollywood (Florida) Police Officers' Retirement System.
At issue in both the federal and state suits is whether Bank of America's board breached its duty to shareholders in approving the 2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch for $50 billion and whether it misled investors about the brokerage firm's weakening financial condition leading up to the purchase.
Struck during the depths of the financial crisis by Kenneth D. Lewis, then Bank of America's chief executive, the Merrill deal generated billions of dollars in losses at the bank. Those losses led to Bank of America's second request for bailout money under the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program.
According to the lawyers in the Delaware case, the $20 million deal is inadequate in several ways. First, the amount does not come close to the $150 million fine paid by the bank in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission suit over the Merrill deal.
Jed S. Rakoff, the federal judge overseeing that matter, said the evidence showed that the bank's disclosures to shareholders about losses and employee bonuses at Merrill were inadequate. Judge Rakoff had rejected the initial proposal by the bank and the S.E.C. to settle the case for $33 million, calling it a contrivance at the expense of shareholders.
The Manhattan court deal is also objectionable, the lawyers in the Delaware case said, because it would not require the directors to dig into their own pockets. The bank's insurance policies extend well beyond the $20 million cost, the papers said, although the exact coverage was redacted in the filing.
A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment.
In addition, the court filing contended, the settlement deal is the result of collusion between the lawyers for the bank's directors and those representing the pension funds.
The lawyer representing Bank of America's directors approached the New York plaintiffs about a settlement, after negotiations with the Delaware representatives collapsed, the filing noted. The Delaware plaintiffs would not accept a settlement amount within the limits of insurance covering Bank of America's directors. When the Delaware plaintiffs learned of the negotiations with the New York plaintiffs and tried to join, they were met with silence.
Joseph E. White III, a partner at Saxena White, one of the law firms representing the New York plaintiffs, said neither he nor his colleague on the case at Kahn Swick & Foti would comment.
Over the last three years, the lawyers in the Delaware case have conducted extensive discovery, taking 48 depositions, including those of all 16 Bank of America directors at the time of the merger, and their experts estimate the damages at as much as $5 billion.
The lawyers for the Delaware plaintiffs have also taken testimony from investment bankers and financial advisers who opined on the Merrill deal. There are four law firms at work on the Delaware case: Horwitz, Horwitz & Paradis; Chimicles & Tikellis; Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz; and James Evangelista.
By contrast, the lawyers in the New York case have done little fact-finding, the filing contended. They have deposed just two of the bank's directors, for example, and did not determine whether the board members had sufficient assets to contribute to a settlement, the court filing noted.
As such, the lawyers who agreed to the $20 million settlement ''have not taken the depositions of witnesses necessary to prove their claims, and have failed to pursue the production of highly relevant and prejudicial documents,'' lawyers for the Delaware plaintiffs contended.
Such documents were identified during discovery in the Delaware case. For example, the lawyers told the court that they discovered a high-ranking Bank of America official in charge of the Merrill deal had routinely deleted documents in spite of having been advised to hold onto them.
Documents also emerged showing ''threats made by the bank to its financial advisers to remove cautionary language from their fairness opinion in the proxy,'' according to the court filing. Shareholders rely upon fairness opinions when voting to support or reject a merger.
Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. is overseeing the Delaware case, which will not be heard if the proposed settlement goes through.
Mr. Strine has noted in court hearings that the matter involves important issues of state law governing the many companies that are incorporated there.

HEADLINE: Post Offices Face Hurdles In Efforts To Diversify

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Well before online bill paying was popular, the Postal Service in 2000 began operating a secure system that would have allowed it to remain the primary conduit for most Americans' monthly payments. But the Internet industry objected, and Congress successfully pressured the Postal Service to abandon it.
The same pattern has repeated several times over the last decade, with the Postal Service identifying a way to cope with the decline of traditional mail, only to have companies -- and ultimately Congress -- object.
The agency's troubles, which could result in the closing of thousands of post offices and hundreds of mail processing centers as early as next month, have many sources. Some are the inevitable result of technological changes, and others are the result of missteps by the Postal Service. 
But top Postal Service officials and outside experts say that another, underappreciated factor has been an insistence by Congress that the service not compete directly with private companies, even as companies like FedEx and U.P.S. have encroached on the Postal Service's turf.
Now, with the volume of traditional mail plummeting and with the agency on the brink of running out of cash, the Senate is debating a bipartisan bill that would let it enter into several new lines of business, like shipping beer and wine. And it would create a chief innovation officer to identify new lines of electronic business. The Senate is expected to vote as early as next week on whether to advance the legislation.
The bill would also provide retirement incentives intended to cut about 20 percent of the Postal Service's 547,000 workers, allow the service to study the elimination of Saturday deliveries, and recoup more than $11 billion that the Postal Service overpaid into one of its pension funds.
The agency's leaders, however, say that cost-cutting alone will not improve its fortunes and that it must increase revenue.
''A lot of the decline in first-class mail is not going to come back, even if the economy improves,'' said Paul Vogel, the chief marketing and sales officer at the Postal Service. ''We realize that the development of new products and offering new service is going to have to be a critical part of our business model going forward. We can't continue to be your grandfather's post office.''
Of course, businesses have good reason to not want to compete with the giant Postal Service. But their opposition to its expansion leaves the agency in a bind: It must be financially self-sufficient like a business, but it is saddled with the burdens of a government agency, like having to deliver mail to every house in the country. Its carriers, in fact, deliver some FedEx and United Parcel Service packages in a partnership with those companies.
One of the sponsors of the bill, Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, said the legislation has the ''potential to push the Postal Service to innovate and experiment with potentially lucrative new lines of business.''
Officials from the Postal Service declined to comment on the legislation. But the National Association of Letter Carriers, which hired a Wall Street investment bank to examine new lines of business for the Postal Service, called the bill a stopgap measure because it would allow only a handful of new revenue options.
''This bill does not give the Postal Service the freedom and flexibility to come up with new products and services that take advantage of its strengths,'' said Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the letter carriers group. ''It tinkers with a flawed business model that two years down the line Congress is going to have to deal with again.''
The carriers are pushing for more latitude to move into businesses that take advantage of the Postal Service's network of mail routes, like offering banking services in rural post offices.
Since its founding in 1775 as the United States Post Office, with Benjamin Franklin as the original postmaster general, the Postal Service has focused mainly on one thing: delivering the mail. But mail volume, particularly fist-class mail, has dropped sharply, to 168 billion pieces last year from a peak of 213 billion in 2006, because of vast changes in the way Americans communicate, move money and even buy books and music.
The stagnant economy also has not helped. Pessimistic projections put the volume at 118 billion by 2020.
As a result, the service is losing a staggering $36 million a day, after having generated an annual profit as recently as 2006. Because of a Congressional mandate, the service has to pay $5.5 billion annually into a fund for its future retirees, which has added $20 billion in debt since 2007.
The Postal Service is the only federal agency that pre-finances its future retiree health obligations, though the bill would restructure the benefit plan by stretching out the payments over 40 years.
Faced with declining revenue, the Postal Service is asking Congress to allow it to close more than 3,700 post offices and 250 processing centers, and to eliminate Saturday delivery of mail.
In other countries, post offices double as banks or sell insurance or cellphones. In the United States, Congress has barred the Postal Service from entering many of these areas. In the 1990s, forecasting a decline in first-class mail, the Postal Service tried several nonmail products, like phone cards, money transfers and e-mail accounts. But Congress said the ventures created unfair competition for the private sector and did not seem to make much money.
Companies like U.P.S. also objected. According to a 2000 report on the Postal Service's e-commerce activities by the Government Accountability Office, U.P.S.'s position was that ''a government monopoly should not be allowed to use the benefits of its government standing to attack the private sector.'' In 2006, Congress restricted nonpostal activities and told the agency to stick with delivering the mail.
Even so, in 2008, the agency tried to raise additional revenue by selling postal meter cartridges to corporations, branded with its logo. But the plan was shelved after Pitney Bowes, a major supplier of ink cartridges, appealed to postal regulators who answer to Congress, saying that the service would cause ''immediate harm'' to its business.
The Postal Service said that such restrictions might have cost the agency billions. A 2010 report from the Postal Service's inspector general said introducing 10 new products like secure e-mail, electronic bill payment and even some banking services could add $9.7 billion annually to Postal Service revenue, which was $66 billion in 2011. But over half of those products would require a change in legislation.
Lawmakers like Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a co-sponsor of the postal reform bill, support limited changes that would allow the agency to increase revenue, like allowing it to sell hunting and fishing licenses and to lease space in its offices to businesses.
Ms. Collins does not support the Postal Service offering a broader array of services like banking. The agency did offer banking services between 1911 and 1967, aimed at immigrants who were used to using post offices to deposit money and at people who had lost confidence in the banks.
Missteps by the agency have also harmed its ability to enter new areas of business. Audits by the Government Accountability Office show that the agency lost millions in offering electronic commerce services, like money transfers, because the products were poorly marketed.
Art Sackler, chairman of the Coalition for a 21st Century Postal Service, a mailing industry group that includes companies like FedEx, said the Postal Service should stick to its core mission. ''They haven't had a good track record when it comes to developing new lines of business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: When the Supermarket Is a Mile Away

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Studies Question the Pairing of Food Deserts and Obesity'' (front page, April 18):
It is best to avoid simplistic terms like ''food desert'' when solving complex social problems. The Agriculture Department's definition is based on proximity to supermarkets with at least $2 million in yearly sales, suggesting that large stores are the answer, when co-ops, produce stands, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture and food hubs are a critical part of the solution.
Focusing on the absence of supermarkets also detracts from the substantial racial, social and economic inequality at the root of disparate retail environments, making it harder to advocate for substantive policies that create lasting and equitable solutions. 
Moreover, the term ''desert'' stigmatizes low-income communities by suggesting a drought of human and physical capital, ignoring the people and organizations working to create healthier environments.
Indeed, as a new growing season gets under way, urban farmers and gardeners throughout the country are making these so-called deserts bloom.
NEVIN COHEN New York, April 18, 2012
The writer is an assistant professor of environmental studies at the New School.
To the Editor:
Discussion of the problem should acknowledge that healthful produce, especially vegetables, is mostly not ready to eat. The healthy food grocery basket needs to be transported home, a reasonably equipped kitchen is needed for preparation, and the preparer needs a modicum of skill, time and inclination to prepare this healthful food.
SUSAN SCHAIER New York, April 19, 2012
To the Editor:
Your article quotes a RAND Corporation analyst who is the author of one of the ''food desert'' studies as saying that within a couple of miles of almost any urban neighborhood ''you can get basically any type of food.'' This is the basis for questioning the connection between obesity and urban food deserts. The assumption seems to be that all city dwellers can hop into their cars and drive a mile or two, thus gaining access to ''any type of food'' and good nutrition.
But this assumption is false; many if not most low-income city dwellers do not own cars. What are these carless people to do? Should they trudge a mile or more to the supermarket and trudge home again carrying two heavy grocery bags? Factor in a small child or two and the absurdity becomes apparent.
Attributing middle-class suburban resources to low-income city dwellers invalidates the studies' assertions and misleads the public about an important failing in our food system.
MICHAEL A. KRASNER DEBORAH KRASNER Westminster West, Vt., April 18, 2012
The writers are, respectively, co-director of the Taft Institute for Government at Queens College, CUNY, and a cookbook author and food professional.
To the Editor:
Two studies do not rule out that limited access to healthy food may contribute to obesity. But policies that drain food swamps awash in high fat, sugar, salt and calories also warrant consideration. These products are primary causes of the most serious illnesses, including diabetes, heart disease and stroke and are also main sources of profit for America's industrial food system.
In recent decades, television and Internet food advertising to children, the number of outlets selling unhealthy food, and the size of portions of these products have grown sharply. Policies to restrict unhealthy food advertising, limit the number of outlets that sell unhealthy food, and reduce portion size have shown promise in some countries.
While market enthusiasts oppose such measures, leaving children's nutrition to the food industry ensures that high rates of diet-related diseases and the premature deaths they impose will continue.

HEADLINE: Afghan Youth Orchestra Plans to Visit the U.S.

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
One of the best-known facts about music in Afghanistan, at least in the West, is that it wasn't. The Taliban banned it when they took power in 1996, beating musicians, burning instruments and destroying cassette tapes in the name of their severe and extreme vision of Islam. 
But with the Taliban's fall, musical life revived, if slowly, in the shattered country. Ahmad Sarmast, an Afghan native and an expert on his nation's music who was trained in Russia and Australia, opened up a rare entity in 2010: a music school for Afghan children.
Now Mr. Sarmast and an American aide, William Harvey, want to send a youth orchestra to the United States to show the West that its sacrifice of lives and material in Afghanistan ''is not gone in the wind,'' in Mr. Sarmast's words.
Mr. Sarmast and Mr. Harvey, who spoke in an interview on Friday, are in New York this week to work on logistics for the trip and to drum up money and other support to pay for it. The current plan calls for concerts at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Feb. 7 and at Carnegie Hall on Feb. 12.
Mr. Sarmast directs the school, the Afghanistan National Institute of Music. Mr. Harvey, a Juilliard graduate who directs a separate organization -- Cultures in Harmony, which promotes unity through classical music with projects in various countries -- teaches violin at the institute and conducts its Afghan Youth Orchestra.
The institute teaches some 150 young people, about half orphans and street hawkers, Mr. Sarmast said. About 35 of the students are female, important in a country where women face obstacles to education.
The young people study both Western and Afghan instruments (the orchestra includes some) and music theory from both cultures. Many of the Western instruments are donated, and the World Bank provides financial support. Tuition is free.
The cost of the tour is expected to be around $500,000. The Carnegie Corporation of New York has promised $50,000, and the institute has submitted a proposal to the United States Embassy in Kabul for a $350,000 grant, which Mr. Harvey said was likely to come through. The current plan calls for 46 musicians to go, along with a dozen teachers, about half of them Westerners.
Mr. Sarmast said a visit by the orchestra would provide a rare bit of good news about Afghanistan. ''It will be showing to the international community about the love of the Afghan people for music and the positive changes for kids and for girls,'' he added.
Mr. Harvey offered an anecdote in that vein. He said he was invited to play the violin at the wedding of Afghan friends and saw a little boy there playing with a plastic toy in the form of an automatic rifle. After the boy saw Mr. Harvey make music, he shyly tucked the toy rifle under his chin, like a violin.

HEADLINE: Top Score Isn't Enough for Preschooler Seeking Seat in Prime Gifted Programs

BYLINE: By ANNA M. PHILLIPS

 BODY:
''We just said goodbye to our last 175,'' said Donna Taylor, principal of the Brooklyn School of Inquiry, referring to the 175 parents who toured her school in a single day -- the last of the 800 she had shown around the building in the days leading up to Friday, the deadline for families to apply to gifted and talented programs.
But unlike the private school admissions process, in which parents try to charm admissions officers, there is little point in trying to make a good impression on Ms. Taylor. 
On Friday, officials at New York City's Education Department announced that the number of children who earned top scores on the admissions tests for gifted and talented programs had risen by 47 percent this year, virtually assuring that children who were not at the top end of scorers would be shut out of the most selective schools, like Ms. Taylor's.
This was unwelcome news to the parents who had assumed that a score in the 99th percentile would guarantee their child a seat in one of the five most selective schools, which enroll children from across the city. But this year, for every available seat, those schools could see four applications from children who scored in the 99th percentile on the two exams the city uses for gifted and talented admissions.
Technically, the 2,656 preschoolers who scored at or above the 97th percentile this year are all eligible to attend one of the five citywide gifted and talented schools: the Anderson School, the Brooklyn School of Inquiry, TAG Young Scholars, STEM Academy at Public School 85, and NEST+m (New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math). But the number of children earning top scores on the exam has increased competition.
This year, scoring in the 99th percentile qualified a child's family to vie with 1,602 others for 400 seats in citywide schools. This was a 47 percent increase from last year, when 1,089 children scored at or above the 97th percentile, but city officials said they had no plans to open more schools or to add seats.
Those 400 seats are unlikely to go to children who scored below the 99th percentile, except for the siblings of students currently enrolled in a citywide school, who are guaranteed a spot if they score in the top 3 percent.
At the Brooklyn School of Inquiry, the only citywide gifted and talented program in Brooklyn, there has been overwhelming demand for years. The program has 44 open kindergarten seats for next year, and for the third year in a row, all of them will be filled by children who scored in the 99th percentile.
''I feel so bad when parents say, 'My kid got a 97, what do you think?''' Ms. Taylor said. ''And I don't know what to think, but we haven't had any 97s in the last two years.''
As recently as 2010, that was not the case at TAG Young Scholars in Harlem. It had fewer applicants than seats in 2010, so it had room for children in District 4 who scored in the 90th percentile.
But last year, District 4 was given its own gifted and talented program, and TAG Young Scholars got so many applicants that it had room only for students in the 99th percentile, a trend that city officials expect will continue.
The city's Education Department oversees gifted and talented admissions, letting parents submit their ranked preferences and then holding lotteries to determine which children get in.
This year, nearly 5,000 children qualified for gifted and talented kindergarten seats at either a citywide or district school, a 22 percent increase from last year. Those scoring at or above the 90th percentile are eligible for one of the dozens of gifted programs in the five boroughs. Officials said they were still deciding whether they needed to add seats to the district programs.
Since those who score below the 99th percentile have little chance of getting into a citywide school, the Anderson School on the Upper West Side restricts tours to parents of children in that top percentile. STEM Academy in Astoria, Queens, limits tours to parents of children in the 98th and 99th percentiles.
Most of the growth has come from parts of Lower Manhattan, northeastern Queens and southern Brooklyn. By contrast, in one district in the South Bronx, no children qualified for the most selective schools this year.
In Districts 2 and 3, which include most of Manhattan below 110th Street, the number of children in the 99th percentile rose to 549 this year, from 389 last year. In District 20, which encompasses the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Borough Park and part of Sunset Park, the number of top-scoring children more than doubled to 134, from 62.
There are several possible reasons for the increase, including an influx of upper-middle-class families into the public school system -- families who under better economic conditions might have paid to send their children to private schools.
Experts have also suggested that the city is experiencing a boom in private tutoring for school admissions, including gifted and talented programs, which test 4-year-old children.

HEADLINE: Tackling Real Estate in a Do-It-Yourself Approach to I.R.A.'s

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE past couple of years have left many people staring in disbelief at the returns on their individual retirement accounts. Consider last year, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished the year essentially where it started.
So it makes sense that people are looking for ways to earn more for retirement -- or to make up for losses. Yet when I heard that an increasing number of people were moving money from traditional I.R.A.'s to self-directed I.R.A.'s that focused on real estate, I was skeptical that this was a good idea.
First, I wondered, how could this be done with retirement money? Was it even legal? And were people who had worked and saved money for their retirement really putting it into real estate so soon after the bubble burst? 
It turns out there is nothing illegal about using a self-directed account to buy real estate or many other things, for that matter. But this does not mean it is easy. There are dozens of caveats on how to do it, and the specter of running afoul of the Internal Revenue Service looms large. (And to be clear, this is still a niche, with only about 2 percent of the $4.8 trillion in I.R.A.'s in self-directed accounts, according to Equity Trust, one of the big players in the industry.)
This week, a lawsuit was filed against two custodians of self-directed I.R.A.'s, the Equity Trust Company and the Entrust Group, accusing them of failing to do due diligence on investments, even though that is something that custodians do not do.
Still, the investors I spoke with were not starry-eyed evangelists, but pragmatists trying to find an investment that they hoped would appreciate but would certainly provide income from rents.
''I got the year-end statement for my I.R.A. and it was within $2,000 of where it was the year before,'' said Mark Rusnak, a real estate agent in Virginia Beach. ''I thought there has to be a better place to put my money.''
He moved money into a self-directed I.R.A., bought a house this year for $80,000 cash and spent $23,000 more fixing it up. He said it was assessed for $147,000, but he was happier with the $13,200 in yearly rent -- a 13 percent return on his money.
This makes sense, but how many people are willing to bet that real estate will provide a comfortable retirement, especially since the value of their own homes has not yet recovered? Here is a look at what some investors who have become comfortable with this niche are doing.
WHAT The most common kinds of real estate in self-directed I.R.A.'s are apartments and multifamily homes. That should be no surprise. They can easily be rented out.
But Kurt Amundson, who sells insurance and real estate in Minnewaska, Minn., said that type of investment seemed too labor intensive to him. So in 2010, he bought an 80-acre parcel of farmland in Iowa. When the price appreciated, he sold it in 2011 for a $50,000 profit, bought a 120-acre plot in a different part of the state and rented out half to a local farmer.
''I looked more for land because I felt it was easier to find a renter,'' Mr. Amundson said. ''I'm also not too handy. An apartment complex wouldn't fit into my comfort zone.''
Roger Voisinet, a real estate agent and the former men's hockey coach at the University of Virginia, made a different sort of purchase based on his expertise: he bought part of an ice-skating rink. The rink, Main Street Arena in Charlottesville, Va., where he had coached the team, was on the verge of closing. He got together with six other investors and committed $300,000 of his own money.
''I wondered how I was going to get the money to do that,'' Mr. Voisinet said. ''I was told I could transfer the money from my I.R.A. through a simple form.'' He set up a self-directed I.R.A. with Equity Trust.
Since that investment in 2010, Mr. Voisinet, who developed an interest in solar energy as a student at Miami University in Ohio, said he pushed to get a grant to put solar panels on the roof to power the arena. He has also bought three other pieces of real estate for his I.R.A.: rental houses in Jacksonville, Fla., and Charlottesville, and a mortgage on a medical building.
WHY Lorraine Walls, 56, and her husband, Richard, 47, recently adopted a 7-year-old girl and three 8-year-old boys. The couple, who live in Midlothian, Va., not far from Richmond, decided to use their retirement money to buy homes in southwest Florida as security for their children should anything happen to them.
They now own seven homes, all in Lehigh Acres, Fla., through their I.R.A.'s, accounting for about half their retirement money. The homes are 2,500 to 3,000 square feet, and they bought them for about a quarter of what the original owners paid.
''The best one was completely tiled with granite,'' she said. ''The poor guy paid $289,000 for it; I paid $60,000.'' She said two months of rent covered their taxes, insurance and property management fees, with the rest going back into their I.R.A.
When they said three of the homes were on the same street, I asked if that level of concentration scared them. On the contrary, Mrs. Walls said, the neighbors looked after one another to keep the street from deteriorating like many around them.
Greg Rand, a former real estate agent and now chief executive of OwnAmerica, a company that teaches people how to invest in real estate, said he was an advocate of using real estate as an alternative way to finance college educations. He bought a condominium for both of his children when they were born.
''I didn't care what they were worth in 2007,'' he said. ''I care what they're worth in 2019.'' By then, he said, both condos will be paid off from a mix of rental income and money he has put in.
HOW Like any I.R.A., a self-directed one comes with plenty of rules. It must be held at a custodian. The legal title of a home must be in the name of the I.R.A.
Any expenses incurred on the property need to be paid by the I.R.A., just as all income generated from rent or the sale of a property need to stay in the I.R.A.
Jeffrey Desich, chief executive of Equity Trust, the custodian for $11 billion of self-directed I.R.A.'s, said most of its clients were in their 40s or 50s and had accumulated enough in retirement accounts to put a portion into a self-directed I.R.A. and buy a property outright.
''The typical account comes from a rollover I.R.A. from corporate America,'' he said. ''The second-most-popular type is from someone who is self-employed.''
His company provides tax documents just as Schwab or Fidelity does, he said. Unlike them, it offers an online bill-paying function for expenses under $5,000. ''We're subject to the same rules they are,'' he said.
He said the average account size was $100,000 to $125,000, with an annual management fee of $300 to $400. But he noted that a nontraditional investment was going to be more time-intensive -- hence the name, self-directed. And the investor is going to be responsible for evaluating the worth of the investment, without any safety net.
PROBLEMS While there is no I.R.S. statement about self-directed I.R.A.'s, there is a rule against ''prohibited transactions.''
''Among other things, this means the property held by the I.R.A. can't be for your own use or that of a family member, and you can't buy the property from yourself with the I.R.A.,'' said Eric Smith, a spokesman for the I.R.S.
Mr. Rusnak, the real estate agent in Virginia Beach, said he knew he could not pay himself a commission on the house he bought. He also made sure that all the bills for the renovation were paid by the I.R.A. and that the tenant had his lease with the I.R.A.
The I.R.S. penalties for mistakes are severe. ''If you do something that is a prohibited transaction, you could invalidate the I.R.A., and that makes it payable to you as ordinary income,'' said Richard S. Aronson, director of special fiduciary services at PNC Wealth Management. ''If the I.R.A. owner directly or indirectly achieves a benefit from the assets, that's a red flag and a big problem.''
Mr. Amundson owns his farmland half inside his I.R.A. and half outside it so that he can hunt white-tailed deer on the property. He said he was aware of the I.R.S. rules and careful to keep his hunting land separate from the rented land.
Then, there is the issue of what to do with the rental income. Presumably, when that income reaches a certain amount, the owner would invest it in more real estate. But until that point, the money could just be sitting there. Mr. Desich said Equity Trust deposits rental money at federally insured banks, which pay close to zero in interest.
But those trying this type of investment believe the returns are worth the more stringent guidelines. At the least, they will own something tangible when they reach retirement.
''I don't plan on selling any of them,'' Mr. Voisinet said of his properties. ''I think of every one like an annuity.''

HEADLINE: At Meeting, Myanmar Looks To Japan for Investment

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TOKYO (AP) -- Myanmar's president told Japanese business leaders on Friday that his country was eager for their investment as it carried out political and economic reforms. 
President Thein Sein of Myanmar, visiting Tokyo for this weekend's summit meeting between the leaders of Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, said Japanese investment and skills were needed to help shrink the economic gap that existed between less developed and more developed countries in Southeast Asia.
Japanese companies have held back from investing in Myanmar in recent years because they did not want to upset relations with the United States and the European Union, which have imposed sanctions on the country. Another factor was the lack of transparency in laws governing business and foreign investment.
There have been moves toward the lifting of Western sanctions as the nominally civilian government has begun to carry out a series of political and economic changes over the past year.
This month, Myanmar unshackled its currency from government controls with the introduction of a managed float for the exchange rate. ''We are going through political and economic changes, and we are also setting up special economic zones,'' Mr. Thein Sein said. ''We welcome Japanese corporate investment in this opportunity.''
Asian investors and international tourists have started to flock to the country recently, and a number of Japanese companies have started projects and expressed interest in doing business in Myanmar. Although it is a poor country, it has an abundance of natural resources.
''There was a political barrier until now, but that's falling,'' said Eitaro Kojima, an official at the Japan External Trade Organization. ''I expect investment will accelerate from here on out.''
By strengthening its ties with Myanmar and other countries in Southeast Asia, Japan is also looking to counter China's growing influence in the region.

HEADLINE: The Global Economy at Risk

 BODY:
Anxieties about Europe dominated this week's meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Fund officials warned that the euro-zone crisis poses a grave danger to a weak global economy. Europe's leaders, masters of denial, are still insisting on destructive austerity. 
The danger was underscored by the latest Brookings Institution-Financial Times index of global economic recovery. The index, which measures economic and financial activity as well as confidence, shows that the world economy has deteriorated since last fall.
Europe has been hard hit by its leaders' continued insistence on austerity for all. The United States is doing better, though it is still vulnerable to rising oil prices or deep recession in Europe. Growth slowed in China and the major emerging economies largely because of the lack of robust recovery elsewhere.
Perhaps even more telling, the global index would have fallen further but for upticks in financial conditions and confidence after the European Central Bank injected liquidity into the euro-zone banks. But investors have already figured out those interventions are too small, especially when combined with policies that only cripple growth. Most recently, they have turned against Spain.
At the meetings this week, several of the Group of 20 economies pledged $430 billion to nearly double the I.M.F.'s ability to make loans. That could bolster the European bailout fund, but not all of that will be for Europe. And more would be needed if large European economies, like Spain, have to be rescued.
At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other European politicians continue to resist the advice of I.M.F. officials, including the sensible call for euro-zone members to issue bonds backed by all members. That would ease borrowing for Spain and others. But Ms. Merkel and her voters are still insisting their neighbors must pay for their sins with even deeper budget cuts.
Never mind that Spain is in trouble because of the bursting of a Spanish housing bubble, not because of government overspending. And never mind that too much austerity in Greece, which undeniably overspent, is backfiring. Budget cuts in the face of recession only further cripple growth and tax revenues, increasing debt burdens.
Changing minds will not be easy. The Times's Annie Lowrey and Jack Ewing reported this week that confronted at the meetings with calls to moderate their austerity stance, German officials countered that Washington and others were making insufficient progress with financial reform. That is true, but off point.
The way forward in Europe and the United States is the same: near-term efforts to ease crises and stimulate demand coupled with serious plans to improve national budgets as the economy recovers. Until Europe's leaders figure that out, the global economy will remain at risk.

HEADLINE: Earnings Help Markets, but Day Ends Mixed

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market on Friday was helped by solid earnings from McDonald's, General Electric and Microsoft, but declines in banks and technology shares pulled indexes down from their day's highs. 
The Nasdaq fell as SanDisk led a drop in semiconductor shares after its second revenue warning in two quarters.
Apple stock fell more than 2.4 percent as shares continue to struggle ahead of earnings next week. Apple shares posted back-to-back weekly declines of more than 4 percent for the first time since late December 2008.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 65.16 points, or 0.50 percent, to 13,029.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.61 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,378.53. The Nasdaq composite dropped 7.11 points, or 0.24 percent, to 3,000.45.
For the week, the Dow gained 1.4 percent, the S.& P. 500 added 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.4 percent, down for a third week running.
As earnings season moves into high gear, the first wave of corporate results has been substantially stronger than expected. About 81 percent of S.& P. 500 companies that have reported so far have beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Earnings have helped stocks regain their footing after a recent pullback on less-than-inspiring United States economic figures and renewed worry about Europe's debt crisis.
Analysts said the weakness heading into the weekend was in part because of caution ahead of an early indicator of China's industrial activity, expected late Sunday.
''We already know earnings are coming in better, and the market has been up quite a bit,'' said Doreen Mogavero, president and chief executive of Mogavero Lee & Company in New York. She added that ''the private sector manufacturing data from China will be setting the pace for next week, so people are taking some profits off the table.''
A weaker level in China's HSBC flash purchasing managers index late in March sent equity and other risk markets lower.
Bank of America fell 4.7 percent Friday to $8.36 after its stock was downgraded by Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA. The shares led declines in the S.& P. financials group, the second-worst performing among the S.& P. 500 top 10 sectors.
Microsoft shares jumped 4.6 percent to $32.42 and helped lift the Dow on Friday, a day after its profit report beat Wall Street's expectations.
General Electric's results drove buying in industrial shares. The company said it expected double-digit earnings for the year, which helped shares rise 1.1 percent to $19.36.
Honeywell International reported higher quarterly profit and raised its 2012 earnings forecast. The stock rose 2.4 percent to $59.39.
McDonald's edged up 0.7 percent to $95.94 after the chain reported higher quarterly profit, helped by strong sales in the United States.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury rose 3/32 to 100 12/32. The yield fell to 1.96 percent, from 1.97 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Sudan Says Military Evicts South's Army From Oil Area

BYLINE: By ISMA'IL KUSHKUSH

 BODY:
KHARTOUM, Sudan -- Sudan claimed Friday that its military had been victorious in forcing South Sudanese soldiers to pull out of a contested oil region as tensions between the two African neighbors remained high. 
In a defiant speech at a rally in the capital, President Omar Hassan al-Bashir labeled South Sudanese leaders as ''insects'' and dismissed their statements that they were voluntarily withdrawing troops from the disputed Heglig oil field. ''We thought these people wanted peace,'' Mr. Bashir cried out in Green Square here. Thousands of people gathered in the square late on Friday evening to celebrate the announcement that after taking over Heglig last week the South Sudanese were ceding the territory to respond to international demands.
The United States, the United Nations and the African Union all condemned South Sudan for sending troops into Heglig last week and bringing the two countries to the brink of war. But South Sudan, which calls the area Pantho, said it considered the area part of the south.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration, an international organization, ruled in 2009 that Heglig was outside the borders of the contested area of Abyei that lies between Sudan and South Sudan, and thus belonged to the government in Khartoum.
''This is our land!'' said Abd al-Aziz al-Tayeb, 33, a grocery store owner in Khartoum. ''Heglig is Sudanese one hundred percent!''
South Sudan was once a part of Sudan but broke away last year after a peace accord ended decades of strife and laid the groundwork for a national referendum. Still, the border between the two nations remains in dispute, as does how to divvy up the area's oil.
Whether the South Sudanese Army withdrew or was forced out of the Heglig area, Abd al-Latif al-Bony, a Sudanese academic, said he believed that military realities on the ground sank in for the South Sudanese Army. Sudan's army, Mr. Bony said, was able to tighten its control around Heglig and bomb supply routes from the air.
''Khartoum was concerned for the safety of the oil facilities and therefore was gradual in its military response,'' he said. ''It was not just a border war; it was an economic war.''
The oil fields of Heglig, which are managed by a consortium of Sudanese, Chinese, Malaysian and Indian companies, produce nearly half of Sudan's remaining oil, after the separation of South Sudan.
In a sign that the countries remained at loggerheads, Mr. Bashir threatened on Friday to block any South Sudanese oil from running through pipelines run by Sudan. Before the recent hostilities, the two nations had been in negotiations over transit fees for South Sudanese oil to transit through Sudan for export.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Recover, Mostly, From Recession

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE American consumer seems to be spending again. Except, that is, on products dependent on home sales.
The Census Bureau reported this week that seasonally adjusted retail sales in March were 0.8 percent higher than in the previous month, more than twice the consensus forecast. 
The accompanying charts show trends in retail sales since they peaked in 2008, both for the overall index and for 10 categories of retailers. After sharp falls in almost all categories, there have been impressive rebounds.
Over the last 12 months, the government estimates retail sales totaled $4.3 trillion, nearly 6 percent more than during the 12 months through July 2008, when sales peaked before the credit crisis and the recession caused sales of nearly everything to fall.
Those figures are not adjusted for inflation, but the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis makes such an adjustment for the overall sales figure. By that measure, sales have not completely recovered but are getting close to peak levels.
Retail sales figures are compiled by the type of retailer, not by the product. At the moment, with Internet retailing continuing to take market share from brick-and-mortar competitors, there is a risk that individual categories may appear to be weaker than they would be if the statistics reflected products.
The category the government calls ''electronic shopping and mail order retailers'' -- labeled Internet retailers in the accompanying charts -- suffered only a mild decline during the recession, and soon resumed its growth. That figure is reported on a delayed basis, so March figures are not available. But in the 12 months through February, it accounted for $308 billion in sales. Sales were up more than 30 percent since the overall sales peak in 2008, and its share of the market had grown to 7.3 percent from 5.7 percent.
Of the 10 categories shown, sales are now higher than predownturn peaks in six areas. The worst performer is furniture and home furnishings retailers, whose sales are still more than 13 percent below the peak. Those products are most often bought by consumers who have recently bought a home. The category that includes appliance stores is off more than 10 percent.
But the category that includes hardware stores and building material retailers appears to be recovering. At the bottom of the cycle, 12-month sales were down more than 15 percent from the 2008 level. They have made up most of that loss.
At the bottom of the cycle, total retail sales were down 11 percent from the peak level. In the more than 40 years for which comparable data is available, there had never been even a 1 percent decline in nominal sales before this cycle.
Of course, in some previous recessions, high inflation rates meant that consumers could continue to spend more money while getting less. This time, there were periods when weak demand meant there was overall deflation. Adjusted for inflation, and using 12-month periods, the maximum decline was 11.4 percent, just a bit more severe than the 11.3 percent fall recorded in the double-dip recessions of the early 1980s.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Retail Sales Bounce Back: Retail sales in the United States rose a surprisingly strong 0.8 percent in March. Over all, retail sales were 5 percent higher in the past 12 months than they were in the 12 months through July 2008, when sales peaked as the credit crisis and recession began to hit. The charts show the change in sales from the peak for overall retail sales and for 10 categories of retailers. The biggest gains have come from Internet retailers, while neither auto dealers nor retailers catering to homeowners have made a complete recovery. (Source: Census Bureau, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: The Lyric Little Bandbox Turns 100

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK. 
David Margolick is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

 BODY:
Home runs come in various guises and sizes. But it is beyond dispute that the most magnificent home runs in baseball are hit at Fenway Park. More specifically, to left field in Fenway Park. So magnificent are they, in fact, that if you're really being fair about it, it doesn't matter who hits them. Even, as on Friday, Alex Rodriguez and Nick Swisher and Russell Martin did.
In other ballparks, even in all those retro Fenways, home runs are often ragged things. Born promisingly, they die ignobly, landing in barren wastes or grassy knolls or pools of water or unused cul-de-sacs, where no human hands or mitts can even reach for them. Or they bounce around skimpy, empty grandstands, chased after by rapacious teenagers quite willing to kill for a souvenir. Watch ''Baseball Tonight'' sometime: lots of home runs are downright ugly. 
But when hit to left at Fenway, they rise majestically, then keep on rising. Often, they are still moving upward as they hit the seats, or, like Kevin Youkilis's shot the other night against Texas, a light standard. Some soar over everything and disappear from view: they say they land on Lansdowne Street, but who really knows? Maybe they come down on Commonwealth Avenue, or the Mass Pike, or they blow out some bulbs on the Citgo sign. Maybe they go into orbit. The mystery is part of their magic. No home runs make hitters look brawnier. That sight, a ball hurtling through a summer night's sky in Boston, heading toward infinity, is one of the sport's most magical. And timeless.
Actually, not totally timeless: it has been happening for only the past century, the century that Fenway Park commemorates this week. Fenway has beaten back urban renewal, escaped AstroTurf and exploding scoreboards, outlasted Pinky Higgins and Joe Kerrigan, recovered from Country Slaughter and Bill Buckner, managed to replace Sherm Feller, survived the designated hitter, Neil Diamond, pink caps and green jerseys, the wave, and hordes who don't know or care much about the game.
The same retrograde forces that doomed the Red Sox for so long -- yes, it was in Fenway in 1945, fourteen years before Pumpsie Green (who graciously returned to Fenway on Friday) integrated baseball's last Jim Crow team, that Jackie Robinson got his perfunctory tryout -- probably spared Fenway. Had the owner Tom Yawkey been less of a mossback, had Boston been less hidebound, maybe Fenway would have gone the way of Forbes and Crosley Field. In a game so careless with its traditions, the salvation of Fenway is probably more a coincidence than a matter of aesthetics.
But survive it has. Only Wrigley Field could have had a ceremony as moving as the one held at Fenway on Friday, when players dating back six decades walked out, or were wheeled out, to their former positions. Miraculously, for all the ''improvements'' in recent years, Fenway, and the Fenway experience, are essentially unchanged from 1912, or the renovations 22 years later. All the familiar landmarks survive: Carlton Fisk's pole in left and Johnny Pesky's in right; the door by the scoreboard; the black triangle of seats in dead center (vacant save for television cameramen until the fans started returning in 1967); the right-field stands behind the bullpen, into which Ted Williams deposited so many home runs, including his last. And all on an intimate scale that makes Yankee Stadium, in either incarnation, seem a Leviathan.
Even Fenway's scars are part of its charm. Catch ''The Wall'' in left (that succinct and honest term sufficed until the cornier ''Green Monster'' came along) from the correct angle, and ponder its lunar landscape of dents. (Only when it's in uppercase is ''dent'' a four-letter word at Fenway.) Whose fingerprints are they? Tony Conigliaro's? Dwight Evans's? Wade Boggs's, going to the opposite field? How might Carl Yastrzemski or Jim Rice or Manny Ramirez (assuming he was paying attention that day) have played those balls off the carom? Was it Mel Parnell or Bill Monbouquette or Billy Rohr who threw the pitch? How did Curt Gowdy or Ned Martin call the play, and Johnny Most retell it afterward on the ''Wheaties Scoreboard,'' or Don Gillis describe it on WHDH that night?
They are monuments as much as the plaques in Yankee Stadium -- more, really, because they're not hidden behind some fence. And they are living monuments, because more dents decorate the wall daily (particularly with this year's crop of Red Sox relievers). It happens with a homey, unsubtle metallic thud that seems to have intensified over the years, perhaps because microphones have been installed. That, rather than the earsplitting rock music that afflicts ballparks, is the real sound track of Fenway.
When I was a kid, it was television that emblazoned Fenway into my mind. We lived two hours away, and my parents weren't fans. As for the games I actually attended, Hawk Harrelson homered into the left-field net in one, a prototypical Sox game against the Tigers in which the Sox came back from trailing, 8-1, only to lose in extra innings. Dave Morehead, who threw a no-hitter at Fenway in 1965 before 1,200 fans -- ''Attaboy, Vander Meer!'' a Sox fan shouted at him when he was knocked out of the box his next start -- struggled in another. I may have seen George Scott hit a tater in one more.
But what stands out for me far more than the action those days were the colors. My Fenway had been strictly black and white. Once you were on the premises, though, there was that first glimpse of the emerald green field. Then there was the strikingly different shade of green of Fenway itself, lighter and paler and cooler than the grass. There was, and is, something wonderfully unpretentious and proletarian about it: it's something you might see below a battleship, or in a boiler room.
Then there were the magic yellow numbers of Fenway's manual scoreboard. In years of watching at home, I'd puzzled over a peculiar, end-of-the-half-inning, Fenway ritual: you'd see the ''1'' or ''2'' or ''7'' that one team had just scored be removed, only to have another ''1'' or ''2'' or ''7'' take its place. Only when I reached Fenway did I realize that those invisible men with their binoculars behind the wall were keeping a running count of the damage. (In my mind's eye, those dreaded yellow numbers are always in the upper row of the line score -- the mark of a true Sox fan.) Only when Mike Fornieles or Dick Radatz or John Wyatt finally got the last out, and the frame belonged to the ages, was it replaced by white. Then came the ad for Atlantic gasoline or Narragansett beer.
It's not always true, as Jerry Seinfeld once said, that rooting for a team in the free-agency era is really rooting for the clothes. For a lucky very few, on Chicago's North Side, as well as in Boston, it's also rooting for a place. Unless they're in Yankee Stadium, I don't much watch the Red Sox on the road. But I invariably watch them at home, and it's to see that home -- which by now is more of a home to me than my original home -- as much as it is to see them. And the more time passes -- as scary as it is, I've now been watching games at Fenway for more than half the time they've played there -- the more important that home becomes.
Why? My relationship with the players and, therefore, the game, grows more attenuated. Ever fewer of them (see Dustin Pedroia, Jacoby Ellsbury) are homegrown, particularly as the Sox have gotten fat and prosperous and Sox fans, like Yankee fans, spoiled and impatient: the team trades away prospects for stars whom you hadn't seen grow up and to whom, therefore, you feel no emotional connection.
Then, too, few players, homegrown or imported, stick around for long. I always found it puzzling that for all of Fenway's allure, plenty of the team's most beloved stars, like Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra, were all too happy to leave, even though, as they'd quickly learn, any other park, and nearly any other group of fans, would be a comedown. Surely, playing in a shrine, and to all that extra adoration, is worth millions in its own right. For players, abandoning Fenway reflects not just ingratitude, but bad taste.
And as a fan grows older, all players loom less large. Like life itself, they pass by at an ever-accelerating rate. Gary Geiger or Ike Delock may not have lasted as long or shone as bright as Adrian Gonzalez or Josh Beckett, but they'll always matter more to me. And truth be told, something changed once those World Series banners were embossed over the luxury boxes behind home plate, where a sign declaring ''Fenway Park'' rather superfluously hangs. The Sox have been to the mountaintop, then gone back again, and it has been downhill ever since. It no longer matters so much whether they win or lose, even against the Yankees, even on Fenway's 100th birthday.
What matters is Fenway itself. And all those glorious home runs to left.

HEADLINE: The Bachelor Vote

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Gail Collins is off today.

 BODY:
''Even if you like Barack Obama, we can't afford Barack Obama.''
That was Mitt Romney's line of attack this week in Charlotte, N.C., during a speech that his campaign ridiculously dubbed a ''prebuttal'' to the president's convention speech, which is scheduled to be given in that city this summer.
This appears to be an attempt to address Romney's connection conundrum. The president is personally popular; Romney isn't. 
According to the ABC News pollster Gary Langer, ''Mitt Romney has emerged from the Republican primary season with the weakest favorability rating on record for a presumptive presidential nominee in ABC News/Washington Post polls since 1984, trailing a resurgent Barack Obama in personal popularity by 21 percentage points.''
Langer continued, ''He's the first likely nominee to be underwater -- seen more unfavorably than favorably -- in ABC/Post polls in eight presidential primary seasons over the past 28 years.''
If Romney is to have a shot in November, he must convince voters that their affinity for the president can diverge from their support of him, that they can be for the president as a person but vote against him, that they can't afford their own affection.
It is an interesting tactic that likely has limited application, but one group that, at this point, seems to me to be most receptive to that argument is unmarried men.
Reviews of the internal number in the ABC News/Washington Post poll found that unmarried men had the widest gap between the percentage who viewed Obama favorably (63 percent) and those who approved of his job performance (41 percent). By comparison, 66 percent of unmarried women had a favorable view of the president and 63 percent approved of his job performance.
(As a point of curiosity, the only demographic group in which Obama's approval rating was higher than his favorability rating was among seniors: 47 percent approval to 43 percent favorability.)
According to 2008 exit polls, unmarried men with no kids were 11 percent of the electorate and Obama won that group 56 percent to John McCain's 41 percent. Obama's overall margin of victory in the popular vote was seven percentage points.
Much has been made, and rightfully so, about the impact of the women's vote (particularly that of young women) in the coming election, but, as it shapes up to be another tight race, young men may also prove pivotal.
Romney is staking out his argument, but Obama would also seem to have a real opportunity to make inroads. It's not as if these young men are thrilled with Romney, either. Of those polled, 38 percent had a favorable view of Romney, while 42 percent had an unfavorable view of him. That means that Obama has a 25 percentage-point favorability advantage over Romney.
Yet when asked whom they would vote for, that advantage virtually evaporated: 47 percent preferred Obama, while 45 percent preferred Romney.
For many of these young men, social issues don't seem to resonate. For them, jobs and the economy are tantamount.
The recession hit everyone hard, but it was particularly brutal for men. Some have even called it the ''Man-cession.'' Men lost more than twice as many jobs as women. And that was particularly hard on younger men.
As The Wall Street Journal reported in November:
''The unemployment rate for males between 25 and 34 years old with high-school diplomas is 14.4 percent -- up from 6.1 percent before the downturn four years ago and far above today's 9 percent national rate. The picture is even more bleak for slightly younger men: 22.4 percent for high-school graduates 20 to 24 years old. That's up from 10.4 percent four years ago.''
And as The Chicago Sun-Times pointed out following the release of a Census Bureau report on living arrangements last year:
''The report, 'America's Families and Living Arrangements: 2011,' found 19 percent of American men ages 25 to 34 living in their parents' homes -- the highest level since 1960. Only 10 percent of women in that age group were living at home with parents.''
This jobless trauma will not soon be forgotten.
Many of these young men want to hear a message about economic stewardship and ways to energize the recovery. They want to know that they will be able to find and keep a job that will allow them the economic stability to start and support a family.
The idea that their fathers' America might be lost to them is frightening.
Obama may have an advantage here, too. A Gallup poll released on Friday found that by ''52 percent to 42 percent, more Americans have confidence in Obama than in Romney on the economy,'' although among men the gap was much smaller: 46 percent to 43 percent.
Much of the economic pain was felt on Obama's watch, and Romney is making every effort to portray him as being responsible for it.
The question is: Will bachelors blame Obama and punish him at the ballot box?

HEADLINE: Deporting Parents Hurts Kids

BYLINE: By HIROKAZU YOSHIKAWA and CAROLA SUAREZ-OROZCO. 
Hirokazu Yoshikawa, the academic dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is the author of ''Immigrants Raising Citizens: Undocumented Parents and Their Young Children.'' Carola Suarez-Orozco, co-director of immigration studies at New York University, is an author of ''Crossroads: The Psychology of Immigration in the New Century.''

 BODY:
LAST May, President Obama told an audience in El Paso that deportation of immigrants would focus on ''violent offenders and people convicted of crimes; not families, not folks who are just looking to scrape together an income.''
Two weeks ago, however, the Department of Homeland Security released a report that flatly belies the new policy. From January to June 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement removed 46,486 undocumented parents who claimed to have at least one child who is an American citizen. 
In contrast, in the entire decade between 1998 and 2007, about 100,000 such parents were removed. The extraordinary acceleration in the dismantling of these families, part of the government's efforts to meet an annual quota of about 400,000 deportations, has had devastating results.
Research by the Urban Institute and others reveals the deep and irreversible harm that parental deportation causes in the lives of their children. Having a parent ripped away permanently, without warning, is one of the most devastating and traumatic experiences in human development.
These children experience immediate household crises, starting with the loss of parental income. The harsh new economic reality causes housing and food insecurity. In response to psychological and economic disruptions, children show increased anxiety, frequent crying, changes in eating and sleeping patterns, withdrawal and anger.
In the long run, the children of deportation face increased odds of lasting economic turmoil, psychic scarring, reduced school attainment, greater difficulty in maintaining relationships, social exclusion and lower earnings. The research also exposes major misconceptions about these parents.
First, statistics about those who were deported in 2011 show that 45 percent were not apprehended for any criminal offense. Those who were, were usually arrested for relatively minor offenses, not violent crimes.
Second, most American-born children of undocumented parents are not ''anchor babies''; most of the parents have lived and worked in the United States for years before having their first child. ''Birth tourism'' is a xenophobic myth.
Finally, our studies in New York City and elsewhere show that these parents are extremely dedicated to their children's well-being and development. Undocumented parents typically work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, at the lowest of wages. Deporting them worsens the already precarious lot of their children.
A more humane deportation policy would not, as Mr. Obama pledged last May, target those with strong family ties who posed no public safety threat. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in fact, began implementing such a ''prosecutorial discretion'' policy last fall, aimed at considering family ties and other factors in deportation decisions and closing low-priority cases.
But preliminary data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement raise the question of how committed the agency is to identifying and closing those cases. As John Morton, the agency's director, testified in March, of 150,000 deportation cases the agency has reviewed nationwide, about 1,500 -- a mere 1 percent -- have been closed.
What does that mean for affected families? Consider Sara Martinez, 47, whose daughter is an American citizen. Since arriving from Ecuador, Ms. Martinez has paid her taxes, learned English and never broken a law, according to the New York Immigration Coalition, which has taken up her case. In January 2011, she was on a bus in Rochester with her daughter when three border patrol agents asked her for identification. She could produce only her Ecuadorean passport, and was arrested.
She has applied to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for prosecutorial discretion three times and been denied, without explanation, even though she meets new criteria for such discretion: she has close ties to the community and is not a threat to public safety.
Ms. Martinez's six-year-old daughter has suffered from nightmares, had trouble sleeping and eating and expressed fear that the ''police'' will come again and take away her mother (who is not in detention while the case is pending) for good.
The United States should not be in the business of causing untold hardship by separating children from the love and care of their hard-working parents.

HEADLINE: Troubling Favoritism In Tax Code

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Like most Americans (though not Mitt Romney, who got an extension), I filed my 2011 tax returns this week and paid my five layers of income tax: federal, state, local, self-employed and something called the metropolitan commuter tax (even though I live in New York City and don't commute). When I first looked at the returns, I was incredulous.
My adjusted gross income was higher than in 2010. Yet my overall tax rate went down. My alternative minimum tax also went down. Wasn't the opposite supposed to happen -- the more you make, the higher rate you should pay?
I called my accountant to double-check, but my returns were correct. This perverse outcome proves that what I'd already discovered about the ultrarich also holds true for people who are far from the million-dollar bracket: our tax code isn't progressive. It's not even flat. For people like me -- and I assume there are millions of us -- it's regressive. For many people, the more you make, the lower the rate you pay. 
Rest assured that I'm still paying a whopping amount of tax: 33 percent of my adjusted gross income in 2011 as compared with 37 percent the previous year. That's far higher than Mitt Romney's 13.9 percent (for 2010) on his more than $21 million in income or even President Obama's 24.6 percent in combined federal and state income tax for 2011 on adjusted gross income of $789,674, which the White House disclosed last week. I'm also paying a lot more in total tax this year than last, even though the rate is lower.
But what really galls me isn't how much I have to pay: it's the unfairness of it. Some have argued that when it comes to the tax code, fairness isn't the main issue. They contend that increasing rates for the ultrawealthy doesn't raise all that much money and doesn't make much of a dent in the federal deficit.
By that logic, we should encourage everyone to become a billionaire by freeing the super-rich from taxation altogether. In the name of tax efficiency, it would make sense to increase taxes on people in the $100,000 to $500,000 category, because that's where the real money is. This group already pays 44.9 percent of total federal income tax even though they account for only 20.2 percent of total returns, according to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service.
That strikes me as absurd. Striving for fairness is not only fundamental to the American experience, but should be the starting point for any tax reform.
So how did I, a journalist as opposed to a private equity manager, manage to increase my income while lowering my tax rate and my alternative minimum tax?
The main culprit is the same thing that benefits the ultrarich and represents the single biggest preference item (i.e., loophole) in the tax code: preferential capital gains rates. And I discovered that the alternative minimum tax, or A.M.T., makes capital gains even more preferential than I'd realized.
When I joined The New York Times last year to write this column, I sold stocks to comply with the newspaper's conflict-of-interest policies, including two of my longest-held positions that both had large unrealized gains -- Google and Apple. Capital gains accounted for 26 percent of my adjusted gross income in 2011. The year before, I had a loss.
Even here, the tax code favors some rich people over others. People who have to divest stock to join the executive branch of the federal government can defer paying capital gains tax as long as they roll the proceeds into other investments. When two former Goldman Sachs executives, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin, left the private sector and had to divest their presumably huge holdings of Goldman and other stocks to comply with federal conflict-of-interest policies, they could do so without any immediate tax hit.
Still, even for ordinary citizens like me, capital gains are taxed at a low maximum rate of 15 percent, which helped lower my overall rate. And I was amazed to discover that unlike other deductions, like state and local taxes and personal exemptions, the tax preference for capital gains is not added back when calculating the A.M.T.
That wasn't the case when the A.M.T. was started in 1970. On the contrary, as the largest single tax break benefiting the rich and a major reason the A.M.T. legislation was enacted in the first place, the capital gains preference was added back when calculating the A.M.T. But as a result of the 1986 Reagan tax reforms, in which capital gains were taxed at the same maximum rate as earned income, capital gains lost their preferential status. Since there was no preferential treatment, there was no need to add anything back when calculating the A.M.T.
Then, over the years, the tax on earned income went up (currently a maximum rate of 35 percent) and the tax rate on capital gains was cut, reaching its current maximum of 15 percent as part of the Bush-era tax cuts, which restored the preferential treatment for capital gains. Nonetheless, capital gains were not restored when calculating the A.M.T.
''Capital gains were the single biggest tax preference when the A.M.T. was passed, and they are again now,'' William G. Gale, co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told me this week. ''Congress should have put them back in as a preference item'' when capital gains rates were cut, ''but it didn't,'' Mr. Gale said. ''The antisheltering part of the A.M.T. has been completely neutered.''
The fact that capital gains escaped the A.M.T. is a testament to the power of the capital gains lobby, crucial Republican legislators and their allies who believe that low capital gains rates promote investment, hiring and economic growth and brush aside arguments that taxing capital gains at a lower rate than earned income is inherently unfair and disproportionately benefits the wealthy.
Excluding capital gains from the A.M.T. ''makes no sense,'' Leonard Burman, a tax expert and the Daniel Patrick Moynihan professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told me. ''It used to be that the A.M.T. was targeted toward rich people. The biggest thing was capital gains. That completely changed. Now, the things that get you are high state and local taxes and personal exemptions,'' both of which are added back in A.M.T. calculations.
Another anomaly is that the top tax rate under the A.M.T. remains the top Reagan-era rate of 28 percent, while the top marginal rate on earned income is now 35 percent. That means that the higher one's income and the more of it that is taxed at the top marginal rate, the lower the difference between the A.M.T. and the regular tax, and the less tax owed under the A.M.T. ''That's why a lot of millionaires aren't subject to the A.M.T.,'' Mr. Burman said.
Since the threshold for paying the A.M.T. wasn't indexed for inflation, it threatens to capture more and more taxpayers -- 30 million more, if the current temporary fix expires, according to Mr. Burman, many of them living in populous, high-tax (and Democrat-leaning) states like New York and California.
As a result of these inequities, the A.M.T. has been attacked from both ends of the political spectrum. The proposed Buffett Rule, which went down to defeat this week and would have taxed people earning more than $1 million a year at a higher rate, was a stab at addressing some of the inequities of the current system, but it drew tepid support from many tax experts since it didn't really tackle comprehensive tax reform.
''You just end up with another Rube Goldberg system that doesn't raise revenue and makes people crazy,'' Mr. Burman said of the Buffett Rule. Representative Paul Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has proposed abolishing the A.M.T. as part of his budget proposal, but hasn't said how he would recoup the lost revenue.
Even with the break on capital gains, I still paid thousands in tax pursuant to the A.M.T., solely because of my high state and local tax deductions. Still, I realize it could be worse. Although the A.M.T. was aimed at wealthy taxpayers who took advantage of abusive tax shelters, ''it now mostly captures people who have big families or live in high-tax states -- neither of which we think of as horrible tax shelters,'' Mr. Gale said.
''The Brady Bunch would be hit big time,'' Mr. Burman said. ''If you live in Los Angeles with six kids and several hundred thousand dollars in income, you have a huge A.M.T. bill.''

HEADLINE: Concern In G.O.P. Over State Focus On Social Issues

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Fiscal issues and union rights were front and center in many Republican-controlled legislatures last year. But this year, with the nation heading into the heart of a presidential race and voters consumed by the country's economic woes, much of the debate in statehouses has centered on social issues.
Tennessee enacted a law this month intended to protect teachers who question the theory of evolution. Arizona moved to ban nearly all abortions after 20 weeks, and Mississippi imposed regulations that could close the state's only abortion clinic. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin signed a law allowing the state's public schools to teach about abstinence instead of contraception.
The recent flurry of socially conservative legislation, on issues ranging from expanding gun rights to placing new restrictions on abortion, comes as Republicans at the national level are eager to refocus attention on economic issues. 
Some Republican strategists and officials, reluctant to be identified because they do not want to publicly antagonize the party's base, fear that the attention these divisive social issues are receiving at the state level could harm the party's chances in November, when its hopes of winning back the White House will most likely rest with independent voters in a handful of swing states.
One seasoned strategist called the problem potentially huge. But others said that actions taken by a handful of states would probably have little impact on the national campaign.
Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a Republican who created a stir a couple of years ago with his suggestion for a ''truce'' on social issues, said in an interview that such issues are best handled at the state and local levels. They become more polarizing, he said, when people try to settle them nationally.
''If we don't address soon what I believe are the lethal threats of our debts, our unaffordable commitments, our slow-growth economy, and so forth, every other problem will seem small,'' said Mr. Daniels, whose state did see union protests this year when it enacted a so-called right-to-work law. He noted that Mitt Romney's campaign was already emphasizing the economy at every opportunity.
''The genuine risk to our party comes if we allow it to appear that these are our first preoccupations,'' he said.
But John Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Senator John McCain and Jon M. Huntsman Jr., said that the attention Republicans were paying to social issues at the state level could cost the party support from several important blocs of voters, including independents, women and young people voting for the first or second time.
''I think it's problematic,'' he said, ''not just for this national election we're facing, but for the long-term health of the party.''
The risks of focusing on social issues were highlighted this week when the American Legislative Exchange Council, a business-backed group that pushes conservative laws at the state level, announced that it would be refocusing its efforts on economic issues. Several sponsors had recently withheld their support after the group came under public pressure for advocating voting restrictions and self-defense legislation modeled on Florida's Stand Your Ground law, which became an issue after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.
It is not only Republican-led states that have turned to social issues as some of the immediate pressures of the fiscal crisis have begun to ease: Washington and Maryland, which are controlled by Democrats, both enacted laws legalizing same-sex marriage this year, and Connecticut voted this month to repeal its death penalty.
But Republicans have more states: recent election victories have left them in control of both the executive and legislative branches of 21, while Democrats control both branches in only 11, and power is divided in the others.
Many Republican governors are focusing on fiscal issues as well: in states including Kansas, Oklahoma and Tennessee, Republican governors have been pressing for tax cuts. But debates over social issues have drawn much of the attention in some states.
After Tennessee's Republican-led Legislature passed a bill to protect school teachers who review ''the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories'' in areas including ''biological evolution, the chemical origins of life, global warming and human cloning,'' it drew denunciations from a number of scientists and civil libertarians. Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, decided this month to let the bill become law without his signature.
Mr. Haslam said in an interview that the law had passed by a wide margin, so the Legislature could have easily overridden a veto. And he said that while he feared that the law would muddy state policy for teachers rather than clarify it, he had been assured by state education officials that it would not actually change the way science is taught in Tennessee.
But he said he also worried that the law could damage the reputation of a state that was home to another famous legal battle over the teaching of evolution, the Scopes ''monkey trial'' of 1925.
''One of the things as governor, you're always out -- I'm out selling Tennessee all the time to businesses and other folks,'' Mr. Haslam said during a recent visit to New York, adding that the state had heavily focused on the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in recent years. ''So you worry about misperceptions, sure. I wouldn't be honest if I said I didn't do that. But if I thought it was actually going to harm the scientific standards, I would have vetoed it.''
When Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, appeared on the MSNBC program ''Morning Joe'' last week to talk about his state's successful efforts to lower its unemployment rate, he found himself facing a number of questions about something else: the law he signed requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before getting an abortion, which received a great deal of attention this year.
''We had 860 bills this session; one of them reached my desk on abortion,'' Mr. McDonnell said. ''So to say that it was some broader trend is not the case.''
So far this year, 75 bills placing restrictions on abortion have passed at least one legislative chamber, which is more than normally pass in an election year, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization. But it is below the pace established last year, when Republicans first won control of many statehouses and a record 127 restrictions were passed by at least one house of the legislatures during the first quarter.
Bills expanding gun rights have passed in a number of states. Maine recently joined several others that passed a bill prohibiting restrictions on the right to carry or sell firearms during a declared state of emergency. Arizona enacted a law requiring law enforcement agencies to sell forfeited guns within a year, rather than destroying them, as many local agencies do. Oklahoma enacted a law that will limit the liability that gun ranges face for accidents.
Now, as legislative sessions continue in many states, social issues continue to be debated and, sometimes, passed. On Tuesday, a Tennessee legislative committee advanced a measure that some have dubbed the ''don't say gay'' bill because it ''prohibits the teaching of or furnishing of materials on human sexuality other than heterosexuality'' in elementary school.
Speaking before that move, Governor Haslam of Tennessee noted that people elected to office have varying priorities.
''I think as governor, I was elected to run this, you know, $30 billion, 40,000-employee entity called the State of Tennessee that provides services from managing prisons to educating Ph.D.'s to helping families with mental health issues, and my job is getting the very best service for the very lowest price,'' he said. ''People run for office for different reasons. And we have some members of our Legislature that that's the motivating factor, certain social issues. My response is, that's how democracy works.''

HEADLINE: What Are the Effects of Raising the Minimum Wage?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Raising the Floor on Pay'' (Business Day, April 10):
Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has introduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $9.80 from its present level of $7.25. Legislators in a number of states -- including Connecticut, New Jersey and New York -- are also considering increases. 
An election-year promise of higher wages and less poverty makes a compelling campaign platform. Unfortunately, it's an empty pledge: Research indicates that, on the whole, a minimum wage increase simply doesn't help the poor -- in fact, it hurts them.
A 2010 study by two economists of the 28 states that raised their minimum wages between 2003 and 2007 found no associated decline in state poverty rates. There are three well-established explanations for this disappointing record: First, a majority of working-age individuals who live in poverty don't work, and thus cannot benefit from the raise. Second, a clear majority of those who do earn the minimum wage live in households that aren't in poverty. Third, less skilled and less experienced employees lose employment opportunities when the cost to hire and train them rises as a result of a minimum-wage increase.
Advocates for a higher minimum wage are expert at using the plight of low-income families to marshal public support. But the poor performance and unintended consequences of their preferred policy are a matter of public record. In an era of 15 percent poverty rates and soaring unemployment for vulnerable groups, that record should stand as a cautionary tale for policy makers everywhere.

HEADLINE: Assad's Lies

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council gave Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, a chance to end the killing and avoid complete chaos with a plan that called for a cease-fire, a withdrawal of troops from embattled cities and a political transition. It is deplorable -- but no surprise -- that he reneged on nearly every promise.
On Friday, activists reported that Syrian troops fired tear gas and bullets on thousands of protesters. The government is thwarting U.N. cease-fire monitors by restricting their numbers and movement. The monitors got off to a bad start, sparking outrage from the opposition after they said they would not circulate on Friday, the normal day for mass rallies. And according to the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the government is failing to provide needed food and medicine to 230,000 displaced people, and refusing to allow outside agencies to help. 
Mr. Assad's cruelty and blindness were predictable. What is unfathomable is why Russia and China continue to protect him. They have blocked the Security Council from imposing any sanctions. Even now, Russian officials put much of the blame for the bloodshed on the fractured, mostly peaceful opposition forces, not the Syrian Army with its heavy weapons.
Russia sells arms to Syria and uses its Mediterranean port of Tartus. And after the events in Libya, both Russia and China seem determined to deny the West another ''win,'' so they keep hanging on to Mr. Assad. At this point it should be clear that for the sake of a pointless geopolitical game, both countries are further tarnishing their global reputations. They are alienating governments and people throughout the region. And when Mr. Assad falls -- and he will -- the people of Syria will blame them for their complicity in this bloodbath.
Their enabling just gives Mr. Assad more time to kill -- the death toll exceeds 9,000 -- and makes a wider war more likely. (Iran is also an Assad enabler but has long stood outside the norms of international probity.)
Eight months ago, President Obama said ''the time has come for President Assad to step aside.'' The international community is still scrambling to find a way to make that happen. There are no easy solutions. The place to start is to push Moscow and Beijing to cut their losses.
The best approach would be a United Nations arms embargo and the toughest possible economic sanctions -- if China and Russia will not block the Council. On Friday, Russia was still opposing a European proposal for even minimal penalties like a travel ban and an asset freeze.
Sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others are having an effect and should be tightened. On Monday, the European Union is expected to take aim at the Assad family and its cronies by blocking the sale to Syria of luxury goods.
Turkey, which is caring for thousands of Syrian refugees, has suggested creating humanitarian corridors inside Syria, where civilians can shelter. We are skeptical. It would require air patrols and possibly troops for protection. And any outside intervention runs the risk of sparking a wider war. After Syrian forces sent shells across the Turkish border last week, the Turkish government hinted that it might invoke NATO's Article 5 on mutual protection.
Washington and its allies need to summon all of the pressure they can find -- and direct it at Damascus, Moscow and Beijing. That is the only way to stop the killing and avoid another war.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Adds $430 Billion For Lending

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund has raised at least $430 billion in extra lending capacity to be used if the euro zone crisis worsens or global financial conditions deteriorate, it said Friday afternoon.
The announcement came during the spring meetings of the I.M.F. and its sister institution, the World Bank. World leaders gathered in Washington to discuss how to bolster growth, reduce unemployment and poverty and ensure financial stability around the world.
''We warmly welcome pledges by our members to increase I.M.F. resources by over $430 billion, almost doubling our lending capacity,'' Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said in a statement. ''We made a call to action and our members have delivered.'' 
The new commitments come mostly from wealthy, developed economies: $60 billion from Japan; $15 billion each from Britain, Saudi Arabia and South Korea; and smaller amounts from countries including Sweden, Norway, Poland, Australia, Denmark and Singapore.
Those sums will join $200 billion in previous commitments from euro zone countries.
But some rapidly growing, cash-rich emerging economies -- including Brazil, China, Russia and India -- made no specific pledges at the spring meetings. They have indicated that they will contribute, Ms. Lagarde said, but they have not committed to specific dollar amounts. The countries are expected to name their precise contributions at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Mexico in June, after consulting with their governments at home.
Emerging countries have argued that they should have more voting power within the fund if they are going to contribute more financing. They have been vocally critical of continued American and European dominance over the I.M.F.
In prepared remarks to be delivered on Saturday, Guido Mantega, the finance minister of Brazil, castigated the fund for not moving quickly enough to enact quota changes made in 2010. And he argued that voting within the fund should be proportional to the countries' economic output, to give the organization greater legitimacy among its members.
''The calculated quota share of Luxembourg is larger than the one of Argentina or South Africa,'' his remarks read. ''The quota share of Belgium is larger than that of Indonesia and roughly three times that of Nigeria. And the quota of Spain, amazing as it may seem, is larger than the sum total of the quotas of all 44 sub-Saharan African countries.''
An American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations, said the new financing pledges were not expected to change the voting shares within the fund. The $430 billion in new commitments represent a temporary buffer in case the I.M.F. needs additional capacity in the coming years, the official said, not a change in permanent quota contributions.
The United States has said it will not pledge any more money to the fund, arguing that Europe's problems are its own to fix and that the I.M.F. has enough spare lending capacity.
''Europe is a rich continent,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said in remarks at the Brookings Institution this week. Europe has to play ''the dominant financial role'' in its own crisis, he argued.
The American official who talked about the new financing pledges said that other Group of 20 countries had not criticized Washington's decision to refrain from contributing additional funding to the I.M.F.
In a meeting with reporters on Friday, Francois Baroin, the French finance minister, said he understood that the Obama administration's hands were tied by Congress -- which would need to approve any additional contributions to the I.M.F. -- and said the United States had helped in Europe in other ways.
The new contributions to the I.M.F. came after the fund reassessed the global economy after continued troubles in Europe this winter. Its economists determined that in the coming years, countries around the world might require up to $1 trillion in new loans because of problems arising from the euro zone and more general sluggish global growth.
The fund agreed to raise about $500 billion in new lending capacity if Europe would raise a commensurate amount for its own bailout fund.
Last month, European leaders agreed to bolster the continent's firewall -- the permanent European Stability Mechanism, which will begin operating this summer and run alongside the temporary European Financial Stability Facility -- to 800 billion euros, or $1 trillion, from 500 billion euros. That opened the door for the additional contributions to the I.M.F. this week.
World leaders have praised Europe for the steps it has taken in the last six months to end its sovereign debt crisis: the European Central Bank made unlimited, cheap short-term loans to financial institutions; countries including Spain and Italy committed to austerity budgets; Europe agreed to a bigger firewall; and Greece restructured its debt.
But Europe remains the center of the crisis, Ms. Lagarde said this week, and countries need to remain vigilant about the risks of the crisis spreading and slow growth. She also said that European governments needed to follow through on their budget promises and reforms and to try to bring down unemployment. Recently, Spanish bond yields have started climbing, raising widespread concern that the country will need a bailout from the European Union and the I.M.F.
The fund announced the new lending capacity in a joint statement with the Group of 20 nations, whose finance ministers and central bankers also met in Washington on Friday.

HEADLINE: In Strategy Shift, Obama Team Attacks Romney From the Left

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- So long, flip-flopper. Hello, right-wing extremist.
Mitt Romney may be inclined to start moving to the political center now that he's practically got the Republican nomination won and done, but the Obama campaign would much rather keep him right where he's been for the past few months: in the conservative territory he staked out while battling for Republican primary voters.
After months of depicting Mr. Romney as the ultimate squishy, double-talking, no-core soul, Team Obama is shifting gears. Senior administration officials, along with Democratic and campaign officials, all say their strategy now will be to tell the world that Mr. Romney has a core after all -- and it's deep red. 
Mr. Romney's overheard remarks at a fund-raiser in Florida on Sunday night that, if elected, he planned to slash government programs (though he has not spelled that out for the voters) gave Obama backers the perfect opening, and they jumped on it. ''Mitt Romney Tells Rich Voters His Secret Plan to Cut Housing Assistance,'' said a headline from ThinkProgress, a blog put out by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Democratic officials followed that up with a call to reporters on Thursday charging that Mr. Romney's proposal would ''cut critical funds for homeless veterans.''
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama's advisers saw another chance, and they were all over that, too. Hours after Mr. Romney accepted the endorsement of Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, the Democratic National Committee was out with an ad ''Mitt Romney and Tom Corbett: Too Extreme for Women.'' The traditional spooky music accompanies video of Mr. Corbett defending his advocacy of a proposal that could make women undergo ultrasounds before receiving abortions, and saying women could ''close their eyes'' if they didn't want to see what was on the screen.
''Did Mitt Romney close his eyes to accept this endorsement?'' the D.N.C. said in an e-mail it helpfully sent to reporters trumpeting the advertisement. ''Probably not, since Mitt Romney's positions mirror those of the extreme elements of his party,'' the e-mail continued, going on to list a host of conservative Romney positions that Democrats hope will alienate women.
For Mr. Obama, the decision to start going after Mr. Romney from the left is as much a logical evolution as is any attempt by Mr. Romney to move to the center, in particular Mr. Romney's effort now to try to woo Hispanic and female voters who may have been alienated by some of the talk coming out of the Republican primary.
As the general election heats up, a central battlefield promises to be the fights for suburban women in crucial swing states like Florida, Ohio and Colorado, and both camps are now trying to prove their bona fides with that population. When added to recent data that shows an increase in Hispanic voters in key states, the Obama campaign sees an opening to paint Mr. Romney as out of touch among both women and Hispanics.
As far as the Romney campaign is concerned, officials say that efforts to paint their candidate as an extremist will not fly. ''They are grasping at straws,'' said Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney's spokeswoman. ''The Obama campaign first said President Obama was going to run on his record and the election would be a referendum on his handling of the economy. When it was clear that wouldn't work, his team said they were going to adopt a 'Kill Mitt' strategy. Then came the plan to run against President Bush again, and then, against Congress. Next they tried to claim Governor Romney had no core.''
Ms. Saul said that while ''each new day brings a different made-up attack from the Obama campaign, what doesn't change is the fact that President Obama has failed and so is going to try to tear down Mitt Romney instead of talking about his record.''
Still, voters should ready themselves for reminders from the Obama campaign that Mr. Romney proposed eliminating Title X, the only federal program devoted to family planning, that he suggested letting the foreclosure process ''run its course and hit the bottom,'' and that he staked out a position on immigration that was to the right of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. The campaign will make certain it is well known that Mr. Romney just agreed to be the commencement speaker at the conservative Liberty University; in fact, within minutes of Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr.'s announcement on Thursday, Democratic operatives were e-mailing the news around.
''Mitt Romney has spent the last two years taking the most extreme positions of his party, whether it's on economic policy or social policy,'' said Stephanie Cutter, the deputy campaign manager of Mr. Obama's re-election team. ''He can try to flip-flop to the center, but who is going to believe him?''
David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said in a telephone interview, ''Whether it's tax policy, whether it's his approach to abortion, gay rights, immigration, he's the most conservative nominee that they've had going back to Goldwater.'' He added that ''one of the key issues in the campaign is to make sure people know that.''
But what about David Axelrod's Twitter feed, which has, nonstop for the past few months, seemed fixated on a depiction of Mr. Romney as the ultimate feather in the wind? (''Yesterday, Mitt predicted victory. Today, he says 3d would be fine. He can't even stick to the same position on THAT!'' Mr. Axelrod, an Obama adviser, said on Twitter on the morning of the Iowa caucuses in January.)
Obama strategists insist they're not flip-flopping on the flip-flopper label, which they believe can serve them well at any given moment. But there appears to be a clear realization that for general election purposes, they may do better with an emphasis on Mr. Romney's conservative stances.
The reason goes back to the very thing that has, all along, made Mr. Romney the candidate whom the Obama campaign has always viewed as the most formidable out of the Republican herd. Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, the architect of a health care plan which is remarkably similar to Mr. Obama's signature domestic policy item, is still viewed among many independents as something of a moderate, and as such, he is more dangerous to Mr. Obama in a general election than the rest of the Republican field.
That viewpoint made Mr. Romney vulnerable during the Republican primaries and at least partly explains his fierce embrace of conservation positions to offset Republican doubts. But it may make him tougher to beat in November. Mr. Romney himself seemed to acknowledge his need to move to the center during his overheard remarks on Sunday, when he told supporters that ''we have to get Hispanic voters to vote for our party,'' and warned that big Latino support for Mr. Obama ''spells doom for us.'' While he did not explicitly endorse a Republican proposal to chart a path to legality for the offspring of illegal residents, he didn't dismiss the idea either.

HEADLINE: Company News: Honeywell Increases Earnings Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The industrial conglomerate Honeywell International reported higher quarterly results and raised its earnings forecast for the full year, saying rising demand in the United States and high-growth markets was more than offsetting softness in Europe. 
The company said its commercial aerospace segment and its specialty materials businesses, known as UOP, drove up first-quarter earnings, and it forecast increased sales and profit for the second quarter.
The unit, which includes catalysts and absorbents used in refining oil, benefited from strong demand in both refining and petrochemical segments, executives told analysts in a conference call on Friday.
Bolstered by its new product development and geographic expansion, Honeywell expects to post higher earnings in 2012 even in a bumpy global economy.
''We said we're going to assume Europe was in recession for the whole year, and unfortunately, I think we are going to be right,'' the company's chief executive, Dave Cote, said in the call. ''Fortunately, we planned for it.''
Shares of Honeywell rose 2.4 percent to close at $59.39.
The company's growth is occurring without much of a housing market turnaround, and will be further underpinned once that takes hold, analysts said.
Honeywell's results came the same day that General Electric reported results that topped forecasts on strong demand for energy equipment and railroad locomotives.
Honeywell said its earnings increased to $825 million, or $1.04 a share, compared with $708 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier.
Last month, the company told analysts that it expected a profit of 96 cents to 98 cents a share.
Sales increased 7 percent to $9.3 billion, above the $9.15 billion that analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters.
Honeywell raised its forecast for 2012 earnings from continuing operations to $4.35 to $4.55 a share, from $4.25 to $4.50.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Big Donations Drop Sharply For President

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and DEREK WILLIS

 BODY:
President Obama's re-election campaign is straining to raise the huge sums it is counting on to run against Mitt Romney, with sharp dropoffs in donations from nearly every major industry forcing it to rely more than ever on small contributions and a relative handful of major donors.
From Wall Street to Hollywood, from doctors and lawyers, the traditional big sources of campaign cash are not delivering for the Obama campaign as they did four years ago. The falloff has left his fund-raising totals running behind where they were at the same point in 2008 -- though well ahead of Mr. Romney's -- and has induced growing concern among aides and supporters as they confront the prospect that Republicans and their ''super PAC'' allies will hold a substantial advantage this fall. 
With big checks no longer flowing as quickly into his campaign, Mr. Obama is leaning harder on his grass-roots supporters, whose small contributions make up well over half of the money he raised through the end of March, according to reports filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission. And Mr. Obama is asking far more of those large donors still giving, exploiting his joint fund-raising arrangement with the Democratic National Committee to collect five-figure checks from individuals who have already given the maximum $5,000 contribution to his re-election campaign.
''They clearly are feeling the pressure,'' said one major Obama fund-raiser, who asked for anonymity to characterize his conversations with campaign officials. ''They're behind where they expected to be. You have to factor in $500 million-plus in Republican super PAC money.''
With no primary to excite his base, the economy struggling to rebound, and four years of political battles with Wall Street and other industries taking their toll, Mr. Obama's campaign raised about $196 million through March, compared with $235 million at the same point in 2008. It has lagged behind its own internal quotas in some cities, according to people involved with the fund-raising efforts. But that has been offset by a highly successful joint fund-raising program with the national committee, which raised about $150 million, twice as much as in 2008.
Mr. Obama has held more than a hundred joint fund-raisers since last spring, far more than President George W. Bush during his 2004 re-election, and has tucked fund-raising stops into many of his official presidential trips.
The result: The national committee's fund-raising from the technology industry, entrepreneurs, Wall Street and the entertainment industry have all risen sharply compared with 2008, even as the Obama campaign's performance in those areas has tailed off, according to data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics. And with no primary to fight, Mr. Obama is spending much less than he was at this stage in 2008: He had about twice as much money in the bank at the end of March than he did four years ago.
All told, Mr. Obama and the Democratic committee ended March with about $130 million in cash on hand, a sizable war chest and far more than Mr. Romney and the Republican National Committee. Candidates typically raise more as the election nears, and Mr. Obama's fund-raising accelerated sharply in the summer of 2008.
But Mr. Obama faces a major challenge in the months ahead. To raise as much money for his campaign as he did four years ago, the president would have to raise about $70 million a month through the end of the election cycle, more than triple the rate he has been bringing in cash so far.
Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, has publicly set a more modest goal, saying the campaign expects to exceed Mr. Obama's 2008 fund-raising of about $750 million only by counting money he is raising for the national committee as well. That would require the campaign and the committee to raise about $51 million a month through November. Mr. Messina has also warned the party's two Congressional campaign committees not to expect their traditional allotments of Democratic National Committee cash this year, money Mr. Obama is husbanding for his own efforts.
Mr. Romney, the likely Republican nominee, ended March with just $10 million in cash on hand, according to campaign reports filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission, and has raised about $87 million during the Republican primary season. His aides are hoping to raise a total of $800 million for the fall elections in combination with the Republican National Committee, which last week finalized a joint fund-raising agreement with Mr. Romney. The committee ended March with $23.4 million in cash on hand.
But Mr. Romney is also expecting significant support from Republican super PACs and other outside groups. On Friday, officials at American Crossroads, the leading conservative super PAC, reported that they had raised close to $100 million so far this year for the group and an affiliated organization, Crossroads GPS. Crossroads alone is aiming to raise as much as $300 million this year, while other conservative groups, like Americans for Prosperity, have aimed at raising close to $200 million.
The super PAC backing Mr. Romney in the Republican primary, Restore Our Future, has raised $51.9 million, and plans to raise twice that by November.
By contrast, the network of Democratic super PACs has raised far less. Democratic groups with close ties to the party's Congressional leaders have raised about $18 million so far during the 2012 cycle. Priorities USA Action, founded by former Obama aides as a counterweight to Crossroads, raised about $9 million through the end of March.
To remain competitive, the Obama campaign has spent millions of dollars on high-tech, small-dollar prospecting. They have used sophisticated data mining techniques and low-dollar promotions -- like $3-a-head raffles for dinner with the president -- to reassemble the network of millions of supporters whose contributions helped propel him into the White House.
All told, about 58 percent of Mr. Obama's total fund-raising during the election has come in checks of less than $200, compared with about 38 percent in 2008. In March alone, Mr. Obama took in $14.2 million worth of checks under $200 -- more than all the money his campaign raised in February.

HEADLINE: For Earth Day, a Bit of Perspective

BYLINE: JUSTIN GILLIS


HIGHLIGHT: A PBS series offers a low-key but encompassing explanation of climate change and lays out common-sense strategies for addressing it. 

 BODY:
Millions of people worldwide will take to the streets, the parks and the National Mall on Sunday for the 43rd Earth Day, but perhaps some readers of the Green blog have yet to make specific plans. Here's one idea: Tune in to Earth: The Operator's Manual, one of the more interesting documentary series to come along in years.
The first of three episodes was broadcast a few months ago, and PBS has chosen to offer it as a rerun to member stations on Earth Day as well as to introduce the other two episodes. Exactly when it will be broadcast is up to your local station, but in most markets it will be possible to catch all three episodes over the next week, if not on Sunday. You can search for your local listings here.
The host of the miniseries is Richard B. Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State with a gift for talking about his field in terms that ordinary people can understand. The basic idea is to lay out the problem of climate change in the first episode and then talk about how to fix it in the others.

Several points distinguish this documentary series, created with financial support from the National Science Foundation, from others on the subject. For starters, it is gloomy! While Dr. Alley certainly conveys the sobering facts about rising emissions of carbon dioxide and what it could mean for the planet, he does it with a light touch and from interesting locales rather than beating people over the head with portents of doom.
Second, he and the producers manage to call forth a surprising diversity of voices in support of taking action to both conserve energy and convert to renewable energy sources. These include farmers, poor people, Republican lawmakers, military brass and native Alaskan villagers. Senator Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican, says in one episode, "What is more conservative than harnessing what is available and around us in a long-term, sustainable way?"
Dr. Alley himself says early in the first episode, "I'm a registered Republican, play soccer on Saturdays and go to church on Sundays." It soon becomes clear that none of that interferes with believing in physics. He doesn't explicitly complain about how climate science has become a political football, but you can sense throughout the three episodes that he yearns to pull the national conversation back toward the reality that he grapples with in his work. 
He uses elements of his personal biography to try to introduce a broader audience to that reality.
In the second and third episodes, we see examples of communities that have embraced renewable energy and conservation programs. Dr. Alley takes us from West Texas to Denmark to see farmers and villagers who have learned to love wind turbines, and we visit a low-income neighborhood in Baltimore that beat out the rest of the city in cutting down on energy use.
The overriding message in these vignettes is that local communities do not have to wait for national political leaders to come around on the issue of climate change. 
Saving energy makes economic sense now, these efficiency advocates say, even for people who may harbor some lingering doubt about the science of climate change. 
Conviction comes through in these videos. "You need to think of energy in a 50-year time frame, and our elected officials are thinking of energy in two-year election cycles," says John Hofmeister, a former president of Shell Oil who has become a strong voice for a better energy policy. "That's ridiculous."
Those who are so inclined can watch the series online here, also sampling some bonus features. 
And for an even deeper dive into the science of climate change and its solutions, Dr. Alley has written a companion book.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and a summary of the president's weekly address, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The traditional big sources of campaign cash are not deliveringfor the Obama campaign as they did four years ago, causing growing concern among aides as they confront the prospect that Republicans and their "super PAC" allies will hold a substantial advantage this fall, Nicholas Confessore and Derek Willis report.

        
A recent flurry of socially conservative legislation comes as Republicans at the national level are eager to refocus attention on economic issues, Michael Cooper writes. Some Republican strategists and officials fear that the attention to divisive social issues at the state level could harm the party's chances in November.

        
Mitt Romney may be inclined to start moving to the political center now that he is the presumptive Republican nominee, but the Obama campaign would much rather keep him in the conservative territory he staked out for months while battling for Republican primary voters, Helene Cooper reports. Campaign officials say their strategy now will be to tell the world that Mr. Romney isn't a flip-flopper after all - he's a right-wing extremist.

        
Mitt Romney's growing staff is hoping to quickly integrate with the Republican National Committee after Tuesday - when he is expected to win all five primaries - in an effort to avoid logistical stumbles that have hampered past nominees, Michael D. Shear and Trip Gabriel report.
Weekly Address

        
 President Obama used his weekly address to stress that higher education has never been more important for the future of America. "But here's the thing," he said. "It's also never been more expensive. Students who take out loans to pay for college graduate owing an average of $25,000. And for many working families, the idea of owing that much money means that higher education is simply out of reach for their children." He called on Congress to take action on making college more affordable. If Washington doesn't act by July 1, the interest rates on some student loans will double and nearly seven and a half million students will end up owing more on their loan payments. "That would be a tremendous blow. And it's completely preventable," he said. .
Happenings in Washington

        
 NASA will host displays and presentations on the National Mall Saturday and Sunday to mark the 42nd anniversary of Earth Day.

        
There will be a special awards ceremony for students from Kimball Elementary, champions of the first ever Recycle-Bowl - a nationwide recycling competition for grade school students.

HEADLINE: Suzuki Is Going Places, but Not in U.S.

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
IF a car company says nothing, can it be heard? It's a question facing American Suzuki Motor, as it cuts marketing budgets and sheds dealer franchises.
According to a report last week by Automotive News, the Japanese manufacturer's American subsidiary skipped the Los Angeles and Detroit auto shows, suspended its social media activity and abandoned national television advertising. 
The company reduced its United States dealer body, dropping 32 franchises last year, according to the report, and canceled its subscription to J. D. Power & Associates' customer satisfaction data, which is used to gauge dealer performance.
''We're currently on television in 20 regional markets and have some national print advertising,'' Jeff Holland, senior public relations manager for American Suzuki, said in a telephone interview. But management had not provided an explanation, he said, for suspending the use of the company's Facebook and Twitter accounts -- marketing tools with very low operating costs.
Suzuki's diminished voice has been accompanied by a sales decrease of 2 percent through March versus the similar period in 2011, at a time when the United States auto market has been rapidly expanding. If there's a bright spot, it may be an uptick in sales in February and March from a poor January. But 2012 shipments of 6,561 units through March suggest that if Suzuki is still in the game, it is only as a bit player. Hyundai, for example, shipped 69,728 vehicles in March alone.
The four Suzuki models marketed in the United States are generally well regarded. The Kizashi midsize sedan drew favorable comparisons to segment leaders like the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry when it was introduced in 2009. But sales of the sedan in 2012 are off last year's pace by 28 percent. Only Suzuki's top seller, the compact SX4, increased its sales over last year.
But the automaker retains a sizable international presence, with total 2011 production of more than 2.7 million vehicles.
Asked if the parent company was committed to maintaining a presence in the United States, Mr. Holland said, ''I'd have to check with our executives on a response, but I assume they would not have a comment.''

HEADLINE: Program for Low-Income Housing Compels Building in Poor Neighborhoods

BYLINE: By KARISA KING and RYAN MURPHY; This article was produced by The Texas Tribune in partnership with The San Antonio Express-News. Julie Domel contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Plans to build a low-income apartment complex for seniors in one of San Antonio's most fashionable neighborhoods had been posted for barely a week in January when the fury began.
Residents feared that the 68 rental apartments, which were competing for federal tax credit subsidies, would spoil the affluent Stone Oak neighborhood. In a storm of e-mails, calls and letters to local and state officials, they predicted unpleasant results: lower property values, more traffic and an increase in crime.
''It just didn't fit with us,'' said Francisco Martinez, president of the Mount Arrowhead Homeowners Association, one of about a dozen groups that opposed the apartments. ''These are single-family homes. Anything that takes away from that takes away from why we bought into it.''
By March, the neighbors had prevailed. The project and any chance of public subsidies this year were dead. 
Federal housing programs are designed to break up concentrations of poverty and discourage segregation. To lift low-income residents out of poverty, policy makers increasingly focus on the links between neighborhoods and access to jobs, good schools, transportation and safe streets.
But in Texas -- which gives neighbors a significant say in where subsidized housing can be built -- those policy objectives are largely being foiled, as the dynamics in Stone Oak illustrate. Subsidized apartments are being built disproportionately in impoverished neighborhoods with high concentrations of minority residents, according to an analysis by The San Antonio Express-News and The Texas Tribune.
The examination of data from the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, which administers the biggest federal housing subsidy program in the state, found that of $9.7 billion in tax credits awarded from 1990 to 2011, more than three-quarters subsidized the construction of apartments in neighborhoods mostly made up of poor blacks and Hispanics. Few units built with support from the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program, which gives federal incentives to private developers to build or rehabilitate low-cost apartments, were in areas that are predominantly white.
The examination found that:
Of the 193,000 tax-credit units subsidized statewide, 78 percent are in census tracts where more than half of all residents are minorities. By comparison, only 59 percent of all rented apartments are in the same areas, according to census data.
Roughly 31 percent of the units across the state are in neighborhoods with high concentrations of minority residents -- 90 percent or more -- which is about twice the rate for all rental housing.
Eighty percent of the low-income apartments, but only 64 percent of all rented units, are in poor census tracts where residents earned less than the state median household income, $49,646.
''Those figures are startling,'' said John Henneberger, co-director of the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service in Austin. ''These funds are supposed to be used to overcome patterns of economic and racial segregation. It appears that they're doing exactly the opposite.''
In many cases, tax-credit financing has clustered apartments in areas suffering from the kind of blight the program is supposed to correct.
The problem is more prevalent in Texas. A study by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2009 ranked Texas fourth in the nation for placing tax-credit apartments in areas where more than half of the residents were minorities.
How the state housing agency dispenses the credits -- worth about $450 million this year -- has come under increasing public scrutiny. In March, a federal judge in Dallas ruled that the program violates the Fair Housing Act. Though the lawsuit focused on a concentration of tax credit-financed apartments in minority areas of Dallas, Chief Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater of the Federal District Court in Dallas ordered a statewide remedy.
The nonprofit group Inclusive Communities Project said in the suit against the state that the department deliberately steered projects into minority neighborhoods. But Judge Fitzwater sided with the state, which argued that it has no control over the location of apartments and that the approval of subsidies is based on a strict point system that is blind to race. The agency also pointed out that developers pick the sites and draw up proposals before the state awards money to high-scoring projects.
The housing department and Inclusive Communities Project declined to comment while the state works on a corrective plan, which is due in May.
High land costs in affluent areas and federal incentives for building in the poorest neighborhoods also aggravate the racial and economic imbalance.
The angry reaction of the Stone Oak neighborhood to the proposed senior apartments, however, epitomized what many view as the biggest cause by far -- state rules that allow such groups to block low-income housing based on not-in-my-backyard fears.
In the scoring system, community support is the second-biggest point-getter -- the first is the financial feasibility of a project. The deals can be lucrative, and the competition is fierce. A single point can separate winning and losing proposals. And with application costs that run up to $100,000, many developers avoid the risks of pitching projects in affluent neighborhoods.
''Usually your more organized neighborhoods and communities are ones that have more resources, and those are the ones that are going to get organized more quickly if they don't want you there,'' said Jennifer Gonzalez, executive director of the Alamo Area Mutual Housing Association, a nonprofit San Antonio developer. ''We just don't even go there.''
Unless low-cost apartments coincide with other public subsidies, they do not typically improve neighborhoods, said Jill Khadduri, the former director of policy development at HUD. By competing with other low-rent apartments already in those neighborhoods, the subsidized units can even add to blight, she said.
''The net effect is not really to improve the neighborhood because it's just moving tenants from one building to the other,'' she said.
The pushback from middle-class neighborhoods has also fostered concentrations of low-income apartments in areas that already accepted tax-credit deals.
In the neighborhood surrounding Mission Del Rio apartments on San Antonio's south side, one of every two rental units was built or refurbished with tax credits. The median household income there is $14,352 a year, and 9 percent of the population is white.
The well-kept complex stands out from a dreary landscape of warehouses, railroad tracks and ramshackle apartments with boarded windows.
Genia Machado and her husband, Elijah, said they were drawn to the complex three years ago because it looked nice and accepted Section 8 housing vouchers. But two weeks after moving in, Mr. and Mrs. Machado were robbed at gunpoint on their way home from the bus stop. Since then, thieves have broken down their door twice, and they no longer go outside at night.
Living in the neighborhood also requires Mr. Machado to commute 35 minutes to his construction job on the north side. Mrs. Machado is looking for work, but is finding that her options in the neighborhood are limited.
''Usually all the jobs are farther away, on the north side,'' she said. ''They want to pay me minimum wage, and I can't be wasting that kind of gas to get up there. Gas is expensive.''

HEADLINE: No City for Old Tankers

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
AN empty oil tanker makes a forlorn setting for a ghost story, and at Pier 9B in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the other day, the winds of April wailed a haunting accompaniment to a tale of maritime woe. Inside the tanker, the Mary A. Whalen, Carolina Salguero raised her raspy Brooklyn voice above the clang of iron chairs being blown over on the deck.
''Now I'm going to cry,'' she said, as she finished giving a tour of the ship that has been her home for most of the past five years. ''I just hope that we're not going to be the Penn Station of the waterfront. The tragedy of Penn Station was that nobody talked about historical preservation until after they tore it down.''
Some ships run into icebergs and become 3-D movie extravaganzas; others disappear silently into the abyss of paperwork. 
Ms. Salguero, 51, bought the 613-ton ship for her nonprofit organization, PortSide NewYork, in 2006 for $16,500, with plans to serve visitors and the companies working in the harbor. She envisioned a future of educational exhibitions and cultural events, as well as weddings and other fund-raising activities. A local opera company staged Puccini's ''Il Tabarro'' for large crowds in 2007, but never again.
Now the Mary Whalen is homeless, and PortSide is running out of money, unable to afford the $5,000 a month it costs to keep the ship idle. Unless the organization finds a new berth or a stream of cash in the next few weeks, Ms. Salguero said, she will have to disband it and give up the 74-year-old vessel, probably consigning it to the scrap heap.
''It'd be a barren and sorrier harbor without the Mary Whalen,'' said Roland Lewis, president of the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance, a consortium of organizations working on the shoreline.
''It's a living artifact of New York's maritime history, as important as a painting in a museum or anything that tells us who we are and how we got here,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''And you can get inside it, unlike a painting. It's right in the water where it lived and worked.''
The Mary Whalen's current berth is within the Red Hook Container Terminal, which belongs to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. To reach it, a visitor has to meet Ms. Salguero at a staffed security booth, then travel about a quarter-mile across a harbor front filled with working cranes and trucks. Under homeland security regulations that took effect in February, Ms. Salguero can escort only one visitor at a time to the ship, and she cannot leave anyone there unattended.
''I keep saying, The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings,'' Ms. Salguero said, enumerating a long history of failed efforts to secure a permanent berth at a city pier. ''But I'm past my comfort level financially. I've been without a salary since 2005. Many people helped make this, and many people want this, but we can't do it without a permanent home.''
THINGS were not supposed to be like this. After buying the ship from Erie Basin Marine Associates, Ms. Salguero and PortSide started negotiating with city agencies for a permanent berth. In the meantime, she began to put on events: book readings, a memorial service, the opera, educational programs, a folk concert and singalong, as well as Tanker Time -- free time for visitors to hang out on the deck. In March 2009, the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which leases part of the waterfront from the Port Authority, said it was awarding PortSide warehouse and dock space at the Atlantic Basin, near the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.
Then the deal for the berth evaporated. ''We don't know why,'' she said.
The city agency put out another request for proposals for the site. It was just one of several negotiations that fell through, she said.
Jennifer Friedberg, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it had decided to rethink its plans for the Atlantic Basin as part of a citywide port development program. In the meantime, she said, officials were trying to find a short-term berth for the Mary Whalen, at the Atlantic Basin or somewhere else.
''We continue to work with PortSide NewYork to help them find a home,'' Ms. Friedberg said.
The Bloomberg administration has ambitious plans for developing the city's 520 miles of shoreline, including a 10-year program to build housing, parks, ferry terminals, tourist attractions and retail space. But so far these plans have not included Ms. Salguero or the Mary Whalen. As the ship moved from one temporary dock to another, Ms. Salguero became its unpaid keeper, living ''like a church mouse'' on money inherited from her mother-in-law and father, forgoing niceties like a salary or a working bathroom.
''The idea was we'd move somewhere else, but those somewhere elses have fallen through,'' she said. ''I've spoken to some parks about us going there, but there's always a problem. Either their piers won't work, or they're not designed for boats. Here in New York, there's not sufficient regard for historic ships.'' At one Manhattan pier that the city has designated for historic ships, she said, the Mary Whalen would need $40,000 in alterations to fit the space.
Without a permanent home, PortSide has had to plan events at the last minute, and it has been limited in its ability to raise money, Ms. Salguero said. In 2010, it negotiated a 55-day berth at the Atlantic Basin and drew thousands of visitors for a variety of programs. But last summer the ship remained in the container terminal, nearly inaccessible to visitors, and PortSide's only activities were events on other ships or docks.
For Ms. Salguero, life on the Mary Whalen has been ''very isolating,'' she said. In winter she shovels snow from the deck; in summer the temperature rises high enough that she had heat exhaustion last year. Her bathroom is a portable blue stall on the dock. The closest store is nearly half a mile away, on the other side of a security checkpoint.
''Of course it's a romantic impediment,'' she said of living on the ship. '' 'Mother of a homeless oil tanker' is not a label that encourages many fellows to step up.''
For now, though, her energy goes toward saving the vessel. With a permanent home, she said, the ship could raise enough money, through donations and events like weddings or corporate outings, to pay for renovations and a three-member staff, which would allow Ms. Salguero to return to something like a normal life.
Last week she began selling artifacts that PortSide had acquired for a land-based exhibition, including ironwork from other old ships. She said she remained hopeful that she would find a berth. ''Some parties are interested,'' she said. ''We've shown what we can do even without a permanent space.''
MS. SALGUERO was eager to describe plans for future events on the ship: an opera based on Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel ''Love in the Time of Cholera'' or a program of gospel music and spirituals, which often use water imagery. Or maybe several ships could band together in the channel as a destination for water taxis. ''There'd be much less review,'' she said.
But she also faced up to a grim prospect: if she gave up the Mary Whalen, she said, it was uncertain whether anyone else would want it, especially with a nonworking engine. ''That means she gets scrapped,'' Ms. Salguero said.
As for herself, she said she had no idea what she would do if she were suddenly to return to life on land. ''I'd like to go to sleep,'' she said. ''I'd like to have a proper vacation. For six years I've been the ship keeper; I have to watch over the ship. I would take a breather. But I'd rather not have to take it.''

HEADLINE: City of Sky-High Rent

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
GARY L. MALIN, the president of Citi Habitats, the city's largest rental brokerage firm, has seen the real estate market at its giddiest heights and its deepest despair. There should be little that surprises him.
But when Mr. Malin's company was preparing its latest analysis of the rental market, he was taken aback.
In March, the firm found, the average rent in Manhattan -- now $3,418 a month -- surpassed the all-time high set in the real estate frenzy of 2007.
''Right now, landlords can go for pie in the sky -- why not?'' he said. ''But when are people going to say enough is enough and look at other options?'' 
The last time rents shot up in a similar fashion, they were tied to a strong economy, low unemployment and booming business on Wall Street.
But this spring, Manhattan rental prices seem to be divorced from the larger economic picture. While the city has added jobs in recent months and growth in businesses like technology has helped make up for losses in the financial sector, much of country is still struggling.
That disconnect has only increased resentment levels among many tenants, already reeling from a year or more of rent increases.
''I felt trapped,'' said Jaclyn Barrocas, who was recently hit with a big rent increase on her East Side apartment. ''It was too expensive to move and too expensive to stay. And it feels like I am not even a person to the landlord.''
There is evidence that rising rents are driving prospective renters into the sales market. But for those who find buying a home in New York City is not an option -- whether because of bad credit, tougher lending standards or lack of a down payment -- the choices are limited and often unappealing.
Landlords and brokers say more and more young people are sharing, even if it means sacrificing a living room to add a bedroom or two. There has also been a surge of interest in the other boroughs, with many neighborhoods reporting record rents of their own.
Some tenants may be able to negotiate with their landlords, especially if they are long-term renters with good track records. But property owners have little reason to cut deals, because the vacancy rate in Manhattan is hovering around 1 percent.
And just 2,229 rental apartments are scheduled to be added to the market this year in Manhattan, a 30 percent drop from the average number over the last seven years.
The uncoupling of the national economy from New York rents is not typical, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ''When you see rents rising, it is usually reflective of a strong economy,'' he said. ''That is not the case now.''
Instead, he said, prices are being driven up by a tight credit market that forces people to stay in the rental market and limits new construction.
Some renters feeling the squeeze have resigned themselves to paying more for less.
When Ms. Barrocas, 26, first found her one-bedroom apartment with views of the East River on the 19th floor of a Murray Hill apartment building in 2010, it cost $2,550 a month. She and her boyfriend quickly signed up for a two-year lease.
With the lease set to expire in June, she recently received word that her landlord wanted to raise the rent by more than $500 a month. ''I started freaking out,'' Ms. Barrocas said. ''It is a huge increase.''
She was not ready to buy, but she could not afford to stay in her current apartment. The landlord would not negotiate. But moving, even if she found a cheaper place, would most likely force her to shell out around $5,000 for broker fees, security deposit and moving costs.
Fortunately, a cheaper apartment was available in her building. It was smaller, had little natural light and lacked river views. But at $2,745 a month it was in her price range, and there was no broker's fee. She made the move.
Ms. Barrocas says many of her neighbors feel similarly trapped. ''People just want to leave,'' she said. ''I would have preferred to leave.''
Landlords like to have leases signed in the spring, when they can command the highest rent because so many people are moving for work or school. So across the city, thousands of renters are facing a similar dilemma.
Rental averages are up in every category, with one-bedrooms rising the most, by 6.5 percent over the past year, to $2,747, according to the Citi Habitats report. Studios rose 3.6 percent, to $1,953; two-bedrooms climbed by 6.1 percent, to $3,865; and three-bedrooms rose 4 percent, to $5,107.
Surveys by the other major brokerage firms show similar leaps in pricing.
Mario Gaztambide, the vice president for residential asset management of the LeFrak Organization, said interest in lower-priced neighborhoods had surged. In Queens neighborhoods like Rego Park and Forest Hills, rents are surpassing peak prices from 2007, Mr. Gaztambide said, adding that newly renovated one-bedrooms are commanding around $1,700 a month.
''The amount of rental supply that has come on the market in the last two to three years has simply not kept up with demand,'' he said.
It is important to remember that New York's rental market is not monolithic. Although the rental averages calculated by the brokerage firms are based on market-rate units, the majority of apartments in the city are rent-regulated in some fashion and are not included in the averages.
Similarly, it is hard to get an accurate snapshot of the rents that small landlords are charging, since many do not use the services of a major brokerage. Renters often find that small landlords are more willing to negotiate because they do not want to have an apartment sit vacant for a prolonged period.
Joseph Rosati, 25, and his roommates adopted a different strategy: Pay more for more.
Last year, Mr. Rosati and two friends were living in Murray Hill, paying $3,700 for a two-bedroom apartment that they had converted to three. When the landlord decided to raise the rent to $4,300 last July, Mr. Rosati decided to shop for a new place.
The group could not find anything acceptable for under $4,700. They decided that if they were going to shell out that kind of money, they might as well spend a little bit more to be in a neighborhood they liked better.
They found a two-bedroom apartment with an office at 37 Wall Street for $5,400. Although they are paying more, they are happy in their new quarters. They signed a two-year lease, fearful that they would get hit with another increase if they did not.
''I did not move to New York City to live in Hoboken or Jersey City,'' Mr. Rosati declared.
Jonathan Wilf, a principal of Skyline Developers, which owns 37 Wall Street, says landlords looking to get top dollar must set their properties apart. That means renovated apartments and lots of amenities. His company also owns the building at 75 West Street. But prices there are more stable, he said, because the building is older and has not been renovated to the same degree as 37 Wall.
What would bring a halt to spiraling rents? It took a financial meltdown in autumn 2008 to topple the last rent peak. After the fall of Lehman Brothers, big landlords, able to pivot on a dime, started offering incentives like two months' free rent on a one-year lease. Those incentives lingered until 2010.
Barring a similar event, experts say it may simply be an issue of supply and demand, and woes will ease once developers start to bring more new units to market. But for now, more pain may lie ahead: Mr. Malin of Citi Habitats said he did not expect relief for renters anytime soon. ''This summer,'' he said, ''everyone is gearing up to push their rents until tenants say, 'This is just too much for me.' ''
Of course, one escape from the gut-twisting rental market is to leave it entirely.
Kimberly Kreuzberger and her husband, Bryan, both 32, were thrilled when they first moved into their loft studio at 666 Greenwich Street in March 2009.
The rent was $3,200 a month, but with the two free months they were offered, it worked out to just over $2,800. Last year, when the rent was bumped up to $3,450, they reluctantly signed on for another year. It was a lot to pay, but they loved living in one of the rare doorman buildings in the West Village.
Then they got word that the landlord was planning another increase this June. The rent would rise to $3,795.
''We were furious when we got it,'' said Ms. Kreuzberger, who works in advertising sales. In the elevator, the increase was the sole topic of conversation among neighbors. ''People will be like, I got hit for 13 percent, someone else 7 percent,'' she said.
The couple made up their minds to move; but rents for the kinds of two-bedrooms in elevator buildings they desired would be at least $6,000 a month.
Their broker, Scott Elyanow of Citi Habitats, urged them to think about buying an apartment, and to look in neighborhoods they might not have considered.
At first, the idea of leaving the Village ''was like a death to us,'' Ms. Kreuzberger said.
But the more they saw of the rental market, the more convinced they became that the time had come to buy.
The couple settled on a two-bedroom apartment at 100 Jay Street in Dumbo, Brooklyn. They paid just over $1 million, putting 25 percent down, and recently moved in. Their monthly outlay is $4,250, which covers their mortgage, common charge and taxes.
''It was such a leap,'' she said. ''But we could not be happier.''

HEADLINE: A Co-op With Elbow Room

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
OVER time, in their Upper East Side rental, Evan Lapidus and Natalie Ings felt the walls closing in.
Their 500-square-foot one-bedroom in a small walk-up building was bright and quiet. The rent, initially $2,300 a month, had dropped to $2,100.
But ''there was nowhere to put stuff,'' said Mr. Lapidus, who like Miss Ings is in his 30s. ''We found ourselves banging into each other or tripping over things. You had to navigate around the front door to get into the apartment. If we had more than two people over, it felt really tight.''
A larger rental didn't seem worth the price. With interest rates low, it was time to buy. 
The couple, who met five years ago when a friend of his became a roommate of hers, wanted to remain in the neighborhood. It seemed to have adequate street parking, and Mr. Lapidus, who is from Canada and works in strategic planning for a hotel company based in Stamford, Conn., drives to work. Miss Ings, who is from Australia, works for an Australian financial services firm in Midtown.
They began the hunt a year ago, checking out one-bedrooms in the $600,000s. ''I was coming to a realization that we didn't know what we were doing,'' Mr. Lapidus said. ''When you start looking for co-ops, it is very easy not to understand what you can afford.'' They learned they needed plenty of liquid assets -- a down payment plus two years of mortgage and maintenance payments. Their price range fell to the $400,000s.
Last spring, the couple visited two one-bedrooms across the hall from each other at an Art Deco co-op on East 77th Street. One was listed at $535,000 with a monthly maintenance fee in the $1,300s. The other was listed at $480,000 with maintenance of a little more than $1,000. (The building also imposes a monthly charge for an overnight doorman.)
Both apartments were amply sized, with around 800 square feet. When Mr. Lapidus saw the higher-priced one, he thought, ''Wow, this is much nicer -- I can see why they are asking more.'' Still, it was too expensive, so they made an offer on the other one, but it sold to someone else. (The price was $435,000.)
The couple liked the selling agent there, Peter Comitini, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group, and enlisted his help. ''You don't see a lot of 800-plus-square-foot co-ops in the low $400,000s,'' Mr. Comitini said, ''so finding something at the size we were hoping for was hard.''
Mr. Lapidus objected to odd layouts with inefficiently used space. Miss Ings disliked small kitchens, especially as they rarely had windows.
Nothing came close until the couple found a 750-square-foot one-bedroom, with bright southern sun, at a postwar co-op on East 67th Street. The price had been steadily dropping through the $400,000s, and the maintenance fee was a little more than $1,500 a month. Their offer of $390,000 was accepted.
''The combination of size and light was attractive,'' Mr. Comitini said. ''We weren't seeing many view apartments. Most were on lower floors.''
The place needed sprucing up. The couple had a contractor come in, prepared a co-op board package and declined invitations to out-of-town weddings in case they were summoned for an interview. All summer, ''we spent our weekends at Home Depot,'' Miss Ings said. They examined paint colors, bathroom fixtures, lighting and flooring.
But because both are foreigners, they were going to have to put a year's worth of maintenance in escrow. And they sensed a lengthy wait for permission to do renovations, which they preferred to have completed before moving in. They opted out. The apartment remains on the market, for $410,000.
Their mood brightened when they found two apartments in the same line at Charing Cross House, a postwar co-op on East 72nd Street. The higher-floor apartment had been on the market for a while, its price having dropped to $425,000 from $449,000. Maintenance was nearly $1,500.
They preferred the renovation on the lower floor, which had a lovely kitchen. It was listed at $440,000, with maintenance of almost $1,400. Having considered a place needing renovation, they were especially taken with the finished interior.
They negotiated the lower-floor apartment to $425,000. But the seller couldn't get financing for a new place, so the deal was off. They decided to go forward with the higher floor, and made an offer of $420,000.
''Natalie was at the end of her wits and was saying if this doesn't happen, we are finished, we will rent something,'' Mr. Lapidus said.
In mid-October, they drove to Kykuit, the historic Rockefeller estate in the Hudson Valley. Mr. Lapidus was planning to propose. On their way there, Mr. Comitini called to say that apartment had been sold to someone else.
''It was a definite downer,'' Mr. Lapidus said, ''but I wasn't going to let it ruin our special weekend. Then something magical happened and our luck turned.''
The very next morning, Mr. Comitini e-mailed them with the news that the price had dropped at one of the first places they had seen, the nice one-bedroom on East 77th Street, the one they couldn't afford at $535,000.
Now engaged, with the wedding planned for next fall, they visited again and quickly settled on a price of $430,000. Mortgage rates had dropped, too, so their rate was better than expected. The two, ecstatic and relieved, closed over the winter and had minor renovations done before moving in.
''I love walking through the front door,'' Miss Ings said. ''I hadn't felt that way in our rental apartment for a while.''
Their windows face the street, which they find a bit noisy, and there is a 24-hour diner on the corner, so they sleep with a white noise machine.
They especially like the utility closet in the hall, for all the stuff that has no obvious place. They had all four closets -- tall but not especially wide -- revamped to include Elfa shelving from the Container Store.
''The closets were not built for the times,'' Mr. Lapidus said. ''That is a classic feature of New York real estate, the closet challenge. Everyone I know has a closet issue.''
They are considering building another closet in a corner of the bedroom. There's enough space.

HEADLINE: The Preschool Race Is No Joke

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
WILDLY implausible faux news stories appear each April Fool's Day, some of which are taken seriously. This year's clear winner was the National Public Radio feature about a preschool's new requirement that all applicants submit DNA profiles.
As the segment begins, the host Guy Raz is greeted by Rebecca Unsinn, described as headmaster at a school called the Porsafillo Preschool Academy, located in a striking I. M. Pei-designed building in a leafy enclave on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Dr. Unsinn walks Mr. Raz through gleaming computer labs where toddlers master C++. She proudly describes the school's Mandarin Chinese immersion program. 
We are also told that Dr. Unsinn, a pediatric neurologist, was recruited to oversee the school's new genetic tests, designed to help winnow 12,000 applications for 32 available spots in next year's class. As she explains, ''We now know that simple DNA testing can determine whether a child will end up at Yale or at Yonkers Community College.''
It's a preposterous claim, of course, but some took it seriously. One Web site recounted the tale this way: ''Parents being what they are today, the applicants to Porsafillo don't even blink at the requirement, some going so far as to have the sample for the DNA test taken while the child is still in the womb, according to an NPR story.'' Such reactions bespeak how bitterly competitive the battle for elite preschool slots has become in New York and elsewhere.
According to the invisible-hand theory of Adam Smith, greater competition generally promotes better outcomes for society. But not always. In particular, when buyers are competing for high-ranked positions in some hierarchy, the invisible hand often fails spectacularly.
In education, the problem is that a quality is inherently relative. A good school is one that compares favorably with other schools in the area. Although a school's quality depends on much more than the size of its budget, additional resources can obviously help. And given the vast sums of money that some parents now have at their disposal, an explosive -- and largely unproductive -- arms race is inevitable.
Tuition at elite preschools has been soaring, sometimes to much more than $30,000 a year and occasionally within sight of $40,000 -- or above that of some prestigious colleges. Yet excess demand persists, and jockeying for acceptance is the subject of much New York lore.
In one notorious episode a decade ago, Jack B. Grubman, then a telecommunications analyst for Citigroup, told a friend in an e-mail that his boss, Sanford I. Weill, then Citigroup's chairman, helped to secure spots in an exclusive Manhattan nursery school for Mr. Grubman's twins after he began recommending that investors buy AT&T stock. (Mr. Weill said he put in a good word for Mr. Grubman only because he was a valuable employee.)
Mr. Grubman's children attended the school, and Citigroup pledged $1 million to the organization that runs it, the 92nd Street Y. In the e-mail, Mr. Grubman described the school as ''harder than Harvard'' to enter.
WITH such stories in memory, it's hardly surprising that many failed to spot the NPR report as a joke. The elite preschool market illustrates a simple but important truth: Contrary to the slogans of champions of minimal government, we don't always get the best possible outcomes when people are free to decide for themselves how to spend their hard-earned money. When all wealthy parents raise their bids for slots in elite preschools, they succeed only in bidding up tuition levels. There are still no more slots than before.
Most societies take at least some steps to curb waste that results from arms races in education and other domains. Consider the practice of kindergarten redshirting -- so called because of its resemblance to the practice whereby universities hold athletes out of competition during their freshman year so they'll be bigger and stronger during their four remaining years of eligibility.
Ambitious parents might consider redshirting their kindergartners, because they would then be older, smarter and more emotionally mature than their classmates. And because school performance is graded on a curve, they would be more likely to win admission to an elite university. But the same option, of course, is available to other parents, and if all took it, no child would perform better in relative terms. We'd just end up with an older crop of kindergarteners.
That's why parents have good reason to favor the laws in most jurisdictions that take the kindergarten start date out of their hands.
It would obviously be a much more radical step to impose limits on how much parents could spend on private schools. But what if we adopted the Buffett Rule, under which top earners' tax rates would be no lower than those paid by middle-income families? That would reduce what top earners could bid for the scarce things they want. But because the allocation of elite preschool admissions, penthouses overlooking Central Park and other such prizes is settled by relative bidding, the question of who gets what would be unaffected. So with no real sacrifice, the rule would generate new revenue for reducing deficits and rebuilding tattered infrastructure.
Top earners, meanwhile, will continue to reap the bulk of all income growth, and the preschool admission battle will grow steadily more intense. The only reason that no elite preschool has adopted DNA tests is that no one has figured out how to use them to predict academic achievement. Yet.

HEADLINE: Avoiding Legal Scams

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE offers seem like answers to the prayers of a struggling homeowner: a promise of legal tactics to forestall foreclosure, reduce mortgage balances and interest rates, or restore credit.
But these so-called mass joinder lawsuits being advertised in mailings are fraudulent -- sent out by companies purporting to be law firms, according to a consumer alert posted on the Federal Trade Commission's Web site.
The F.T.C. last month filed a lawsuit against one operation based in Santa Ana, Calif., asserting that it had persuaded more than 1,000 homeowners nationwide to pay $6,000 to $10,000 each to join ''mass joinder'' suits, which are akin to class-action suits. Homeowners ended up with little or nothing in return, the F.T.C. said. 
''It is an emerging trend,'' said Reilly Dolan, the agency's assistant director of financial practices, describing these fraudulent operations as part of a wide range of scams linked to loan modifications.
Consumers can lose valuable time to these dishonest players -- not to mention money. The nonprofit Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has brought seven lawsuits nationwide involving fraudulent loan modifications, estimates that homeowners nationwide who reported scams to its database have lost over $60 million in the last two years alone, and that $4 million of those losses were suffered by New Yorkers.
Of course, there are many credible law firms around to help homeowners. But Mr. Dolan noted that some businesses might be promoting themselves as providers of legal services, though they might have, say, only one lawyer on retainer, as a way around F.T.C. rules that allow only lawyers to collect upfront fees on mortgage aid. And these businesses may not meet all the requirements of the rule, which also mandates that the lawyer be licensed to practice law in the state where the homeowner lives.
''We definitely get people who think they have attorneys, who have retained attorneys who are not adequately assisting them,'' said Erica Jo Gilles, the deputy director for advocacy and outreach at the South Brooklyn Legal Services.
Such firms, and people posing as lawyers, are fueling a 60 percent jump in complaints about mortgage scams this year, according to a report this month by the Homeownership Preservation Foundation, which helps distressed homeowners. The nonprofit group says the increase coincides with the announcement of new federal relief programs for homeowners.
So how can consumers protect themselves from unscrupulous operations? Here are some suggestions from industry experts.
CHECK CREDENTIALS State bar associations have lists of licensed lawyers. (And the National Organization of Bar Counsel Web site has links to state bar associations.) When speaking with a lawyer, consumers might ask about the lawyer's track record, including documentation of successes via media reports or signed court documents awarding borrowers money or relief. Local bar associations can provide the names of lawyers who specialize in foreclosure and loan modification, as can housing counselors from nonprofit groups in some instances.
BEWARE OF PROMISES ''Legitimate lawyers don't make guarantees, just like doctors don't,'' said Colleen Hernandez, the chief executive of the Homeownership Preservation Foundation. In particular, Mr. Dolan of the F.T.C. suggested avoiding firms that promise to restore credit.
DON'T PAY IN ADVANCE ''If they're asking for any kind of money, you want to say, 'N-O,' '' said Martha Cedeno-Ross, a counselor at Neighborhood Housing Services in Waterbury, Conn. She notes that there are plenty of free services available at nonprofit groups certified by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

HEADLINE: Pros And Cons Of Hiring Outsiders

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
AS an employee, you may feel at some point in your career that you aren't being paid what you're worth. If the feeling is acute enough, you may lobby for a promotion and a raise. But suppose that doesn't work. Then maybe, you think, it's time to apply elsewhere.
Employers, meanwhile, may feel that their talent base isn't as strong as it could be. When an opening arises, they may receive some credible applications from inside the company. But what if they could do better? Maybe they should hire a star from the outside. 
Such thought processes are common among workers and bosses, and a new study shows how they play out. The study, by Matthew Bidwell, an assistant management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, found that external hires, on average, make around 18 percent more money than internal employees with similar positions. And yet they perform less well in the first two years and are also more likely to leave or be let go.
The findings may well stir indignation among internal employees passed over for jobs in favor of outsiders. The implications are worth considering as the economy improves, loosening hiring budgets and letting more employees seek greener pastures. They come amid a long-term trend of job mobility, with the idea of working for one employer for life seeming downright antiquated.
The rise of so-called knowledge workers has led to the myth of the completely portable employee, says Boris Groysberg, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School and the author of ''Chasing Stars.'' Because these workers' means of production is found between their ears, the logic goes, they will continue at the same level of performance if they move their brains to a new company.
To test that theory, Professor Groysberg studied some of the most ideal free agents he could imagine: Wall Street analysts. In some cases, just about all they had to do was clear off their desks and walk across the street to similar jobs. But he found that for most of the analysts, performance suffered significantly after they started a new job. They failed to account for all the institutional knowledge they had acquired at the old firm and would need to rebuild at the new one, he says.
After working somewhere for a while, you develop spheres of influence, says Beverly Kaye, founder and C.E.O. of Career Systems International, based in Scranton, Pa. You know who the power players are; you know the dos and don'ts. You know people's ''freaky buttons'' -- the odd things that can make them fly off the handle -- and that new people are prone to press by accident.
Companies consistently underestimate how long it takes new hires to be effective in a job, especially when it comes to building relationships, Professor Bidwell observes. They need to understand that new jobs can come with a substantial learning curve, he says.
Of course, there can be much value in hiring externally. Outsiders can bring fresh skills and ideas, along with a healthy skepticism about long-held practices. But Professor Groysberg says employers need to be much more strategic about hiring so that the organization has the right mix of old and new.
As for employees, Ms. Kaye advises, ''Don't look to leave if the reason you're leaving is financial only.'' That is only one marker of a good job match -- things like achieving the right fit for your unique skills are also important.
Managers need to be aware of valued employees who are ''loose in the saddle,'' says Ms. Kaye, co-author of a book called ''Love 'Em or Lose 'Em.'' A signal is that they aren't participating as fully as they once were and may need a new challenge.
Even the consideration of other offers means that talented employees are taking their eye off of their company, she says. Then there's the Pied Piper effect: if one person leaves, she says, others are more likely to follow.
INSTEAD of exit interviews, she recommends that managers conduct ''stay'' interviews -- saying to valued employees: ''Listen, I really want you to stay. What can I do to keep you?''
The first response will probably be ''Give me a raise,'' which is why managers are reluctant to have these conversations, Ms. Kaye says. But if they can't deliver on a raise, they can say so and then ask, ''What else is important to you?'' Chances are, she says, that they can find something to give these employees, thereby re-energizing them and persuading them to stay.

HEADLINE: Down With Everything

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
DOES America need an Arab Spring? That was the question on my mind when I called Frank Fukuyama, the Stanford professor and author of ''The End of History and the Last Man.'' Fukuyama has been working on a two-volume opus called ''The Origins of Political Order,'' and I could detect from his recent writings that his research was leading him to ask a very radical question about America's political order today, namely: has American gone from a democracy to a ''vetocracy'' -- from a system designed to prevent anyone in government from amassing too much power to a system in which no one can aggregate enough power to make any important decisions at all?
''There is a crisis of authority, and we're not prepared to think about it in these terms,'' said Fukuyama. ''When Americans think about the problem of government, it is always about constraining the government and limiting its scope.'' That dates back to our founding political culture. The rule of law, regular democratic rotations in power and human rights protections were all put in place to create obstacles to overbearing, overly centralized government. ''But we forget,'' Fukuyama added, ''that government was also created to act and make decisions.'' 
That is being lost at the federal level. A system with as many checks and balances built into it as ours assumes -- indeed requires -- a certain minimum level of cooperation on major issues between the two parties, despite ideological differences. Unfortunately, since the end of the cold war, which was a hugely powerful force compelling compromise between the parties, several factors are combining to paralyze our whole system.
For starters, we've added more checks and balances to make decision-making even more difficult -- such as senatorial holds now being used to block any appointments by the executive branch or the Senate filibuster rule, effectively requiring a 60-vote majority to pass any major piece of legislation, rather than 51 votes. Also, our political divisions have become more venomous than ever. As Russ Feingold, the former Democratic senator, once remarked to me: At the rate that polarization is proceeding, partisans will soon be demanding that consumer products reflect their politics: ''We're going to have Republican and Democrat toothpaste.''
In addition, the Internet, the blogosphere and C-Span's coverage of the workings of the House and Senate have made every lawmaker more transparent -- making back-room deals by lawmakers less possible and public posturing the 24/7 norm. And, finally, the huge expansion of the federal government, and the increasing importance of money in politics, have hugely expanded the number of special-interest lobbies and their ability to influence and clog decision-making.
Indeed, America today increasingly looks like the society that the political scientist Mancur Olson wrote about in his 1982 classic ''The Rise and Decline of Nations.'' He warned that when a country amasses too many highly focused special-interest lobbies -- which have an inherent advantage over the broad majority, which is fixated on the well-being of the country as a whole -- they can, like a multilimbed octopus, choke the life out of a political system, unless the majority truly mobilizes against them.
To put it another way, says Fukuyama, America's collection of minority special-interest groups is now bigger, more mobilized and richer than ever, while all the mechanisms to enforce the will of the majority are weaker than ever. The effect of this is either legislative paralysis or suboptimal, Rube Goldberg-esque, patched-together-compromises, often made in response to crises with no due diligence. That is our vetocracy.
The Financial Times columnist Ed Luce, the author of the new book ''Time to Start Thinking: America in the Age of Descent,'' notes that if you believe the fantasy that America's economic success derives from having had a government that stayed out of the way, then gridlock and vetocracy are just fine with you. But if you have a proper understanding of American history -- so you know that government played a vital role in generating growth by maintaining the rule of law, promulgating regulations that incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, educating the work force, building infrastructure and funding scientific research -- then a vetocracy becomes a very dangerous thing.
It undermines the secret of our success: a balanced public-private partnership.
''If we are to get out of our present paralysis, we need not only strong leadership, but changes in institutional rules,'' argues Fukuyama. These would include eliminating senatorial holds and the filibuster for routine legislation and having budgets drawn up by a much smaller supercommittee of legislators -- like those that handle military base closings -- with ''heavy technocratic input from a nonpartisan agency like the Congressional Budget Office,'' insulated from interest-group pressures and put before Congress in a single, unamendable, up-or-down vote.
I know what you're thinking: ''That will never happen.'' And do you know what I'm thinking? ''Then we will never be a great a country again, no matter who is elected.'' We can't be great as long as we remain a vetocracy rather than a democracy. Our deformed political system -- with a Congress that's become a forum for legalized bribery -- is now truly holding us back.

HEADLINE: Searching for the Next Snuggie

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
The Inventors Association of Manhattan meets on the second Monday of each month in the conference room of a Times Square law firm. I went to their most recent meeting to explore an idea that I've been hearing a lot about lately -- that we are living in a golden age of the independent inventor. Or as Ron Reardon, a patent agent who was a guest speaker that evening, explained, the odds of making money ''aren't good -- 1 in 100, 1 in 1000, I'm not sure -- but they are better than the lottery.'' 
Gathered around the room that evening were 55 people, old and young, in suits and T-shirts, everyone hoping that his or her idea could buck the odds. Chris Landano, a young, wiry firefighter, told me about his TrakPak360, a utility belt -- perfect for photographers, carpenters, ''anybody who carries tools!'' -- which is equipped with a plastic track that allows pouches to swing around easily. Lorraine Muriello, a woman from New Jersey, described her borderline-brilliant (but extremely easy to rip off) idea: No Sweat Towels, gym towels with zippered pouches for keys and cellphones. Her friend, Cheryl Manzone, told me she has filed countless patents over the past few decades (shoes with interchangeable heels, a compact diaper travel kit) and is now pitching her latest innovation, Stickpods, which are like straws with legs. They're for holding lollipops, among other treats. The one invention already on sale came from Gregory Quinn, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union. Quinn, a veteran driver (''Truck, taxi, limo, you name it'') has begun selling his Stimulus Pad, a kind of massaging car-seat cover that offers the equivalent of 15 masseurs' hands on your back all at once. And this is only a small sample of the ideas I heard about.
America has always been the land of tinkerers, from Benjamin Franklin and Henry Ford to Steve Jobs and the guy who created the Flowbee. But today's basement inventors have it easy in ways their predecessors couldn't have imagined. In the past, someone with a new idea would have had to actually build the thing themselves, find a market for it and figure out how to get it mass-produced. Now inexpensive technology means that anybody can quickly transform an idea into a physical product. Google SketchUp makes it easy for even the sloppiest untrained draftsperson to mock up a 3-D digital model. Any inventor can contact a Chinese factory, many of which are so hungry for American business that they will create a prototype for next to nothing. Sites like Etsy.com make it easier to reach a market, and others, like Quirky.com, allow users to simply suggest an idea and share the royalties if it makes it to the market.
This environment approaches the ideal economy that Adam Smith wrote about -- one in which size and power don't always beat good ideas in the market. Comprehensive data are difficult to come by, but the largest inventor's organization, the United Inventors Association, says their membership has tripled to 12,000 in the last 18 months. This spike is undoubtedly due in part to the economic slowdown and high unemployment, but the new tools seem likely to inspire a permanent increase in amateur inventing when the economy starts growing more aggressively (whenever that is).
This is good news for noninventors too. Many of the things that make life better started off in the brain of some lonely experimenter: the steam engine, airplanes, antibiotics, maybe even self-supporting lollipop holders. But after leaving the meeting, I felt less convinced than ever that we are living in a golden age of invention. Sure, the Internet and other tools have made the inventing process easier; but the entrepreneurial landscape hardly seems dominated by small inventors. Actually, the new-idea supply chain has some considerable rough patches that, in many ways, are harder to overcome than ever. Once invented and prototyped, those new products have to compete for space in a very narrow pipeline. Retail has become so concentrated that three companies (Walmart, Kroger and Target) control about a fifth of all United States in-store sales, and a tiny number of Internet and made-for-TV giants (Amazon, QVC) dominate in-home sales.
Another huge barrier to independent inventors is, paradoxically, the system set up to protect them. ''The patent system has become rather costly for a small inventor,'' says James Bessen, a lecturer at the Boston University School of Law. ''Go back 100 years, and patents were very inexpensive to get. You didn't have to have a lawyer to get one. The system is working in a very different way than it did years ago, and that favors large corporations.''
These days, the average costs for a patent are about $10,000 -- chump change for a corporation, but a considerable amount for many home inventors. And even when they spend that much, they often see their patent applications rejected. Even if an application is approved, larger companies have become adroit at swooping in and copying the product with just enough changes to make it legal. As a result, many give up on the process altogether. Gary Clegg invented the Slanket before Allstar Products Group introduced its near-identical Snuggie. Allstar outmarketed the unpatented Slanket, and the rest is history.
Since he took over the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 2009, David Kappos says, he has thought every day about a man he met from northern Vermont (''He was dressed, literally, in overalls with a red-and-white checkered shirt'') who had invented a brilliant, transformative two-cycle engine for a snow blower. ''If you don't protect your invention with intellectual property,'' Kappos says, ''it will be copied almost immediately if it's good.'' So Kappos has initiated a host of initiatives to help the small inventor with cheaper patent filing fees, pro bono legal help and a more responsive patent office.
It probably won't matter, though, says Paul Romer, an economist at N.Y.U. and perhaps the leading thinker of our time on economic growth. It costs around $1 million to defend a patent-infringement lawsuit, Romer says. So even if a lone inventor has a legitimate patent claim, a large company can sue and force the person into bankruptcy. Romer says that our patent-law system is one of the key barriers to progress, because wealth typically wins out, which would set Adam Smith spinning in his grave. The problem, Romer says, is not simply that the amateur snowblower tinkerer is cheated out of some profit; it's that people with real world-improving ideas may ignore them because they think the system is stacked against them. If that's the case, winning the lottery might be their best hope.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. It's easier than ever to be an inventor.
2. Then why are so few making money?
3. It's a complicated (and really expensive) process.

HEADLINE: When to Buy a Plane Ticket

 BODY:
To the Editor: Regarding ''When to Buy That Plane Ticket'' (Practical Traveler, April 15), we've reached the point where buying an airline ticket is a blood sport. The relationship of customer and airline should not be a competition, yet that is what it has become. I honestly think I'd like to return to the era of regulated (albeit higher) fares when everyone on the plane paid the same price in each class no matter when the ticket was bought. 
I fly only for pleasure, and having to devise strategies to secure a lower fare is tiring and not fun. This year, I gave up the fight. As soon as I committed to a late summer trip to Italy, I looked around a bit and bought economy-plus seats and paid extra to choose seats. It was more than I've ever paid to fly to Europe, and I purchased earlier than ever before, but I don't have to think about it until the trip. Ken Taub Flushing, Queens
To the Editor: My rule is to book five to six months out for international flights, but never check back to see what the price is later. It's essential for no-regrets travel. David G. Dill Madison, Wis.
To the Editor: I would love to be able set the price at which I will buy my holiday flights or my summer vacation flights months in advance, and just have a service buy them when, or if, the flight hits that price. The technology already is used by companies like Priceline. The only thing missing is the ability to buy the ticket automatically when the price hits the level at which I'm willing to buy. Chanel Renee Chambers Kirkland, Wash.

HEADLINE: On Black Sea Swamp, Big Plans for Instant City

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
ZUGDIDI, Georgia -- Reaching the site where Georgia's government is breaking ground for Lazika, its grandiose city of the future, requires navigating livestock -- shaggy cows and huge spotted hogs that sunbathe on the road to the hypnotic chirping of innumerable frogs.
Along the way, one finds varying opinions about the proposal to build a city of half a million here on a stretch of marshy land near the Black Sea, a project based on the Chinese concept of the instant city.
Khatia Ochiava, a schoolteacher in a village of 330 beside the building site, is so inspired by the idea that practically every day she watches a government promotional video, whose computer animation shows a Dubai-like cluster of skyscrapers and a teeming cargo port. She is already planning to open a restaurant called Cafe Lazika.
Others, like Kakha Pachkua, 38, have their doubts about the plans. A Megrelian, from the ethnic group that has lived here for centuries, he works at the edge of the site and says the ground there is so saturated that the proposed high-rises would require foundations nearly 80 feet deep. 
''Any Megrelian will tell you it is impossible to build there,'' he said, looking over at the wetlands. ''Lazika is only a word -- Lazika. There is nothing else. Those are huge buildings; I don't know how the swamp will hold them.''
Government officials have little time to engage with skeptics. The headlong pace of new construction in Georgia has not allowed for public debate over the projects' financing, environmental impact or merit. Despite queries raised on all of these scores, Lazika's first building -- a futuristic Public Service Hall for the new city -- is already under construction, and due to open in September. Ten years from now, President Mikheil Saakashvili has said, Lazika will be Georgia's second-largest city after Tbilisi, which has a population of about 1.5 million, and a leading Black Sea trading hub.
Since taking office in 2004, Mr. Saakashvili has based his leadership on one big idea after another: the dissolution of the notoriously corrupt traffic police; changing the country's second language to English from Russian; moving Parliament from Tbilisi to Kutaisi, a small city a three-hour drive away; and, now, confronting poverty in the agrarian west by building a city from scratch.
''The main reason we are changing our country so fast is that we are quite smart and very young and we want to do everything fast,'' said Giorgi Vashadze, a deputy minister of justice, who is overseeing the construction of sleek new government service buildings in cities across Georgia. ''We don't have time, like in Europe and America, to think about the project for 10 years and then start implementation. That's why these kinds of crazy ideas are sometimes coming to our mind.''
The idea of Lazika was rolled out four months ago, when Mr. Saakashvili was visiting Zugdidi, a city of about 65,000 that has been gradually losing population. The area, which produces tangerines and nuts, suffered greatly when Russia shut its markets to Georgian goods in 2005 and 2006, and two years later, when Russian forces sealed off the neighboring separatist region of Abkhazia. Ketevan Gvinjilia, 50, says residents have begun to economize by using electricity in only one room.
''We are sitting here in a vacuum,'' she said, adding that the region's economic stagnation was beginning to remind her of the period before Mr. Saakashvili came to power. ''We haven't gotten to that point, but we are gradually approaching it,'' she said.
The president acknowledged Zugdidi's troubles in a Dec. 4 speech, saying, ''We need a big breakthrough if we are not to have poverty anymore.''
The breakthrough, he said, would be a brand-new city and maritime port on the coast, 18 miles away -- an idea now common in China, which has erected dozens of cities to house its flood of rural migrants, but highly unusual for Europe. Mr. Vashadze said he was browsing on the Internet when he came across the idea of a ''charter city,'' with distinct regulatory and judicial systems that could attract foreign investors to build factories.
''This idea came to us -- why can't we do that in Georgia?'' he said. ''We looked out and we saw there is free space on the Black Sea coast.''
That the space is watery poses no problem, he figured, because ''if you go to China, you will see the new cities are all built on a swamp.''
When asked how many officials were working full time to plan Lazika, Mr. Vashadze said that it was only one, though he added that 10 to 15 people were on the project part time.
The presidential announcement has prompted a flurry of questions. The proposed site is at the edge of the Kolkheti wetlands, where in 1997 Georgia committed to preserve about 82,000 acres as part of the international Ramsar Convention. Though the convention, overseen out of Switzerland, has no power to punish violators, it warns of ''political and diplomatic discomfort in high-profile fora or the media.'' So far, Georgia's minister of environmental protection has responded rather sarcastically to concerns about the wetlands.
''Please help me and tell me what I will do to attract tourists who will come here and see these swamps, donate, take photos, write something about it, spend money here, tell others, 'These swamps are cool!' '' the minister, Giorgi Khachidze, told students in February.
The questions extend to practical matters, like how Lazika could attract half a million residents in a country of about 4.5 million that is neither growing in population nor urbanizing.
Financing is another concern: Four months ago, Mr. Saakashvili said Georgia had begun talks with several large investors from Europe and Asia who would shoulder most of the long-term building cost, which the president estimated at $600 million to $900 million. No investor has yet publicly committed, though, leaving it unclear how much of the burden would fall to Georgia's budget, which was $4.2 billion last year.
''We don't know how much it will cost, how much budget money will be spent,'' said Eka Gigauri of Transparency International, an anticorruption group that April 11 released a new study documenting violation of landowners' rights by state development projects. She said some of Mr. Saakashvili's huge building projects -- road construction in particular -- had greatly benefited Georgia, but she expressed doubt about the priority put on Lazika.
''There are so many things that need to be done,'' she said. ''Why build a totally new city? What stands behind that? There was nothing, no explanation. Just the president said, 'We are building a new city there.' ''
Similar questions have occurred to ordinary Georgians; in a poll released last month by the National Democratic Institute, 59 percent of those who were aware of the proposed construction said they supported building Lazika, but 68 percent said there should be public discussion in Parliament beforehand. Kakha Bakhtadze of the Caucasus Environmental N.G.O. Network said it would be difficult to have a serious debate about the environmental impact of the project because the government had not yet published a site plan. He added that he had little doubt that Lazika would be built.
''The government and the president announced that there will be a city,'' he said. ''Very often, when our president is announcing something, it is happening.''
Indeed, at a site 200 miles west of the capital, Merab Chkhikvadze, an engineer, was overseeing a crew of about a dozen workers on a recent day. As a pump squirted muddy water out of a 72-foot hole that will help make up the Public Service Hall's foundation, he said the project made him feel like part of history, and recited a proverb about the rewards that await the bold. But besides that one building, his site plan showed a six-lane circular road and nothing else. ''I don't exactly know,'' he said when asked what the rest of the city would look like. ''But a plan exists, of course.''

HEADLINE: Stocks and the Economy, Singing Different Tunes

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
''THE test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function,'' F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in 1936. He might have been describing the difficulties faced by current analysts of the financial markets.
The stock market roared through the first quarter of this year, yet most people believe that the economy isn't really healthy. 
That may not be a contradiction, but making sense of it may require some awkward mental gymnastics.
Certainly, the market's recent rise has been spectacular. While stocks have dithered in April, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned nearly 30 percent from its low of last Oct. 3 through March this year.
Yet the economic picture has been mixed at best, with unemployment still above 8 percent and the gross domestic product growing at an estimated annualized rate of only 2.5 percent in the first quarter, according to the Wall Street consensus. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll last week found that unemployment and the economy remain the main concerns of most voters, 70 percent of whom said the economy is ''very'' or ''fairly'' bad. That was an improvement over October, when 86 percent said the economy was ''very'' or ''fairly'' bad, but it's hardly upbeat.
This kind of dichotomy -- market returns that may not accurately reflect the underlying economy -- actually occurs rather often, and it poses a ticklish problem, both for professional money managers and for the rest of us.
For example, if you focus on the economy and find that it's weak, you might think it wise to lighten the risk in your portfolio and concentrate on protecting your assets. On the other hand, if you focus on the market's momentum and believe stocks are likely to keep climbing, you might try to ride that wave until it crests.
But if you look at both the economy and the market, and believe both that the economy is weak and that the market's momentum is upward, you may not be entirely comfortable with any course of action. Yet if you're fortunate enough to have money to invest, you must do something. In a report last week, Ned Davis, founder of Ned Davis Research, an investment research firm in Venice, Fla., put the problem this way: What's more important, he asked, ''being right or making money?'' He lands squarely on the side of making money, and says stocks are likely to rise over the next six months or so. But he acknowledged that he must balance his short-term views against his longer-term convictions about the state of the economy.
As a ''secular bear,'' he says he is convinced that the economy is plagued by deep-seated maladies that will take years to clear up and that, at some point, the stock market will resume a long-term downward trend. But as a close analyst of technical market indicators, he is advising clients that by year-end the market is likely to rise, though with some caveats.
There may well be a correction -- a relatively modest decline -- in the next few months, his firm has concluded. But it is telling clients that a cyclical bull market is in place -- a strong upturn within the longer downward trend.
This may well seem confusing. Mr. Davis said as much, reassuring clients: ''I remain a secular bear. I am concerned about the long-term consequences of the Fed's zero interest rate and easy credit policies and exploding government deficits.''
Despite these worries, he also said that it didn't make sense, at least right now, to ''fight the Fed and fight the tape.''
In a telephone conversation, Ed Clissold, United States market strategist for Ned Davis Research, explained the firm's analysis, which has a wide following among money managers. Much of the apparent paradox is a question of timing, he said. ''Four years from now, you may find that the stock market is trading in the same range as it is today,'' he said. But, he added, it is likely to cycle up and down in the interim. And over a much longer time frame, ''global deleveraging still needs to be completed, and that will have negative effects for the stock market.''
While the market may consolidate in the weeks ahead, two main factors argue in favor of a continuing upward trend this year, the firm has concluded. The first of these is ''the Fed'' -- meaning the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world, which have adopted extraordinarily accommodative monetary policies and committed to redoubling their efforts if economic growth falters. The stock market generally responds favorably to loose money.
The second is ''the tape,'' the momentum of the market and its individual sectors, which continue to show favorable patterns. In essence, what goes up tends to keep going up -- until it no longer does.
And there are certainly many factors weighing on the market, both technical and economic.
A short-term consolidation might be in order after a stock market rise as sharp as the recent one; in a benign forecast, a modest decline would prepare the way for a bigger run upward for several months, which Ned Davis Research sees as the likeliest outcome. Stock valuations are already elevated, the firm says, and while that may not be an immediate problem, it implies that some excesses will need to be wrung out of the market down the road.
ENORMOUS problems remain for the global economy. The European financial crisis has been contained but not solved; further flare-ups are quite possible and could derail the market. Longer term, Mr. Clissold said, reversing the credit expansion and reducing debt loads are likely to have negative effects on riskier assets.
Buy-and-hold investors who maintain diversified portfolios and rigorously reinvest dividends and interest can try to ride out these cycles, Mr. Clissold said, and ''have what will probably be modest returns'' in the years ahead. Market professionals who try to do better than that will need to be nimble indeed.

HEADLINE: Can You Build a (Better Brain?)

BYLINE: By DAN HURLEY

 BODY:
Early on a drab afternoon in January, a dozen third graders from the working-class suburb of Chicago Heights, Ill., burst into the Mac Lab on the ground floor of Washington-McKinley School in a blur of blue pants, blue vests and white shirts. Minutes later, they were hunkered down in front of the Apple computers lining the room's perimeter, hoping to do what was, until recently, considered impossible: increase their intelligence through training.
''Can somebody raise their hand,'' asked Kate Wulfson, the instructor, ''and explain to me how you get points?''
On each of the children's monitors, there was a cartoon image of a haunted house, with bats and a crescent moon in a midnight blue sky. Every few seconds, a black cat appeared in one of the house's five windows, then vanished. The exercise was divided into levels. On Level 1, the children earned a point by remembering which window the cat was just in. Easy. But the game is progressive: the cats keep coming, and the kids have to keep watching and remembering. 
''And here's where it gets confusing,'' Wulfson continued. ''If you get to Level 2, you have to remember where the cat was two windows ago. The time before last. For Level 3, you have to remember where it was three times ago. Level 4 is four times ago. That's hard. You have to keep track. O.K., ready? Once we start, anyone who talks loses a star.''
So began 10 minutes of a remarkably demanding concentration game. At Level 2, even adults find the task somewhat taxing. Almost no one gets past Level 3 without training. But most people who stick with the game do get better with practice. This isn't surprising: practice improves performance on almost every task humans engage in, whether it's learning to read or playing horseshoes.
What is surprising is what else it improved. In a 2008 study, Susanne Jaeggi and Martin Buschkuehl, now of the University of Maryland, found that young adults who practiced a stripped-down, less cartoonish version of the game also showed improvement in a fundamental cognitive ability known as ''fluid'' intelligence: the capacity to solve novel problems, to learn, to reason, to see connections and to get to the bottom of things. The implication was that playing the game literally makes people smarter.
Psychologists have long regarded intelligence as coming in two flavors: crystallized intelligence, the treasure trove of stored-up information and how-to knowledge (the sort of thing tested on ''Jeopardy!'' or put to use when you ride a bicycle); and fluid intelligence. Crystallized intelligence grows as you age; fluid intelligence has long been known to peak in early adulthood, around college age, and then to decline gradually. And unlike physical conditioning, which can transform 98-pound weaklings into hunks, fluid intelligence has always been considered impervious to training.
That, after all, is the premise of I.Q. tests, or at least the portion that measures fluid intelligence: we can test you now and predict all sorts of things in the future, because fluid intelligence supposedly sets in early and is fairly immutable. While parents, teachers and others play an essential role in establishing an environment in which a child's intellect can grow, even Tiger Mothers generally expect only higher grades will come from their children's diligence -- not better brains.
How, then, could watching black cats in a haunted house possibly increase something as profound as fluid intelligence? Because the deceptively simple game, it turns out, targets the most elemental of cognitive skills: ''working'' memory. What long-term memory is to crystallized intelligence, working memory is to fluid intelligence. Working memory is more than just the ability to remember a telephone number long enough to dial it; it's the capacity to manipulate the information you're holding in your head -- to add or subtract those numbers, place them in reverse order or sort them from high to low. Understanding a metaphor or an analogy is equally dependent on working memory; you can't follow even a simple statement like ''See Jane run'' if you can't put together how ''see'' and ''Jane'' connect with ''run.'' Without it, you can't make sense of anything.
Over the past three decades, theorists and researchers alike have made significant headway in understanding how working memory functions. They have developed a variety of sensitive tests to measure it and determine its relationship to fluid intelligence. Then, in 2008, Jaeggi turned one of these tests of working memory into a training task for building it up, in the same way that push-ups can be used both as a measure of physical fitness and as a strength-building task. ''We see attention and working memory as the cardiovascular function of the brain,'' Jaeggi says.''If you train your attention and working memory, you increase your basic cognitive skills that help you for many different complex tasks.''
Jaeggi's study has been widely influential. Since its publication, others have achieved results similar to Jaeggi's not only in elementary-school children but also in preschoolers, college students and the elderly. The training tasks generally require only 15 to 25 minutes of work per day, five days a week, and have been found to improve scores on tests of fluid intelligence in as little as four weeks. Follow-up studies linking that improvement to real-world gains in schooling and job performance are just getting under way. But already, people with disorders including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (A.D.H.D.) and traumatic brain injury have seen benefits from training. Gains can persist for up to eight months after treatment.
In a town like Chicago Heights, where only 16 percent of high schoolers met the Illinois version of the No Child Left Behind standards in 2011, finding a clear way to increase cognitive abilities has obvious appeal. But it has other uses too, at all ages and aptitudes. Even high-level professionals have begun training their working memory in hopes of boosting their fluid intelligence -- and, with it, their job performance. If the effect is real -- if fluid intelligence can be raised in just a few minutes a day, even by a bit, and not just on a test but in real life -- then it would seem to offer, as Jaeggi's 2008 study concluded with Spock-like understatement, ''a wide range of applications.''
Since the first reliable intelligence test was created just over a hundred years ago, researchers have searched for a way to increase scores meaningfully, with little success. The track record was so dismal that by 2002, when Jaeggi and her research partner (and now her husband), Martin Buschkuehl, came across a study claiming to have done so, they simply didn't believe it.
The study, by a Swedish neuroscientist named Torkel Klingberg, involved just 14 children, all with A.D.H.D. Half participated in computerized tasks designed to strengthen their working memory, while the other half played less challenging computer games. After just five weeks, Klingberg found that those who played the working-memory games fidgeted less and moved about less. More remarkable, they also scored higher on one of the single best measures of fluid intelligence, the Raven's Progressive Matrices. Improvement in working memory, in other words, transferred to improvement on a task the children weren't training for.
Even if the sample was small, the results were provocative (three years later Klingberg replicated most of the results in a group of 50 children), because matrices are considered the gold standard of fluid-intelligence tests. Anyone who has taken an intelligence test has seen matrices like those used in the Raven's: three rows, with three graphic items in each row, made up of squares, circles, dots or the like. Do the squares get larger as they move from left to right? Do the circles inside the squares fill in, changing from white to gray to black, as they go downward? One of the nine items is missing from the matrix, and the challenge is to find the underlying patterns -- up, down and across -- from six possible choices. Initially the solutions are readily apparent to most people, but they get progressively harder to discern. By the end of the test, most test takers are baffled.
If measuring intelligence through matrices seems arbitrary, consider how central pattern recognition is to success in life. If you're going to find buried treasure in baseball statistics to give your team an edge by signing players unappreciated by others, you'd better be good at matrices. If you want to exploit cycles in the stock market, or find a legal precedent in 10 cases, or for that matter, if you need to suss out a woolly mammoth's nature to trap, kill and eat it -- you're essentially using the same cognitive skills tested by matrices.
When Klingberg's study came out, both Jaeggi and Buschkuehl were doctoral candidates in cognitive psychology at the University of Bern, Switzerland. Since his high-school days as a Swiss national-champion rower, Buschkuehl had been interested in the degree to which skills -- physical and mental -- could be trained. Intrigued by Klingberg's suggestion that training working memory could improve fluid intelligence, he showed the paper to Jaeggi, who was studying working memory with a test known as the N-back. ''At that time there was pretty much no evidence whatsoever that you can train on one particular task and get transfer to another task that was totally different,'' Jaeggi says. That is, while most skills improve with practice, the improvement is generally domain-specific: you don't get better at Sudoku by doing crosswords. And fluid intelligence was not just another skill; it was the ultimate cognitive ability underlying all mental skills, and supposedly immune from the usual benefits of practice. To find that training on a working-memory task could result in an increase in fluid intelligence would be cognitive psychology's equivalent of discovering particles traveling faster than light.
Together, Jaeggi and Buschkuehl decided to see if they could replicate the Klingberg transfer effect. To do so, they used the N-back test as the basis of a training regimen. As seen in the game played by the children at Washington-McKinley, N-back challenges users to remember something -- the location of a cat or the sound of a particular letter -- that is presented immediately before (1-back), the time before last (2-back), the time before that (3-back), and so on. If you do well at 2-back, the computer moves you up to 3-back. Do well at that, and you'll jump to 4-back. On the other hand, if you do poorly at any level, you're nudged down a level. The point is to keep the game just challenging enough that you stay fully engaged.
Play a free online version of the N-back game.
To make it harder, Jaeggi and Buschkuehl used what's called the dual N-back task. As a random sequence of letters is heard over earphones, a square appears on a computer screen moving, apparently at random, among eight possible spots on a grid. Your mission is to keep track of both the letters and the squares. So, for example, at the 3-back level, you would press one button on the keyboard if you recall that a spoken letter is the same one that was spoken three times ago, while simultaneously pressing another key if the square on the screen is in the same place as it was three times ago.
The point of making the task more difficult is to overwhelm the usual task-specific strategies that people develop with games like chess and Scrabble. ''We wanted to train underlying attention and working-memory skills,'' Jaeggi says.
Jaeggi and Buschkuehl gave progressive matrix tests to students at Bern and then asked them to practice the dual N-back for 20 to 25 minutes a day. When they retested them at the end of a few weeks, they were surprised and delighted to find significant improvement. Jaeggi and Buschkuehl later expanded the study as postdoctoral fellows at the University of Michigan, in the laboratory of John Jonides, professor of psychology and neuroscience.
''Those two things, working memory and cognitive control, I think, are at the heart of intellectual functioning,'' Jonides told me when I met with him, Jaeggi and Buschkuehl in their basement office. ''They are part of what differentiates us from other species. They allow us to selectively process information from the environment, and to use that information to do all kinds of problem-solving and reasoning.''
When they finally published their study, in a May 2008 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the results were striking. Before training, participants were able to correctly answer between 9 and 10 of the matrix questions. Afterward, the 34 young adults who participated in dual N-back training for 12 weeks correctly answered approximately one extra matrix item, while those who trained for 17 weeks were able to answer about three more correctly. After 19 weeks, the improvement was 4.4 additional matrix questions.
''It's not just a little bit higher,'' Jaeggi says. ''It's a large effect.''
The study did have its shortcomings. ''We used just one reasoning task to measure their performance,'' she says. ''We showed improvements in this one fluid-reasoning task, which is usually highly correlated with other measures as well.'' Whether the improved scores on the Raven's would translate into school grades, job performance and real-world gains remained to be seen. Even so, accompanying the paper's publication in Proceedings was a commentary titled, ''Increasing Fluid Intelligence Is Possible After All,'' in which the senior psychologist Robert J. Sternberg (now provost at Oklahoma State University) called Jaeggi's and Buschkuehl's research ''pioneering.'' The study, he wrote, ''seems, in some measure, to resolve the debate over whether fluid intelligence is, in at least some meaningful measure, trainable.''
For some, the debate is far from settled. Randall Engle, a leading intelligence researcher at the Georgia Tech School of Psychology, views the proposition that I.Q. can be increased through training with a skepticism verging on disdain. ''May I remind you of 'cold fusion'?'' he says, referring to the infamous claim, long since discredited, that nuclear fusion could be achieved at room temperature in a desktop device. ''People were like, 'Oh, my God, we've solved our energy crisis.' People were rushing to throw money at that science. Well, not so fast. The military is now preparing to spend millions trying to make soldiers smarter, based on working-memory training. What that one 2008 paper did was to send hundreds of people off on a wild-goose chase, in my opinion.
''Fluid intelligence is not culturally derived,'' he continues. ''It is almost certainly the biologically driven part of intelligence. We have a real good idea of the parts of the brain that are important for it. The prefrontal cortex is especially important for the control of attention. Do I think you can change fluid intelligence? No, I don't think you can. There have been hundreds of other attempts to increase intelligence over the years, with little or no -- just no -- success.''
At a meeting of cognitive scientists last August, and again in November, Engle presented a withering critique of Jaeggi and her colleagues' 2008 paper. He pointed to a variety of methodological weaknesses (many of which have been addressed in subsequent papers by Jaeggi and others) and then presented the results from his own attempt to replicate the study, which found no effect whatsoever. (Those results have yet to be published.)
The most prominent takedown of I.Q. training came in June 2010, when the neuroscientist Adrian Owen published the results of an experiment conducted in coordination with the BBC television show ''Bang Goes the Theory.'' After inviting British viewers to participate, Owen recruited 11,430 of them to take a battery of I.Q. tests before and after a six-week online program designed to replicate commercially available ''brain building'' software. (The N-back was not among the tasks offered.) ''Although improvements were observed in every one of the cognitive tasks that were trained,'' he concluded in the journal Nature, ''no evidence was found for transfer effects to untrained tasks, even when those tasks were cognitively closely related.''
But even Owen, reached by telephone, told me that he respects Jaeggi's studies and looks forward to seeing others like it. If before Jaeggi's study, scientists' attempts to raise I.Q. were largely unsuccessful, other lines of evidence have long supported the view that intelligence is far from immutable. While studies of twins suggest that intelligence has a fixed genetic component, at least 20 to 50 percent of the variation in I.Q. is due to other factors, whether social, school or family-based. Even more telling, average I.Q.'s have been rising steadily for a century as access to schooling and technology expands, a phenomenon known as the Flynn Effect. As Jaeggi and others see it, the genetic component of intelligence is undeniable, but it functions less like the genes that control for eye color and more like the complex of interacting genes that affect weight and height (both of which have also been rising, on average, for decades). ''We know that height is heavily genetically determined,'' Jonides told me during our meeting at the University of Michigan. ''But we also know there are powerful environmental influences on height, like nutrition. So the fact that intelligence is partly heritable doesn't mean you can't modify it.''
Harold Hawkins, a cognitive psychologist at the Office of Naval Research who oversees most of the U.S. military's studies in the area, expressed a common view. For him, the question now is not whether cognitive training works but how strongly and how best to achieve it. ''Until about four or five years ago, we believed that fluid intelligence is immutable in adulthood,'' Hawkins told me. ''No one believed that training could possibly achieve dramatic improvements in this very fundamental cognitive ability. Then Jaeggi's work came along. That's when I started to move my funding from some other areas into this area. I personally believe, and if I didn't believe it I wouldn't be making an investment of the taxpayers' money, that there's something here. It's potentially of extremely profound importance.'' A similar view was expressed by Jason Chein, assistant professor of psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, who published a series of studies -- using another method, not N-back, for training working memory -- that showed an increase in cognitive abilities. ''My findings support what they've done,'' he says, referring to the work of Jaeggi and her colleagues. ''I've never replicated exactly what they do. But across a number of labs, using similar but different approaches to training, we have related successes./ I think there's a great deal of work to be done, but on the whole we are seeing positive signs.''
This past winter, I went to visit Jason Chein's lab in Philadelphia, where he has begun to train subjects with something called a complex working memory span task. ''It's a terrible name,'' he said with a laugh. ''And you could call it a gimmicky psychological task. But there are 20 years of research behind it.'' Chein invited me to try my hand at it. Once he clicked ''start'' on the computer program, the screen showed a checkerboard of 16 squares, with all of them white except 1; I was supposed to remember the red square's location. Then it showed a series of three checkerboard patterns; for each, I had to decide whether the pattern was symmetrical or not. This sequence -- having to remember the one red square, and then having to decide on symmetry -- was repeated three more times. At the end, I had to click, in order, on the location of those four red squares.
I got only three right.
''Everyone gets better with practice,'' he said. ''Some people get up to being able to remember a string of 11 or higher.''
Of course, the goal is not to get better at remembering the location of red squares on a checkerboard but to expand a subject's underlying working memory. Doing so, Chein has found, translates into the kind of real-world improvements associated with increases in cognitive capabilities. ''We've seen, in college kids who do it, improvements in their reading-comprehension scores,'' Chein said. ''And in a sample of adults, 65 and older, it appears to improve their ability to keep track of what they recently said, so they don't repeat themselves.''
In addition to working memory, researchers are seeking to improve fluid intelligence by training other basic mental skills -- perceptual speed (deciding, in a matter of seconds, whether a number is odd or even), visual tracking (on a shoot-'em-up computer game, for instance) or quickly switching between a variety of tasks. Ulman Lindenberger and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin used 12 different tasks to train 101 younger and 103 older adults. Compared with those who received no training, those who participated in 100 daily one-hour training sessions (both young and old) showed significant improvements on tests that measured reasoning, working memory, perceptual speed (in young adults only) and episodic memory (the ability to remember a short list, for example). A statistical measure of how those improvements correlated to one another suggested, Lindenberger concluded, systematic improvements ''at the level of broad abilities.''
At the University of California, Berkeley, Silvia Bunge, director of a laboratory on the building blocks of cognition, takes what she calls ''an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach.'' Working with 28 children from low socioeconomic backgrounds, she assigned half of them to play games designed to boost the speed of response times, and the other half to play games that target reasoning skills. ''Quirkle,'' for instance, challenges children to align tiles on a grid to match shapes and colors. After eight weeks of training -- 75 minutes per day, twice a week -- Bunge found that the children in the reasoning group scored, on average, 10 points higher on a nonverbal I.Q. test than they had before the training. Four of the 17 children who played the reasoning games gained an average of more than 20 points. In another study, not yet published, Bunge found improvements in college students preparing to take the LSAT.
Torkel Klingberg, meanwhile, has continued studying the effects of training children with his own variety of working-memory tasks. In October 2010, a company he founded to offer those tasks as a package through psychologists and other training professionals, was bought by Pearson Education, the world's largest provider of educational assessment tools.
Despite continuing academic debates, other commercial enterprises are rushing in to offer an array of ''brain building'' games that make bold promises to improve all kinds of cognitive abilities. Within a block of each other in downtown San Francisco are two of the best known. Posit Science, among the oldest in the field, remains relatively small, giving special attention to those with cognitive disorders. Lumosity began in 2007 and is now by far the biggest of the services, with more than 20 million subscribers. Its games include a sleeker, more entertaining version of the N-back task.
In Chicago Heights, the magic was definitely not happening for one boy staring blankly at the black cats in the Mac Lab. Sipping from a juice box he held in one hand, jabbing at a computer key over and over with the other, he periodically sneaked a peak at his instructor, a look of abject boredom on his freckled face.
''That's the biggest challenge we have as researchers in this field,'' Jaeggi told me, ''to get people engaged and motivated to play our working-memory game and to really stick with it. Some people say it's hard and really frustrating and really challenging and tiring.''
In a follow-up to their 2008 study in young adults, Jaeggi, Buschkuehl and their colleagues published a paper last year that described the effects of N-back training in 76 elementary- and middle-school children from a broad range of social and economic backgrounds. Only those children who improved substantially on the N-back training had gains in fluid intelligence. But their improvement wasn't linked to how high they originally scored on Raven's; children at all levels of cognitive ability improved. And those gains persisted for three months after the training ended, a heartening sign of possible long-term benefits. Although it's unknown how much longer the improvement in fluid intelligence will last, Jaeggi doubts the effects will be permanent without continued practice. ''Do we think they're now smarter for the rest of their lives by just four weeks of training?'' she asks. ''We probably don't think so. We think of it like physical training: if you go running for a month, you increase your fitness. But does it stay like that for the rest of your life? Probably not.''
If future studies confirm the benefits of working-memory training on fluid intelligence, the implications could be enormous. Might children with A.D.H.D. receive working-memory training rather than stimulant drugs like Ritalin? Might students in high school and college do N-back training rather than cramming for their finals? Could a journalist like me write better articles?
Of course, in order to improve, you need to do the training. For some, whether brilliant or not so much, training may simply be too hard -- or too boring.
To increase motivation, the study in Chicago Heights offers third graders a chance to win a $10 prepaid Visa card each week. In collaboration with researchers from the University of Chicago's Initiative on Chicago Price Theory (directed by Steven D. Levitt, of ''Freakonomics'' fame), the study pits the kids against one another, sometimes one on one, sometimes in groups, to see if competition will spur them to try harder. Each week, whichever group receives more points on the N-back is rewarded with the Visa cards. To isolate the motivating effects of the cash prizes, a group of fourth graders is undergoing N-back training with the same black-cats-in-haunted-house program, but with no Visa cards, only inexpensive prizes -- plastic sunglasses, inflatable globes -- as a reward for not talking and staying in their seats.
The boy tapping randomly at his computer without even paying attention to the game? He was in the fourth-grade class. Although the study is not yet complete, perhaps it will show that the opportunity to increase intelligence is not motivation enough. Just like physical exercise, cognitive exercises may prove to be up against something even more resistant to training than fluid intelligence: human nature.

 BODY:
The cover article last Sunday, ''Portent or Blip?'' (April 15), reported on signs of a recovery in the Manhattan real estate market. Following are edited excerpts from nytimes.com:
All you New Yorkers might be interested to know that you don't have a monopoly on a lively market. Much of the greater Boston area is experiencing the same phenomenon. I had buyers (not investors, not ''off-shore'' buyers, just a young couple looking for a home) offer $20,000 above asking on a modest, nondescript condo in Brookline (whose neighbor had closed below asking not three weeks before) -- there were five offers and they did not get the unit. ... ''Too many eager buyers, not enough inventory'' is not only the story in New York but also around Boston. Ellen F
Somerville, MA 
We know the ''rich'' are getting richer. So it's not surprising a million-dollar house sells fast. The recovery comes when the middle and working classes are O.K. Get a grip! Laughingdragon

A question: Would a professional couple who worked in Manhattan (high school teacher and physical therapist, for example) make enough money to live in a Manhattan apartment that costs a million dollars? Or would they have a mortgage for the rest of their lives? Or would they live somewhere else? I'm truly curious. Dee Western New York
Some people simply live beyond their means just to live in Manhattan. They think that spending over 50 percent of their after-tax monthly earnings in rent is O.K. and is worth it. Some people are sharing their apartment with one or more people to make it more affordable. J, NYC
No, a regular professional couple like you describe cannot afford a $1 million apartment. Couples like that live in Queens, New Jersey or Brooklyn. Or in less desirable, smaller apartments in Manhattan, like those with a 15-minute walk to the nearest subway. Julie, New York, NY
New York City real estate, predominantly Manhattan/Brooklyn, is and will always be resilient. It has survived a tragically devastating terrorist attack, and an economic meltdown, yet continues to forge ahead. Why? Two reasons: A) This is NYC, still one of the most desirable places to be on the planet. B) Supply and demand. Since the area is relatively small in terms of square miles, there will always be more demand than supply. DSTEIN
nyc, ny
Just another bubble brewing.
Burn Wall Street burn, nyny
Whether city real estate is recovering (was it ever down?) remains debatable. There seem to be neighborhoods where the market usually remains strong. As long as there are sufficient high-paying jobs, the real estate will market will remain good. Because buying a home is partially emotional, people with the financial means will tend to buy even if the overall market is overvalued. ... Utopia1, Las Vegas, NV
Well, I don't have a crystal ball, so I can't say exactly where it is headed, but I hope, considering I wish to sell my apartment, that the market is headed up for the next six months. Then, AFTER the sale is completed, fully conscious of my own hypocrisy, I hope the market heads dramatically down, because this bubble is unsustainable and the city cannot forever remain exclusively the land of the rich without, ironically, the quality of life going down. Middle-class families have to be able to afford live here, and right now they can't. ... Real estate bubbles don't just affect the housing market, they crush small businesses, leading to a city of nothing but banks and drug stores. Oe, ny
Shades of the unscrupulous times in the early 1930s when the moneyed swooped in on burdened property owners like vultures on carrion and many folks ended up in tents ... if they were lucky. Hank

I'd say the market had bottomed out. But given that the industry still has layoffs going on and bonus comp was weak last year, I don't think it will take off anytime soon. Brokers will always insist it's just about to take off. That's their job. The macro story would suggest otherwise. My guess is much of the ''takeoff'' is being spurred by offshore buyers looking to pick up investment properties. JG, New York
I think the Manhattan real estate market is headed to even more of a 1 percenter ghetto. Not to sound churlish or resentful, but what's the point of a city of uberrich? John L, Manhattan
Wherever the market is headed, it won't be good for anyone who doesn't have money.

HEADLINE: Are Travel Agents Back?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THE complimentary wine and fruit platter was sent up to Jessica Griffin and her family moments after they strolled into their roomy suite. They were accompanied by a bellhop who placed their bags near a tidy crib made up with luxurious, high thread-count sheets for Ms. Griffin's 1-year-old daughter.
The V.I.P. treatment at the Cheeca Lodge and Spa in the Florida Keys last month hadn't come with an extra cost. In fact, Ms. Griffin said, she paid about $100 a night less than the standard rate for her room. And the deal wasn't the result of hours of tedious online research either. She had finagled her savings the old-fashioned way: through a travel agent.
''I needed recommendations and someone to steer me in the right direction,'' said Ms. Griffin, who opted to work with an agent after years of making her own reservations because she needed a getaway suitable for a toddler and had little interest in scrolling through endless and conflicting user hotel reviews online. ''There are so many,'' she said. And with every site displaying beautiful pictures and tantalizing offers, ''it can be overwhelming.'' 
''I wanted somebody from a reputable agency who could say yes, you'll enjoy this stay,'' she said.
According to those in the travel agent industry, clients like Ms. Griffin are not alone, and are in fact helping to stanch the bloodletting the industry has experienced since the onset of D.I.Y. booking more than a decade ago. Nearly one in three leisure agencies is hiring, according to PhoCusWright, a travel research firm. And in 2011 travel agencies experienced a second consecutive year of growth; their bookings account for a third of the $284 billion United States travel market.
This comes after years during which all signs seemed to be suggesting that travel agents would soon go the way of telex operators. And it's true that the numbers are stark: During the industry's peak years of the mid-1990s, there were about 34,000 retail locations booking trips. Today, there are 14,000 to 15,000, according to PhoCusWright. In 2009 alone, in the throes of the recession, bookings through traditional agencies plummeted by 23 percent.
But now, some green shoots. An improving economy and the corporate travel that goes with it seem to be converging with a population for whom booking travel online has become increasingly onerous and time-consuming. Just how time-consuming? Steve Peterson, the global travel and transportation leader for the I.B.M. Institute for Business Value, set out to answer that very question. In a survey of more than 2,000 travelers worldwide, 20 percent said it took them more than five hours to search and book travel online. Nearly half said it required more than two hours.
No one expects agency business to rebound to pre-Internet levels, but recent signs -- like the fact that leisure travelers accounted for a 10 percent bump in sales in 2010 (a bit less in 2011) -- suggest that agents can still play a relevant role. And though no one has been keeping track of the reasons travelers are turning to actual human beings, Mr. Peterson suspected it might have something to do with the drawbacks of the Web. ''It's come to a point that it's too much information to be confident that they have the ability to book the lowest fare,'' or uncover the best place to stay, he said of the respondents. ''Consumers are hungry for that one-and-done shopping experience.''
As it turns out, after years of losing ground to online sites, a new breed of tech savvy, specialized and collaborative agent has emerged.
''This whole idea that I go to a travel adviser to tell me what to do -- those days are long gone,'' said Matthew Upchurch, the chief executive of Virtuoso, a network of more than 330 upscale agencies. A contemporary travel agent expects customers to have done their homework, he said: ''You've done a lot of research, now how do we work together?''
Agents today also know they must set themselves apart from the Web by offering special experiences that consumers can't easily get on their own, like after-hours tours of the Sistine Chapel, tee times on P.G.A. golf courses normally closed to the public or the ability to pull some strings to get clients into that sold-out hotel or on the next flight out when bad weather strikes.
Such services often come with fees that range widely from $25 to book an airline ticket to $12,000 annual retainers. But even for budget travelers, the overall experience can offer better value, as my colleague Seth Kugel found in a recent test of agents versus online search engines. Agents won ''nearly every time,'' he wrote, ''on both price (the objective part of the test) and service (what you might call the essay question). In other words, the agents suggested alternate routes, gave advice on visas and just generally acted, well, more human than their computer counterparts.''
Comfortable with technology and accustomed to information on demand, new agents respond to clients around the clock through text, e-mail, cellphone and Twitter. And when they are not inspecting new hotels or touring the latest cruise ship, they are often blogging about recent trips or posting their photos to Facebook. Having grown up booking their own travel online, they understand the skepticism new clients may have about whether an agent can do any better and look for opportunities to wow them. Here are a handful of young, up-and-coming agents who have been identified as rising stars by trade publications, peer reviews and the agent community at large for their travel know-how, customer service and budding expertise.

Ms. Brower was one of the first agents in 2007 to be hired under the American Express Travel Research Apprentice program, designed to mold young talent into experienced travel counselors. A year after going through the 12-month curriculum, which includes training on everything from customer service to booking systems, she was named an American Express Pacesetter, an award presented to the top 5 percent of performers in sales and customer service; she has received the award every year for the last three years.
On Her Radar Croatia. Affordable (compared with Western Europe), with gorgeous beaches, historic architecture, good food, ''it's definitely becoming one of the Mediterranean's hottest destinations,'' she said.
Travel Tip The best way to get a quick shot of authentic local culture is to visit an outdoor market or grocery store. ''Markets are a terrific place to see real people, living real lives, and there are tons of interesting foods and packaging to check out,'' she said.
JASON COLEMAN
Jason Coleman Inc. Los Angeles
Age 36.
Specialty Cruises.
Planning Fee $75 to $175 an hour or clients can negotiate an annual flat fee.
Back Story By focusing on a small portfolio of cruise lines that includes Princess, Cunard, Norwegian, Carnival and Crystal, and by sailing several times a year, Mr. Coleman has come to know many of those ships intimately, sussing out everything from the must-do shore excursions to what the various cabins are like.
In college, Mr. Coleman trained for a job in theatrical production and stage management. Although his career took a very different path, he said there were many parallels between producing a show for the theater and advising travelers on their vacations. Travel consulting, he said, is just ''producing an enjoyable and entertaining experience for the audience.
''For me, that means delivering a memorable and flawless vacation for my clients,'' he said.
Mr. Coleman's efforts have not been unrecognized: He was cited as one of the top 25 agents of 2010 by Travel Agent magazine; in the same year he was named the 2010 Young Professional of the Year by the American Society of Travel Agents; and last year he received the 2011 Industry Activist Trendsetter Award from TravelAge West magazine for notable achievements in support of travel agents.
On His Radar ''The buzz I'm hearing for 2012 is longer, more exotic cruise itineraries, especially South America and Asia,'' he said. ''I've also seen a spike in interest for British Isles and London; lots of interest surrounding the Olympics this summer.''
Travel Tip Some ships have tiered decks, like a wedding cake, with lower decks that stick out the farthest, he said. If you like the sun, choose an extended balcony on the lower decks.
JULIA P. DOUGLAS
Jet Set World Travel Inc. Chicago
Age 31.
Specialty Honeymoons, babymoons and other special occasion trips.
Planning Fee $250 a couple or family, in addition to hourly fees for concierge services and additional research.
Back Story While working as a commercial property broker at Lloyd's of London, Ms. Douglas earned the nickname Jet Set Julia for her weekend escapes to Berlin, the French Alps, Edinburgh and so on. After becoming the de facto travel adviser for her friends, family and colleagues, she decided to make it her career. In 2005, she moved from London to Chicago and established Jet Set World Travel, which she describes as a luxury travel consultancy and concierge service, often surprising clients with special touches like airport transfers in Bentleys, ''triple-room upgrades'' and bubble baths drawn upon arrival.
She has personally visited 46 countries and is on the road at least seven days out of every month, inspecting new hotels and destinations. Next month she is off for a nine-night trip to Botswana, where she will be staying at eight safari camps to make sure they are up to snuff for her guests. ''We won't unpack,'' she said. ''Between game drives, we're moving every afternoon after lunch.''
Last year, she was recognized by the Virtuoso luxury travel network with a ''rising star'' award.
On Her Radar Bhutan, where a new domestic airport that opened in the Bumthang Valley offers better access to more of the country.
Travel Tip ''Build loyalty with an airline or hotel group so you are well taken care of,'' she said. ''We have many Executive Platinum American Airlines clients, and the reservation agents have been with American for 20-plus years and know the traveler intimately, secure upgrades immediately, always find award availability and accommodate changes while in transit.''
BETH JENKINS
McCabe World Travel McLean, Va.
Age 24.
Specialty Latin America and Western Europe.
Planning Fee $50 and up, depending on the trip's length and complexity.
Back Story Ms. Jenkins, who studied international relations in college, has traveled throughout Mexico and South America and toured Europe while living and studying in Madrid. Though she is the youngest agent in her office by at least 10 years, she knows how to work her travel connections to gain special access for her clients, whether it is setting up an after-hours tour of the Sistine Chapel or getting someone into a sold-out hotel.
''Challenging situations are more easily overcome, and demanding clients more easily satisfied, when you have partners on your side,'' she said, noting that she always calls a hotel the day before clients check in to confirm that everything is set for their arrival and to see if they can be upgraded.
''By touching base,'' she said, ''I never leave any added benefit on the table that my clients could be receiving.'' She was listed among Travel Agent magazine's top 35 travel agents under 30 in 2011, and is on the steering committee for the Young Leaders Conference at Luxury Travel Expo, an invitation-only event designed to bring high-end travel advisers together with premium hotels, cruises and tour operators.
On Her Radar Adventure trips like sky diving in New Zealand or hiking Machu Picchu. ''So many of my contemporaries are really looking for experiential travel -- to take bigger or more exotic trips before settling down,'' she said. ''Taking the 'bucket list' trips instead of saying we'll wait until we are older to do it.''
Travel Tip When flying to Europe from the United States, book the hotel room a night early. That way, when you arrive at 6 a.m. and your body thinks it is 1 a.m., she said, you can have breakfast delivered to your room, then take a nap to avoid jet lag.
RYAN MCGREDY
Moraga Travel Moraga, Calif.
Age 35.
Specialty Family travel.
Planning Fees $75 to $300, depending on trip complexity.
Back Story For Mr. McGredy, vacation planning is not just about sending people to great places, but also imagining the most mundane details of his clients' trips and planning around them. ''That means we look at the little things that you don't tend to think of as a traveler, like the added taxi cost of staying in this place versus that, depending on your itinerary,'' he said.
With a background in Web development for Fortune 500 companies, Mr. McGredy said he, like many in his generation, believed that ''things are faster, easier and a better value when you do all of the work yourself online.'' But after trading some Web development work for a stake in a travel agency, he learned that there were advantages to using an agent. ''Not only was I saving myself hours of searching and frustration as I tried to find travel that suited my needs and fit within my budget, but I found that all of a sudden I was being treated like a high-value customer wherever I went, with special treatment -- like free breakfast or a room upgrade when I checked in. I feel like this is something that my generation is missing out on, and so I want to focus on ways to show this world to them.''
Last year, Mr. McGredy was named the Young Professional of the Year by the American Society of Travel Agents.
On His Radar Family adventure travel. ''We're seeing a lot more of the family trip to Costa Rica or Peru,'' he said. ''We're also finding with high airfares that people are seeing the value in spending a little more to take their vacation someplace exotic. Since going to Hawaii or Cancun can run you anywhere from $800 to $1,000 per person for airfare, many clients are opting to spend an extra $200 to $500 per person and go to Australia, Europe or even Africa.''
Travel Tip Buy travel insurance. ''I know it makes me sound like the guy at the electronics store trying to push the extended warranty, but I have so many examples where it has saved clients so much money,'' he said.
EMILY MEREDITH PRENTISS
Valerie Wilson Travel Inc. New York
Age 23.
Specialty Family travel and exotic destinations.
Planning Fee $150 a person, depending on the trip's complexity.
Back Story Under the wing of her mentor, Kimberly Wilson-Wetty, a co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel, a well-established luxury agency in New York, Ms. Prentiss plans custom vacations for well-heeled clients looking for V.I.P. attention. Through the company's deep-rooted connections with airlines, resorts and tour guides, she secures exclusive rates and special treatment for her clients whether it is an overwater bungalow in Bora Bora for less, a private dinner for two in an ancient temple in Cambodia or getting a family of five into a sold-out resort two weeks before Christmas.
''It is imperative to keep in touch and maintain good relationships with our representatives because they do so much to assist me and ultimately my clients,'' she said.
Last year she was named one of the top 35 travel agents under 30 by Travel Agent magazine.
On Her Radar Myanmar, as a newer destination that has opened its arms to travelers. ''It offers an element of mystery and romance whether visiting sacred sites, river cruising or walking through bustling markets,'' she said.
Travel Tip Plan ahead for greater flexibility and better rates. ''This advice seems very simple but believe it or not, sometimes even my clients think they can get a better deal by booking last minute,'' Ms. Prentiss said.
LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE DO THE WORK
How to Find an Agent
Word of mouth is often best. If that fails, a number of online matchmaking services connect vacationers with experts in the place they are going or in the kind of trip they want. At Tripology.com, travelers describe their interests through online forms and then receive e-mail alerts with up to three itinerary proposals from competing agents.
Additionally, agency groups such as Travel Leaders and Travel Savers offer online databases to help you find an agent. And AmexTravelResources.com allows users to search by destination and interest for American Express agents with corresponding expertise.
Travel magazines are another place to look. Travel + Leisure and Conde Nast Traveler each identify top travel agents annually in print and online.
What to Look For
In short: someone who has been where you want to go. Agents flash various credentials around -- C.T.C. (certified travel counselor), L.C.S. (luxury cruise specialist), C.L.S. (certified lifestyle specialist) -- but, as Tony Gonchar, chief executive of the American Society of Travel Agents, put it, ''The three-letter acronym has less influence over the reason why you'd go to one professional over another than their reputation and experience.''
It also doesn't hurt if the agent is a member of a major travel consortium, which often has access to special negotiated rates from partner hotels, airlines or cruises. (Virtuoso, for example, offers guaranteed amenities ranging from free cocktails upon arrival to spa services at more than 900 luxury hotels.)
Keep in mind that the relationship between agents and hotels, cruise lines and other travel suppliers is a two-way street. The suppliers benefit from agent referrals and often pass those benefits on to customers. But the agents can benefit, too, with kickbacks or discounts. Nevertheless, good agents won't risk a client's experience on one hotel or cruise line just because of some kickback. Feel free to ask whether and how your agent is benefiting from your itinerary.
Also, don't be shy about asking for references from past clients.
What Should You Pay?
Fees vary widely based on everything from the agent's experience to the complexity of the trip. But how much travelers pay should generally correspond to the services provided -- say, $100 or so to plan a basic weeklong vacation to $500 or more for a major multiweek group trip with detailed custom itineraries, not including the actual cost of the trip.
There are exceptions to this rule. Bill Fischer, the New York travel agent with a famously unlisted phone number, charges a $100,000 membership fee for his services and a $25,000 annual retainer. Jacyln Sienna India, 30, commands a $12,000 annual retainer for her personalized travel services, planning every detail of her clients' trips down to creating a custom soundtrack for their flight.

 BODY:
EISENHOWER IN WAR AND PEACE
By Jean Edward Smith
Illustrated. 950 pp. Random House. $40.
Dwight D. Eisenhower's memoirs came out while I was in graduate school in the 1960s, and one of my professors commented -- not entirely facetiously -- that he'd been surprised to see print on the pages. My fellow students and I were being taught that despite Eisenhower's victories in World War II, the presidency had been beyond his capabilities. Like Ulysses S. Grant, another general to make it to the White House, Ike won elections easily, but did not rise to the responsibilities these thrust upon him.
Jean Edward Smith challenged that argument about Grant in a well-received biography published a decade ago: Grant had been a better president than contemporaries or previous biographers realized, Smith maintained. In ''Eisenhower in War and Peace,'' Smith, who is now a senior scholar at Columbia after many years at the University of Toronto and Marshall University, makes a more startling claim. Apart from Franklin D. Roosevelt (whose biography Smith has also written), Ike was ''the most successful president of the 20th century.'' 
Historians long ago abandoned the view that Eisenhower's was a failed presidency. He did, after all, end the Korean War without getting into any others. He stabilized, and did not escalate, the Soviet-American rivalry. He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism. He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism. He maintained prosperity, balanced the budget, promoted technological innovation, facilitated (if reluctantly) the civil rights movement and warned, in the most memorable farewell address since Washington's, of a ''military-industrial complex'' that could endanger the nation's liberties. Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do.
But does Eisenhower merit a place in the pantheon just behind Franklin Roosevelt? Smith's case would be stronger if he had specified standards for presidential success. What allowances should one make for unexpected incumbencies, like those of the first Roosevelt, Coolidge, Truman, Johnson and Ford? Or for holding office in wartime? Or for ''black swan'' events -- economic crashes, natural disasters, protest movements, self-inflicted scandals, terrorist attacks? What's the proper balance between planning and improvisation, between being a hedgehog, in Isaiah Berlin's famous distinction, and being a fox?
Smith doesn't say. But he does carefully trace Eisenhower's preparation for the presidency, and that's what this biography is really about. (Only a quarter of the book is devoted to the White House years and beyond.) From it, Eisenhower's own views on success in leadership emerge reasonably clearly. To reduce them to the length of a tweet -- an exercise my students recommend, and which Ike might well have approved -- they amount to achieving one's ends without corrupting them.
Ends, Eisenhower knew, are potentially infinite. Means can never be. Therefore the task of leaders -- whether in the presidency or anywhere else -- is to reconcile that contradiction: to deploy means in such a way as to avoid doing too little, which risks defeat, but also too much, which risks exhaustion. Failure can come either way.
Exhaustion was the problem in World War I, in which the costs on all sides allowed no decisive outcome. As a young (and disappointed) Army captain, Eisenhower was kept stateside during the hostilities, training troops in the use of the recently invented tank. After peace returned, he and his fellow officers assumed there would be another war, but they had to plan for it under conditions wholly different from the profligacy with which the last one had been fought. With cuts in military spending that left ranks reduced, Eisenhower's generation took limited means as their default position.
Doing as much as possible with as little as possible required setting priorities, so Eisenhower made himself an expert, during the 1920s and 1930s, on the theory and practice of limited means. The theory came from the 19th-century Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz, whose difficult classic, ''On War,'' Eisenhower mastered, as almost no one else in the Army at the time did. The practice came from serving on staffs: of Fox Conner in Panama, who introduced him to Clausewitz; of John J. Pershing in Paris, who had him map World War I battle sites; of Douglas MacArthur in Washington and the Philippines, from whom Eisenhower learned the pitfalls of arrogance in command; and, in the final years of peace, of the indispensable George C. Marshall, who catapulted Eisenhower above hundreds of more senior officers to make him, after Pearl Harbor, the Army's chief planner.
Eisenhower's skills were not those required to command armies on battlefields: in this respect, he lacked the talents of his World War II contemporaries Bradley, Patton and Montgomery. But in his ability to weigh costs against benefits, to delegate authority, to communicate clearly, to cooperate with allies, to maintain morale and especially to see how all the parts of a picture related to the whole (it was not just for fun that he later took up painting), Eisenhower's preparation for leadership proved invaluable. Lincoln went through many generals before he found Grant, Smith reminds us. Roosevelt found in Eisenhower, with Marshall's help, the only general he needed to run the European war.
There were setbacks, to be sure: the North African and Italian campaigns, the Battle of the Bulge after the triumph of D-Day. But because Eisenhower showed himself to have learned from these crises, Roosevelt and Marshall never lost confidence in him. At the same time, Ike was perfecting the art of leading while leaving no trace -- the ''hidden hand'' for which he would be known while in the White House. The best wartime example, Smith suggests, was the way he gave his subtle support to Charles de Gaulle as the leader of the Free French, which left Roosevelt -- no fan of le grand Charles -- with a fait accompli. Eisenhower was getting to be good at politics as well as war.
Politics beckoned, after his victories, as it did with Grant before him, but the situations they inherited upon becoming president could hardly have been more different. Facing no credible external enemy, the United States in 1869 was as inward looking as it ever had been or would be. But by 1953, its interests were global and threats seemed to be too. Grant, in the aftermath of the Civil War, struggled to maintain any weapons more lethal than those required to fight American Indians. Eisenhower controlled weaponry that, if used without restraint, could have ended life on the planet.
Success in his mind, then, required not just avoiding the corruption of ends by means, but also their annihilation. How could the United States wage a war that might last for decades without turning itself into an authoritarian state, without exhausting itself in limited conflicts on terrain chosen by adversaries, without risking a new world war that could destroy all its participants? And how, throughout all of this, could the country retain a culture in which its traditional values -- even the bland and boring ones -- could flourish?
Eisenhower's greatest accomplishment may well have been to make his presidency look bland and boring: in this sense, he was very different from the flamboyant Roosevelt, and that's why historians at first underestimated him. Jean Edward Smith is among the many who no longer do. The greatest virtue of his biography is to show how well Eisenhower's military training prepared him for this task: like Grant, he made what he did seem easy. It never was, though, and Smith stresses the toll it took on Eisenhower's health, on his marriage and ultimately in the loneliness he could never escape. Perhaps Ike earned his place in the pantheon after all.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 06, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A review on April 22 about ''Eisenhower in War and Peace,'' by Jean Edward Smith, erroneously attributed a distinction to Ulysses S. Grant, who, like Eisenhower, won elections easily. It was Benjamin Harrison -- not Grant -- who was the last general before Dwight D. Eisenhower to become president. (Like Harrison, Rutherford B. Hayes, James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur all attained the rank of general and also reached the White House subsequent to Grant.)

HEADLINE: A Hard Look at the President

BYLINE: By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE

 BODY:
FOUR weeks ago, I criticized The New York Times for overplaying an article on an investment made by Ann Romney's blind trust. The article was but one installment of the intense campaign coverage scrutinizing Mitt Romney as he bids for the Republican presidential nomination.
During this period, we haven't heard as much from The Times about President Obama's re-election effort. 
There is precedent for the disparity. The Republican primary fight is a prelude to the general election season. Eight years ago, The Times offered comparably scant campaign coverage of the incumbent, George W. Bush, even as it blanketed readers with articles about Senator John Kerry and others competing for the Democratic nomination.
Now, though, the general election season is on, and The Times needs to offer an aggressive look at the president's record, policy promises and campaign operation to answer the question: Who is the real Barack Obama?
Many critics view The Times as constitutionally unable to address the election in an unbiased fashion. Like a lot of America, it basked a bit in the warm glow of Mr. Obama's election in 2008. The company published a book about the country's first African-American president, ''Obama: The Historic Journey.'' The Times also published a lengthy portrait of him in its Times Topics section on NYTimes.com, yet there's nothing of the kind about George W. Bush or his father.
According to a study by the media scholars Stephen J. Farnsworth and S. Robert Lichter, The Times's coverage of the president's first year in office was significantly more favorable than its first-year coverage of three predecessors who also brought a new party to power in the White House: George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.
Writing for the periodical Politics & Policy, the authors were so struck by the findings that they wondered, ''Did The Times, perhaps in response to the aggressive efforts by Murdoch's Wall Street Journal to seize market share, decide to tilt more to the left than it had in the past?''
I strongly doubt that. Based on conversations with Times reporters and editors who cover the campaign and Washington, I think they see themselves as aggressive journalists who don't play favorites. Still, a strong current of skepticism holds that the paper skews left. Unfortunately, this is exacerbated by collateral factors -- for example, political views that creep into nonpolitical coverage.
To illustrate, Faye Farrington, a reader from Hollis, N.H., wrote me earlier this year in exasperation over a Sunday magazine article about ''Downton Abbey,'' the public television series, in which the writer slipped in a veiled complaint about Mitt Romney's exploitation of the American tax code.
''The constant insertion of liberal politics into even the most politically irrelevant articles has already caused us to cancel our daily subscription,'' Ms. Farrington wrote, ''leaving only the Sunday delivery as I confess to an addiction to the Sunday crossword.''
The warm afterglow of Mr. Obama's election, the collateral effects of liberal-minded feature writers -- these can be overcome by hard-nosed, unbiased political reporting now.
Mr. Farnsworth, the media scholar, who is a professor at the University of Mary Washington, suggested to me that ''more vigilance'' is what The Times needed to keep out bias. He advocated a ''wider range of sources and greater openness to perspectives that may not be the way the reporter thought of the story at the outset.''
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, is a co-author of ''The Obama Victory: How Media, Money, and Message Shaped the 2008 Election.'' I asked her what she thought The Times should do to wring out bias in its 2012 coverage. Among other things, she said, ''Don't play a sex scandal out when you don't have any evidence,'' a reference to The Times's controversial 2008 article on John McCain's relationship with a lobbyist.
Going forward, she said, The Times should examine Mr. Obama's record and campaign promises; monitor campaign messaging for deception; emphasize substantive policy matters over petty rhetorical combat; scrutinize the newly powerful ''super-PAC'' groups, and take care not to let polls overdetermine the coverage.
These are the right priorities. To date, The Times has delivered some clear-eyed coverage of the administration's mixed record on the housing crisis, banks, the economy, Afghanistan and other issues. Now is the time to shift to a campaign coverage paradigm that compares promises with execution, sheds light on campaign operations and assesses the president's promises for a second term.
I asked Richard Stevenson, the political editor overseeing campaign coverage, about these matters, and he offered a detailed e-mail response, noting that ''we take very seriously our responsibility to report without favoritism.''
He added, ''We remind ourselves every day of the need to provide readers -- voters -- with as much news, information and context as possible about the candidates, their records, their characters, their positions and the influences on them, including their campaign donors.''
On covering Mr. Obama's record, he cited as an example a Feb. 27 article about the president's decision not to pursue recommendations of the Simpson-Bowles commission on debt reduction -- a move the article said had contributed to undercutting ''a central promise of his 2008 campaign, to rise above the rancor.''
Mr. Stevenson promised that the Obama campaign's use of his powers of incumbency, along with his ''political style, character and learning curve,'' will all be targets of Times coverage.
On the question of campaign finance, Mr. Stevenson cited several articles that The Times has already done: one on the Obama campaign's acceptance of money from a questionable source, another on the link between campaign contributions and White House access, and a third on Mr. Obama's decision to use super-PACs to support his campaign, reversing an early policy.
On the campaign operations side, he pointed to a March 8 article about the ''largely secret'' operation in Chicago where data specialists are cooking up ways to rebuild the vaunted support base of four years ago.
I applaud The Times's stated commitment to doing these kinds of stories. Readers deserve to know: Who is the real Barack Obama? And The Times needs to show that it can address the question in a hard-nosed, unbiased way.

HEADLINE: In the Uprooting of Kurds, Iraq Tests a Fragile National Unity

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting from Khanaqin, and employees of The New York Times from Diyala and Erbil Provinces.

 BODY:
KHANAQIN, Iraq -- In January, the dismembered body of Wisam Jumai, a Kurdish intelligence officer, was discovered in a field in Sadiyah, a small town in northeastern Iraq. Soon his family and friends, one after another, received text messages offering a choice: leave or be killed.
''Wisam has been killed,'' read one message sent to a cousin. ''Wait for your turn. If you want your life, leave Sadiyah.''
After Mr. Jumai's killing, nearly three dozen Kurdish families fled their homes and moved here, according to local officials, to the sanctuary of a city that is claimed by the government in Baghdad but patrolled by Kurdish forces. Other Kurds from the area have come here after being pushed out over property disputes that can be traced to Saddam Hussein's policy in the 1970s of expelling Kurds and resettling Arabs.
Whether by terrorism or judicial order, the continuing displacement of Iraq's Kurdish minority lays bare the unfinished business of reconciliation in the wake of the American military's withdrawal, and it is a symptom of the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the semiautonomous Kurdish government based in Erbil and the central government in Baghdad. 
The schism, which is most immediately over sharing oil wealth but is more deeply about historical grievances and Kurdish aspirations for independence, raises serious questions about the future of a unified Iraq. The crisis, American officials say, is far more grave than the political tensions between the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and the country's Sunni Arab minority set off by an arrest warrant on terrorism charges issued in December for Tariq al-Hashimi, the Sunni vice president.
The Kurds, unlike the Sunnis, have their own security forces, oil reserves, ports of entry and even their own de facto foreign policy, with envoys operating in other countries. This could eventually lead them to seek more independence from Baghdad.
''Fearing a resurgence of a strong central state, Kurdish leaders want to leave Iraq, and they appear to believe their moment to do so may soon arrive,'' wrote Joost Hiltermann, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, in a recent report.
In the latest chapter of a long-simmering dispute, Kurdish authorities have shut off their oil exports, claiming that Baghdad is behind on payments to oil companies working in the Kurdish region. Officials in Baghdad, angered by this and by Kurdistan's oil deal with Exxon Mobil that bypasses the central government, in turn threatened to cut off billions of dollars that flow to Kurdistan from the Iraqi budget. Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish regional government, has called Mr. Maliki a dictator and expressed fears that Baghdad might use American-supplied F-16 warplanes against the Kurds. Both sides have accused the other of smuggling oil and siphoning off profits.
''I cannot respect myself, working with the people in Baghdad,'' said Mohammed Ihsan, the Kurdish government's representative in Baghdad, who is calling for a referendum in Kurdistan on independence, something he acknowledged was unfeasible in the short term because of Western opposition. ''But a lot of people are thinking that way,'' he said.
American officials are concerned that Kurdish leaders are considering seeking a deal to sell oil to Turkey, in an effort to become economically self-sufficient. Such a pact would probably be illegal and unlikely before 2014, when Kurdistan is expected to complete its own oil pipeline.
''The Kurds hope, however, that Turkey's thirst for oil and gas will align with their own thirst for statehood,'' Mr. Hiltermann wrote in his report.
Kurds are captive to the painful memories of repression under Hussein; like the Sunni and Shiite Arabs, who fought a brutal sectarian war, the Kurds, too, cling to a narrow identity, theirs defined by ethnicity, rather than national citizenship.
''How can we forget?'' said Bakir Karim, a member of the Kurdish Parliament in Erbil who described Iraq as a ''fake state'' created by the British after World War I that, he said, has only ''harmed us and tortured us.''
He added, ''If you ask any Kurd if he wants independence from Iraq, without hesitation he will say yes.''
Khanaqin, a few miles from the Iranian border, lies at the end of a belt of rugged land in northern Diyala Province that runs from Sadiyah through Jalawla, another disputed town. It is also a place of ethnic rivalry, where Arabs and Kurds are trying the soft ways of democracy to settle feuds that nevertheless can still end in bloodshed.
Outside a Kurdish political office in Jalawla is a mural of three men, representing the area's main ethnicities: Arab, Kurd and Turkmen. ''We are all brothers,'' it declares.
Inside, Khader Mohammed, who directs the office, waved an intelligence report he recently received from authorities in Baquba, Diyala's capital. It claimed that the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group of militants, would ''attempt a number of attacks to destabilize the security situation in the province.'' Among the targets: Mr. Mohammed.
''I'm not afraid,'' he said. ''This is my duty. I have to do my work.''
Karim Ali, 60, is among those who may soon leave. Like many Kurds here, Mr. Ali was forced out in the mid-1970s as part of the Hussein government's ''Arabization'' policy, which aimed to dilute ethnic opposition. He resettled in Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province, but reclaimed his old home in 2003 as some Arabs, fearing revenge from the Kurds, decided to return to their original homes in other regions.
Though a court was set up to handle claims stemming from the Arabization policy, Kurds say that property records that would verify their ownership claims were destroyed. As a result, Arabs are now reclaiming homes that were seized from Kurdish families in the Hussein years.
This, Mr. Ali said, is what happened to him. ''This belonged to my father,'' he said, standing outside his home. ''In 20 days, I have to evacuate my house.'' He said he was taken to a police station in handcuffs several months ago and forced to sign papers turning the property over to an Arab who held the deed from 1975 to 2003.
''It's the same as during Saddam,'' Mr. Ali said. ''It's even worse now because I was young then, and now I'm old.''
Local officials say nearly 400 houses in Jalawla are being turned over in a similar fashion. Mr. Ihsan, the Kurdish representative in Baghdad, is also involved in matters related to these disputed areas. He said the process was rife with corruption: ''We have the most corrupted judicial system in the world.'' (A 2009 report on internal displacement in Iraq by the Brookings Institution and the University of Bern called the process one of ''incomprehension'' and ''frustration.'')
''It's getting worse,'' Mr. Ihsan said. ''The Americans left without finishing the job. We are worried that history is going to repeat itself.''
For their part, Arabs in the area say that they are also targets of terrorist attacks, and that the property transfers are the result of a fair and legal process.
On a recent afternoon, Rasmiya Ahmed, the mother of Mr. Jumai, the murdered officer, unzipped a blue nylon pouch and out tumbled the strips of pills that provide her with a measure of relief from her sleeplessness and anxiety. Another son, a soldier, was killed last year. ''I don't have anyone now,'' she said.
The Kurds may be free from the Baath Party's brutality, but for Ms. Ahmed things were better then, because, she said, ''at least I had my boys.''

HEADLINE: In Customer Service Consulting, Disney's Small World Is Growing

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Maryland teachers were instructed to engage children by crouching and speaking to them at eye level. Chevrolet dealers were taught to think in theater metaphors: onstage, where smiles greet potential buyers, and offstage, where sales representatives can take out-of-sight cigarette breaks.
A Florida children's hospital was advised to welcome patients in an entertaining way, prompting it to employ a ukulele-playing greeter dressed in safari gear.
These personal service tips came from the Disney Institute, the low-profile consulting division of the Walt Disney Company. Desperate for new ways to connect with consumers, an increasing array of industries and organizations are paying Disney to teach them how to become, well, more like Disney. 
Revenue from the Disney Institute has doubled over the last three years, according to Disney, powered in part by its aggressive pursuit of new business. Over the last two years alone, 300 school systems across the country have sought its advice.
Other clients range from very large entities -- Haagen-Dazs International, United Airlines, the country of South Africa -- to small ones: three Subway restaurants in Maine, a Michigan hair salon, a Boston youth-counseling center.
The Disney Institute recently hired a network of field representatives to sign up clients and started dispatching its executives to companies wanting help; before that, advice-seekers traveled to Walt Disney World here or Disneyland in California.
''We're putting our people on planes all day every day, domestically and internationally,'' said Jeff James, who runs Disney's consulting branch. ''Some clients are in great shape and want to improve even further, and some are truly clueless.''
Mr. James said the up-and-down economy had put pressure on companies to pay more attention to consumers' needs. He also cited the importance of the Web, which ''gives unhappy customers a megaphone.''
Disney, which employs 64,000 people in Orlando alone, has its own employee difficulties, of course. Union spats arise, and some cast members -- Disney-speak for employees -- chafe at the company's strict rules, although it recently lifted a facial-hair ban and now allows women to forgo pantyhose. Disney's sugary customer service can also startle visitors who aren't used to such uniform cheerfulness.
But vast numbers of consumers love it, and the company is routinely showcased in business books, like ''The Disney Way: Harnessing the Management Secrets of Disney in Your Company,'' for its hospitality and efficiency. For instance, the company has spent so much time studying its park customers -- more than 120 million of them globally last year -- that it places trash cans every 27 paces, the average distance a visitor carries a candy wrapper before discarding it.
That attention to detail is what compelled Frank Supovitz, the National Football League's senior vice president for events, to hire Disney to help with this year's Super Bowl, following a seating debacle at the 2011 game. Disney devised and executed a training program for the game's 20,000 staff members and helped coordinate crowd control.
''We wanted those 20,000 people to internalize a sense of pride in their part to play,'' Mr. Supovitz said, adding that he planned to hire Disney again next year.
Sometimes the Disney influence is more noticeable. Florida Hospital, a 22-campus chain, now employs that ukulele-playing greeter and exhibits what Tim Burrill, a vice president of the chain, called ''calming video art'' elsewhere. The hospital installed recessed lighting in hallways after Disney researchers found that patients on gurneys didn't like staring at fluorescent bulbs.
Disney has been marketing its services to hospitals in advance of a new government requirement that patient satisfaction surveys be reported online; starting in October, billions of dollars in Medicare reimbursements will be linked to the scores.
In 2009 Florida Hospital's children's unit had patient satisfaction scores in the bottom 10 percent of the country. It hired Disney and by the end of 2010 ranked in the top 10 percent. (Last year, the hospital opened a new $75 million expansion; Disney's philanthropic arm contributed $10 million and was given naming rights of the children's wing.)
Disney is competing against more well-known consulting operations like McKinsey & Company and the executive management programs of business schools like Harvard. But it stays low key in part because its ubiquity can bring sarcastic publicity.
''Meet the Nets' new coach -- Mickey Mouse,'' The New York Post wrote in January about Disney's advising the Nets on their future basketball arena, the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
A couple of years ago, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics came under fire for a plan to spend $130,000 on Disney advice while laying off staff members. The Iowa City Press-Citizen described state legislators as ''understandably appalled.''
Alan Batey, vice president for Chevrolet sales and service, said: ''Some dealers were very skeptical. We had to explain that this was about taking the best things about Disney and applying it to our own culture. We're not going to be building castles and dressing people up in costumes.''
About 3,000 Chevrolet dealership employees are going through Disney-led workshops that emphasize five principles: leadership, training, customer experience, brand loyalty and creativity. Sessions are custom tailored.
''We needed some help figuring out how we can really excite our customers by doing lots of little things really well,'' Mr. Batey said. So far, ideas include improving children's play areas and returning vehicles to owners with dealer-branded bottles of water in the cup holders.
When clients send their employees to Disney for training, as Chevrolet is doing, some time is spent in seminars on topics like ''purpose before task.'' They also get tours of the parks, where Disney managers demonstrate their tricks in action, like giving directions by pointing with two fingers instead of one (it's more polite). A behind-the-scenes stop at ''textile services'' (the laundry) might emphasize how managers are taught to show appreciation for lower-level workers by pitching in to complete menial tasks.
Disney got into the consulting business by accident after being featured in the 1984 best seller ''In Search of Excellence: Lessons from America's Best-Run Companies,'' by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman. So many corporations started asking for tips that the company created a program in 1986 called ''The Disney Approach to People Management'' and formalized the business a decade later with the Disney Institute's creation.
Mr. James would not say how much the institute earns, but it is a drop in the bucket for a conglomerate with annual sales of $41 billion. Fees range from $900 a person for a one-day workshop to hundreds of thousands of dollars for intensive on-site work.
''Companies come in and say, 'Just make my employees smile more,' '' Mr. James said. ''But you can't take Disney and just plug it in. We can advise them on how to change, but the heavy lifting is theirs.''

HEADLINE: Dutch Austerity Talks Fail As Geithner Prods Europe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and ANNIE LOWREY; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels, and Annie Lowrey from Washington.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- More uncertainty loomed for the euro zone on Saturday after the prime minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, said he expected new elections to take place following the collapse of talks on new austerity measures.
The announcement is unwelcome news for Europe's single currency zone, particularly because the Netherlands is one of just four countries using the euro currency that have maintained a coveted AAA credit rating.
Over the weekend, officials from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank met in Washington and sought ways to bolster contingency plans if the debt crisis in Europe worsened. The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, declined to pledge any new money to a rescue fund but urged European leaders to be aggressive. 
''The success of the next phase of the crisis response will hinge on Europe's willingness and ability, together with the European Central Bank, to apply its tools and processes creatively, flexibly and aggressively to support countries as they implement reforms and stay ahead of markets,'' he said Saturday.
The Dutch government has taken a tough line on bailouts for Greece and given strong support to Germany's efforts to force through a new pact on fiscal responsibility in the euro zone.
But the country's domestic politics have been plunged into crisis because targets for the budget deficit, laid down by the European Union, were missed.
On Saturday it became clear that a package of measures that had been under negotiation for several weeks, intended to save about 14 billion euros, or $18 billion, would not be supported by the Freedom Party, led by Geert Wilders, a populist right-wing and anti-Islam campaigner. The proposal included spending curbs and tax increases.
''Elections are to be expected now,'' said Mr. Rutte, who has held power since 2010 and who added that he would consult the Dutch parliament on how to proceed, Reuters reported.
Although he has never been a formal part of the coalition government, Mr. Wilders's support on major issues was crucial for Mr. Rutte to have a functioning parliamentary majority. Mr. Wilders has spoken out against bailing out other euro zone members.
''I had hoped we would work something out, but this package is unacceptable for our party and the country,'' Mr. Wilders told reporters, according to Reuters. ''It's time to go to the Dutch voters.''
In Washington, the Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, said that Europe had made significant progress toward quieting its sovereign-debt crisis through closer fiscal coordination and austerity budgeting.
But he also sought to turn attention from Europe, arguing that big debts in countries including Japan and the United States remained threats to international financial stability, even if they were out of the ''limelight.''
''Not all risks emanate from Europe,'' Mr. de Jager told the International Monetary and Financial Committee of the I.M.F. on Saturday. ''There are key medium-term risks elsewhere in the world, which must also urgently be addressed.''
Nevertheless, international attention has focused on the Continent this weekend in Washington. Countries in the euro zone and international partners -- mostly wealthy economies, including Japan, Norway, Britain and Switzerland -- pledged more than $430 billion to the monetary fund to help guard against any runs on sovereign debt within the euro zone and to protect countries that might be innocent bystanders to the crisis, the fund announced on Friday.
But that money comes with the understanding that Europe will be vigilant in fighting off speculative attacks, bringing down unwieldy budgets and spurring growth -- even as political changes come, like those looming in the Netherlands and France.
Some countries declined to provide additional I.M.F. financing, arguing that the fund had enough spare capacity and that Europe needed to be more aggressive in solving its problems.

HEADLINE: Would You Vote for This Face?

BYLINE: By LEONARD MLODINOW. 
Leonard Mlodinow teaches at the California Institute of Technology and is the author of the forthcoming book ''Subliminal: How Your Unconscious Mind Rules Your Behavior.''

 BODY:
HOW important is a political candidate's appearance?
We're all worldly enough to understand that looks matter. You probably know about the famous 1960 presidential debate between an unshaven and tired Richard Nixon and a tanned and rested John F. Kennedy: those who watched on television generally thought Kennedy won the debate, while those who listened over the radio overwhelmingly favored Nixon. Still, even the most jaded politico assumes that appearance is a relatively small factor -- and one that we are basically aware of. Everyone knew that part of Kennedy's appeal was how he looked.
But recent research suggests that we may need to adopt a more cynical attitude. It turns out that a candidate's appearance -- not beauty, but a look of competence -- can generate a far greater vote swing than we previously thought. Furthermore, this effect is not only powerful but also subliminal. Few of us believe that appearance determines our vote, yet for a significant number of us, it may. 
In one study, led by the political scientist Shawn W. Rosenberg of the University of California, Irvine, 140 volunteers were told that they were participating in a study of voting in which they would scrutinize candidates for Congress in three nearby districts. For each of the three races, the volunteers were shown two fliers presenting information about the candidates, including their party affiliations and their stances on several issues. Each flier also included a photo of the candidate.
In reality, the fliers had been concocted for the experiment. The photos were not of actual candidates but of models (all white males dressed in coat and tie) whose visages, in a prior survey with different volunteers, had been given either high or low marks with regard to perceived qualities like integrity, competence and leadership ability.
For each of the three races, the researchers arranged for half the subjects to see a flier in which the candidate with the more favorable appearance was pictured as the liberal Democrat, while the other half saw him pictured as the conservative Republican. That way, if looks didn't matter, the two candidates should receive about an equal number of votes (regardless of the split in party preference among the participants). Instead, the voting split about 60-40, with a majority favoring the candidate with the better visage.
A related series of studies, also led by Professor Rosenberg, showed that candidates could exert some control over the appearance factor. Researchers first recruited 210 volunteers to rate head-and-shoulder shots of hundreds of women in terms of how ''able looking'' they were. From these ratings they determined that certain factors contributed to this appearance: for example, eyes with more curvature on the top than the bottom; hair that is short and parted on the side or combed back; a hairline that comes to a slight widow's peak; a broad or round face; and a smile. Then they employed a Hollywood-style makeup artist and a photographer to use these criteria to create two images of each candidate, one more able looking and one less. (A second study confirmed that the manipulations had the desired effect.)
Finally, the researchers recruited another set of volunteers to do the voting. Each candidate was presented in her ''attractive'' form to half the subjects, while her opponent was presented in her ''unattractive'' form. The other half of the subjects saw the same women running under the same party banners, but with the appearance variable reversed. On average, the candidates received 56 percent of the vote when portrayed by the better campaign photo, compared with 44 percent when portrayed by the unfavorable photograph -- a vote swing of 12 percentage points.
In another series of studies, conducted at Princeton by the psychologists Alexander Todorov and Charles C. Ballew II, participants were presented with pairs of head-shot photos of the competing candidates in hundreds of actual Congressional and gubernatorial elections in the United States. After displaying a photo pair for just a quarter of a second, the researchers asked the participants to judge which candidate was more competent. (If a participant recognized a candidate, his response for that race was not counted.) These fleeting and uninformed impressions of competence turned out to correlate strongly with the actual election results. Over the hundreds of races tested, the more competent-looking candidate won the real-world election about 70 percent of the time.
The idea that appearance might be so influential is remarkable in light of the billions of dollars spent each election year to advertise candidates' records, views and personal qualities. After all the talk about the economy, health care and other contentious issues, the issue that may swing an election may be which candidate best looks the part.

HEADLINE: The Fight Over Inequality

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: What's the best way to figure out the size of the income gap between the top and the bottom? The debate is fierce, complicated and crucial. 

 BODY:
The headline promised an article of critical importance: "Obama's inequality argument just utterly collapsed."
James Pethokoukis, a conservative columnist and blogger at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote on April 11 that a new academic study put the lie to Democratic claims of endemic inequality and grotesquely distorted income gains by the top 1 percent. The "tax and regulatory policies of the past three decades," he wrote,
did not lead to stagnation for the middle class at the hands of the rapacious rich. Claims to the contrary - such as those made by Obama, the Occupy movement, and many liberal economists - never really passed the sniff test of anyone who lived through the past few decades. And now we know why: The inequality and stagnation alarmists were wrong. And so, therefore, is the economic rationale of the president's class-warfare economic policies.
Pethokoukis's claim is based on the findings of three scholars: Richard V. Burkhauser, an economist at Cornell; Jeff Larrimore, an economist on the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation; and Kosali I. Simon, a professor at theIndiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.
Pethokoukis is a hard-core adversary of the current administration. His recently filed contributions include: "Obama's government by gimmick: His 7 most meaningless policy gestures," "More unintended consequences of Obamacare," "Just how high does Obama think taxes should go? 70%? 80%? 90%?," "The total intellectual collapse of Obama's Buffett Rule" and "Why pretty much everything Obama is saying about income stagnation and inequality is wrong."
The paper by Burkhauser, Larrimore and Simon on which Pethokoukis builds his argument, "A 'Second Opinion' on the Economic Health of the American Middle Class," appeared in the March 2012 issue of the National Tax Journal. The paper does, in fact, provide valuable insights into the sometimes daunting arguments over inequality, income stagnation and economic stratification.
The continuing debate over social mobility and income distribution does not lend itself to facile conclusions. Some of the findings of Burkhauser et al are advantageous to the political right; others undermine the conservative agenda. I will explore both below, but first we must turn to the crucial dispute over the definition of income.
Key players in the inequality controversy include economists Emmanuel Saez of Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the School of Economics in Paris; Burkhauser and his co-authors; and the Congressional Budget Office.
Saez and Piketty measure "market income" - that is, total income before tax minus income from government sources, like unemployment. "Think about our measure as gross income reported on tax returns (measured consistently since 1913) and before any deductions," Saez explained in an e-mail.
Because the findings of Saez and Piketty are based on millions of United States tax returns filed over nearly a century, they are widely viewed as providing the best insight available into the share of income going to the very top of the distribution - not just the top one percent, but the top 0.5 percent, the top 0.1 percent and even the top 0.01 percent.
From 1970 to 2010, Saez and Piketty show, the share of total market income going to the top one percent more than doubled, from 9.03 to 19.77 percent. The share going to the top 0.1 percent more than tripled, from 2.78 percent to 9.52 percent; and for the top 0.01 percent, it nearly quintupled from 1.00 percent of the total to 4.63 percent.
In addition, by focusing on income as reported on tax returns, Saez and Piketty show how market mechanisms distribute wages and other taxable benefits - capital gains, dividends - as opposed to government transfers, entitlement benefits and sources of income like untaxed employer paid health insurance.
Because Saez and Piketty do not take into account welfare payments, food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and employer-provided health insurance (which are not reported to the I.R.S. as income), they arguably overstate inequality trends. A second caveat to bear in mind is that the Saez-Piketty findings are based on pre-tax income, which is more unequally distributed than after-tax income.
In addressing the issue of inequality, Saez and Piketty found that from 1970 to 2010, average pre-tax income per taxpayer in the bottom 90 percent of the distribution fell from $31,839 to $28,840 in inflation-adjusted dollars. For those in the top 0.01 percent, market income rose from $2.14 million a year in 1970 to $16.27 million in 2010. The gains at the top from 1970 to 2010 stand in contrast to the post-war period from 1945 to 1970 when the share of income going to those at the top fell. During those earlier 25 years, the share going to the top 1 percent dropped from 12.52 to 9.03 percent; the share going to the top 0.1 percent dropped from 4.16 to 2.78 percent, and the share going to the top 0.01 percent dropped from 1.26 to 1.00 percent.
"Emanuel and Thomas can do the top 1 percent better than anyone," Timothy Smeeding, a professor at the University of Wisconsin's La Follette School of Public Affairs, wrote in an e-mail to The Times. Similarly, Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, wrote: "Only the I.R.S. data have large enough samples to focus on the very rich." The other major source of income data, the Current Population Survey (conducted by the Census Bureau), "is too small to examine the top 1 percent," Danziger wrote.
Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, notes the vulnerability in the Saez and Piketty data:
"The two economists are trying to compare trends in inequality over a very long time span and in a number of different countries, and they've done a good job of that. Unfortunately, the only income measure available over a long time span seems to be taxable income assessed for purposes of collecting the income tax. This means the Piketty-Saez measure falls short of total income received by U.S. households," Burtless wrote. "A lot of that income - an increasing share of it, in fact - is not ascertained in the I.R.S. statistics that Piketty-Saez use to measure income. For example, virtually all health benefits are excluded. So are untaxed government transfer benefits."
Piketty defended the Saez-Piketty approach in an e-mail to The Times. "We have always been very clear about the fact that we study changes in the distribution of market income. Our point is that top incomes have taken a disproportionate share of market income growth over the past 30 years, and as a consequence that the market incomes of the lower and middle class have stagnated."
Saez, in turn, said he hopes to be able to produce data on "post-tax, post-transfer, per adult, adding non-taxable income sources, etc.," but pointed out that gathering this kind of data to the level of detail and accuracy that would allow careful exploration of the top one percent and other income groups would involve "a huge enterprise."
In October, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, issued a 47-page report, "Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007."
The C.B.O. used information from tax returns and from the Current Population Survey to determine "real (inflation-adjusted) average income, measured after government transfers and federal taxes." Gains from 1979 to 2007 were heavily concentrated among those in the top one percent, with smaller gains moving down the income ladder. In contrast to Saez and Piketty, the C.B.O. report shows modest gains for every income group below the top 1 percent:
At the moment, there is considerable agreement that the C.B.O. analysis of overall income shares is the gold standard. "For the whole distribution," Smeeding, of the University of Wisconsin, wrote, "C.B.O. is best."
The C.B.O. data does deal with the effect of government transfers. But the report makes the point that government income transfer programs have changed significantly from 1979 to 2007, with less going to the poor, and more to those in the middle:
"The equalizing effect of transfers and taxes on household income was smaller in 2007 than it had been in 1979," according to the C.B.O. "In 1979, households in the bottom quintile received more than 50 percent of transfer payments. In 2007, similar households received about 35 percent of transfers. That shift reflects the growth in spending for programs focused on the elderly population (such as Social Security and Medicare), in which benefits are not limited to low-income households. As a result, government transfers reduced the dispersion of household income by less in 2007 than in 1979."
Which brings us back to Burkhauser. In their National Tax Journal article, Burkhauser and his co-authors add the cost of health insurance - whether it is government-paid through Medicare or Medicaid or employer-provided. They define their measure of income as: "post-tax, post-transfer, size-adjusted household income including the ex-ante value of in-kind health insurance benefits." Many conservatives prefer this approach because it measures after-tax household income, which magnifies the share of income going to those in the middle and bottom of the income distribution and consequently makes the economic system look more equitable.
Using their measure of household income, Burkhauser and his co-authors find that median income has grown from 1979 to 2007 by a relatively healthy 36.7 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.
The Burkhauser approach shows the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution with median income growth of 26.4 percent, while the top five percent experienced a 63 percent increase.
The Burkhauser study attempts to estimate the value of health care coverage from Medicare, Medicaid and employer provided insurance. Danziger, of the University of Michigan, notes that "Burkhauser is correct that the I.R.S. data overstate inequality because much income received by low income families is not included in Adjusted Gross Income (for example, cash welfare, food stamps). And Burkhauser is also correct that economists prefer to adjust family income to account for differences in family size. If one does that, one also gets less income inequality."
Are the lower estimates of inequality trends found by Burkhauser cause for cheering on the right?
The driving force behind lessened inequality that Burkhauser posits stems from government intervention, combined with pressure on the private sector to provide health care benefits - the very things the right objects to.
Food stamps, Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, the tax exemption for employer-provided health insurance - all of these are major factors in lessening inequality. At least two of these - Medicaid and food stamps - would be cut sharply under the budget plan approved by House Republicans in March, which Mitt Romney has endorsed.
The second major criticism of the Burkhauser approach involves the inclusion of the cost of health coverage. Health care costs have been rising at a much faster pace than inflation, which makes income appear to rise quickly.
"So," Saez argues in his e-mail to The Times, "the argument (of the right) has to be: cash market income of the bottom 99 percent of adults has stagnated but the bottom 99 percent get much more expensive private and government provided health care benefits, some more government transfers, and they have fewer kids. This does not seem like a great situation, especially from a conservative point of view."
Timothy Noah, a senior editor at The New Republic and the author of "The Great Divergence: America's Growing Inequality Crisis and What We Can Do About It," replied in response to an inquiry from The Times:
No matter whose data you use, you find a.) median income growth since 1979 is paltry compared to the 50s and 60s; b.) most of the growth occurred under Clinton during the late-1990s tech bubble; c.) median income growth, which kept up with income growth for the rich during the 50s and 60s (sometimes even exceeding it, thereby making incomes more equal) has most emphatically not kept up with income growth for the rich since 1979.
Conservatives might do well to reconsider their hostility to the Saez-Piketty analysis. The two economists, by their own admission, are not describing all income, but they are much closer to the ideal of the political right: an America with little or no welfare state and the lowest possible tax burden, especially taxes on income from capital.
Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and principal architect of current Republican fiscal policy, is determined to reverse the nation's slide into what he sees as socialism. "We're reaching a tipping point in this country, after which the majority of Americans are more dependent on the government than they are upon themselves," Ryan told Newsmax last year. His view of the American welfare state, especially programs geared to the poor, is equally clear: "We don't want to turn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency, and have that dependency culture. That's not the American way, that's not the American dream."
Ryan's "hammock," as it is currently constructed, leaves recipients of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (better known as welfare) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (better known as food stamps), well below the poverty line, which in 2011 was $18,123 for a family of three, a level unlikely to lull many "able bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency."

HEADLINE: A Case From the Cold War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I write to protest that in Benn Steil's April 9 Op-Ed article, ''Banker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,'' old allegations of espionage against my father, Harry Dexter White, are once again repeated as fact. 
In support of his statement that White was guilty of spying for the Soviet Union in the 1940s, Mr. Steil cites a handwritten memo that my father allegedly gave to Whittaker Chambers, a self-confessed Soviet spy. Mr. Steil then declares that White's guilt was firmly established by Soviet intelligence cables published in the late 1990s.
The content and provenance of all these documents have been studied in depth by serious scholars and have been found to raise as many questions as they answer. However they are interpreted, it can by no means be said that they establish my father's guilt.
It should also be remembered that White himself vigorously and eloquently denied the accusations against him.
Readers interested in a serious analysis of my father's role in Soviet-American relations might wish to see ''The Case Against Harry Dexter White: Still Not Proven,'' a paper by James M. Boughton, historian of the International Monetary Fund, published in the summer 2001 issue of History of Political Economy.

HEADLINE: Supercomputing For Small Players

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The supercomputer game has traditionally been the playground of giants -- government agencies and a handful of major corporations.
But cloud computing is leveling even this elite realm of technology, a development underlined by an announcement at a conference on Thursday. A 20-person company, Cycle Computing, a leader in supercomputer software, recently lashed together a massive supercomputing cluster, with 50,000 processors, on Amazon Web Services to do drug compound simulations. Its software was essentially the operating system, tapping resources from several Amazon data centers. 
The simulation applications for drug discovery created by two other small companies, Schrodinger and Nimbus Discovery, ran on top of Cycle's cluster-managing software. That software bundle performed a daunting simulation of 21 million chemical compounds to see if they would bind with a protein target. That run ate up the equivalent of 12.5 processor years, but it was completed in less than three hours. The computing cost was less than $4,900 a hour.
''This enables small companies and any researcher that has a grant to do science that they could never do before,'' Jason Stowe, chief executive of Cycle Computing, said in an interview.
The economics are striking, but so is the new approach to scientific discovery and exploration. In the past, even major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with internal computing clusters, would typically develop models that virtually tested some portion of the possible chemical combinations and protein targets -- not the 21 million, as in the Cycle-Schrodinger-Nimbus collaboration. ''The technology allows researchers to leave no sample unconsidered,'' Mr. Stowe said.
The project announcement was made at the Amazon Web Services conference in New York. It is further evidence of the remote computing -- or cloud -- advance into a field known for its centralized supercomputer centers. Last fall, an Amazon Web Services cluster ranked 42 in the annual top 500 supercomputers in the world.
Supercomputing, according to Mr. Stowe, is undergoing a rapid evolution that echoes the transformation in data analysis, made possible by the accelerating surge in digital data and new computing tools. Government science officials emphasized that trend at a Washington conference last month, in which several federal agencies announced research initiatives.
Data analysis has been opened up to finding new patterns and insights in the so-called Big Data. Supercomputing focuses on simulations, but the two are related and that, Mr. Stowe says, represents a next stage in the march of Big Data.
Data analysis, Mr. Stowe said, looks for correlations and patterns in the data. Noticing a surge in a subject or sentiment in Twitter messages, for example.
The next step, Mr. Stowe said, is going to be ''how to get a Twitter avalanche going, how to make people have this sentiment about my brand. That's a simulation problem.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Gritty Musical Mainstay In the East Village Fades

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
For 16 years, the Lakeside Lounge employed a formula that never changed: a handpicked band every night, a jukebox loaded with classic songs, a cadre of quick-witted bartenders working under strings of colored lights, and an old-time photo booth that spat out strips of pictures shot using real film.
While the bar, on Avenue B in the East Village, held true to the rock 'n' roll vision of its co-founders, Eric Ambel, a guitarist and record producer, and James Marshall, a disc jockey, the neighborhood gradually acquired a new personality. Upscale restaurants replaced drug dens, seedy gave way to hip, and hangouts for musicians and artists vanished. With rent and expenses rising relentlessly, the party at the Lakeside Lounge will end on April 30. 
''The economics of the new East Village caught up with us,'' said Mr. Ambel, 54.
Many music fans are mourning the passing not just of a nightspot, but of an era. ''We learned how to be a band here, and so many others did, too; where are we all going to go now?'' Mo Goldner, 43, asked as he leaned against the bar for a farewell toast. Mr. Goldner's band, Spanking Charlene, has for years played a monthly gig on Lakeside's small side-room stage.
The Lakeside Lounge opened in April 1996, taking the space previously occupied by a rehearsal studio and a Jamaican restaurant. The bar's name was an allusion to the summer trips to Wisconsin that Mr. Ambel made with his family while growing up.
Mr. Marshall, 52, who had worked for WFMU-FM in Jersey City, helped fashion the ambience by installing the photo booth. He filled the jukebox with a collection of music far enough from the mainstream to function as what he called ''a self-cleaning oven.''
''If someone wasn't cool enough to spend a quarter hearing Howlin' Wolf, we didn't want them in there anyway,'' he said.
In 2009, Van Morrison was interviewed by The New Yorker at the Lakeside Lounge because, he said, of the jukebox. This month, Elvis Costello dropped by for a listen. In December, the Alabama Shakes, an up-and-coming band, played a secret gig between sold-out New York shows.
''This is the machine I heard stories about,'' said the band's singer, Brittany Howard, as she flipped reverently through each selection on the jukebox, which glowed like a beacon in the dark space.
Mr. Ambel, who had toured with Joan Jett and Steve Earle, strove to make Lakeside a pleasure for its performers. Unlike New York rock clubs that cram in several acts a night, Lakeside made its one nightly band the star attraction. Musicians played on quality house gear, including warm-sounding tube amps and solid drums. Mr. Ambel personally booked each act and fostered a scrappy community of garage rockers, soul belters, country weepers and urban bluesmen. (This reporter played there with various bands over the years.)
''Making sure the bands had a good experience and were treated really well has always been real important to me, because I'm a musician,'' Mr. Ambel said.
In its earliest days, when Avenue B still bristled with danger, the Lakeside was a musical beachhead. Once, while Joey and Dee Dee Ramone played, audience members watched the police raid a nearby crack house and line suspects up against the picture window beside the stage.
Alex Feldesman, 39, a bartender at Lakeside for 13 years, said: ''If you like the bar, the bar likes you.'' Another bartender, J. D. Hughes, 47, described working there as ''like bartending in your dad's basement.'' Erick Hartz, 50, likened it to a clubhouse.
Leslie Day, who has worked at Lakeside since it opened, said she loved its characters but noted, ''There aren't as many as there used to be.''
And there are fewer places for the characters to go. The Life Cafe, which was next door, closed last year, as did the nearby music nook Banjo Jim's. So, too, did the Mars Bar, an artists' hangout on Second Avenue. Mr. Ambel said rent and expenses had more than quadrupled since the mid-1990s, forcing him and Mr. Marshall to face the prospect of deviating from the formula that had served Lakeside, its musicians and its patrons so well.
''I can't raise drink prices too much, I don't care to have a D.J. in there, I don't want to have five bands a night -- that's not what we're about,'' said Mr. Ambel, who will play with his own band at the closing party.

HEADLINE: Start-Up Aims to Stream Pay TV Onto Web Devices

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
In a move that could hasten the slow pace of so-called TV Everywhere, a technology start-up is introducing a way to move a whole subscription's worth of TV onto the Web, with or without the subscription company's permission.
The start-up, called NimbleTV, will begin testing its service with a limited number of users on Monday. The service takes the package of television channels that a customer buys through a distributor like Dish Network, then streams the package onto the Web, allowing the customer more options for viewing than most distributors now allow. It also allows for thousands of hours of TV recording via a virtual digital video recorder. 
NimbleTV is the latest example of technology companies trying to break into the closed system of television distribution in the United States. As Americans buy more smartphones and tablet computers, cable and satellite distributors are under pressure to provide TV access on more screens, and entrepreneurs are -- depending on one's view -- either helping to provide it, or forcing it to happen on their own terms.
Large companies like Apple and Google have taken steps to enter the television distribution business.. So have start-ups like NimbleTV, which is backed by the venture capital firms Greycroft Partners and Tribeca Venture Partners and by the Tribune Company, the owner of 23 TV stations.
''We've all heard about TV Everywhere for a long time. One of the questions that's bothered me is, why is it not here yet?'' said Anand Subramanian, the chief executive of NimbleTV, during a preview of the service at Greycroft's Midtown Manhattan office last week.
TV Everywhere is a slogan for a nearly three-year-old effort by TV distributors and channel owners to make channels available to subscribers on all screens at all times. Despite some notable successes, the effort has been stymied by outdated contracts and by concerns that new ways of TV viewing will generate less revenue than the old ways.
As a result, many technologically adept television viewers have voiced some variation of the same complaint: why can I not watch any show on any device at any time? That availability is what NimbleTV is pushing.
''It picks up where Slingbox left off,'' said Jason Hirschhorn, a former executive at the maker of the Slingbox, Sling Media, who is now an adviser to Greycroft and a supporter of NimbleTV.
When the Slingbox device is hooked up to a TV set, users can log in on a computer from anywhere and view whatever is live on their DVR at home -- a useful feature for watching a home team's baseball games while on the road, for instance.
Sling Media is owned by EchoStar, which is controlled by Charles W. Ergen, the satellite media mogul who also controls the Dish Network. Dish promotes the Slingbox to its subscribers as its form of TV Everywhere. But the device has not been embraced by other distributors.
NimbleTV says it has the same functionality as a Slingbox and DVR, but without the actual boxes. Mr. Subramanian, a Giants fan, recounted watching the Super Bowl through the service while on a work trip in India.
Within the cable world, the closest thing to NimbleTV is an app from Cablevision that replicates its subscribers' live television lineups on tablets, phones and computers. The app works only within the subscriber's home, however. Time Warner Cable has a similar app that replicates part of the lineup.
NimbleTV also raises the tantalizing prospect that users could shop around for television subscriptions -- removing the physical constraints that now give companies like Comcast and Cox exclusive cable licenses in cities.
But that will not happen for a while, if at all. The company's test phase, which begins Monday, is limited to New York City and to a set of 26 channels that the company will pay for. It plans to start letting people sign up for satellite service through its software this summer.
The service is positioned by Mr. Subramanian and his supporters as a way to enhance existing cable or satellite packages and to help distributors sell more such packages. ''Our intention is to support as many providers as possible,'' he said. But he declined to name any providers that are already on board, and he asserted that NimbleTV did not need their blessing.
In that way, NimbleTV is like Aereo, the start-up backed by Barry Diller's company IAC that repackages broadcast channels like NBC and Fox into a streaming service for $12 a month. As Aereo started letting customers in New York City sign up last month, virtually all of the city's broadcasters filed lawsuits against the company, citing copyright infringements. The suits are pending and Aereo is online for now.
Mr. Subramanian said that NimbleTV ''went to extreme lengths'' to comply with the law -- changing strategies five or six times along the way. Noting that users would still be paying for cable or satellite service, he said NimbleTV's role was as an ''agent,'' paying the monthly service bill for the user and providing software for streaming.
NimbleTV itself will include a monthly fee, probably around $20, though the company would not comment.
Mr. Hirschhorn said planning for the service ''took into account a lot of industry issues,'' and he added that it ''doesn't economically harm anyone.''
Mr. Subramanian said he did not expect for the company to be sued, but some of the company's investors said privately that they expected suits.
Dan Rayburn, the principal analyst for digital media at the market research firm Frost & Sullivan, said that even if these streaming companies believed they were on solid legal ground, the entrenched distributors were ''still going to come after them.''
''Guys like Aereo and Nimble can't afford the legal fight,'' he added.
Tribune declined to comment on the size of its investment or the reasons for it.
For the venture capitalists involved, a sale of NimbleTV's software to a distributor or to a technology company would seem like an obvious goal. Mr. Subramanian said he could not speculate on that and added, ''I'm just trying to build a really good consumer experience and solve a consumer problem.''

HEADLINE: Iranians Say They Took Secret Data From Drone

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and SCOTT SHANE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Iran claimed on Sunday to have extracted secret intelligence information from an advanced American drone aircraft that crashed in the country in December, seeking a propaganda victory over what has been an embarrassing intelligence failure for the Central Intelligence Agency.
The air force commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Brig. Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, suggested in remarks to the country's semiofficial news agency that Iran had or would soon reverse-engineer the aircraft, known as the RQ-170 Sentinel, though American intelligence officials and experts have discounted the country's ability to do so. 
General Hajizadeh cited as evidence data that he said was extracted from the drone's computer hard drives revealing its operations in the months before it went down in Iran -- either because it was shot down, as Iranian officials have claimed, or because it experienced a technical failure, as the Americans have said.
The drone, he said, had undergone repairs in California in October 2010 and returned to Afghanistan in November 2010, where American officials have acknowledged it operated, though without specifying where its missions took it. He added that the drone's computer memory revealed that it had flown over the compound in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden was killed in an American raid in May 2011.
''Had we not accessed the plane's softwares and hard disks, we wouldn't have been able to achieve these facts,'' General Hajizadeh said, according to the news agency Fars.
The White House and American intelligence officials declined Sunday to comment on the new claims, though independent experts expressed skepticism. They noted that the information about the drone's activities -- including its use in the Bin Laden raid -- could have been drawn from public reports about the sophisticated aircraft. It was not clear what record of previous flights would have remained on the drone's systems.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut and a member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee, also suggested that Iran's claims were probably overblown, though he said the drone's loss was embarrassing.
''I think there is a history here of Iranian bluster, particularly now when they are on the defensive because of our economic sanctions against them,'' he said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' referring to the increasingly punitive restrictions on Iran's oil industry and central bank imposed by the United States and Europe because of the country's nuclear program. ''But, look, it was not good for the U.S. when the drone went down in Iran, and not good when the Iranians grabbed it.''
Mr. Lieberman called the drone ''a very sophisticated piece of machinery'' that he assumed had operated in Iran, ''particularly at areas where we have reason to believe that they are working on a nuclear weapon.''
American officials have said that the drone's onboard computers were programmed to destroy important information if it stopped responding to radio signals from its base. They said, however, that such security systems do not always function properly and that intelligence and military officials of other countries, including China and Russia, would undoubtedly try to persuade Iran to share any data or allow their experts to study it.
Dennis M. Gormley, an expert on drones and cruise missiles at the University of Pittsburgh, said Sunday that Iran's claims strained credibility. ''It's hard for me to imagine no self-destruct or erase mechanism was embedded in the drone to destroy sensitive systems, including software.''
He added: ''As someone who does monitor Iranian aerospace and missile claims closely, let me simply observe that they are preternaturally disposed to exaggeration.''

HEADLINE: Climate Change to Affect Corn Prices, Study Says

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Researchers have found that climate change is likely to have far greater influence on the volatility of corn prices over the next three decades than factors that recently have been blamed for price swings -- like oil prices, trade policies and government biofuel mandates. 
The new study, published on Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change, suggests that unless farmers develop more heat-tolerant corn varieties or gradually move corn production from the United States into Canada, frequent heat waves will cause sharp price spikes.
Noah S. Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford and an author of the study, said he was surprised by the notable effect of climate change on price volatility for corn, the country's largest crop. ''I really thought climate would be a minor player before we did this analysis,'' Professor Diffenbaugh said. ''We're looking at a period over the next three decades or so of moderate global warming, after all.''
Instead, the analysis found that a moderate warming trend was likely to increase the number of days of severe heat in the growing season, thus doubling the volatility of corn yields.
Using economic, climatic and agricultural data, the study found that if climate change stayed within the internationally accepted range of two degrees Celsius over the next 20 years or so, temperature changes would make those heat waves more common.
The researchers then sought to determine how the heat waves would in turn interact with other factors that affect corn prices.
''Energy policy increasingly is important for agriculture,'' said Thomas W. Hertel, another author of the study and a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue. Referring to the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Agriculture, he added: ''Ten or 20 years ago, what the E.P.A. and the U.S.D.A. did influenced corn prices. Today, what the Energy Department does also is important.''
The growing use of biofuels, particularly those derived from corn, has already distorted agricultural markets by encouraging farmers to plant corn instead of other crops, thus increasing the price of things like soybeans, which are being produced in lesser quantities.
The study found that federal mandates for biofuel production could amplify the effect of climate change on corn price volatility by hampering the market's ability to adjust to changes in crop yields.
''If we let the market determine how corn gets allocated,'' Dr. Hertel said, ''in a year with less severe heat and higher corn yields, more corn can be sold into the energy market for ethanol, while in years of high heat and lower yields, more would end up in the food market.''
The mandates, however, require a certain amount of ethanol for biofuel regardless of yields, he added, ''and that will greatly exacerbate the price spikes brought on by climate change.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Way to Stop Fake Drugs

BYLINE: By ROGER BATE. 
Roger Bate, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Phake: The Deadly World of Falsified and Substandard Medicines.''

 BODY:
Washington
IN 2007-8, when counterfeit versions of heparin, a blood-thinning drug, were shipped from China to the United States market, 149 people died. In the last few months, bogus versions of the cancer drug Avastin, apparently shipped from the Middle East, have surfaced in clinics in California, Illinois and Texas. Thankfully, so far as we know, they haven't killed anyone, but more and more cases of dangerous fake drugs are being reported by the Food and Drug Administration. Numerous incidents surely go unreported, the evidence swallowed, the deaths incorrectly attributed to natural causes.
Fighting the fake drug menace is like playing whack-a-mole. It is technically illegal for individuals to order drugs online from other countries. And yet no sooner does the F.D.A. shut down one dubious online pharmacy than another pops up. According to the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, only 3 percent of the 9,600 online pharmacies it has reviewed complied with industry standards. Many were based overseas, so their sales to Americans were illegal; others did not require doctors' prescriptions. And some were very likely peddling dangerous counterfeit drugs. 
And yet, the answer is not to outlaw this business entirely. Foreign versions of drugs can cost roughly half what they do in the United States. For the millions of Americans who are uninsured or underinsured, buying from international, credentialed online pharmacies could provide access to the medicines they need at a price they can afford. The online market for drugs is already substantial, with probably more than a million Americans regularly participating. But it is growing slowly because of concern about drug safety and, of course, legality. While the F.D.A. does not prosecute individual consumers whose purchases present no threat to themselves or the public and grants some waivers to those buying less than three months' supply of a drug from abroad, most are still technically considered criminals.
The logic behind the current law is that it protects Americans from buying dangerous drugs. But there are better ways to guarantee that. In a recent National Bureau of Economic Research paper, I assessed the quality and price of drugs procured through Internet pharmacies. As expected, I found several foreign sites that sold fake drugs. But of the international Web pharmacies certified by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association or PharmacyChecker.com -- 23 in all, with 211 drugs sampled -- all passed quality-control tests. After all, they were the same drugs made by the same companies, just in different locations.
Careless buyers play Russian roulette, but those who look for credentialed sites can purchase safe drugs at a significant discount. Some Americans know this, but far more should. And it should be made entirely legal for them to do so.
Buying drugs online from overseas isn't for everyone. It should remain a limited option for desperate cash buyers -- sick people with limited resources and insurance coverage -- not a way for well-insured patients to reduce their co-pay. American health insurance companies should not be required to reimburse consumers for these drugs, because that would effectively import foreign governments' price controls into the United States and undermine American companies' research and development budgets.
Nonetheless, American pharmacists will most likely lose some business, and they will lobby hard against such a change. And no doubt some bad drugs will slip through, which will probably stop the F.D.A. from backing the idea. But as the problems with heparin and Avastin show, fake drugs leak into the United States already. The Internet is not the problem; the problem is that United States law cannot reach many of the criminals who perpetrate the frauds because most never set foot in America.
We can do something about that. These criminal networks flourish across Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Turkey and the Caribbean act as major transit points, and countries like Panama launder the billions in profit. A global treaty against fake drugs (and the financing to enforce it) could work to eliminate these safe havens and ensure that the perpetrators of fraud have nowhere to hide. We have treaties against fake currency and the narcotics trade, but as the medical journal The Lancet recently noted, we do not have one for fake drugs. Developing such a treaty -- the World Health Organization is the obvious place to start -- will take time, but it is the only way to begin to stamp out the international fake drug trade.
In the meantime, poor Americans should know how to buy their medicines online safely and should be allowed to do so. In an attempt to protect poor, uninsured and underinsured Americans from unsafe drugs, we are making sure that some go without drugs completely. It is time the law was changed.

HEADLINE: Afghan Pact Vows U.S. Aid For a Decade

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Graham Bowley contributed reporting from Kabul, and Helene Cooper and Steven Lee Myers from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- After months of negotiations, the United States and Afghanistan completed drafts of a strategic partnership agreement on Sunday that pledges American support for Afghanistan for 10 years after the withdrawal of combat troops at the end of 2014.
The agreement, whose text was not released, represents an important moment when the United States begins the transition from being the predominant foreign force in Afghanistan to serving a more traditional role of supportive ally.
By broadly redefining the relationship between Afghanistan and the United States, the deal builds on hard-won new understandings the two countries reached in recent weeks on the thorny issues of detainees and Special Operations raids. It covers social and economic development, institution building, regional cooperation and security.
The talks to reach the agreement were intense. At times they broke down altogether, primarily because of geopolitical frictions in the region from two powerful neighbors, Iran and Pakistan. Each country opposes long-term American ties with Afghanistan. 
The American and Afghan negotiators have been working hard in recent days to complete the draft so that it could be signed before a NATO conference in Chicago on May 20. There, decisions are to be made on how much money and support will be provided to the Afghan security forces after 2014 and by whom.
Lacking certainty about a long-term American commitment to Afghanistan, some countries were holding back, waiting to see what the United States, the leader in shaping Afghan policy, would do. Western diplomats said Sunday that the allies would now be more willing to make commitments.
The agreement -- sweeping by design, with few details to bog down negotiators -- puts down in writing for the first time the nature of the relationship the United States will have with Afghanistan once the bulk of American troops go home. It is meant to reassure the Afghan people that the United States will not abandon them, to warn the Taliban not to assume that they can wait out the West, and to send a message to Pakistan, which American officials believe has been hedging its bets in the belief that an American departure would leave the Taliban in charge.
''This is the proof in the pudding that we intend to be there,'' one United States official said Sunday, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
The agreement came despite a series of setbacks in Afghan-American relations, including the burning of Korans, the massacre of 16 civilians attributed to a lone Army sergeant, and the appearance of grisly photos of American soldiers posing with the body parts of Afghan insurgents.
''In the midst of all these meteor strikes, we were able to still sit down across the table and get these documents agreed to,'' one NATO official noted. Many Afghans, including some who are ambivalent about the American presence, believe that the country's survival is tied to having such an agreement with Washington. They say it will make clear to the Taliban and to regional powers that the Americans will not walk away the way they did in the 1990s after the Soviets were pushed out of the country.
A loya jirga, or traditional council, convened by President Hamid Karzai last fall strongly urged the government to sign a long-term agreement with the United States.
The draft agreement was initialed by Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, and Rangin Spanta, the Afghan national security adviser, at a meeting of the Afghan national security council on Sunday. It will now be sent to Mr. Karzai and to the Afghan Parliament for review and approval, and also to President Obama and the White House. It will become final when signed by the two presidents, according to American and Afghan officials.
Western diplomats in Kabul said the agreement was an important marker and a positive one, both because it would help persuade other Western countries to continue to support Afghanistan and because it will signal all sides, including the Taliban, that they will not have a free hand to manipulate the country after 2014.
''The Iranians don't like it because it shows the U.S. is going to be here for a long time,'' said a European diplomat here who noted that the Taliban would not like it for the same reason. ''This is important because they cannot tell their soldiers now just to sit it out and wait for 2014.''
The Taliban responded to the draft agreement within minutes, issuing a detailed statement condemning it as a giveaway to the Americans.
The goals of the agreement for the Americans, the Taliban statement said, are: ''First goal: securing routes to the Central Asian and Caspian oil fields. Second goal: prevention of a movement in favor of a true Islamic government. Third goal: Bringing secularism and liberalism to Afghanistan. Fourth goal: establishing an army hostile to Islam that protects Western interests. Fifth goal: Continuous threats to Islamic countries in the region and the prevention of political and military ties between them and Afghanistan.''
In many respects the strategic partnership agreement is more symbolic than substantive. It does not lay out specific dollar amounts of aid or name programs that the Americans will support; the financing must be authorized and appropriated by Congress from year to year.
Nor does it lay out specifically what the American military and security presence will be after 2014 or what role it will play. A more detailed security agreement is to come later, perhaps in the next year, Western diplomats said, once it becomes clear how much support European nations will give to the Afghan security forces.
Even so, the United States expects to make substantial contributions toward the cost of Afghanistan's security forces beyond 2014. A total figure for the United States of $2.7 billion a year has been discussed, and it could easily be more; there would most likely be aid for civilian programs as well.
That would be a steep reduction from the amount the United States now spends here, which has been $110 billion to $120 billion a year since the ''surge'' in American troop levels began in 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service.
For the partnership to work, the Afghan government must follow through with political reforms, particularly in fighting corruption, said Brian Katulis, a national security expert at the Center for American Progress. ''U.S. taxpayers have seen tens of millions of their dollars wasted by a corrupt and ineffective Afghan government over the past decade,'' Mr. Katulis said. ''Any transition plan needs to demand more responsibility from our Afghan partners.''
Officials declined Sunday to release the text of the draft strategic partnership deal or comment on it in detail. ''Until the agreement is finalized, we're not in a position to discuss the elements it contains,'' said Gavin Sundwall, the American Embassy spokesman in Kabul.
''Our goal is an enduring partnership with Afghanistan that strengthens Afghan sovereignty, stability and prosperity and that contributes to the shared goal of defeating Al Qaeda and its extremist allies,'' he said. ''We believe the agreement supports that goal.''
The talks on the agreement were delayed repeatedly over the delicate issues of night raids by American troops and the American operation of detention facilities. Ultimately, negotiators agreed to prepare detailed side agreements on those two issues. In March the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding shifting responsibility for all detention facilities in the country to the Afghans, and earlier this month they handed final authority over night raids to Afghan security forces, who are now carrying out all raids unless American assistance is requested.
With those two issues resolved, the strategic partnership was completed quickly.

HEADLINE: Egypt Cancels the Delivery of Gas to Israel

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Egypt's state-owned natural gas company said Sunday that it was ending a deal to ship gas to Israel because of a payment dispute. Israeli officials responded by warning that the termination cast a new shadow over the bilateral peace treaty.
The gas deal, signed in 2005, has become a target here in Cairo for broader resentment of the supportive relationship with Israel that was forged by Hosni Mubarak, the former Egyptian president. 
Lawsuits and criminal investigations have accused Mr. Mubarak and his associates of corruption for depriving Egypt of a fair market price for the gas sold to Israel. And since Mr. Mubarak's ouster last year, unknown attackers have bombed a gas pipeline in the Egyptian Sinai more than a dozen times, apparently to disrupt the flow to Israel.
For Israel, on the other hand, the deal had given it a crucial source of fuel. Before the disruptions, Egypt was said to have provided Israel's electric utility with 40 percent of its natural gas, which makes up about a third of its total fuel. The Israeli Foreign Ministry has described the agreement as an ''important and central element in the bilateral economic relationship.''
Mohamed Shoeib, the head of the state-owned Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company, told The Associated Press on Sunday night that it was exercising a legal right to terminate the contract because its Israeli customers had not paid for the gas for four months. ''This has nothing to do with anything outside of the commercial relations,'' Mr. Shoeib said.
Some Israeli officials expressed concern over the suspension of the gas deal. In a statement reported by Israeli news media, Yuval Steinitz, the finance minister, said it was ''a dangerous precedent that overshadows the peace agreements between Israel and Egypt.''
Other Israeli officials played down the potential economic impact, alluding to recent discoveries of natural gas off the coast. The minister of energy, Uzi Landau, said that Israel had been preparing for two years for the possibility of a cut in gas supplies from Egypt. ''Israel is working to strengthen its energy independence,'' he told Army Radio.
Egypt's current military rulers and the Islamists who now lead the Parliament have pledged to uphold all international obligations, including the peace treaty with Israel. But since Mr. Mubarak's ouster, American diplomats and Israeli officials have been bracing for a tempestuous period in Egyptian-Israeli relations.
After wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, Egypt's military government signed the 1979 Camp David peace accords without any public debate or consent. Egyptians of all political stripes overwhelmingly resent Israel because of its continued occupation of the West Bank and its restrictions on Gaza, which many here believe to be a violation of the accords.
In the recent parliamentary elections and the presidential campaign, Egyptians have been debating relations with Israel publicly for the first time.
Almost no one is calling for the cancellation of the treaty; all three remaining front-runners in the presidential race have pledged to respect it. But nearly every candidate at every level has pledged to take a hard look at the fairness and appropriateness of the unpopular natural gas deal.
Correction: April 26, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on Monday about Egypt's cancellation of deliveries of natural gas to Israel in a payment dispute referred imprecisely to Israel's relationship to Gaza, which is one of the causes of popular Egyptian anger at Israel. While Gaza's borders are controlled by Israel, and the territory is subject to an embargo Israel imposed in 2007, Gaza is no longer occupied by Israel, which unilaterally withdrew its military forces in 2005. (As the article correctly noted, there is continued occupation of the West Bank by Israel.)

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2012

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Monday about an announcement by Egypt's state-owned natural gas company that it was ending a deal to ship gas to Israel because of a payment dispute misstated the year the two countries signed the Camp David peace accords. It was 1978, not 1979. (The Camp David peace treaty was signed in 1979.) The error was repeated in some copies on Tuesday in a report about Egypt in the World Briefing column and again in later editions when that report was expanded to an article.

HEADLINE: Let Arizona's Law Stand

BYLINE: By PETER J. SPIRO. 
Peter J. Spiro is a law professor at Temple University.

 BODY:
Philadelphia
THE United States Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Wednesday in Arizona v. United States, the Obama administration's challenge to Arizona's immigration law, known as S.B. 1070. The law requires local law enforcement to make immigration-status determinations -- traditionally the prerogative of the federal government -- and to arrest people suspected of being undocumented. S.B. 1070 effectively makes undocumented status a crime under state law and penalizes unauthorized employment.
Arizona is one of several states, including Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina and Indiana, that, frustrated by Congress's idling on immigration reform, have challenged federal authority by taking it upon themselves to devise draconian policies for undocumented immigrants. Alabama's law even requires schools to collect immigration-status data on their students. 
Such laws are misguided at best, mean-spirited and racially tainted at worst. The conventional wisdom among immigration advocates is that immigrant interests will be best served if the Supreme Court makes an example of Arizona's law by striking it down.
But in the long run, immigrant interests will be better helped if the Supreme Court upholds S.B. 1070. Laws like Arizona's are such bad policy that, left to their own devices, they will die a natural death -- and their supporters will suffer the political consequences.
Undocumented immigrants may themselves be politically powerless, but they have powerful allies. In Alabama and Georgia, dismayed farmers have watched crops rot in the fields for want of immigrant labor. Arizona is estimated to have lost more than $140 million from convention cancellations made in protest.
Even more important is the prospect of lost foreign investment. Caught in the net of Alabama's law in November was a German Mercedes-Benz executive, who left his passport at home while out for a drive and as a result found himself in a county jail. Mercedes has a plant in Tuscaloosa that employs thousands of Alabamians and adds many hundreds of millions of dollars to the state economy. That embarrassment will make the next foreign company think twice as it scouts out a location for a manufacturing facility in the United States.
Even without such blunders, international human rights advocates, union organizers and shareholder activists are putting these laws on the corporate social-responsibility agenda. Earlier this month, opponents of Alabama's law traveled to Berlin to press the issue at Daimler's annual meeting. This is the kind of hassle that corporations hate. Why deal with Alabama or Arizona when you can build in North Carolina or Florida, states that have refrained from pursuing extreme anti-immigrant measures?
Similar anti-immigrant laws are often introduced but rarely enacted, as corporate interests work quietly to kill or defang them. Mississippi became the latest state to refuse to follow in Arizona's footsteps when an illegal-immigration bill died in a State Senate committee earlier this month in the face of opposition from prominent local business groups.
In those states that have enacted laws, there are moves to roll them back. The Alabama House of Representatives has approved a Republican-sponsored bill to soften its current law. At the local level, Riverside, N.J., repealed a similar ordinance following the exodus of an economically vibrant immigrant community.
In other words, the problem will largely self-correct. But even to the extent that it doesn't, the courts should still refrain from overturning such laws. Judicial intervention risks generating its own backlash. If the Supreme Court strikes down S.B. 1070, anti-immigrant constituencies will redouble their efforts to enact tougher laws at the federal level. A cautionary tale here is California's Proposition 187, a punitive immigration law that was blocked by a federal court in 1994 before it went into effect. Two years later, undaunted supporters helped push through the harshest overhaul of federal immigration policy in decades.
Even if some of these state immigration laws survive political, corporate and consumer opposition on the ground, it's better to have the scattered imposition of state laws than the blanket coverage of a federal measure. Other states and localities are welcoming immigrants, legal or not. That fact gets lost in the common indictment of state and local immigration measures as a ''patchwork.'' One of federalism's core virtues is the possibility of competition among states. Competition in this context is likely to vindicate pro-immigrant policies.
We should hold our noses and hope the Supreme Court lets S.B. 1070 stand, so we can watch it wither away on its own.

HEADLINE: Fed, Aiming For Clarity, Falls Short In Some Eyes

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has tried to speak more clearly and more frequently than his predecessors. He has lectured college students, met with members of the military and, since last April, held quarterly news conferences.
But as Mr. Bernanke prepares to meet the press for the fifth time Wednesday afternoon, after a scheduled meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee on Tuesday and Wednesday, there are reasons to doubt that the efforts are increasing public understanding of monetary policy. 
Experts and investors have continued to disagree about the plain meaning of the Fed's recent policy statements. Some say the increased volume of communication is creating cacophony rather than clarity. Political criticism of the Fed has continued unabated.
And the economists and analysts who are paid to predict and translate the Fed's actions and pronouncements for investors say that demand for their services has only increased.
''It's been one of the most amazing things,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, a Chicago investment firm. ''Over time I would have expected increased transparency to diminish my role in translating monetary policy for the markets.''
Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have said that they view the news conferences and other changes as a success. They point to the stability of asset prices tied to the future level of interest rates as evidence that the markets understand the Fed's commitment to hold down rates.
The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has sought to further reduce long-term rates through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds. It has said that it plans to continue those policies at least until late 2014.
Its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, is expected to affirm that course this week, according to Ms. Swonk and other analysts. The economy is growing, reducing the need for new stimulus, and there is little slack in the rate of inflation, sapping support for new steps.
At the same time, there are no indications that Mr. Bernanke is ready to consider doing less.
A dissident minority of Fed officials has pressed loudly and publicly for the Fed to curtail this aid campaign, suggesting that interest rates should be raised as soon as the end of this year. But the public profile of these Fed officials significantly exceeds their internal influence.
The Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, said this month that if anything, the Fed's existing efforts are insufficient, and that it might need to maintain rates near zero beyond 2014.
Mr. Bernanke has long argued that central banks can increase the potency of their policies through clear communication, because convincing investors that you will do something is tantamount to doing it.
The current effort also is politically expedient, in light of attacks from conservative politicians over the Fed's response to the financial crisis and subsequent efforts to revive the pace of growth. By increasing public understanding of its goals and methods, the central bank hopes to defuse political efforts to circumscribe its powers.
In addition to becoming the first Fed chairman to hold regular news conferences, Mr. Bernanke has carried this message to a wide range of other public forums, including a series of lectures at George Washington University last month, an interview shown on ABC's evening news program, and a ''town hall'' meeting with military personnel at a base in Texas.
The Fed also has expanded its formal statements. In January it began to release the predictions of its senior officials about the level of short-term interest rates over the next several years.
''A consensus has developed on the necessity and value of greater disclosure, accountability and candor,'' John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a recent essay. ''When the public better understands what the Fed is trying to do, uncertainty about its policies is reduced, and households and businesses are able to make spending and investment decisions with greater confidence.''
The Fed remains opaque compared with other parts of the government. For example, a spokeswoman declined to comment for this article on the effect of increased transparency, citing a policy against public comment in the week preceding a meeting of the policy-making committee.
But those who watch the Fed closely say that the changes have significantly improved their understanding of the Fed's policies. Several offered particular praise for Mr. Bernanke's news conferences, which he holds after four of the committee's scheduled meetings.
''You can imagine that the effectiveness would depend on the chairman, but Bernanke is excellent,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Fed governor. ''He uses them well to provide color and clarification.''
But when the Fed said last August that it intended to hold short-term rates near zero at least through the middle of 2013, confusion ensued. Some experts said it meant only that the Fed intended to keep rates near zero as long as the recovery did not outpace its expectations. Others described the language as something close to a commitment.
Since then, Mr. Bernanke and his lieutenants have sought to make clear that the language was indeed conditional. But when the Fed said in January that it intended to hold short-term rates near zero until late 2014, the same debate sprang back to life.
Indeed, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, published a paper describing the language as ambiguous.
Confusion also has surrounded another Fed initiative, the publication of predictions by its senior officials regarding the future level of short-term interest rates.
The Fed also releases predictions by those officials of the pace of economic growth and inflation, and the level of unemployment. But the predictions are published anonymously, so it is impossible to determine, for example, whether the person with the most optimistic view about unemployment is also the person who sees the most urgent need to raise interest rates.
Also, the predictions include the views of the 12 presidents of the regional Fed banks, but only five hold votes on the policy-making committee at any given time. The other votes are held by Mr. Bernanke and the other members of the Fed's board of governors; there are currently two vacancies on the seven-member board.
Some Fed officials want to publish additional information about the forecasts. Others want to wait.
They say it is not yet clear whether the Fed is being sufficiently clear.

HEADLINE: The New York Primary

 BODY:
Every four years, the New York primary becomes less significant. The front-loading of the parties' nominating processes has become so intense that Republican voters have made their choice before New Yorkers get a chance to vote on Tuesday. But in a year that started with the most right-wing fringe lineup we have seen, Republicans could have done a lot worse than Mitt Romney. 
Mr. Romney has compromised his record of moderation to become the presumptive candidate of a party that bears little resemblance to the G.O.P. of his father, George Romney, who was the governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969 and a presidential candidate himself. It is somehow fitting for this strange election year that Mitt Romney recently told supporters that if elected, he might shutter the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which his father ran from 1969 to 1972.
Still, Mr. Romney was the best choice of the field, an experienced politician and businessman who is capable of doing more than simply representing moneyed interests and social conservatives. He is the best bet to challenge President Obama.
The only other remaining candidates are terrible choices. Newt Gingrich, who was drummed out of the House speaker's job, is a right-wing zealot who wants to give minority children jobs as school janitors to show there is an alternative to being a pimp or a drug dealer. Ron Paul, a presidential never-was since the 1980s, offers the usual libertarian litany of agencies he would close, and some disturbing racial views.
Rick Santorum, the most sincere representative of the extremist forces who have killed any expression of Republican moderation, dropped out on April 10. Herman Cain dropped out before Iowa and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota left after her pathetic showing there. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who was confused about foreign policy but clear on his desire to deny health services for poor women in Texas, dropped out before South Carolina.
We have long wished Mr. Romney were running on the record he created as governor of Massachusetts, where he was protective of women's reproductive rights and introduced a health insurance reform that was the model for the one Mr. Obama championed and Mr. Romney now denounces. But he clearly concluded that that record could never win him the nomination. He was probably right, but we don't believe he had to go as far to the right as he did.
Mr. Romney's challenge is to find a way out of his current position, where he has endorsed Representative Paul Ryan's budget, a pinched and cruel blueprint that pretends to deal with the budget deficit by slashing programs for poor and working-class Americans while expanding tax giveaways for rich Americans who don't need the government's aid. He has taken to telling whoppers about Mr. Obama's record -- on gun control, for example, and on the effect of his economic policies on women.
We don't think it is too late for Mr. Romney to build a platform that addresses the real needs of Americans, and his party should let him, for the country's sake. The Republicans' politics of personal destruction and public deprivation have done a great deal of damage and only promise more. Mr. Romney ought to aim higher.

HEADLINE: The Amnesia Candidate

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Just how stupid does Mitt Romney think we are? If you've been following his campaign from the beginning, that's a question you have probably asked many times.
But the question was raised with particular force last week, when Mr. Romney tried to make a closed drywall factory in Ohio a symbol of the Obama administration's economic failure. It was a symbol, all right -- but not in the way he intended.
First of all, many reporters quickly noted a point that Mr. Romney somehow failed to mention: George W. Bush, not Barack Obama, was president when the factory in question was closed. Does the Romney campaign expect Americans to blame President Obama for his predecessor's policy failure? 
Yes, it does. Mr. Romney constantly talks about job losses under Mr. Obama. Yet all of the net job loss took place in the first few months of 2009, that is, before any of the new administration's policies had time to take effect. So the Ohio speech was a perfect illustration of the way the Romney campaign is banking on amnesia, on the hope that voters don't remember that Mr. Obama inherited an economy that was already in free fall.
How does the campaign deal with people who point out the awkward reality that all of the ''Obama'' job losses took place before any Obama policies had taken effect? The fallback argument -- which was rolled out when reporters asked about the factory closure -- is that even though Mr. Obama inherited a deeply troubled economy, he should have fixed it by now. That factory is still closed, said a Romney adviser, because of the failure of Obama policies ''to really get this economy going again.''
Actually, that factory would probably still be closed even if the economy had done better -- drywall is mainly used in new houses, and while the economy may be coming back, the Bush-era housing bubble isn't.
But Mr. Romney's poor choice of a factory for his photo-op aside, I guess accusing Mr. Obama of not doing enough to promote recovery is a better argument than blaming him for the effects of Bush policies. However, it's not much better, since Mr. Romney is essentially advocating a return to those very same Bush policies. And he's hoping that you don't remember how badly those policies worked.
For the Bush era didn't just end in catastrophe; it started off badly, too. Yes, Mr. Obama's jobs record has been disappointing -- but it has been unambiguously better than Mr. Bush's over the comparable period of his administration.
This is especially true if you focus on private-sector jobs. Overall employment in the Obama years has been held back by mass layoffs of schoolteachers and other state and local government employees. But private-sector employment has recovered almost all the ground lost in the administration's early months. That compares favorably with the Bush era: as of March 2004, private employment was still 2.4 million below its level when Mr. Bush took office.
Oh, and where have those mass layoffs of schoolteachers been taking place? Largely in states controlled by the G.O.P.: 70 percent of public job losses have been either in Texas or in states where Republicans recently took control.
Which brings me to another aspect of the amnesia campaign: Mr. Romney wants you to attribute all of the shortfalls in economic policy since 2009 (and some that happened in 2008) to the man in the White House, and forget both the role of Republican-controlled state governments and the fact that Mr. Obama has faced scorched-earth political opposition since his first day in office. Basically, the G.O.P. has blocked the administration's efforts to the maximum extent possible, then turned around and blamed the administration for not doing enough.
So am I saying that Mr. Obama did everything he could, and that everything would have been fine if he hadn't faced political opposition? By no means. Even given the political constraints, the administration did less than it could and should have in 2009, especially on housing. Furthermore, Mr. Obama was an active participant in Washington's destructive ''pivot'' away from jobs to a focus on deficit reduction.
And the administration has suffered repeatedly from complacency -- taking a few months of good news as an excuse to rest on its laurels rather than hammering home the need for more action. It did that in 2010, it did it in 2011, and to a certain extent it has been doing the same thing this year too. So there is a valid critique one can make of the administration's handling of the economy.
But that's not the critique Mr. Romney is making. Instead, he's basically attacking Mr. Obama for not acting as if George Bush had been given a third term. Are the American people -- and perhaps more to the point, the news media -- forgetful enough for that attack to work? I guess we'll find out.
