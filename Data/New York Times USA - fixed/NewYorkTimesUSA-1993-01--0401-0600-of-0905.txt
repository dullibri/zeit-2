HEADLINE: Shetland Critics Urge New Regulation of Tankers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT

DATELINE: SUMBURGH HEAD, Shetland Islands, Jan. 13

 BODY:
With millions of gallons of oil on the water and the tanker Braer a battered wreck near this rocky headland, conservationists and local residents are now demanding to know who is to blame and what will be done to prevent anything like it from happening again.
Paralleling similar arguments made in the United States after the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in March 1989, critics say the Braer accident -- in volume one of the worst oil spills in history -- shows that the British Government must move immediately to adopt tougher safety regulations as well as restrictions on the coastal movements of tankers, particularly in bad weather and in environmentally sensitive areas. 
 Government ministers told Parliament this week that as a result of the Braer accident, they would convene an inquiry to consider what needs to be done to protect a coastline that overlooks some of the world's most heavily traveled sea lanes.
The Duke of Edinburgh, who visited the islands and flew over the wreck today in his role as international president of the World Wide Fund for Nature, raised several questions about regulating tankers, beyond tighter controls on their coastal routes.
"Are the crews properly trained?" he asked at a news conference today. "Are they maintained properly? To what extent do flags of convenience mean you can opt out of regulations?"
With skies clearing and strong winds abating today, Prince Philip and Prince Charles, flew over the scene of the accident, where pollution control officials said large swells and churning seas overnight achieved a 90 percent reduction in the thick coffee-colored slicks that stained the southern coastal area Tuesday after the ship broke up.
So far, visible damage from the nearly 26 million gallons of light crude spilled along the coast of these islands is light, although officials and scientists acknowledge the oil is toxic in high concentrations, and its long-term environmental consequences on marine life are still unknown.
The discussion about tighter controls over tankers comes amid growing concern from some critics that tanker owners are cutting corners and adhering to less rigid safety and training standards as a result of economic and competitive pressures.
According to one estimate, there are more than 30,000 annual movements of oil, gas and chemical tankers to and from British ports. In the English Channel, where there are strict navigation restrictions as well as constant radar coverage, as many as 10 tankers a day pass within 12 miles of the British coast.
Critics say tougher controls are long overdue. Paul Horsman, an oil pollution expert for Greenpeace, the environmentalist group, says prevention is the only answer. "Once the oil is in the water, it's too late," he said.
In the Shetland Islands and elsewhere, officials have called for the Government to move now to install surveillance systems to monitor all tankers carrying oil or hazardous cargos, or to insist such ships be accompanied by escort tugs, in case they encounter trouble.
Malcolm Green, the chief executive of the Shetland Islands Council, complained today that radar coverage of the passage south of the islands, where the tanker Braer ran into trouble last week, was inadequate. "We can't see the tankers when they stop, or reverse course," he said.
Leonard Groat, another member of the Shetlands local government, added: "It's the Government's job to guard our coast. They aren't doing it."
Others go even further, calling for an outright ban on tanker traffic near environmentally sensitive coastal areas, like the southern Shetlands, a ruggedly scenic coastline that is home to one of Europe's largest seabird and wildlife colonies.
Rick Steiner, of the University of Alaska's Marine Advisory Program, argues that spills like the Braer underscore the need for a "complete review and rethinking" of everything from radar coverage and speed restrictions to tug escorts, improved construction and the banning of coastal zones to such shipping.

Auto Sales Down in Early January

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 3.1 percent in early January, compared with the corresponding period last year, the industry said today.
Sales during the first 10 days of January are typically an unreliable indicator of demand, since incentives used by many dealers to meet year-end quotas pull many January sales into December.
"Early January statistics are the least accurate of the year," said Jean-Claude Gruet, an automotive analyst for UBS Securities Inc. in New York. 
 Sales of domestically built cars dropped 4.5 percent, to 82,729, while sales of light trucks -- including mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickups -- fell 1.2 percent, to 62,881. Vehicle sales over all were 145,610.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales was 5.3 million, the same as during last year's early January period. Mr. Gruet said he had expected an adjusted rate of between 6 million and 6.5 million. Last year, the United States auto industry sold 12.9 million vehicles, compared with 12.3 million in 1991.
Tom Webb, the chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association, concurred that January's weakness reflected a "payback" for the industry's late December sales surge. Contributing to the surge may have been the Ford Motor Company's successful campaign with its Taurus model to defeat the Honda MotorCompany's Accord for honors as best-selling car of the year.
Paul Ulan, general sales manager of Southwest Ford Sales Company in Cleveland, said sales tapered off after the end of the year because Ford ended its $1,300 rebate and subsidized lease program for Taurus on Jan. 5. Moreover, he said, the dealership had no more cars to sell: "We have no stock left; we're out of everything."
The General Motors Corporation posted a 17.8 percent drop in car sales to 33,221 and a 7.9 percent drop in light-truck sales to 24,092. G.M.'s Chevrolet division, the company's largest, reported a roughly 25 percent drop in sales year-to-year as it continued to curtail subsidized sales to rental companies. G.M.'s Pontiac division, led by strong sales of its compact Grand Am, was the only division to increase sales.
Ford, which last year posted strong gains in car and truck market share, managed to maintain momentum. Ford's domestic car sales rose 12.1 percent, to 29,532, compared with the corresponding period last year; the light-truck sales, however, fell 9.1 percent, to 18,999.
 
Sales Up at Chrysler
 The Chrysler Corporation's car sales rose 23.3 percent, to 10,900, and light-truck sales rose 17 percent, to 17,200, according to an estimate by Ward's Automotive Reports. Chrysler only reports vehicle sales on a monthly basis.
Honda suffered a 42.2 percent drop in sales of domestically produced cars to 3,251.
The Toyota Motor Corporation reported a 17.7 percent drop in domestic cars to 2,186; Toyota also reported sales of 823 light trucks, compared with only 74 last year, during the first phase of production.

HEADLINE: New Tax Rules for Foreign Companies Disclosed

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13

 BODY:
The Treasury Department disclosed today a broad revision of the nation's tax regulations for foreign companies, but it was unclear what effect, if any, the changes would have on tax revenue.
The revision aims to clarify existing regulations rather than enact sweeping changes. Though the Bush Administration would like to increase tax collections from foreign companies, Administration officials say huge increases are not feasible. President-elect Bill Clinton said during the campaign that billions of dollars could be raised through increased taxes on foreign businesses. 
 The new rules, contained in documents nearly an inch thick, will take effect in 90 days, allowing a little time for the Clinton Administration to review and possibly change them.
The Treasury Department does not estimate revenues from new regulations, and did not do so today.
 
Enforcement Is Crucial
 George N. Carlson, a tax partner in the Washington office of Arthur Andersen & Company, one of the first private tax experts to read the new regulations, said that the effect of the new rules on tax revenues and the budget deficit, and the indirect effect on Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, would depend entirely on how the Clinton Administration chose to enforce the new rules.
Mr. Clinton's economic proposals during the campaign rely in part on raising an extra $45 billion over the next four years through the tougher enforcement of tax regulations on foreign companies doing business in the United States. The same plan proposed to collect $91.7 billion from wealthy individuals and a total of $58.3 billion by closing corporate loopholes, including the higher tax collections from foreign companies.
Treasury officials have expressed skepticism about Mr. Clinton's forecasts of extra revenues.
"There is a general consensus in the tax community that those figures are greatly exaggerated," a senior Treasury official said today. But the official, who insisted on anonymity, said that he and his colleagues had not studied the revenue effects of today's revision.
 
Regulations Spur Complaints
 The Treasury Department issued a draft of today's regulations a year ago, and that draft prompted complaints from the European Community and the Japanese Government that the rules might discriminate against their companies. Mr. Carlson said that the final rules issued today appeared to represent "a step back" from a few of the more drastic changes previously envisioned.
The new rules will also affect the extent to which American multinational corporations pay taxes in the United States or overseas.
The rules released today represent the first comprehensive revision since 1968 of regulations that govern how much of an international company's profits are taxed by the United States and how much are taxed by foreign countries.
The 1968 regulations assumed that most international companies were manufacturers that traded goods with easily measured costs and prices, the senior Treasury official said. The rules have become increasingly outdated as service companies have taken greater roles in the American economy, the official said.
Because state governments typically base their tax bills on corporations' Federal tax liability, additional Federal revenues would likely result in more money for the states.
Estimates of the potential extra revenues have ranged wildly. Shirley Peterson, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said last April that an additional $3 billion annually could be raised through new regulations and better administration. But the Democrat-controlled House Ways and Means Committee has estimated that up to $30 billion annually could be available to the Federal Government.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bombing Causes Little Reaction

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose yesterday, but the rest of the market was little changed. The bombing of Iraq appeared to have an impact in the auction of seven-year Treasury notes, but otherwise did not cause big changes in the market, traders said.
The 30-year bond seemed to get a boost from two factors. One was that the price had fallen sharply lately and was due for a correction. Since Jan. 4, the price of the bond had dropped almost two points through Tuesday and the yield had jumped to 7.47 percent from 7.32 percent. 
 Another factor was the unexpectedly low volume of car sales, which was another sign that the economy, while growing, is still weak. The sales for Jan. 1 to Jan. 10 were 5.3 million, well below the 6.2 million in many forecasts. In late trading, the price of the 30-year bond was up 18/32 point to yield 7.43 percent, down from 7.47 percent Tuesday.
Traders said the military action in Iraq helped push down the discount rates of Treasury bills several basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. They said that there was a belief there would be a flight to quality in reaction to the risks surrounding the confrontation with Iraq. "So people were reluctant to be short," said Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, referring to a reluctance to sell shorter maturities.
Prices of intermediate maturities were down earlier in the day, apparently because of concerns about the prospects for the Treasury auction of seven-year notes. John Costas, a managing director at the First Boston Corporation, said many dealers were reluctant to bid aggressively at the 1 P.M. deadline when there was a possibility of a confrontation with Iraq.
In a seven-year auction two years ago, dealers had been hurt by the drop in price just after the auction when then-Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced that talks to avoid the Persian Gulf War had failed.
The auction did not go well from the Treasury point of view. The average yield was 6.41 percent while the yield in the pre-auction, or when issued, market, was 6.39 percent before the 1 P.M. deadline. But the market rallied after the auction, and in the when-issued market the seven-year note finished the day with the yield down to 6.34 percent. This had to leave a lot of dealers happy because it meant a good profit for them out of the auction.
 
New York in Japan
 The New York City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, said yesterday that the city intends to sell bonds denominated in yen in Japan soon as long as the financial savings for the city are there.
Ms. Holtzman made her comments in a telephone interview while she was visiting Tokyo as part of an effort to sell the Japanese on the idea of buying New York.
"There is a tremendous amount of interest," she said after several days of meeting with potential investors and bankers.
"Assuming the market conditions are right and and it is favorable, we will go ahead," she said. Because it is a sale of bonds denominated in yen, it is important that the value of the dollar, as well as interest rates, are at the right level for the city to be able to save money.
The city is planning on offering $100 million to $150 million of what are known in the trade as "Samurai" bonds as part of its regular spring bond sale, which will be at the end of February or early in March. Despite the interest in Japan, Ms. Holtzman said that there was no talk now of increasing the size of the issue. "This will be the first time, so we want to make sure that we will not be biting off more than we can chew," she said.
The city sold bonds to the Japanese as part of its bond sale in February 1992. But those bonds were denominated in dollars. According to Darcy Bradbury, the deputy comptroller for debt management, those sales went especially well, with the demand from Japanese buyers pulling down the yield on the bonds that the city had to pay.
 
Sale to Argentina
 The Treasury announced yesterday that it would sell $18.5 billion of zero coupon 30-year bonds to Argentina to use as collateral to guarantee the principal portion of the debt reduction agreement that Argentina reached with its commercial bankers last year.
The sale will be based on the price of existing zero-coupon bonds due in August 2022 and November 2022. Zero- coupon bonds do not pay regular interest. Instead they are purchased at a deep discount to the face value of the bond and when they mature the investor gets the face value.
Yesterday, the 30-year zero-coupon bonds due in August and November 2022 were trading at just around 11 cents on the dollar. The Treasury will charge a fee for the sale that will raise the market price slightly. Argentina has until April 30 to purchase the zero-coupon bonds.

HEADLINE: Grief Over AIDS Spurs Gifts to Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
They are struggling to make sense of it all: How can so many lives be snuffed out in their prime, as if nature's laws had suddenly imploded? Why are once-healthy sons and daughters turning into invalids? Who will care for the tens of thousands of poor people fallen ill? Can anything stop this plague from further scarring a generation?
As the AIDS epidemic drags on, growing numbers of people are trying to exorcise some of their grief over the disease by sending contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, asking that the money be used for patient care and prevention. 
 After years of giving to the fund in honor of their son, Larz and Marylou Anderson of Dallas sent $50 this year in memory of him. Larz F. Anderson 2d, a financial analyst, died of AIDS last summer in Manhattan at the age of 33.
"He had a wonderful sense of humor," Mrs. Anderson said yesterday. "He liked to help good causes. I thought he would have liked this."
 
'Wonderfully Giving'
 Friends of Melvin L. Rosen, who served as executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis and chairman of Beth Simchat Torah synagogue in Manhattan, sent donations in his memory. He was 42 when he died of AIDS-related lung cancer last year. A close friend who gave $500 recalled in a letter that Mr. Rosen was a "wonderfully giving citizen of New York."
Richard Schuckman of Fair Lawn, N.J., gave to the fund in honor of Jeffrey Schmalz, a reporter for The New York Times who has AIDS and wrote an article for the newspaper on Dec. 20 about his experiences covering the epidemic.
"I felt that he would appreciate my enclosed check for the Neediest Cases," Mr. Schuckman wrote. "Tears streamed from my eyes and I hoped he may be able to win his battle with AIDS."
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund gives money to seven charities that have set up programs for thousands of adults and children who have AIDS. These services provide special housing, home-care workers and meals for seriously ill patients; grants for medication and other treatment, and counseling for people whose relatives or friends have died from the disease. Some of the charities are also mounting education campaigns.
But as the epidemic continues and the recession digs in, the charities are facing strained budgets that might force the elimination of some AIDS programs. To complicate matters, donations to the Neediest Cases have declined so far in this year's campaign, which ends on Feb. 28. The New York Times pays the fund's expenses, so all contributions are given directly to seven charities.
Rosalind Pretzfelder of Manhattan gave $100 to the fund to be used "in making the lives of AIDS victims, especially children, more comfortable in whatever time they have." And Terese Kreuzer of Manhattan sent $25 in memory of her friend and piano teacher, Mark Kyrkostas, who died of AIDS in 1990.
"Every day I see names of people in the paper who have succumbed to this plague -- and no end in sight," she wrote. "But he was the one I knew and loved and continue to miss."

Cash Influx Lowers Yields On Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were down sharply in the latest week, after a month-long climb driven by year-end adjustments by investors and portfolio managers.
The latest survey by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report shows tax-exempt yields sharply lower for the week ended Tuesday, as money from the recent huge redemptions of municipal bonds and end-of-year dividend payouts poured into the money funds. 
 Assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $6.7 billion, to $104.1 billion, and the average number of days left to maturity of securities being held in the fund portfolios dropped to 55, from 58. This was all in line with seasonal expectations, analysts said.
The seven-day average compounded yield for tax-exempt funds plunged 88 basis points, to 1.95 percent, while the average seven-day simple yield dropped by 86 basis points, to 1.93. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The statisticians for the Money Fund Report calculate that over a 30-day period the compounded yield has averaged 2.45 percent and the simple yield 2.42 percent.
Not assuming state taxes, the taxable bond equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield this week for someone in a 28 percent tax bracket is about 2.70 percent, and about 2.83 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets greater than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Strong Municipal Money Market fund led the group, yielding 2.65 percent. The fund is distributed by Strong/ Corneliuson Capital Management in Milwaukee.
Walter S. Frank, chief economist at the Money Fund Report, expects yields to begin climbing again next week, or the week after, as the flow of cash into the funds diminishes.
 
Taxable Funds
 In taxable money market funds for the latest week, assets grew by $21.7 billion, to a total of $481.2 billion, with institutional funds up by $18.4 billion and retail up $3.3 billion.
Analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios rose to 58, from 56.
Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. in Detroit, was the week's top performer, yielding 3.78 percent.
Banks, which compete directly with money market funds for investor money, adjusted yields on money market accounts down an average 2 basis points in the week, to 2.75 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor.

HEADLINE: New Housewares In Search of a Home

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In comparison with the rapidly changing electronics industry, which ended its giant Las Vegas show on Sunday, the nearly 1,900 housewares manufacturers who gathered here this week seem to be strolling toward the future. The vast majority of product categories are evolving slowly, and that fact lent an almost sedate air to the 1993 International Housewares Show, despite its drawing nearly 50,000 visitors.
That is not to say that the exhibitors at McCormick Place were disappointed in the three-and-half-day show, which ended this morning. With indications that consumer confidence is up from a year ago and with retail shelves emptier than usual after a strong Christmas season, buyers from department stores and mass retailers were out in force. 
 Some old product categories, like food dehydrators, are undergoing a burst of renewed interest that is resulting in a bigger range of selections and more aggressive marketing. Health-oriented products, like air and water purifiers and cooking equipment aimed at reducing fat intake, were displayed at many booths. And as in recent years, convenience, ergonomic design and environmental features were touted.
But it was symbolic, perhaps, that one of the splashiest introductions for a product that will be mass-marketed in the coming months came in the mundane world of soap-filled cleaning pads, where the 3M Company is challenging the decades-old dominance of S.O.S. and Brillo with a new product made of recycled plastic.
In a campy scrub-off staged like a prize fight between what 3M called "a complacent, tired and out-of-shape" product "whose name is a distress call" and its new Scotch Brite pad, "fresh from a string of test-market victories," 3M showed off its claims that the new pad retains its cleaning power longer, does not splinter or rust and is better for the environment. It plans to price the pad to match the competition.
A much simpler new product with an even more modest target market is the Guardian II, a rubbery casing to protect television remote controls from damage when they fall. The device is made in Italy, and will retail for $9.95.
Elsewhere, a giant carrot demonstrated a Farberware peeler while bemoaning the vegetable life ("I used to work for Gerber's baby foods but everything was such a strain"). Sales representatives from Ironclad Inc. of Tustin, Calif., repeatedly poured mountains of nails into their trash bags to show that they deserved to be stocked alongside such brands as Hefty and Glad. And a rap singer chanted the praises of Blublocker sunglasses in a large booth that brought together 14 small enterprises hawking products that are heavily advertised on television.
The sponsor of that booth, As Seen on TV Inc. of Cathedral City, Calif., is one of several companies that have sprung up to help such products migrate from the television-sustained mail-order business to mainstream retail outlets. "Four or five of these products will be the hits of 1993," Robert Garrison, the company's president, predicted amid devices like the Magic Dip paint kit for creating marble effects on fabrics, ceramics and other materials; the For the Birds roasting rack; the Stainarator stain remover, and the Flowbee hair-cutter, which connects to a vacuum cleaner.
There were several Elvis sightings at the show, most prominently in the Elvis postage stamp design on a display of towels from Leshner Mills of Hamilton, Ohio. "We lucked out," said Pat Walsh, who handles international sales for the mill. "There's no way to get an Elvis license, but we have a license to do all United States postage stamps."
The environmental theme continued to attract new entrants and extensions of existing lines. For example, Enviracaire, which has an air-filtration system classified as a medical device by the Food and Drug Administration, introduced a new product for 9-by-12-foot rooms that will be its first below $100.
Environmental concerns also showed up more subtly. Primex International Trading Corporation, a New York-based purchasing agent that handles imports from Latin America for big retailers, showed off tile-topped kitchen carts from Brazil that are assmebled by the buyer. In doing so, the company emphasized that the carts were made of common pine grown far from the Amazon rain forests.
Products designed to fit the human body better was another popular theme. Oxo International is expanding its line of peelers and other Good Grip brand kitchen tools with ergonomic handles, many for under $10. They include a jar opener, strainer, spatula, ladles and garden tools.
The National Brush Company showed off a broom that looks like something out of Mother Goose's "there was a crooked man" rhyme. The handle reduces pressure on the back when sweeping, the company said. It will retail for under $25. The shape is used in the company's new barbecue brush, too.
The ergonomic trend is international and is affecting even upscale products in many categories. For example, when Sabatier, a French company, decided to introduce its first never-needs-sharpening knives at this year's show, it hired Mark Harrison, a Rhode Island School of Design ergonomics expert, to design the handle. Sabatier views the handle as an added selling point, but it will emphasize that the computer-designed edges are waves rather than teeth. As a result, it said, the knives will slice rather than saw food. The new knives will cost $6 to $20.
Convenience was another area where manufacturers sought to edge ahead of rivals. Nonstick surfaces cover an increasing number of baking, cooking and ironing products. Farberware, which broke new ground three years ago with its Millennium line that applied the Excalibur no-stick coating to stainless steel cookware, extended its line to include saute pans that will sell for $20 and up.
Among its rivals introducing nonstick stainless steel at the show was Revere. Revere had Whitford, the British company that invented Excalibur, develop an exclusive gold-flecked version of the surface for saute pans it is introducing for $30 to $50.
The Du Pont Company continues to be a dominant supplier of nonstick surfaces. Max Burton Enterprises of Tacoma, Wash., which set off a boomlet in stove-top broilers five years ago, advertised its partnership with the chemical giant in developing its latest design. A new nontick surface allows the company's new portable broiler to have a higher dome than earlier products did, allowing for a larger broiling surface and better drainage of fat.
Health concerns showed up as a theme outside the kitchen, as well. Lumiscope Inc. of Edison, N.J., combined health and convenience concerns by developing a baby thermometer inside a pacifier. It is scheduled to be in catalogs and stores this spring and sell for $15 to $20.
Some products were just meant to be fun, like the Scaredy Cat line of candleholders and the miniature-chair candleholders made by Beagle Manufacturing of El Monte, Calif.
"We made wedding gazebos for 20 years," said Linda Derman, a vice president of Beagle, "but this line of new-age metal has really taken off. This show allows us to meet the big shots we can never get an appointment with normally."

Tales Out of School
Joseph Fernandez's Crusade to Rescue American Education
By Joseph A. Fernandez
With John Underwood. 278 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
Aside from the stories of his youthful drug use and street-gang rambles, the advance news about "Tales Out of School," by the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, has centered on his purportedly confrontational remarks about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the members of the New York City Board of Education. Various officials have been prompted by such remarks to wonder whether "Tales Out of School" constitutes Mr. Fernandez's unofficial resignation. 
 Yet read in context, the Chancellor's utterances seem not so much resigning as resigned, as if his relation to the board had long since been resolved. He writes as if the board's appointment in July 1991, 18 months after his assumption of the chancellorship on Jan. 1, 1990, came as a catastrophe that placed him beyond meliorating his position.
He accuses the board of failing to perform its required function of defining a coherent policy, and of crossing "over the line, trying to extend their jurisdiction into administration." Though he mentions calling one board member, Ninfa Segarra, a "political prostitute" because of her "turn-around" on the issue of distributing condoms, he cites his remark only as an example of how fractious his relations with the board had become.
He concludes: "As for my deteriorated relationship with this particular board, I finally decided to quit worrying about it. You can't gauge your profession or base your life's work on job security. . . . But I will say honestly that I wouldn't have come to New York if it was to work for the board I have now."
What further distances his remarks from a confrontational tone is that his outlook toward his present situation seems consistent with everything in his past. It's almost as if he were saying that given what happened to him in his youth, he has never had anything to lose by taking risks. After gang fights that could have killed him and after several near overdoses on heroin, nothing seemed all that dangerous.
Certainly, it was his style to take big risks in his rise to the top of the Dade County Public School System. At least as he tells it, he was never one to play a calculated game of politics. He liked bold strokes and he liked to dominate, a trait he recognizes as going back to his boyhood behavior on the playground. And such a nature seems to have liberated him to develop a broad and imaginative vision of public education.
All of which makes for a good story, up to a point. "Tales Out of School" is captivating as long as Mr. Fernandez recounts his life. Written with the help of John Underwood, a former columnist for The Miami Herald who has written autobiographies with Ted Williams ("My Turn at Bat") and Paul (Bear) Bryant ("Bear"), Mr. Fernandez's narrative is also clever in the way that it weaves in his developing educational philosophy, which continues to be hopeful for the American public school system despite the terrible battering he believes the shortage of Federal funds has inflicted on it.
He is particularly inspiring when he describes his reclamation of Central High School in Miami, whose ethnic makeup was about 85 percent black, with the rest white and Hispanic, and all at the lower end of the economic scale. It was here that he developed some of his most innovative programs for rescuing inner-city schools.
It is only when he generalizes about his operating style as Dade superintendent that his narrative loses its drive and the prose descends into tired cliche. At one point, he manages to switch metaphors at least 10 times, going from horse wrangling ("a principle digs in his heels") to gambling ("all these people take risks") to baseball ("like a pitcher responding to a chattering infield") to cattle herding ("actively prodding it along") to cooking ("keep the fires burning") to child rearing ("nurturing is vital") to military organization ("the cadres don't get the spiritual support") to racing ("far behind") to battle command ("when the soldiers in the field look to the center for assurance"), all within the space of four paragraphs. When Mr. Fernandez reports how he arrived in New York City, he says he "hit the ground running" but "seemed to skip right past the governance problems we had in Miami." After not too much of this, your mind begins to run and your eyes are tempted to skip.
But then comes the provocative analysis of his present relations with the Board of Education, along with a chilling portrait of the condition of New York City schools. This is in turn folded into an inventory of what Mr. Fernandez feels he has accomplished during his term in office, which then expands into an optimistic vision of the possibilities of public education.
As some board members have speculated, Mr. Fernandez may possibly have had an agenda in writing "Tales Out of School," to renounce his chancellorship and offer himself as a candidate for Secretary of Education in Washington. But in this unevenly absorbing book, it sounds as if he's simply washing his hands of petty politics. Like some democratic version of Shakespeare's Coriolanus, he's refusing to flatter Jove for the power to thunder and letting his tongue vent what his breast has forged.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Iraq, What Next?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Good. The U.S. and friends finally rebuked Saddam Hussein in language he seems to comprehend. But Bill Clinton should not expect that the joint air attack -- a rather modest one at that -- will end the Iraqi bad man's insults and evasions of U.N. resolutions. Nor will these rare rebukes dissuade Saddam from continuing cat and mouse games, thus diddling and distracting the new President as he has the outgoing one.
Worse, Saddam may now be ready to go beyond marginal provocations and present Mr. Clinton with a fiendishly tough and intricate choice between another war and "peace." 
 Saddam's next military challenge might be far more audacious than the mosquito bites he has been taking from President Bush's hide, but far less threatening than his conquest of Kuwait. Mr. Clinton would have to choose between doing nothing, which would be politically unthinkable, and hitting back with an attack smaller than Desert Storm yet much larger than yesterday's slap and therefore much harder to orchestrate.
Or, more likely, Saddam could concoct a "peace and disarmament package," pledging concessions deeper than anything he ever offered to Mr. Bush if the U.S. accepts his authority over all Iraq. Mr. Clinton could resist the bait, but that would anger allies now searching to escape the present box. Or he could bite and negotiate, which would restore Saddam's legitimacy.
Maybe these scenarios give Saddam too much credit. Perhaps he is just a megalomaniacal jerk whose only purpose in violating U.N. restrictions in recent weeks has been to irritate his departing archnemesis, George Bush -- even at the cost of a U.S. retaliatory blow.
Administration experts, however, see domestic political reasons for Saddam's madness. They say he has been tweaking Mr. Bush recently to show Iraqis he is still boss and to keep his military busy with external threats. But how does Saddam look strong when the U.S. bombs his forces with impunity?
Others in the Administration say that Saddam knew what was in store for him, but elected to take the punishment anyway to test Bill Clinton's mettle and chip away at U.N. authority in Iraq. This makes little sense; if he wanted to test Mr. Clinton, why did he provoke George Bush? And as Saddam surely knew, Mr. Bush had to respond with force. Saddam must also appreciate that the Bush action established a benchmark that Mr. Clinton must equal or watch his Presidency dwindle.
All of which suggests that Saddam may be setting the stage for bigger challenges that, paradoxically, could be less risky for him. Two and a half years ago he grabbed all of Kuwait. Perhaps he has learned that had he simply settled for the northern Kuwaiti oilfields, the West might merely have grumbled and looked away.
So next time he might pose a lesser challenge. He could launch a ground attack against the Kurds in the north or the Shiites in the south. Western airpower alone would be unable to stop these attacks. Western ground troops would be needed. And that might prove very difficult to arrange, as Saddam well knows.
If force seems too risky -- as it probably does -- Saddam could float a sweetened peace proposal. He could accept U.N. demands to freely inspect and dismantle his weapons of mass destruction, and to earmark most Iraqi oil proceeds for war reparations and pledge greater autonomy for Kurds and Shiites. In return, he could ask "only" for U.N. recognition of Baghdad's authority over all Iraq. The Clinton team has already gotten such feelers.
Saddam may reckon even now that such war or peace games could prove good gambles. Western will to fight a second major war against Iraq is eroding. Not only Bill Clinton, but every other Western leader wants to concentrate on domestic problems. The resistance of Western and Arab leaders to a "peace" with Iraq is also waning. Increasingly, they see Iran as the greater future threat and are more willing to contemplate Iraq's reconstruction as a buffer to Iran.
Whatever Saddam chooses, new bold moves or the piddling old ones, Mr. Clinton must not permit him to retain the initiative. To take it away, to avoid the persistent pattern of reacting to Saddam's every whim and challenge, the new President must forge a policy that anticipates and heads off trouble. Compared with Mr. Bush's, it must promise swifter and firmer punishment, a tighter economic embargo and a diplomatic track with imagination.

HEADLINE: Mr. Florio's Call for 'Real Reform'

 BODY:
To hear New Jersey's Jim Florio tell it, life as a Democratic Governor with a Republican Legislature is just a bowl of cherries. Though the Republicans passed a budget and a tax cut over his veto last year, his State of the State address was a hymn to harmony. Focused on economic development, it proposed little that Republicans found objectionable. But his "first priority" -- "real reform" in campaign funding -- will test both parties. His leadership on this is laudable.
"Last year one-half million people in our state turned away from both political parties to vote for Ross Perot for President," Mr. Florio said, "because they didn't believe that government works for them anymore." Among other things, he continued, there is a "growing perception that government is for sale to the highest bidder." The House has approved a campaign reform bill, and the Senate is working on one, but Mr. Florio declared that neither was "the strong medicine we need." 
 New Jersey puts no limits on how much an individual, a corporation or a labor union may give a candidate for the Legislature. (Contributions to gubernatorial candidates are limited to $1,800 per donor.) A state commission recommended ceilings for legislators three years ago, along with new rules on the allowable uses of the funds raised.
Governor Florio has endorsed those recommendations as a "first step." But the Senate bill's ceilings are far more generous than the commission proposed, or the House adopted, and it's not yet certain that the two chambers can agree to a final bill the Governor can sign.
Given the overwhelming strength of the Republican majorities in both houses, it makes political sense in an election year for Mr. Florio to adopt a spirit of cooperation, at least for now.
But he will serve the people of New Jersey well if he stands firm for a genuine stiffening -- at a minimum, the commission's reforms -- of the lax rules that now govern the state's campaign fund-raising.

HEADLINE: Authoritative Answers on M.I.A.'s

 BODY:
The thorough Senate committee report released yesterday on the fate of Americans missing since the Vietnam War should dispel suspicions of a U.S. Government conspiracy or cover-up.
Should, but probably won't. Word that Henry Kissinger's lawyer was given a last-minute opportunity to propose cosmetic changes in language criticizing the former Secretary of State will damage the report's credibility, even though telling substantive criticisms of Nixon-era officials seem to have survived largely intact. 
 Mr. Kissinger's intrusive intervention is regrettable. More important public issues than his personal reputation are at stake.
The main reason this committee was established, almost 20 years after America's withdrawal from Vietnam, was that many Americans no longer trusted the executive branch's efforts and assurances on the issue of P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s.
To its credit, the Bush Administration granted the committee unprecedented access to official records. So did the Vietnamese Government. And sworn public testimony was taken from a procession of former high American officials.
The public expected authoritative, if not definitive, conclusions. To a large extent, that's what it got, despite tensions between some Republicans who believe captive Americans may still be alive and other committee members who believe that the passage of many years effectively rules out that possibility. The committee majority found no hard evidence to support Republican suspicions; it also uncovered no hard evidence to completely refute them.
The dispute has its roots in the Nixon Administration, which publicly declared that no Americans remained in captivity even though there were more than 100 who were last reported to be alive but remain unaccounted for.
The committee found that efforts by the Nixon Administration and its successors to track down reported sightings of live Americans were not always given suitably high priority. But it found no evidence of a cover-up or official conspiracy.
The committee also reported that Vietnam and Cambodia were now cooperating in the search for further evidence. Vietnam's failure to cooperate has been an impediment to normal diplomatic and economic relations.
Hanoi must be held to its new commitments. But Washington can now prudently go ahead on normalization. There's still time for President Bush to act, redeeming the hope he expressed in his inaugural address four years ago that America could at last overcome the bitterness and divisions of the Vietnam War.
If Mr. Bush won't act, it will be up to Bill Clinton to close the last chapter of the Vietnam War. For bringing that end within reach, the Senate committee deserves the nation's thanks.

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 13

 BODY:
In an effort to forestall a huge new flow of refugees, Haiti's exiled President formally requested today that the United Nations send a large human-rights observer team to the Caribbean nation as the first step in new diplomatic efforts aimed at restoring him to office.
If the presence of as many as 500 United Nations observers is accepted by Haitian military leaders, as expected, officials of the Bush Administration and Clinton transition team hope that word of their arrival, the most significant progress in diplomatic efforts to restore elected democratic government in months, will encourage Haitians not to flee from their country. 
 The deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has several times in recent days urged his countrymen not to take to the seas.
Today, for instance, he said in Creole on the Voice of America: "Until constitutional order is returned to Haiti, I ask all of you to stay home and help re-establish democracy. It hurts me a lot to think about people preparing to risk their lives in flimsy boats. That's not the road to freedom."
His statements are seen as part of the effort to avoid an expected new flow of refugees coinciding with Bill Clinton's inauguration as President next week. During the campaign and at times since, Mr. Clinton has indicated a willingness to establish American screening procedures for Haitian refugees that would not pre-ordain the summary rejection of their requests for asylum.
 
Some Terms of Proposal
 If the Haitian military acquiesces in a settlement, advisers to Father Aristide said today that the President, who gained popularity as a leftist militant, would support the naming of an opposition figure as Prime Minister. And once an observer mission was sent to Haiti, he would call for the lifting an international embargo that has battered the country's perennially frail economy.
A close adviser to Father Aristide, who asked not to be further identified, said the exiled President was also expected to offer concessions on his demands that military leaders be punished for their role in the September 1991 coup that ousted him.
Under the outlines of this emerging agreement, Father Aristide would remain outside Haiti as long as six months after the arrival of the observers. Both he and the military backed out of a similar agreement reached last February.
"Things look extremely positive right now," the adviser to Father Aristide said. "I still have a hard time believing that the army and its supporters will let it happen, but we'll see. I pray it works."
Father Aristide, who was elected President in December 1990 and held office for nine months, remains highly popular among the country's desperately poor majority.
Diplomats said today that they expected Mr. Clinton to reward Father Aristide's cooperation on a settlement with a meeting, at which the new American President would publicly commit himself to working toward the priest's return to office.
Father Aristide's call for a large United Nations team, which was urged on him by both Bush and Clinton aides, comes a week after a Pentagon official visited Haiti to warn the army command not to block international efforts aimed at restoring Father Aristide or preventing a refugee flow.
A United States official involved in the diplomatic efforts said: "Now we have got the O.A.S. and the U.N. working together; we have the Administrations, both the ins and the outs working more or less together, and we even have Aristide and some people with power in Haiti working together. Now it is a question of how fast we can all act by sending in significant numbers of people, and that means negotiating an agreement with the de facto authorities, something which hasn't been done in recent months."
 
Genteel Captivity
 Human rights abuses in the Haitian countryside are rampant, yet a 16-member observer team sent in the fall by the Organization of American States remains confined to the capital, Port-au-Prince, by order of the military-backed civilian administration of Prime Minister Marc L. Bazin.
With the restoration of democracy to Haiti increasingly seen as the only way to avoid flows of desperate boat people to southern Florida, intense pressure has been mounted in recent days by Bush and Clinton officials to get the Haitian adversaries to agree on the outlines of a settlement.
Mr. Clinton, in turn, has come under pressure from Democratic lawmakers to forestall an outpouring of Haitians, which many here in Florida fear might be provoked by the President-elect's campaign statements. In a sign of the seriousness with which a new Haitian influx is regarded, the Florida National Guard was put on alert today to handle any rush here.
Already this year, about 600 Haitians have been picked up at sea by the Coast Guard, and many more say they are awaiting Mr. Clinton's inauguration. It has been estimated that enough crude wooden boats stand at the ready on Haitian shores to carry 100,000 people toward Florida. Since Father Aristide's overthrow, more than 40,000 Haitians have been rescued at sea.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a request by the exiled Haitian president, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, for a United Nations observer team for Haiti misstated the length of his term in office. It was nearly eight months, not nine months. The article also characterized Father Aristide's politics incorrectly. He was a leftist priest who won election.

On Schools and Politics: The Chancellor Has His Say

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:
Tales Out of School Joseph Fernandez's Crusade to Rescue American Education By Joseph A. Fernandez With John Underwood. 278 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $24.95. 
Aside from the stories of his youthful drug use and street-gang rambles, the advance news about "Tales Out of School," by the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, has centered on his purportedly confrontational remarks about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor David N. Dinkins and the members of the New York City Board of Education. Various officials have been prompted by such remarks to wonder whether "Tales Out of School" constitutes Mr. Fernandez's unofficial resignation.
 Yet read in context, the Chancellor's utterances seem not so much resigning as resigned, as if his relation to the board had long since been resolved. He writes as if the board's appointment in July 1991, 18 months after his assumption of the chancellorship on Jan. 1, 1990, came as a catastrophe that placed him beyond meliorating his position.
 He accuses the board of failing to perform its required function of defining a coherent policy, and of crossing "over the line, trying to extend their jurisdiction into administration." Though he mentions calling one board member, Ninfa Segarra, a "political prostitute" because of her "turn-around" on the issue of distributing condoms, he cites his remark only as an example of how fractious his relations with the board had become.
 He concludes: "As for my deteriorated relationship with this particular board, I finally decided to quit worrying about it. You can't gauge your profession or base your life's work on job security. . . . But I will say honestly that I wouldn't have come to New York if it was to work for the board I have now."
 What further distances his remarks from a confrontational tone is that his outlook toward his present situation seems consistent with everything in his past. It's almost as if he were saying that given what happened to him in his youth, he has never had anything to lose by taking risks. After gang fights that could have killed him and after several near overdoses on heroin, nothing seemed all that dangerous.
 Certainly, it was his style to take big risks in his rise to the top of the Dade County Public School System. At least as he tells it, he was never one to play a calculated game of politics. He liked bold strokes and he liked to dominate, a trait he recognizes as going back to his boyhood behavior on the playground. And such a nature seems to have liberated him to develop a broad and imaginative vision of public education.
 All of which makes for a good story, up to a point. "Tales Out of School" is captivating as long as Mr. Fernandez recounts his life. Written with the help of John Underwood, a former columnist for The Miami Herald who has written autobiographies with Ted Williams ("My Turn at Bat") and Paul (Bear) Bryant ("Bear"), Mr. Fernandez's narrative is also clever in the way that it weaves in his developing educational philosophy, which continues to be hopeful for the American public school system despite the terrible battering he believes the shortage of Federal funds has inflicted on it.
 He is particularly inspiring when he describes his reclamation of Central High School in Miami, whose ethnic makeup was about 85 percent black, with the rest white and Hispanic, and all at the lower end of the economic scale. It was here that he developed some of his most innovative programs for rescuing inner-city schools.
 It is only when he generalizes about his operating style as Dade superintendent that his narrative loses its drive and the prose descends into tired cliche. At one point, he manages to switch metaphors at least 10 times, going from horse wrangling ("a principle digs in his heels") to gambling ("all these people take risks") to baseball ("like a pitcher responding to a chattering infield") to cattle herding ("actively prodding it along") to cooking ("keep the fires burning") to child rearing ("nurturing is vital") to military organization ("the cadres don't get the spiritual support") to racing ("far behind") to battle command ("when the soldiers in the field look to the center for assurance"), all within the space of four paragraphs. When Mr. Fernandez reports how he arrived in New York City, he says he "hit the ground running" but "seemed to skip right past the governance problems we had in Miami." After not too much of this, your mind begins to run and your eyes are tempted to skip.
 But then comes the provocative analysis of his present relations with the Board of Education, along with a chilling portrait of the condition of New York City schools. This is in turn folded into an inventory of what Mr. Fernandez feels he has accomplished during his term in office, which then expands into an optimistic vision of the possibilities of public education.
 As some board members have speculated, Mr. Fernandez may possibly have had an agenda in writing "Tales Out of School," to renounce his chancellorship and offer himself as a candidate for Secretary of Education in Washington. But in this unevenly absorbing book, it sounds as if he's simply washing his hands of petty politics. Like some democratic version of Shakespeare's Coriolanus, he's refusing to flatter Jove for the power to thunder and letting his tongue vent what his breast has forged.

RAYTHEON TO SUPPLY PATRIOT MISSILES TO KUWAIT

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The Raytheon Company has received a $327 million contract to supply Patriot missiles to Kuwait, and the military contractor said the deal's value could rise to more than $450 million. The order is for five Patriot fire units and 210 missiles. But support hardware, test equipment and required engineering and logistical services will likely increase the deal's value. Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., recently received a $1.03 billion order from Saudi Arabia for 12 Patriot fire units and 793 missiles.

HEADLINE: Perils of a Senator

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Jan. 13

 BODY:
Although a Federal grand jury has declined to indict Senator Charles S. Robb in an electronic eavesdropping case, the Virginia Democrat's troubles are far from over.
 The jury's decision on Tuesday was a major surprise. Even the Senator had predicted he would be indicted for recordings made of conversations involving his chief political rival, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. Something happened in the late stages of the grand jury's deliberations, but there are only questions, no explanations, of what. 
But soon the surprise and puzzlement over what led the jury to flout the conventional wisdom will wear thin, and Mr. Robb, while no longer burdened by a legal threat, will be left with the hefty political baggage that remains from a long, messy Justice Department investigation.
 The new conventional wisdom is that this baggage will make it very difficult, though not impossible, for him to achieve his announced goal of winning re-election next year to a second term.
 
Prospects for Re-election
 As for his ever regaining his stature as the pre-eminent politician in Virginia and one of the promising moderates among Democrats nationally, perhaps even a Presidential prospect -- well, fairly or unfairly, conventional wisdom ruled those things out almost as soon as the grand jury began its work.
 "Chuck Robb may have a future in Virginia politics -- may have -- but I don't see much future for him nationally ever again," said Robert Holsworth, who keeps an astute eye on Virginia politics from the political science department at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
 Mr. Robb himself sees his re-election efforts as a tough uphill climb.
 "People have been exposed to 18, 19 months of stories and, in many cases, breathless reporting that Robb is about to go down for the last time," Mr. Robb said minutes after learning of the grand jury's exoneration. "If you've been exposed to that, there's got to be the impression that there must be something terribly wrong here."
 There is much in the public record from the inquiry that reflects poorly on the Senator, even if it does not constitute indictable activity, including contentions that he knew more about the eavesdropping than he admitted and even ordered an aide to lie to the press about his role in the incident. There is the inescapable fact that three of his closest aides were convicted in the episode.
 
Possible Testimony by Robb
 There is the prospect that he will be called to testify in the coming trial of the one person the grand jury did indict, Bruce Thompson, who is said to be the initial distributor of a tape recording of Mr. Wilder. And then there is the mother lode of political gossip about Mr. Robb's private life that bubbled up during the investigation, including unsubstantiated assertions that he consorted with drug users and had a dalliance with a Virginia beauty queen who later posed for Playboy.
 Still, the state's political professionals do not count the Senator out. They note that two of his most likely challengers in 1994, Mr. Wilder, who is barred by state law from seeking a second consecutive term as Governor, and Oliver L. North, have their own political baggage to drag around.
Mr. Wilder must contend with a failed Presidential campaign that took him away from the state in the early primaries and angered many Virginians. Mr. North has his own murky legal past from the Iran-Contra affair.
 Daniel S. Alcorn, a Democratic district chairman in northern Virginia, acknowledges that Mr. Robb has been politically wounded by the grand jury investigation. But he predicts Mr. Robb will successfully rebuild his reputation. "People will see that the investigation was politically motivated," he argues.
 Whatever the motivation, in the end the investigation was one of the most confusing in memory.
 The lead prosecutor, Robert W. Wiechering, was stunned by the grand jury's decision. He had been in long discussions with top Justice Department officials in Washington. Lawyers familiar with the case say he had won approval to seek charges against Mr. Robb of conspiring with aides to make public the Wilder tape and then trying to cover up that wrongdoing.
 Then, inexplicably, just before the jury voted, the Justice Department sent down a prosecutor from the Washington office to make a final pitch to the panel. The burden of his message was that the case was an especially serious one, meriting especially serious consideration before a vote, according to lawyers with knowledge of the case.
 
Unanswered Questions
 What happens in a grand jury is secret, so it is not clear whether the outside lawyer was trying to steer the jury toward an indictment or away. But the visit left several questions.
 Why could Mr. Wiechering not have been instructed to make that kind of plea himself? Did top Justice Department officials themselves have last-minute second thoughts? Were they swayed by many assertions by Democrats and Republicans alike that the eavesdropping episode was nothing more than an almost childish political dogfight?
 Did a voluntary second appearance before the jury that Mr. Robb made late last month affect the views of officials in Washington, or the jurors? Did his Washington superiors suddenly lose confidence in Mr. Wiechering?
 They are not talking. Neither is Mr. Wiechering.
 For all the satisfaction he took from the grand jury's vote, even Senator Robb professed puzzlement about this confusing denouement of his case.
 "Normally," he said, "a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich if a prosecutor asks it to."

Short of Power, 8 Aluminum Concerns Cut Output

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 13

 BODY:
Eight aluminum companies in the Pacific Northwest, which produce 40 percent of the nation's supply, said today that they would cut production 25 percent because of an electricity shortage in the region.
The action came after the Bonneville Power Administration, the Federal authority that markets energy from more than 30 hydroelectric dams in the region, notified the producers that on Jan. 16 it would cut power supplies to its 15 largest industrial customers, including 10 aluminum smelters, for six weeks and maybe longer.
 
A Drought and a Cold Snap
 A severe drought, now in its sixth year, has reduced hydroelectric production, and a cold snap, which has increased demand, forced Bonneville to make the cuts. In addition, electricity is less available for import from Canada because frozen rivers have choked the output of hydropower dams there. 
 The producers are Alcoa, the Alumax unit of Amax, Kaiser Aluminum, Northwest Aluminum, Reynolds Metals, Vanalco, the Columbia Aluminum unit of Columbia Ventures and Columbia Falls Aluminum.
"This is a significant and surprising event," said Ken Peterson Jr., president of Columbia Aluminum, which is paring output by 45,000 tons.
Peter Marcus, analyst with Paine Webber in New York, called the cuts "a moderate event" for prices. He said prices were very low, partly because the London Metals Exchange has nearly 1.5 million tons in warehouses.
Alcoa said it was closing one of the five lines of pots where aluminum is smelted, adding that it may lay off up to 75, or 8.5 percent, of its 882 workers at its Wenatchee, Wash., plant.
"It's unlikely we will restart" pot lines soon "because we are not sure if we will have a guaranteed power supply in the fall," said Jack Speers, power manager at Alcoa. Restarting a pot line costs about $1 million, he said.
Alcoa's plant is the only one that receives power from a source other than Bonneville. A subsidiary has a share of the Rocky Reach hydroelectric dam on the Columbia River in eastern Washington, but it is unable to buy more.
"Bonneville is tying up the supply of all economical power in the region," Mr. Speers said. "We can't tap into it."
Alumax said it would cut 209 tons daily, or more than 76,000 tons, out of the 305,000 tons it produced in 1992. Columbia Falls Aluminum said it was cutting output by 30 percent, or 150 tons daily, rather than take a chance that spot-market power might be available later. Northwest Aluminum, which is closely held, said it would cut less than 25 percent but declined to be specific.
 
'A Painful Loss'
 "This is a painful loss to the industries at a time when we are beginning to see the economy rebound," said John Carr, executive director of Direct Service Industries, which negotiates with Bonneville for the eight aluminum companies, as well as three titanium and chemical producers that also are restricted.
The electricity cut runs through Feb. 28 and may be extended. Bonneville had previously interrupted 25 percent of the power to the companies, from Aug. 20 to Dec. 31, because of a drought-caused energy squeeze. But the plants operated at 100 percent because Bonneville was able to buy replacement power on the spot market.
Industry executives here say that Bonneville told them that a utility -- which they said the Federal agency would not identify -- offered energy at 7.3 cents to 8.8 cents a kilowatt- hour. This compares with the 1.7 cents the plants normally pay Bonneville. But it takes 7.5 kilowatt-hours to produce a pound of aluminum, and at this utility's prices, the power costs alone would equal the price the aluminum companies would receive for each pound produced.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SAYS U.S. WILL CONTINUE BAN ON HAITIAN EXODUS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
Saying that he feared a mass exodus of Haitians unless he acted, President-elect Bill Clinton announced today that he would at least temporarily abandon a campaign pledge and would continue the Bush Administration's policy of forcibly returning Haitians who try to emigrate to the United States.
It was Mr. Clinton who helped create the expectation of an exodus from Haiti when he condemned the Bush Administration for a "cruel policy of returning Haitian refugees to a brutal dictatorship without an asylum hearing." 
 Mr. Clinton had promised to give Haitians refuge and make it easier for them to apply for political asylum until democracy is restored in their country. At one point in the campaign he said, "If I were President, I would -- in the absence of clear and compelling evidence that they weren't political refugees -- give them temporary asylum until we restored the elected Government of Haiti."
That promise prompted Haitians to build nearly 1,000 boats that could accommodate as many as 150,000 people, many of whom are poised to set sail in stormy seas in the hopes of arriving on American shores at the moment of Mr. Clinton's inauguration Wednesday.
 
Intercepting Refugees
 But in a bluntly worded taped radio message broadcast this morning directly to Haiti and Haitian communities in the United States, Mr. Clinton said that Haitians who fled by boat would be intercepted and returned to the island. He also emphasized that he would enforce current United States immigration policy, which prevents Haitians escaping poverty -- but not those fleeing political persecution -- from seeking asylum in the United States.
Mr. Clinton's announcement was met with dismay in Haiti and among American refugee groups that have worked closely with the transition team to forge a new appraoch to the problem of boat people. [Page A2.]
"The practice of returning those who flee Haiti by boat will continue, for the time being, after I become President," Mr. Clinton said in the broadcast. "Those who leave Haiti by boat for the United States will be intercepted and returned to Haiti by the U.S. Coast Guard. Leaving by boat is not the route to freedom."
Mr. Clinton stressed that his advisers were now working "with energy and determination to promote agreement among all Haitian parties on a political solution for your nation" and that "progress toward a settlement will improve the human-rights situation for all Haitians."
Mr. Clinton made his remarks after a radio appeal on Monday by the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected President, who was ousted in a military coup two years ago. Father Aristide's plea for Haitians to stay home appeared to have little impact in Haiti.
Explaining his first foreign-policy action at a news conference later in the day in Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton reiterated his tough approach, saying that his goal was to save lives and that his campaign oratory had been sorely misunderstood. He noted that he had repeatedly stated that "people who didn't qualify as refugees still shouldn't be here and that there was a clear and legitimate distinction between political and economic refugees."
He continued, "So, you know, sometimes people hear only half the message."
Arthur C. Helton, Director of the refugee project for the Lawyer's Committee for Human Rights, who has criticized the Bush executive order of May 1992 authorizing the forcible return of potential refugees as illegal, said, "It's very worrisome and it reflects the fear -- even paranoia -- among the Clinton team about an influx of boat people."
 
Policy Called Temporary>
 "Mr. Clinton has aimed very low in trying to achieve any balance in managing the flow of boat people and providing protection to genuine refugees. To the extent the new Clinton Administration relies on the discredited approach of the outgoing Administration, it will be complicit with that violation of law."
Indeed, in the last two weeks, members of Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team have expressed concern that celebrations surrounding Mr. Clinton's inauguration, which will be widely televised, will be marred by news footage of Haitian boat people drowning in stormy waters while trying to make the 600-mile journey to the Florida coast. Mr. Clinton cited a report in recent days, still unconfirmed by the Coast Guard, that nearly 400 Haitian boat people drowned when their boat sank in the Bahamas.
During the eight months before Mr. Bush announced his policy, more than 30,000 Haitians had set sail, and 12,000 were housed in a makeshift refugee center at the American military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. When the base became overcrowded and Mr. Bush began his plan of forcible return, the Coast Guard turned back 5,000 Haitians to their homeland and the number of new boat people dropped dramatically.
Mr. Clinton emphasized today that continuing the Bush policy was only temporary, but he did not say when he would replace it, as his aides have promised, with a broad new executive order that envisions processing applications for refugees in third countries.
 
Support for Aristide
 He left open the possibility that he will continue the inherited policy while the United Nations and the Organization of American States try to negotiate a settlement that would restore the legitimate Government to Haiti.
Mr. Clinton said that he explained his approach last night to Father Aristide, who, he said, supports "the direction we are taking."
During his confirmation hearings for Secretary of State on Wednesday, Warren M. Christopher expressed support for Father Aristide put stopped short of calling for his reinstatement as President.
"There is no question in my mind that because of the election, he has to be part of the solution to this," Mr. Christopher said. "I don't have a precise system worked out in my mind as to how he would be part of the solution, but certainly he cannot be ignored in the matter."
Mr. Christopher said the United Nations and the Organization of American States might need to station human-rights observers inside Haiti to insure that people returned to Haiti are not punished for trying to leave.
Mr. Clinton said today that he would increase the number of immigration officers throughout Haiti to process applications for political asylum inside the country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service is considering setting up operations at five sites on the island, and assigning "upwards of 20 immigration agents" to the island, a number that refugee groups consider woefully inadequate.

HEADLINE: Laws Often Disregarded for Household Workers

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
While President-Elect Clinton promised a Cabinet that looks like America, Zoe Baird, his nominee for Attorney General, apparently behaved a bit too much like America: she hired, in this country illegally, a Peruvian couple as a baby-sitter and driver and she failed to pay the required Social Security taxes.
Accountants and lawyers say the system for reporting income paid to domestic workers is so cumbersome, and the supply of household workers so saturated with illegal aliens, that hundreds of thousands of Americans, and maybe millions, are probably flouting the law. 
 These lawbreakers include not only affluent two-earner couples with full-time help, like Ms. Baird and her husband, but less wealthy Americans who have weekly arrangements with cleaning women or baby-sitters. Experts say they believe that most of these Americans are fully aware they are breaking the law, but not all.
"I'd be willing to bet there are men in very high Government positions who are in exactly the same situation as Zoe Baird, but don't know it because it's their wives who deal with the domestic help," said Patricia McConnell, who writes an accounting and tax newsletter at Bear, Stearns & Company.
 
Exception Was Defeated
 In 1985, when Congress was considering immigration legislation, which made it illegal to hire an undocumented alien, there was talk of a "Beverly Hills exception," exempting people with three or fewer employees.
But the exception was dropped after it was argued that the provision would be unfair to small-business owners, who are subject to many of the same burdens as household employers but who would not have been covered by the exemption. In addition, some members of Congress argued that it might subvert the goal of stopping the flow of people coming to this country illegally in quest of jobs.
The passage of the law did spur some people to find household workers who were in this country legally, and to start paying all the taxes that are due, experts said. But many others chose to ignore the law, and as a practical matter, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has almost never prosecuted people who employ illegal aliens in their homes.
"Only about 3 percent of the employed mothers of children under five use in-home care by a nonrelative, because it's the most expensive form of care, but among those who do, it's very common to hire illegal aliens off the books," said Ellen Galinsky, a co-president of the Families and Work Institute. "I don't think anyone knows exactly how widespread it is."
 
Taxes in All Cases
 To comply with the law, employers must find domestic workers who can legally work in the United States, and they must pay social security taxes and unemployment taxes for any worker paid more than $50 in a three-month period. These taxes are due regardless of whether the employee is in the country legally or illegally.
For those who do not have a social security number, employers are supposed to set up an account for the payments, which come to 15.3 percent of the worker's pay. Half of the payments are made by the employer and half comes form the worker's wages.
"It's not the right thing to do, but I know of a number of cases in which the employer wanted to pay social security, but decided against it because the child-care worker resisted," Ms. Galinsky said. "The real problem is that child care is so poorly paid that when you take money out, there isn't much left."
A Manhattan father who has hired three baby-sitters in six years explained yesterday that although he and his wife, both lawyers, have tried hard to comply with the law, they found it impossible in their last two searches.
 
Avoiding Taxes
 "The first time around, we interviewed 23 people, 18 of whom were illegal, and we hired one who was legal," he said. "When she left, we interviewed 14 people, not one of whom was legal, including the ones sent from the most elite employment agency. This last time, we interviewed 10 people, and offered the job to the one legal person who applied, but she didn't take it, in part, I think, because she wanted an off-the-books job where she'd take home more. So we're back to an illegal person. It worries me, because what we're really doing is avoiding our tax obligation."
Government officials and some accountants stress that however common the practice has become, avoiding taxes is precisely what many household employers are doing. Furthermore, they said, they are cheating their employees out of future social security benefits. And those who hire illegal aliens, many said, could find American workers if they were willing to pay higher wages.
Many working mothers hire illegal aliens as housekeepers or baby-sitters and sponsor them for a "green card," actually, a permanent residency visa that allows the alien to live and work in this country indefinitely.
But the process requires many years before the immigrant is legally allowed to work. And some families find the vagaries of immigration law surprising.
 
'A Crazy System'
 "My wonderful baby-sitter, who was illegal and off the books, wanted me to sponsor her, so I went to a lawyer, who told me that to get a green card for her, I had to sign a letter telling the Labor Department that I was, in effect, breaking the law by employing an illegal alien," said a woman in Washington. "The lawyer said that was okay, because the Labor Department doesn't give the information to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It seems like a crazy system."
After a four-year wait, that woman's baby-sitter got her green card and, as frequently happens, immediately quit for a more lucrative one.
Immigration lawyers say the number of domestic workers applying for permanent residency has dropped in recent years, largely because the process now takes as much as eight years after the Labor Department certifies that there is a shortage of Americans to fill a particular job.
"The immigration law doesn't reflect any sympathy for families that need help, either live-in or by the day, to operate their households," said Frances Berger, a New York immigration lawyer. "The fact that the Labor Department certifies that there are no lawful U.S. workers to do these jobs indicates the need for immigrants."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: President-Elect;
Clinton Selects a Mostly Youthful Group of White House Aides

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 14

 BODY:
Only six days before he becomes President, Bill Clinton today announced a mostly youthful group of White House aides and tapped David C. Wilhelm, his campaign manager, to head the Democratic Party.
In addition to Mr. Wilhelm, a veteran political consultant from Chicago, whose selection must be ratified by the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Clinton singled out two others who would accompany him to the White House: Carol H. Rasco, a longtime adviser in Arkansas on welfare and education, who will be chief domestic policy adviser, and Eli J. Segal, the campaign's chief of staff, who will head an effort to establish a national service program for young people. 
 The biggest surprise was that the deputy chief of staff will be Mark D. Gearan, a former executive director of the Democratic Governor's Association who was a senior campaign aide. Mr. Gearan's role is seen as particularly important because he has worked in Washington for years. The chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, is an Arkansan who is close to the President-elect but lacks Washington experience.
For weeks, Mr. Clinton's aides had said the deputy job would go to Harold M. Ickes, who was the campaign's New York State chairman and Mr. Clinton's manager at the Democratic convention. But Clinton aides said Mr. Ickes asked that he be pulled out of the running after several recently published reports linking two former clients, Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York and Local 100 of the Hotel and Restaurant Workers, to business improprieties. Mr. Ickes has denied knowing of any criminal activity. He did not return phone calls today.
At his last scheduled news conference before leaving for Washington on Saturday, Mr. Clinton found himself already on the defensive over signs that he was backing off several campaign pledges. In his most explicit comments on the matter thus far, Mr. Clinton made clear that a middle-class tax cut was no longer on the table, but suggested that voters cared more about his fundamental philosophy than specific promises.
"I think the American people voted for me because they supported the big things we were running on," he said. "From New Hampshire forward, for reasons that absolutely mystified me, the press thought the most important issue in the race was the middle-class tax cut. I never did meet any voter who thought that."
Mr. Clinton went on to say that he had proposed the tax cut as "an economic stimulus" and "when that seemed to not be necessary any more, I said I still think we need tax fairness."
 
Sought Diversity
 Aides said a major reason Mr. Clinton took so long to announce his staff was that he wanted it to be more diverse than his campaign staff, in which most of his top lieutenants were white men. It was no accident that at today's announcement, most of the women and minorities were placed at the front of the stage behind Mr. Clinton. More than a third of the 59 White House jobs announced thus far have gone to women.
The other appointments were announced by Mr. McLarty. Most of the aides appointed today are in their 30's. Many also had positions with the campaign and then the transition team, and a large number have worked in Washington, some for public policy organizations.
The communications office will be directed by George Stephanopoulos, who was a familiar spokesman for Mr. Clinton during the campaign and the transition. Mr. Stephanopoulos said he would also hold daily press briefings and oversee media strategy. Dee Dee Myers, who was also a familiar spokesman during the campaign, will be press secretary.
Bernard W. Nussbaum, a senior litigation partner in a New York law firm and a former assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, will be White House counsel. Mr. Nussbaum, who met Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, when she was an intern and he was senior counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, advised Mr. Clinton when questions were raised during the campaign about the candidate's involvement with Gennifer Flowers.
 
Delay in Selections
 The White House political apparatus will be run by Rahm Emmanuel, a director of the inaugural events who was the chief fund-raiser for the campaign. He will work closely with Mr. Wilhelm, an old friend from Chicago.
In choosing two men from outside the political confines of Washington, Mr. Clinton is signaling his intention to use his party to reach beyond the Beltway.
Mr. Wilhelm said the party "ought to take the 500,000 people who donated to the party in this general election campaign" and "turn that into five million." He added, "We need to be truly a grass-roots party, truly a party that reaches out into every nook and cranny of this country."
Mr. Clinton also said his longtime Arkansas aide, Craig Smith, would be the Democratic Party's political director.
Mr. Clinton took weeks longer than his immediate predecessors in naming senior staff members, and many Clinton aides have privately expressed concern that the delay will hamper efforts for a quick start in Washington.
 
Relieved to Have a Job
 Though many White House posts are still empty, Clinton aides said they were far from their goal of figuring out how to make good on Mr. Clinton's campaign promise that he would cut the White House staff by 25 percent. Moreover, aides and some Democrats in Congress said they were troubled that hundreds of important sub-Cabinet appointments have yet to be made.
With dozens of appointees on stage, the announcements today seemed more exuberant than when some Cabinet appointments were named. Many staff members, relieved to have finally been given a job, cheered as their colleagues' names were announced.
"We will make the White House a place of team work and free flow of ideas," Mr. Clinton said. "I want the best and most creative advice I can get across the broad range of areas which we must deal."
Others in the White House inner circle will be Bruce Lindsay, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton, who will be in charge of personnel; David Watkins, the campaign's director of operations, will head the office of Administration and Management; Christine Varney, the campaign's counsel, will be Cabinet secretary; John Podesta, a Democratic political consultant, will be staff secretary, and Nancy Hernreich, a longtime executive assistant to Mr. Clinton, will be in charge of appointments and scheduling.
The head of legislative affairs will be Howard Paster, Washington director of a public relations firm, and the head of public liaison will be Alexis Herman, who was chief executive of the Democratic convention.
Margaret A. Williams, a former communications director for the Children's Defense Fund, will be Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff. Vice President-elect Al Gore's chief of staff will be Roy Neel, his longtime top Senate aide.
Other White House appointments announced today were:
Office of the Counsel: Vince Foster, deputy counsel; Ron Klain and Cheryl Mills, assistant counsels.
Office of the First Lady: Melanne Verveer, deputy chief of staff; Lisa Caputo, press secretary; Ann Stock, social secretary, and Patty Solis, scheduling director.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Has Come Up With a New Headache

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
As if dandelions and crabgrass were sprouting through the snow, tax panic is coming three months early this year.
Today is the quarterly deadline for more than 12 million people, about one in 10 taxpaying Americans, to pay estimated taxes on income for the final three months of 1992. 
 Typically, these are people with earnings from businesses, investments and self-employment who are not covered by the withholding system and therefore must estimate and pay their taxes every quarter. Under a new tax law, what had been a routine calculation has become for many a dicey exercise, with more money owed sooner and greater chance for error.
 
Revised in 1991
 Under the old laws, people owing estimated taxes could avoid any penalty by paying a sum equal to their taxes for the previous year -- even if they made substantially more. Accountants called this the safe harbor provision.
Now, this harbor has become as treacherous as the Shetland Islands' rocky coast. Paying the same amount as last year is no longer enough.
Legislators intent on collecting quicker payments on big surges in income, like a generous gain on a stock, decided in November 1991 to change the system.
Most of those whose income rose at least $40,000 last year, to $75,000 or more, and who have had to pay estimated taxes in the last three years, must pay estimated taxes by today. To escape penalties, estimated payments must equal at least 90 percent of total 1992 taxes.
These taxpayers must figure their taxes fairly accurately, possibly without the benefit of all the receipts and paperwork that help in calculating income and deductions. They must cover any uncertainties with overpayments, or run the risk later of penalties from the Internal Revenue Service. Accountants say that faced with this choice, some clients are opting to risk punishment.
"It's aggravating," said Craig Willett, a real estate and computer software investor in Provo, Utah. "I don't understand how the I.R.S. can expect everyone to comply."
Mr. Willett, an accountant himself, decided that the cost and difficulty of complying outweigh the likely risks and plans to pay only as much as he owed last year under the old rules. "I put myself out as a test because I want to advise my clients," he said. His brave message for the I.R.S.: "They can come after me all they want."
The I.R.S. estimates that under the new rules effective with the 1992 tax year, 500,000 taxpayers will have to pay sooner. Millions more have to check to see whether the rules apply to them.
Some business people and professionals accuse lawmakers and the I.R.S. of enacting a tax increase in disguise, shaking billions of dollars from taxpayers intimidated by all the complications.
Some accountants who stand to reap higher earnings from the extra paperwork are still advising their clients they they should not necessarily play by the new rules. They question whether the I.R.S. can figure out how to enforce the new law, or whether the penalties will be greater than the savings in accounting fees.
But Donald Roberts, an I.R.S. spokesman, promises that the agency's enforcement will be certain and swift. "We have all the data right there on the computer," he said. "We're going to notice right away. No guesswork involved, and we'd just send out the penalty notice."
The new rules have been applied since the quarterly payment due on June 15 last year. But today, they will also snare many of the executives, financiers and others who accelerated their bonuses and stock benefits into the end of 1992 to avoid tax increases that are likely under the coming Clinton Administration.
For many in this category, who already know how much they earned, the computations will take only an hour or two of their accountants' time. Their difficulties are of the sort that other taxpayers might well envy.
The headaches will continue indefinitely, though, for the many professionals, freelancers and entrepreneurs -- some rich, some less so -- who are self-employed or own or invest in partnerships and a variety of other businesses. These can involve real estate holdings, law firms, manufacturers, shops or other ventures from corner delicatessens to factories with hundreds of employees.
 
7 Percent Penalty
 Often, these businesses need until March or early April to calculate their own taxes and report to their investors. The accounting treatment of, say, a new piece of machinery can make a substantial difference.
The penalty for underpaying by more than 10 percent under the new law is currently a nondeductible 7 percent interest rate on the amount due. Some business people believe that it's better to risk overpaying, giving the Government an interest-free loan, than to incur the penalties.
Kent Nelson, a painting contractor in Provo, sent the I.R.S. a check for tens of thousands of dollars yesterday. Shunning the example of Mr. Willett, his accountant, he doubled his payment from last year to avoid the chance of suffering extra charges.
"Our income varies in an extreme amount. We have no way of knowing what to do," Mr. Nelson said. Not until April will his tax forms be complete, telling him for sure whether he has avoided penalties or whether he will get a refund.
 
$2.6 Billion in Revenue
 The new tax rules, meant to speed the payment of taxes on sudden jumps in earnings, were written by a House-Senate conference committee. Effective through 1996, they are expected to generate an estimated $2.6 billion to help pay for extended unemployment benefits. An attempt to rewrite the law and reduce taxpayer distress died in Congress last year.
Accountants say that the loudest protests might come in a couple months, when their clients prepare their final returns and discover that they owe penalties on money they earned as much as a year ago.
"The I.R.S. is no longer going to say, 'How much did you earn during the year?' but 'When did you earn it?" said David Lifson, a committee chairman for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. "If it sounds like extortion, perhaps it is."
Several states have considered following the Federal example, Mr. Lifson said, and New York already has.
Jack Porter, the national director of tax practice at the BDO Seidman accounting firm, says that some clients might do better paying penalties than paying his staff $70 to $250 an hour to figure their estimated taxes.
"I try to educate them not to be paranoid about this 7 percent interest charge," he said. But when it comes to enforcement, he added, "The I.R.S. seems to be quite diabolical."

GRAPHIC: Table: "New Tax Rules"
 
Under the new rules, you generally must pay quarterly estimated taxes that equal at least 90 percent of your total tax bill if you meet all these conditions:*
 
Your income, less a few such items as alimony payments, is more than $75,000.
Your income increases by more than $40,000.
You ever had to pay estimated taxes or penalties in the last three years.
 
These figures pertain to joint and individual returns. Married people filing separately have thresholds of a $37,500 income and a $20,000 increase. Others can continue to pay estimated taxes equal to their final tax bill for the last full year.
 
* Estimated taxes cover income from investments, self-employment, partnerships, trusts, bonuses and other sources that are not subject to sufficient withholding. Taxpayers can also avoid penalties if they file final returns by Feb. 1.

HEADLINE: New York City Planners Seek New Uses for Industrial Areas

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
After years of preserving industrial zoning for thousands of acres of land in the futile hope that New York City's manufacturing base could be revived, the city's planners said yesterday that they wanted to open the land for more promising uses.
The proposal by the City Planning Department, is aimed at improving neighborhood services, creating jobs and generating more tax revenues. In many cases, the plan would make it easier to put into productive use land that is now vacant, underused or has only abandoned multistory industrial buildings. 
 For example, the proposal for industrial zones would enable dozens of the huge discount and department stores and supermarkets now found in the suburbs to be established in the city -- especially in poorer neighborhoods that need them the most. The proposal would do this by raising the size limit on stores in some areas zoned for light and medium manufacturing to 100,000 square feet, from a current 10,000 square feet.
 
New Recommendations
 Under current rules, a retailer would need to obtain a zoning variance to build such a store -- a process that can take years.
Some 17,000 to 20,000 acres, or about 10 percent of the land in New York, is now zoned to encourage industrial use, even though employment at industrial companies has fallen to 768,000, from 1.7 million in 1960.
Richard L. Schaffer, director of the Planning Department and chairman of the City Planning Commission, said the department intends to begin writing detailed recommendations within a couple months and to begin a city- and state-mandated environmental-impact study in the spring.
While Mayor David N. Dinkins already is a supporter, the proposals, which arose from an 18-month study by the Planning Department, will also need to be approved by the Planning Commission and the City Council. When it comes to zoning, which can change the value of real estate by thousands if not millions of dollars, any proposed change of this magnitude is sure to generate battling over the rules deciding the fate of each block.
But economists and private urban planners agreed with Dinkins administration officials that the changes are badly needed.
"This is a long-overdue and essential effort to bring New York City's zoning into the 21st century," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. "The study demonstrates that a change in the city's land-use policy offers an untapped opportunity to stimulate economic development and investment, especially in the outer boroughs."
With the proposal seeking to make zoning more flexible and with the city desperate for jobs and modern retail stores, Dinkins administration officials predicted that after much wrangling and inevitable modifications they would prevail.
Mr. Schaffer said he hoped to begin the process of obtaining the commission's and Council's approval by the end of this year. He said the zoning changes could be enacted as early as mid-1994.
"What the study provides is a comprehensive, realistic assessment of the industrial sector and recommends changes in land use and zoning policies that recognize current economic realities," he said. "New York City is no longer the place that produces goods for the rest of the country but one that exports advanced business services and information around the world."
 
59 Areas Examined
 It was Mr. Schaffer who decided in 1991 that the city needed to rethink its industrial zoning and how it could stabilize the industrial sector and stimulate overall economic development. He found an important ally in Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, who took office last May.
The city has been holding the industrially zoned land in the hope that manufacturing and other industrial activities would rebound. But the Planning Department study documented the failure of that policy.
It looked at 59 areas that account for virtually all of the industrial zones in the city and their density of industrial employment density -- or the number of jobs per acre. In 43 of the 59 areas, there were fewer than 30 jobs per acre. By comparison, Manhattan's garment district, the densest area, has 676 jobs per acre, and 63 percent of the city's industrial jobs are within a three-mile radius of Manhattan's central business district, including neighboring parts of Queens and Brooklyn.
"It's difficult to think of an economic scenario under which the kind of manufacturing we once had is going to come back," said Eric Kober, the Planning Department's director of housing and economic planning.
The study, entitled "New Opportunities for a Changing Economy," also identified the high level of crime in some industrial districts and the city's poor freight-transportation system and high taxes as factors that have hurt the industrial sector.
 
Better Truck Routes
 Planning Department officials also jumped into the debate about the priorities for improving the city's transportation system.
They called for improvements in water and rail links, but they clearly believe that the top priority must be improving truck routes so freight can move easily throughout the city. New York's congested trucking network -- the result of obsolete highways that lack clearance for the largest trucks -- is widely considered one of the worst of any big American city's.
The transportation and zoning proposals are aimed at encouraging the growth of such promising enterprises as air cargo, wholesaling and such light manufacturing businesses as food processing and assembling computers and consumer electronics. Many of these industries have been growing in the region in the last decade, but most of that growth has occurred in the suburbs.
Restrictions on some areas now zoned for industrial use might also be eased or eliminated so they could be turned into residential neighborhoods or parks.
The department identified some of these areas -- like Red Hook in Brooklyn, the Harlem River waterfront in the Bronx and northern Hunters Point in Queens -- in its waterfront plan issued last August. In yesterday's report, it said other formerly industrial areas where residential and commercial rezonings might be appropriate include three neighborhoods in Manhattan, SoHo, NoHo and TriBeCa.
 
Expansion Possibilities
 The proposal also calls for easing restrictions in some commercial districts -- including Chinatown and an area between 14th and 34th Streets and Fifth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan -- to create more mixed-residential, commercial and light-industrial areas. Specifically, it calls for easing or eliminating the tight restrictions on wholesalers and light manufacturers.
The changes would make it easier for these businesses to expand their operations in the city rather than move to the suburbs and might generate new uses for obsolete commercial buildings.
Poor and working-class neighborhoods in upper Manhattan, the South Bronx and central Brooklyn could benefit if modern retail stores are developed on their extensive tracts of underused industrially zoned land. But so would such affluent Manhattan neighborhoods as SoHo, NoHo and TriBeCa, which now suffer from a dearth of grocery stores, dry cleaners and other local services.
 
'Room for Retail Growth'
 "What's been happening is New Yorkers have been commuting to the suburbs for shopping," Mr. Schaffer said. "The city, in effect, has been ceding tax dollars, employment and income to the suburbs. We think there's more room for retail growth in the city."
Since the current zoning code was enacted, manufacturing employment in the city, excluding the self-employed, has plunged to 293,448 from 914,000 in 1961, mainly as a result of the fall in production workers. About 60 percent of those remaining are production workers. The remaining 40 percent are professional, clerical and other white-collar jobs.
During the same period, employment in other industrial sectors like transportation, wholesale trade, construction, public utilities and telecommunications dropped, but less precipitously, to 474,423 from 759,700, while employment in services soared to 1.9 million from 1.4 million as a result of growth in financial and business services like advertising and accounting.
In 1974, when the city significantly amended the industrial zoning laws, officials still hoped for a revival in manufacturing and other industrial sectors and believed that one way to encourage it was to limit the competition for land between industrial and other activities.
 
Differing Reactions
 Many operators of small retail shops are expected to oppose the proposed changes. But supermarket chains and mass merchandisers were enthusiastic. "We're definitely looking at more locations, and it would be very helpful to us if there were some changes made," said Charles E. Lotzar Jr., director of special real-estate projects at K Mart Corporation. It opened its first store in the city -- a 147,000-square-foot unit in Fresh Meadows, Queens -- last October.
The proposal may raise fears among economists and business executives who have contended that the city should not give up on the manufacturing sector, which can provide jobs for relatively unskilled people, including many who do not speak English well.
But city planners say other industrial sectors can also provide work for those workers.

A Hot Company With a Low Profile

BYLINE: By Stephanie Strom

 BODY:
THE nation's holiday selling season ends on Dec. 24, but for Little Switzerland, a chain of 19 duty-free shops in the Caribbean and the Bahamas, Christmas doesn't end until Easter.
For most retailers, the peak season starts the day after Thanksgiving and ends late Christmas Eve. It's after that when Little Switzerland's sales start moving up, with the arrival of tourists seeking sun, sand and duty-free Rolexes. 
 "We don't do a big business before Christmas, but between Christmas and Easter, we have a retailer's dream here," said Walter Fischer, the company's president and chief executive.
But despite its double-digit growth over the last five years, Little Switzerland Inc. has had trouble attracting attention on Wall Street since it went public in July 1991 at $12 a share. Although the company has consistently reported earnings increases of between 15 and 20 percent -- it earned $6.7 million on $57.1 million in sales in the last fiscal year -- the stock has generated little of the interest that other small, newly public companies have garnered.
"It's one of those stocks that falls through the cracks," said Harry E. Wells 3d, an analyst at Adams Harkness & Hill in Boston. "It's not a fast-enough grower for the small guys, and the value guys like a dividend, and it doesn't pay one."
In its brief lifetime, the stock has been a minor attraction for some short-sellers who had bet (unsuccessfully) that the shaky financial condition of the jeweler Town & Country Inc., Little Switzerland's former owner, would force it to flood the market with the 2.7 million shares it still holds.
That cloud has lifted, since Town & Country has offered its bondholders a package that includes $39 million worth of preferred shares convertible to its 2.7 million shares of Little Switzerland.
Investors have also been concerned about the retailer's growth prospects once it saturates the Caribbean with its stores. But Mr. Fischer says that for the next five to seven years at least, there is plenty of room to grow in the Caribbean.
The company is also exploring opportunities in Mexico, although there it would not have the exclusive distribution of Rolex watches that it enjoys in the Caribbean. But Little Switzerland is expanding into other merchandise like leather goods, and some analysts salivate over Little Switzerland's prospects should Cuba ever cast off Fidel Castro.
Little Switzerland has maintained profitability despite extraordinary events in previous years. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo rampaged through the Caribbean, curbing tourism, and Eastern Airlines, then the largest carrier to Little Switzerland's turf, had a strike. The war in the Persian Gulf in 1991 curtailed wanderlust worldwide, and the recession damped business last year.
There appears to be no gloomy economic news on the horizon this year. Still, Little Switzerland stock will invariably suffer from the innate cyclicality of the company's market.
"Between now and Easter is when they make the bulk of their money, and the market recognizes it," said Michael B. Exstein, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody. "Then there's a massive hiatus in sales in the summer and fall and everyone sells off."
Except for a slight dip in midsummer, the stock has closed between $11 and $13.25 between late March and Nov. 9, when it rose to $14 before closing at $13.25. Since then, the stock has risen as high as $15.50. Yesterday, it rose $1, to $15.50, in over-the-counter trading.
Analysts say investors have bought the stock recently in hopes of cashing in on Little Switzerland's late Christmas. An expected increase in tourism to the Caribbean also bodes well.
Between January and May, the number of tourists who arrived by cruise ship increased 79.2 percent, to more than 96,000, in Aruba, where Little Switzerland has eight stores. The United States Virgin Islands, where Little Switzerland is based and has seven stores, had a more typical 2.5 percent increase, to 489,000 tourists.

Molson, No. 1 in Canada, Sells Stake to Miller

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Seeking to enhance its position in a sluggish domestic beer market and energize its presence internationally, the Miller Brewing Company has agreed to buy a 20 percent stake in Molson Breweries, Canada's leading maker of beer, for $273 million.
With it, Miller would get the rights to import and distribute Molson, as well as other brands Molson distributes, in the United States. 
 The acquisition was announced yesterday by Miller and Molson, whose joint partners, Molson Companies Ltd. and Foster's Brewing Group, would each retain 40 percent ownership. Miller would also buy Molson's United States offices and plant in Reston, Va., for a price to be determined later. Completion of the deal depends upon the approval of both the United States and Canadian Governments, which is expected.
Officials from Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, said that the deal addressed two major goals during a period in which beer consumption has stalled worldwide.
The first was to expand the company's share of the domestic market in which Miller last year trailed Anheuser-Busch Inc. by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Miller sold about 21 percent of the 190 million barrels of beer consumed in the United States in 1992, compared with the 44 percent sold by Anheuser-Busch, whose leading beers carry the Budweiser label.
Miller also viewed the acquisition of Molson as a major step toward strengthening its ability to move into foreign markets. "It gives us the opportunity to grow," John N. MacDonough, the president and chief operating officer of Miller, based in Milwaukee, said in an interview.
The acquisition would constitute Miller's introduction to the import market, a small but influential industry niche. Last year, Molson had eight-tenths of 1 percent of the American market, which made it the second-leading imported beer behind Heineken. More significantly, the deal puts all of Molson's brands sold in the United States -- including Foster's, Carling, Old Vienna and several other labels -- under Miller's control.
Mr. MacDonough said that the acquisition not only helped define Miller's "North American strategy," which includes a 7.9 percent stake in Mexico's largest beverage company, Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A., it also reflects Miller's plans to seek out joint ventures and partnerships in foreign markets. Currently Miller markets beer in Britain, Ireland, China and Canada.
 
Bid to Lift Molson's U.S. Share
 The deal would give Molson, which dominates the Canadian market with slightly more than 50 percent of that market, a chance to increase its presence in the United States. With most of its American sales in the Northeast and parts of other states along the Canadian border, Molson would now have access to the entire United States market through the imposing force of Miller's advertising, marketing and distribution apparatus. The Canadian company would also gain royalties from Miller, based on sales.
"There are enormous pluses for us," Marshall Cohen, the president and chief executive of Molson, said in a telephone interview from Toronto. "We have always eyed the U.S. market -- it has been the world's biggest for a long time. But we have never been a big-time player. This gives us the opportunity to access it in a big way, not just in the import market, but to compete in the main market."
It was initially unclear whether the deal might be affected by recent trade disputes between American and Canadian brewers. In a clash over pricing in Ontario, the United States in July imposed a $3-a-case import tax on beer imported from that province. Canadians retaliated with similar duties on American beer entering the province, which accounts for a third of all Canadian beer sales.
Washington has rejected a Canadian offer to settle through binding arbitration. It is one of many trade conflicts left for the incoming Clinton Administration to resolve.

Bond Prices Up on Economic Data

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The tug of war continued in the bond market yesterday as investors and traders tried to resolve whether the news of moderate growth should push prices higher or whether concerns about the Clinton Administration's ability to cut the Federal budget deficit and restrain fiscal stimulus should push them lower.
The battle has been going on since the beginning of the year. So far, it has jerked the yield on the 30-year bond down to a low of 7.32 percent and up to a high of 7.47 percent. 
 "The market has a bullish bias but a lingering fear of the Clinton program," James Fralick, principal senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said. "And that is what is moving the market back and forth."
The slower economy tugged harder yesterday as prices of bonds and notes rose and yields fell. The discount rates on Treasury bills fell. The price of the 30-year bond rose 13/32 point and the yield fell to 7.39 percent, down from 7.43 percent Wednesday. The 6.375 percent seven-year bond that the Treasury auctioned Wednesday was up 14/32 to yield 6.26 percent, which was down from 6.34 percent at the close of trading Wednesday and from 6.41 percent, the average yield at the auction.
 
 
Economic Reports
 Several economic reports yesterday added to the belief that that the economy is growing at a slower pace than the end of last year, which is positive news for the bond market.
While retail jumped 1.2 percent in December, the rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in November was revised to a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent. Initial jobless claims jumped 52,000 in the week ending Jan. 2 to 343,000. It was the largest weekly increase in five months. This offset the strong report of last week, when initial jobless claims dropped 40,000.
In addition, prices at the producer level rose just two-tenths of 1 percent in December and were up only 1.6 percent for all of 1992.
Mr. Fralick said that this and other data was leading him to conclude that the economy may only grow at a 2.5 percent rate in the first quarter, down from 3.4 percent in the third quarter of last year and an expected 3 percent in the last three months of the year.
But the deficit is still in the background and already helped pull the market down at the end of last week. And as the inauguration approaches and stories begin to leak out about the Clinton economic program, concern will grow and investors and traders may switch their tune and tug prices lower.
Already, Mr. Clinton has said that he cannot cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term, because new projections show it rising to as high as $400 billion by 1996 if no action is taken.
In addition, if the economy does slow to a pace below 3 percent in the beginning of this year, the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress may decide that spending and tax cuts to stimulate the economy -- beyond what is originally proposed by the new president -- are needed.
"We really need to hear from Clinton here," Mr. Fralick said.
 
Corporate Bonds
 It was another big day in the corporate bond market with about $4.4 billion of new issues. But despite the billions of new issues that have been sold in the last two weeks, the market seems to be holding up well.
The sales yesterday were lead by Hanson P.L.C., a British industrial conglomerate making its first foray into the American corporate bond market, and by Hydro-Quebec, the utility that supplies electric power in the Province of Quebec. Both were Yankee issues, which are securities denominated in dollars and sold in the United States for foreign governments, institutions or corporations.
Both issues were Yankee records according to the underwriters. The $1.25 billion Hanson issue, which included $500 million in three-year bonds and $750 million in 10-year bonds, was the largest issue by a foreign corporation. The First Boston Corporation was the lead manager.
The $1.5 billion Hydro-Quebec issue, which included $500 million of 10-year bonds and $1 billion of 20-year bonds, was the largest foreign sovereign issue. The lead underwriter was Merrill Lynch.
The 5.5 percent three-year Hanson bonds were priced to the public at 99.749 to yield 5.592 percent, which was 70 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the three-year Treasury note. The 7.375 percent 10-year bonds were priced at 99.468 to yield 7.451 percent, 80 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.
The 7.375 10-year Hydro-Quebec notes were priced at par to yield 7.375 percent, or 75 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note. The 8 percent 20-year notes were priced to the public at 99.486 to yield 8.052 percent, 65 basis points over the 30-year Treasury bond.
Prices of airline bonds were knocked lower when Standard & Poor's Corporation said it might lower the credit ratings of the country's three biggest airlines. The three airlines are American, United and Delta. American and Delta are rated BBB, while United is BBB-. A downgrade for United would push it into the non-investment grade, or junk-bond category.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Some Gains, Strengthened by U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly higher on world currency markets yesterday, falling first on slightly weaker economic news, then recovering on the strength of higher United States bonds.
Gold prices fell. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery settled at $327.30 an ounce, off 20 cents from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank quoted gold at a late bid price of $327.45, off 45 cents an ounce. 
 The dollar slipped early in the day after the Government reported that first-time claims for unemployment benefits climbed 52,000 in the last week of the year, to 343,000.
 
Jobless Volatility
 Analysts quickly discounted the increase because jobless claims numbers are notoriously volatile during holidays. But the dollar initially traded down on the news, said Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services at Bank Brussels Lambert, in New York. The dollar generally trades lower on bad economic news, because that augurs for lower interest rates and ultimately a less attractive dollar for investors.
The foreign-currency market largely ignored a report that showed a 1.2 percent growth in December retail sales and another report that showed producer prices up a slim two-tenths of 1 percent in December and 1.6 percent for the year.
Once bonds responded positively to the data, Mr. Hodge said, the dollar recovered. "If we can get a better tone for the U.S. asset market, then the dollar will go up," he said. "When both the stock and bond markets are selling off, there's an inclination to sell the dollar, too."
 
Pound Dip
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.65 yen, down 0.22 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 125.70 yen. It finished at 125.85 yen in New York, up from 125.65 yen Wednesday.
The pound fell to $1.5380, from $1.5395 late Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.5380 to buy 1, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.5485.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6245 German marks, up from 1.6235; 1.4850 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.50375 French francs, down from 5.5045; 1,504 Italian lire, down from 1,506.5, and 1.27925 Canadian dollars, unchanged.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Advance 1.2%; Initial Jobless Claims Jump

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
In a mixed report that nonetheless confirmed banner holiday merchandising and continuing economic growth, retail sales climbed 1.2 percent in December to stand 8 percent above levels a year earlier, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Automobiles and other durable goods jumped 2.5 percent from November levels while nondurables gained a modest four-tenths of 1 percent. 
 The upbeat data on retail sales, which account for one-third of economic activity, was regarded by analysts as more evidence that the expansion now has solid footing. Since sales are outpacing income growth, however, many expect the consumer will be forced to cut back in coming months.
"The momentum is still quite extraordinary," Laurence H. Meyer, head of a St. Louis consulting firm that bears his name, said. "But retrenchment is inevitable," he added, expressing the hope that the gap can be filled by inventory rebuilding and other activity, perhaps home building.
And another report, the Labor Department's weekly tabulation of first-time claims for unemployment benefits disclosed a big jump of 52,000 for the week ended Jan. 2. The increase more than wiped out the preceding week's 40,000 decline.
The jobless claims figures are always interpreted cautiously, but analysts said there was particular reason to do so in light of back-to-back holiday weeks in which many factors were at work, including closed claims offices and a reluctance of some employers to dismiss workers at this time of year.
Other Government data today showed that inflation at the producer level rose over all by just two-tenths of 1 percent last month and by three-tenths of 1 percent when the erratic food and energy components are excluded. This was slightly more than expected but caused little anxiety.
Credit-card issuers have reported gains in volume of 20 percent and more for the 1992 holiday season.
Retailers rang up a total of $166.8 billion in sales last month, aided by aggressive automobile promotions that included a contest between the Ford Motor Company and the Honda Motor Company of Japan for the year's best-selling car.
Disregarding the automotive sector, the retail sales gain was halved, to six-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department's report showed.
 
 
Downward Revision
 Analysts also noted a substantial downward revision in retail sales for November -- which reversed what was initially thought to have been a four-tenths of 1 percent gain -- to a five-tenths of 1 percent decline.
This lowered the base for the December results, causing the 1.2 percent gain to look stronger than it was.
But analysts insisted this was not at odds with the belief that holiday sales were exceptionally strong this year, pointing out that merchants generally make their comparisons on a year-to-year basis, not from month to month.
By this measure, according to historic figures supplied by Ronald Piencykoski of the Commerce Department, the results were impressive indeed. For general merchandise, a proxy for gift-giving activity, December 1992 sales were 10.3 percent ahead of the December 1991 level and were the best since a 13.5 percent jump in 1977 when inflation was running twice as high.
The sales figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences but not for price changes.
Gains in general merchandise were 2.4 percent in December 1991, two-tenths of 1 percent in December 1990, 6.5 percent in December 1989, 5.6 percent in December 1988 and 9.2 percent in December 1987 -- the year of the stock market crash.
 
 
Big Profits Seen
 "The best part was that retailers didn't have to cut prices, plus the fact that they didn't do much hiring," Mr. Piencykoski said of the season just concluded. This, he added, implies profits that could be "unbelievable."
And even with the revision, November sales were 8.6 percent ahead of November 1991, the best performance since 1984, the figures also showed.
Although business was not quite a boom, considering 3 percent inflation over the last year, "these are strong numbers," said Michael P. Daly, economist for the Cigna Corporation, the Hartford-based insurer. In recent months "we've shaken off the notion that the consumer is going to tighten his belt forever," he added.
In durable goods, accounting for 37 percent of the total, there were hefty 3.2 percent gains for both automotive dealers and for those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes. Merchants in furniture and other equipment for the home posted a three-tenths of 1 percent sales decline from November.
The modest gain in nondurables was aided by increases of 1.4 percent at drug and proprietary stores, eight-tenths of 1 percent at food stores and four-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars. These were partly offset by decline of six-tenths of 1 percent each for general merchandise and for gasoline service stations and a two-tenths of 1 percent decline at stores selling apparel and accessories.
About half the revision for November resulted from automobile sales that were lower than first estimated, the Commerce Department said.
For 1992 as a whole, retail sales advanced 5.1 percent, to $1.94 trillion. Excluding the automotive sector, the year's gain was 4.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Donations To Neediest Give Value To Holiday

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
It was 2:30 A.M. on Jan. 1. After hours of cheering and hugging and feasting and toasting, the guests had finally left Natalie Manzino's home in Brooklyn. She sat down to enjoy the silence and wondered whether there was a more personal and meaningful way to usher in the New Year.
She decided that she wanted to highlight how lucky she felt to have two loving sons, close friends and a secure job. Her first post-party act of 1993, she resolved, would be to remember less fortunate people in New York City by writing a check to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 "Although I've had my share of problems, I can quickly put them in perspective as I think about the ever-increasing problems of poverty, homelessness, disease and drugs," Ms. Manzino wrote in a letter to the fund that she enclosed with her $50 contribution.
As they tear the December page off their calendars, many people customarily reflect on their lives and make promises to themselves about the coming year. But some also focus on how they can improve their society. This year, as the recession clings to the New York region, many contributors have concluded that one answer is to assist the Neediest Cases.
 
A New Year's Donation
 "As I write this check on the final day of 1992, I fervently wish that the need for so much help will be alleviated in the coming year and that those in trouble now will find peace and relief," Linda Ward Beech of Manhattan wrote. She sent $200 to the fund.
Emmanuel Zorbas of Manhattan gave $100 with a note that began with the greeting "Happy New Year!" surrounded by a heart. "This is the first check I am writing this year and it is a joy to send it to you!" he wrote.
Beatrice Schultz of Manhattan expressed similar sentiments in a letter that she enclosed with her $18 donation. "I can think of no better way to start the year than to contribute to your fund," she wrote.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund is in its 81st annual campaign amid an economic slump that has heaped added burdens upon charities. Many are trying to aid growing numbers of newly unemployed while also providing food, shelter, clothing and health care to countless others.
 
47 Years of Donations
 The Times pays the expense of the Neediest Cases appeal, so all donations go directly to the seven charities linked to the fund. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
Beata M. Newman of Manhattan sent $30 with a note that harked back to her previous support of the Neediest Cases. "The old year cannot end," she wrote, "without some donation going to your fund -- some years larger, some smaller, but always there. Thank you!"
And for the 47th time in a row, Jim Herrmann of Queens wrote his first check of the year -- for $100 -- to the fund. The first donation in this streak was made in honor of his daughter, Linda, who was born on New Year's Day.
"She has made her own contributions for many years and this year my family is very grateful for her speedy recovery from surgery," Mr. Herrmann said. "We have doubled our gift this year to show that we appreciate your efforts."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- Middle East;
Pursuit of Peace In Troubled Lands

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan, 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
If only because Saddam Hussein refuses to just go away, President-elect Clinton may find himself dealing more immediately and more deeply than he would have liked with fallout from the Persian Gulf war. 
 Much may depend on how far Mr. Hussein thinks he can push the relatively young and inexperienced new President. In this regard, the Iraqi leader might keep in mind that Mr. Clinton's role model is John F. Kennedy, who felt he had to prove his mettle by pushing back hard when challenged by Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, more than three decades ago in the Cuban missile crisis.
Mr. Clinton warns the Iraqi against underestimating him. In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, he said he "would not rule out anything," even renewal of the ground war against Iraq, to enforce United Nations resolutions.
But as dangerous as Mr. Hussein is, the Persian Gulf is not likely to be the new President's most complicated Middle East concern. That distinction falls to the Middle East peace talks. As much as Mr. Clinton might prefer to concentrate initially on domestic issues, Arabs and Israelis alike are already calling on him to keep the sputtering negotiations from stalling completely, a task that will test his capacity for toughness and cajolery.
 
Will the Palestinians Show Up?
 The talks are expected to resume in Washington in a few weeks, a Bush Administration legacy that Mr. Clinton has promised to continue and enhance. But it is far from clear that all the participants will show up, conspicuously the Palestinian team.
While it is hardly the Palestinians' first boycott threat, they may mean it this time. The delegation feels itself hopelessly undermined by Israel's recent expulsion of more than 400 hard-core fundamentalists from the occupied territories. Even before the deportations, the mood against going back to Washington was running high in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At this point, many Palestinians could not care less that they themselves would arguably be the big losers by staying home.
So one question is whether Mr. Clinton will have to gallop to the rescue. And if so, how? It is not as though he lacks for foreign-policy distractions -- in Somalia, Bosnia and even elsewhere in the Middle East, where radical Islam is spreading and regimes like Syria, Iran and Iraq are developing nuclear-weapons programs.
Still, this corner of the globe hates nothing more than being pushed off center stage, even by starving Somalians and freezing Bosnians. The incoming President will find the Middle East impossible to ignore, although he may also have to work extra hard to establish his credibility.
Many Arabs are wary of him because of his strong pro-Israel statements during the campaign. Yet some Israelis and American Jews are also skittish because important members of the Clinton foreign-policy team -- notably the designated Secretary of State, Warren M. Christopher -- harken back to the Carter Administration. Even though Jimmy Carter brokered one of the most significant achievements in Israeli history, the peace treaty with Egypt, some in Israel still view him and anyone associated with him as unfriendly.

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
In Europe, President Clinton will immediately face the urgent need for two decisions: What to do about the continued fighting in the Balkans, and how to rescue a critically endangered accord on world trade that is the best hope for respite from a spreading global recession.
The Bush Administration left the problem of the Balkans to the Europeans, who have demonstrated that they are unable to take effective measures and passed the buck to the United Nations. 
 United Nations and European Community negotiators succeeded last week in getting Serbian agreement to a plan to carve up Bosnia and Herzegovina. If, like all previous plans, it fails and the war continues in Bosnia, Mr. Clinton will have to decide whether the United States should become militarily or otherwise involved in the Balkans.
Mr. Clinton has given vague hints that he would take a tougher attitude than Mr. Bush to the Serbs' "ethnic cleansing" campaign in which Bosnian Muslims have been forcibly displaced from their homes and even killed, but the President-elect also seems to be against the idea of committing American ground troops to stop it.
"There may be some things we can do militarily, short of the introduction of a large ground force, that would change the dynamics," Mr. Clinton said in an interview this week. "I don't want to rule any of those things out."
 
Danger of Ethnic Conflicts
 How quickly and decisively he acts is important for two reasons. Ethnic conflicts could break out in many parts of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union if the world community does not soon develop an effective deterrent against them, as Mr. Clinton himself said after the election.
Europe, most of whose political leaders have been in office for many years, is disunited and dispirited by the consequences of spreading recession, and seems ready to be receptive to clear leadership from Washington. It may not seem like America's problem, but unless Mr. Clinton gives clear signals, instability could continue to spread and create bigger problems that will end up in his lap later.
The negotiations on the global trade accord, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dragged on throughout the Bush Administration, with desultory spats between the United States and Europe on agricultural subsidies. It could still be derailed because President Francois Mitterrand of France fears resistance from French farmers to cuts demanded by the Americans and accepted by France's European partners.
If Mr. Clinton, who has occasionally sent protectionist signals to Europe in his campaign speeches, also demands a renegotiation of the accord, it could quickly die and lead to a series of trade wars between the United States and the European Community.

HEADLINE: The Stampede From a Tax Cut

 BODY:
The rush of the Democrats away from the middle-class tax cut is beginning to look like one of those wildebeest migrations on a National Geographic special. But maybe the herd is moving in the right direction, provided President-elect Clinton is clear about his economic and political destinations.
The movement of the Congressional Democrats and his own budget appointees is a recognition that as a candidate, Mr. Clinton made promises he knew he couldn't keep. He pledged to spend more than $200 billion on infrastructure and training, cut the deficit in half and reduce taxes on the middle class -- without gutting a major Federal program. 
 So which pledge should Mr. Clinton keep?
Leon Panetta, the President-elect's choice for budget director, gave a wise answer during his confirmation hearings. He called for preserving the keys to long-term growth -- deficit reduction and public investment. He also called for abandonment of the middle-class tax cut. That may prove wise, but someone has to say: "Not so fast there. Make a better case."
If Bill Clinton stands for anything, it is a redressing of "soak the poor" tax and income-distribution policies during the Reagan and Bush years. He has to search for a middle course that honors his commitment while bowing to changing economic realities.
Even his most ardent supporters must be aware that he is a man who bears constant watching on questions of tax equity. As Arkansas's longest-serving Governor he drove up consumer taxes to preserve tax breaks for the timber, agriculture and oil and gas interests.
As President, if Mr. Clinton wants the name of "progressive," he's got to earn it. That means first squeezing every available dollar from income taxes on the affluent and on foreign corporations and hunting down bigger defense savings than Les Aspin, the Secretary-designate, says are possible. Only then should Mr. Clinton address the question of where and how to increase either income or consumption taxes on the people who got battered over the last 12 years.
The pressure is already mounting for him to dissolve the Reagan-Bush deficit using the Perot solution -- a 50-cent gasoline tax. That would work all right, but Mr. Clinton himself questioned the fairness of gasoline taxes at his Little Rock economic conference. If Democrats don't stand for fairness, who needs them?
Gasoline taxes have doubled since 1982, and in the long run they have to go higher for sound budgetary and environmental reasons. But as a matter of equity, they need to be calibrated as part of a broad-based revenue program.
Here's one of many possible approaches that a creative, progressive President could follow. Start with the fact that Mr. Clinton faces deficits of about $350 billion even before he spends a dime on all the programs he promised voters. Even so, he could raise large sums from several sources.
Steeper defense cuts might generate $25 billion or more per year. An additional $40 billion could be achieved by raising tax rates and limiting tax deductions for the rich, thereby righting the unbalanced cuts during the 1980's. Fully taxing Social Security benefits to high-income families would no doubt cause a big political fight, but it is one a determined President could win, yielding tens of billions more.
Should he achieve all of that, Mr. Clinton could then address the question of taxing the middle class -- including whether he wants a politically symbolic middle-class income tax cut offset by an increase in gasoline or other energy taxes.
Such a program could preserve his credibility on taxes while making visible progress on both the deficit and social programs. It would be a reassuring achievement for the economy and the political system, not to mention the President at its helm.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- Ex-Soviet Lands;
Nervousness In the Kremlin

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
Bill Clinton is in effect the first "post-Communist" American President, who will deal with Russia and the other former Soviet republics as independent states from the outset of his Administration.
The prospect has caused some apprehension in Moscow. In the Bush Administration, Russia enjoyed a distinct primacy among other former republics and was treated as the successor to the Soviet Union in arms controls and other areas. It was evidently for this reason that President Boris N. Yeltsin pushed to sign the latest strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start II, while Mr. Bush was still in charge. Mr. Yeltsin has also asked for a quick meeting with the new President to maintain that special relationship. 
 For that same reason that Russians are loathe to lose Mr. Bush, Ukraine is not sad to see the Republicans go. In most of the other new states, leaders do not see either a large plus or minus from a Clinton Administration.
Some Russian commentators have speculated that the new Administration is likely to keep the former Soviet states on a back burner for several months, while it sorts out its agenda, and after that might not show the same enthusiasm for East-West relations as did predecessors who skirmished in the cold war.
 
Attention and Dollars
 But whatever his inherited perceptions of Russia and the other new states, they are certain to make potent claims on his Administration. Even without new ethnic battles and political upheavals, the tumultuous transition of the former Communist world will demand constant attention and reaction.
Mr. Clinton has given relatively few signals on his attitudes and intentions. But those he has given suggest he will give the region as much attention as the Bush Administration, and perhaps more dollars.
He has declared that he will actively support the march to democracy, and that he expects to approach the Group of Seven, the major industrial nations, with ideas for more aid.
Whether Mr. Clinton remains as Russia-centered as his predecessors is another question. The very size and power of Russia, the scope of its debts, its problems, its military might, will ensure that Moscow retains the bulk of his concern. But Ukraine in particular is demanding increased attention as it takes up ratification of the Start I treaty and intensifies its demands for compensation and support, and other republics are likely to become more assertive.

HEADLINE: Dump Hussein

BYLINE: By Richard H. Ullman; Richard H. Ullman is professor of international affairs at Princeton University. 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
So the coalition's bombers are at it again. The measured strikes by the U.S., France and Britain at air defense targets in southern Iraq should have been no surprise to anyone, least of all Saddam Hussein.
It would be surprising, however, if the attacks achieved the stated goal of persuading Saddam Hussein to stop attempting to undermine the territorial and military terms imposed by the victors in the Persian Gulf war. For him, the benefits of showing the Arab world he can still thumb his nose at the West outweigh the costs of losing a few radar and missile sites.
Soon -- within a few months, at best -- Mr. Hussein will resume his nibbling. Then the allies, including the new team in Washington, will respond, as they must, with air strikes against targets that he values more. Those responses are unlikely to be decisive, and the round of move and countermove will continue.
Saddam Hussein and the coalition are locked in a ritual dance from which there is no easy exit. The coalition will thus pay a price for failing to press the 1991 war to the point of toppling him. But at that time carrying the ground war into Baghdad's streets seemed likely to cost too many coalition and Iraqi lives and to be unnecessary. Surely, it was assumed, the Iraqi armed forces, with critical help from Washington, would purge the leader who had brought them so catastrophic a defeat. That calculation did not reckon with Mr. Hussein's ability to coerce continued loyalty from an inner circle ruthless enough to suppress opposition.
The means of persuasion at the coalition's disposal today are far fewer than they were two years ago. Renewing the ground war is not among them. Nor need it be: the available instruments are sufficient to get two clear messages across.
The first message is for the Iraqi military establishment. Deprived of modern air defenses, its forces are acutely vulnerable to air attack. It should understand that the strikes will continue, and be more and more costly, until the nibbling stops.
The second message is the same, but it is for the Iraqi people. The coalition will not attack them directly. Nor does it want to attack military targets in their midst. But the Iraqis should realize that the comfortable life they enjoyed before 1990 will be impossible so long as Saddam Hussein continues his provocations. That means maintaining the blockade, at least to the point where only essential medical supplies and foods can enter Iraq. It means continuing the embargo on oil sales and thus denying Iraq the money needed to import anything of value. For middle- and upper-class Iraqis, it means no travel abroad.
Such responses should lead the Iraqi military and people to realize that time is not on Saddam Hussein's side. Obviously, the coalition cannot stop all embargo- and blockade-busting. But sufficient pressure can be maintained for a very long time, particularly if substantial oil sales are prevented.
Iraqis must realize that Mr. Hussein has reduced Iraq to the status of marginal actor in the Middle East; by continuing to exert steady military, political and economic pressure, the coalition can insure that it will remain one. Mr. Hussein's posturing in the prison he has made of his country should not prevent the Clinton Administration and its allies from focusing on the issue that will most affect the Middle East's future stability: the continuing effort to bring about peace between Israel and its neighbors.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- Japan and East Asia;
A Rising Sun; Crises-in-Waiting

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
For all of what Bush Administration officials describe as their foreign policy successes elsewhere, the concede that they are leaving Mr. Clinton with an overarching problem in Asia: a Japan policy that is in disarray, with few fresh ideas about how to deal with America's biggest economic competitor.
The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil. And the Japanese fear a backlash that will lead to unilateral American action to restrict Japanese imports, poisoning early relations with the new Administration. Lurking beneath the surface is resentment at the failure of the Bush Administration to focus on Japanese concerns; as Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d spent more time visiting Ulan Bator than Tokyo. 
 Before the election, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that "we really do not have a good, coherent policy toward Japan that will lead us to open markets and give us enough respect in their country." But he has not explained how he thinks the United States should become re-engaged in the country or the region, beyond his domestic goals for enhancing competitiveness.
 
Early Challenges
 Among Mr. Clinton's early challenges will be how to promote a greater presence of American manufacturing and services in Japan -- without looking like he is creating jobs for Japanese instead of Americans -- and how to replace the Bush Administration's fizzled effort to remove "structural impediments" to trade between the two countries.
Japanese officials are now publicly saying the Bush Administration's initiative lost credibility because the United States never followed through on many of its own commitments to economic reform, the quid pro quo for changes in Japan. But the Japanese, one senior American official here noted recently, have failed to come up with their own initiatives to greet Mr. Clinton. "They are going to Washington with even fewer new ideas than we have," he said.
Elsewhere in Asia, Mr. Clinton faces two crises-in-waiting: Cambodia and North Korea. With the Khmer Rouge unwilling to take part in the elections scheduled for later this year, Mr. Clinton may soon have to decide whether the new American role in enforcing United Nations resolutions extends to a new involvement in Indochina. Continued evidence that North Korea may be developing nuclear arms likely poses the largest threat to peace in the region, and will almost certainly slow any effort to reduce American military presence in the Pacific. Mr. Clinton will also face hard decisions on future relations with Vietnam.
But the most delicate problem for Mr. Clinton may be finding the right security role for the Japanese -- as a member of the United Nations Security Council, as United Nations peacekeepers and as a nation once again able to exercise power of a noneconomic nature -- in a way that will not reawaken fears elsewhere in Asia.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- China;
Beijing Awaits Decision on Trade

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
America's relations with China for years to come may be determined by Mr. Clinton's handling of a single issue in the next six months: extension of "most-favored-nation" trading status for China.
Mr. Clinton suggested in the campaign that he wanted to add human rights conditions to any extension of this status, which guarantees the low tariffs that are applied to virtually all of the United States' trading partners. If Mr. Clinton decides to impose tough conditions that Beijing feels it cannot meet, relations could deteriorate precipitously. 
 A secondary issue is whether Mr. Clinton will press ahead with plans for the establishment of a proposed Radio Free Asia to broadcast to China and other countries. The Communist leaders in Beijing would regard this as an attempt to subvert their rule and probably would react harshly.
With these matters at stake, Chinese-American relations are widely seen as at a crossroads. But in the past few months, both sides seemed to peer over the abyss and then back away from their more confrontational statements.
 
Help From Bush
 Mr. Clinton said in late December that he was "very hopeful that progress can be made" in negotiations with China. President Bush has also helped Mr. Clinton out by resolving some longstanding problems: he sent Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin to Beijing in December, ending a freeze on high-level visits by United States officials, and he released for delivery military equipment that Beijing had paid for but that had been held abeyance since Chinese Army troops attacked pro-democracy protesters in June 1989.
China has also been conciliatory. It scarcely reacted to the United States sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan, and it responded to Mr. Clinton's election by announcing a huge purchase of American wheat.
Still, many problems linger on the horizon.
Unconfirmed satellite evidence suggests that China may have secretly delivered M-11 missiles to Pakistan last November, despite Beijing's pledges not to. And the United States' trade deficit with China is second only to Japan's and is growing rapidly.
Further human rights abuses are possible as Chinese dissidents grow bolder about challenging the Communist Government. And China's 88-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, is frail and his death is certain to provoke far-reaching uncertainties about China's future.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- The Americas;
Haiti, Cuba And Free Trade

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
The Clinton Administration will need a delicate touch in handling the intricate economic issues surrounding the consolidation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and the expected expansion of trade arrangements to other countries in the region. 
 And although Mr. Clinton has indicated that he will seek to make economics the basis of more and more foreign policy thinking, experts in the regional affairs expect that two island neighbors, Haiti and Cuba, could present the new Administration with some of its stickiest political crises.
With the new trade agreement, Mr. Clinton must find a way to reach new pacts with Mexico that will require enforcement of minimal standards of working conditions and environmental protection, without which, many complain, American labor and industry will face unfair competition. Although Mr. Clinton has already met with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, extracting new concessions from Mexico without causing the complex knot of the trade agreement to unravel will be a difficult trick.
In Haiti, which has suffered perennial unrest since the downfall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986, the Clinton Administration must find a way to restore democratic order to a country as deeply divided as any along class lines.
 
Haitian Refugees Still to Be Returned
 One of the reasons for doing so is to stop the tide of refugees fleeing to the United States from Haiti, an issue that came into sharp relief today when Mr. Clinton announced that he plans to temporarily continue the Bush policy of repatriating boat people picked up at sea. Thus Mr. Clinton, who criticized the Bush policy during the campaign, decided that he needed to maintain the policy to block a new exodus.
Clinton aides have been taking part in diplomatic efforts to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a military coup in September 1991.
Father Aristide's opponents in the army and the nation's tiny economic elite, meanwhile, have shown no signs of willingness to relinquish their control over the country's affairs. Any failure to bring these two distant sides together will probably further increase the prospects of mass emigration.
In Cuba, the Clinton Administration faces a more unpredictable, but potentially even more explosive challenge. In the last year, President Fidel Castro's inability to reverse his island's steep economic decline has become apparent. And while repressive police policies have prevented the emergence of mass opposition organizations, experts in Cuban affairs say the end is fast approaching for the 34-year-old Communist Government.
They disagree, however, on how that end might come. A military coup could spark a civil war, the experts warn, as could a sudden popular uprising. Further, the 66-year-old leader's sudden death could set off a chaotic power struggle. With Cuba only 90 miles away, any of these situations could generate a refugee flood to dwarf the recent outpouring from Haiti.

HEADLINE: Anti-Immigrant Attitude Starts in Washington

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Growing evidence of animus against immigrants in the United States is discussed in news articles Dec. 11 and 13. You report a poll Dec. 15 showing that most Latino immigrants believe there are too many immigrants here. 
 The most common explanation for this anti-immigrant bias is economic: those who enjoy the relative prosperity of the United States standard of living are threatened by the prospect of sharing it with others.
But another cause, not mentioned by you, is the Federal Government's legal attitude toward immigrants. When our Government fails to treat immigrants as human beings with equal dignity and respect, it institutionalizes and reinforces the prejudice you have observed among the general population.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service's treatment of Haitian refugees and Palestinian immigrants provides examples of such invidious official conduct. For several months, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has held a group of Haitian refugees afflicted with AIDS incommunicado at Guantanamo Naval Base in Cuba.
In court, the agency has argued that the Haitians deserve no access to lawyers because they have no rights in the first place. More recently, in justifying a refusal to send four refugees to the mainland for necessary treatment, Duke Austin, an Immigration Service spokesman, told a reporter, "they're going to die anyway, aren't they?" (news article, Dec. 13). Such an attitude cannot but encourage anti-immigrant bias.
Meanwhile, in Los Angeles the Immigration and Naturalization Service is attempting to deport a group of Palestinians for alleged support for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Government has conceded that these immigrants have done nothing that a United States citizen could not do. United States citizens have a First Amendment right to send money to these or any other groups, so long as they do not intend to further any unlawful ends of the group.
But in the Immigration Service's view, if an immigrant raises any money for such a group, even if it is directed solely toward humanitarian ends, he is deportable as a "terrorist." Thus, the agency seeks to deport immigrants for activity that their citizen neighbors have a constitutional right to engage in.
We will not move beyond prejudice against newer immigrants as long as our Federal Government maintains policies that refuse to afford the most basic human rights to all people under our control, citizens and noncitizens alike.

HEADLINE: Why Ticket Scalpers Don't Qualify for Entrepreneur Status

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Tickets? Supply Meets Demand on Sidewalk" (front page, Dec. 26), you present economic arguments for ticket scalping. However, the implication is that tickets to the Matisse exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art operate under the same economic forces as grain does. 
 Organizations such as the Modern do not operate under a profit motive, but under mandate to provide the public with access to art. If the museum operated under the same free-market principles as grain suppliers, its directors would simply raise prices or offer more Matisse. Raising prices, however, would make the exhibition less affordable.
Offering more Matisse is not practical. You cannot create more Matisses. And it may not be simple to extend the run of the show. Finally, you cannot just make more tickets available because of the problem of where to put the extra patrons.
To help the museum fulfill its mandate, public organizations, private organizations, foundations and donors provide funds. These donors, in effect, subsidize affordable access to the arts for the public benefit and make tickets at below-market prices possible. When scalpers buy these tickets and sell them at market prices, they are "stealing" the subsidy.
While this focuses on the Matisse exhibition, some Broadway shows, sports events and rock concerts are also priced below market value because of what is called the good will factor. This good will is stolen when scalpers sell tickets for higher prices.
Scalpers who wait in line (physically or over the telephone) for their tickets will argue that they should be compensated for their time. This argument is not valid because most people do not go to scalpers to avoid box office lines; they go only after they cannot get tickets through legitimate channels (possibly because the supplies were depleted by the scalpers). Also, some scalpers do not wait in line at all, but bribe box-office employees for access to tickets.
While scalpers provide some of the economic benefits that you note, in the end they are simply opportunists making money at the expense of the public.

HEADLINE: From 'Beulah' to 'Oprah'

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
IN "Beulah," a show that made its debut on ABC in 1950, the title character was a huge black maid with a mooching, irresponsible boyfriend; a dimwitted, high-strung girlfriend; a keen sense of rhythm, and an apparently inexhaustible supply of patience.
"Beulah" was the first television sitcom to feature a black lead, preceding "Amos 'n' Andy" by a year. It was one of several shows of the early 1950's that helped perpetuate old stereotypes in a new medium, leading many black actors and politicians to protest that television represented a setback to the cause of equal rights. 
 Over the next two decades, though, television was slowly to reveal that it had a more progressive streak as well. Even as "Amos 'n' Andy" reruns continued in syndication, television coverage of the civil-rights movement was bringing the struggle to life for millions of viewers who might otherwise have had little sense of it. And by the time the next comedy with a black heroine, "Julia," went on the air on NBC in 1968, the familiar stereotypes -- along with any hint of racial strife -- were self-consciously suppressed: Diahann Carroll played a beautiful, talented nurse living in a perfectly integrated neighborhood.
This ambivalent history of blacks on television, from "Beulah" through "Julia" all the way up to "Oprah," is the subject of a new series of talks and screenings through March at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens. The premise of the series, titled "Changing the Picture: The Emergence of African-Americans in Television," is that television images not only reflect but also help shape racial attitudes in this country. The premise is particularly thought-provoking given the current state of race relations in New York City.
Moving sometimes chronologically, sometimes thematically, the screenings offer a look at blacks on television that is alternately troubling, inspiring and entertaining. It raises questions not only about programs written by whites that reinforced negative images of blacks, but also about black-oriented shows like "In Living Color" that in the search for laughs, often seem to come dangerously close to re-enacting old stereotypes. Speakers in the series include Malcolm-Jamal Warner, the star of NBC's "Here and Now," on Monday; Melvin Van Peebles, the actor and film director, on Jan. 23, and Ms. Carroll on March 11.
The screenings began this week with a set of programs that established the comic stereotypes of the 1950's: "The Jack Benny Show," with Eddie (Rochester) Anderson as the gravelly voiced valet; "Amos 'n' Andy," with Tim Moore as the conniving Kingfish, and "Trouble With Father," with Willie Best as the brainless handyman. In an episode from the second season of "Beulah," Hattie McDaniel fittingly teaches her small charge, Donny, how to dance. ("Amos 'n' Andy" and "Trouble With Father" will be screened again at the museum on Monday and Feb. 15 to 19.)
This weekend, in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, the focus of the series will shift to television and the civil-rights movement. Tomorrow at 2 P.M., Jim Desmond and Nick Proferes will introduce "Free at Last," their documentary about King, filmed in the months before his assassination. And at 4 P.M., there will be a screening of Kenneth Clark's interviews with King, Malcolm X and James Baldwin, originally broadcast on public television.
In the early years of television, variety shows were important showcases for black entertainers, and several of the biggest names in show business, among them Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen, actively promoted black performers on their programs. White viewers, however, did not always respond favorably. In early 1952, for instance, Eddie Cantor invited Sammy Davis Jr., then relatively unknown, to be on the "Colgate Comedy Hour." During the show, Cantor used his handkerchief to wipe Davis's perspiring brow; after the program, both men received baskets full of hate mail over this interracial contact.
As a result of white viewers' attitudes, blacks did not have much luck as hosts of their own variety shows. To many blacks, the failure of "The Nat (King) Cole Show" was one of the low points of television history.
"The Nat (King) Cole Show" went on the air on NBC in late 1956, but despite the host's enormous popularity as a recording artist, it could not find a national sponsor. It was canceled after one year, prompting Cole to write in Ebony that "Madison Avenue . . . and their big clients didn't want their products associated with Negroes."
Scenes from the short-lived "Nat (King) Cole Show" will be shown at the museum on Sunday at 4 P.M. The "Colgate Comedy Hour" episode with Sammy Davis Jr. will be shown next month.
 
On the News
 In contrast to the barriers black performers encountered in entertainment shows, news programs of the late 1950's and the 60's often provided sympathetic portraits of black political leaders and of their work. In his book "Blacks and White TV" (Nelson-Hall, 1992), one of the few extended studies of race and television, Fred MacDonald, a historian and film collector, writes, "There can be no doubt that scenes of protest against racial injustice communicated nationally through TV in the early 1960's did much to win popular support for meaningful reform."
On Monday beginning at 2 P.M., two early documentaries on civil rights will be screened: a portrait of two white supremacists and a report on the school integration battle in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957. And on Feb. 14, the museum will show five more news specials, including a look at racial violence, with Edward R. Murrow, and a viewer-participation program on racial attitudes broadcast in Chicago in 1963.
 
In Praise of Cosby
 Of the thousands of black actors who have appeared on television since the medium was born, none have done more to expand the range of black characters than Bill Cosby. In tribute to his accomplishments, "Changing the Picture" is devoting an entire weekend, Feb. 20 and 21, to Mr. Cosby's career. Writers from "The Cosby Show" will discuss the making of a hit, and clips from some of the most popular episodes will be shown. Screenings will also include episodes of Mr. Cosby's earlier work, including "I Spy," the first dramatic series with a black leading character; the original "Bill Cosby Show," in which Mr. Cosby played Chet Kincaid, a Los Angeles gym teacher, and "The New Bill Cosby Show," a variety series from 1972.
Although "The New Bill Cosby Show" was never terribly successful, it was part of a second generation of variety programs with black hosts that seemed to have commercial promise. Another example of the genre, "The Flip Wilson Show" of 1970 to 1974, was a tremendous hit.
"The Flip Wilson Show" was a breakthrough: the first black-led variety show to rate consistently among the top shows on television. The show comically appropriated many of the old black stereotypes; the character Geraldine Jones, for example, played by Mr. Wilson in drag, had many characteristics of the classic hysterical black woman. Because the show offered a black take on stereotypes, Mr. Wilson's fans hailed the show as an example of authentic black humor. Many critics, on the other hand, disparaged "The Flip Wilson Show" as simply a hipper version of the old minstrel shows, what Mr. MacDonald labels the "New Minstrelsy."
 
The Fine Line
 Today, a similar criticism is sometimes leveled against the Fox series "In Living Color," just as a similar defense is offered by its fans. In a recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, the creator of the show, Keenen Ivory Wayans, who left Fox last month in a dispute over the network's decision to rerun old episodes, acknowledged the delicacy of the situation, saying, "There's a fine line between African-American humor and making fun of African-Americans." Episodes of both "The Flip Wilson Show" and "In Living Color" will shown at the museum on Feb. 28.
Over the decades, of course, shows with black leads have not been the only ones dealing with racial issues. Included in "Changing the Picture" are white casts' efforts to grapple with black topics. On Jan. 30, for example, the museum will present an episode from "Channing," a drama series from the 1960's, in which James Earl Jones guest-stars an economics professor who resents his status as the token black.
The series ends on March 28 on a forward-looking note with clips from Black Entertainment Television, the first cable station specifically targeted to a black audience. Because of their smaller-scale economics, cable stations can often afford to offer programming that would not be commercially viable on broadcast television. Thus, cable ventures like Black Entertainment Television suggest -- although they by no means insure -- a somewhat more hopeful future for blacks on television. As Mr. MacDonald said recently: "Never has the time been more propitious."

Marching With Sousa, The Oompah Master

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Fans of military marches are in luck. "If You Knew Sousa," tonight's offering in "The American Experience" series, is filled with the music that has been stirring patriotic juices for more than a century.
The series host, David McCullough, calls the Sousa march America's answer to the Strauss waltz. Although the rousers reached their peak of popularity in the early 1900's, bands around the country are still beating out "The Stars and Stripes Forever" and "The Washington Post March," and you can hear them and other favorites through most of tonight's 90-minute documentary. 
 The program makes a connection between the march tempo and the upbeat spirit of America in Sousa's time. His were not the sounds of depression or recession, and they made him a superstar before that word was invented. His career is laid out by engaging archival photographs and old recordings; the details of his life, less stirring than his tunes, are filled in by enthusiasts, especially Loras Schissel of the Library of Congress.
In the 1920's, when jazz seemed to be taking over, Sousa commented, "Just now it is the style to be crazy." He kept conducting up until a few hours before his death in 1932, ending his career on an apt upnote, leading a band in "The Stars and Stripes Forever." Through such Sousa favorites, tonight's documentary calls up a robust, optimistic era that seems more distant all the time.
 
'Ute Lemper
 Sings Kurt Weill'
Bravo, tomorrow at 9 P.M.
Robust and optimistic are not words that spring to mind from the music of Kurt Weill. If Sousa was imbued with 19th-century optimism, Weill reeked of 20th-century disillusion. This hourlong concert, recorded at the Bath International Festival in May 1989, is also an opportunity to meet Ute Lemper. Although her interpretations seem a touch over-emoted at times, the lovely young German cabaret singer, performing on a darkened stage to Jurgen Knieper's accompaniment, has evident feeling for Weill's work, particularly from his German period.
Here, in subtitled German, are such Weill standards as "Mack the Knife" and "Surabaya Johnny" and an affecting English version of "Moon of Alabama." Now and then, 1920-ish black-and-white pictures of a bleak Berlin flash on a screen behind or seemingly all around the black-attired singer as counterpoint to the lyrics. If you're taken with Ms. Lemper, who offers a few comments on this and that between songs, you may be able to catch her on tour this month and next in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, singing songs identified with Edith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich.
 
'The Ernest Green Story'
Disney, Sunday at 7 P.M.
If virtue is its own reward, the producers of "The Ernest Green Story" should be richly compensated. Ernest Green was one of the nine black students who broke the racial barrier at the all-white Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, with the help of 1,200 paratroopers. Tonight's play, told from young Ernest's point of view, pits a few brave black teen-agers against malevolent white politicians and racist mobs. That is not inaccurate as far as it goes, but it does not go nearly far enough to make for adult drama. This largely predictable exercise, with Morris Chestnut as Ernest and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee playing familiar parts, can be recommended for youngsters. Grown-ups, stick with "60 Minutes."
 
'Telling Secrets'
ABC, Sunday and Monday at 9 P.M.
For four unenthralling hours, "Telling Secrets," based on a 1989 murder in Phoenix, tells the story of some people who manage to be odd without being interesting. Cybill Shepherd is supposed to be a femme fatale; Ken Olin plays the least assertive detective west of the Rockies. Among its many other deficiencies, the screenplay has no detecting to speak of and no real focus; it drifts here and there, pausing now and then for a pleasing glimpse of Ms. Shepherd in underwear. She does wonders for a money belt.
 
'The American Experience'
'If You Knew Sousa'
Channel 13, tonight at 9
 
A portrait of John Philip Sousa produced by Tom Spain and Linda Spain for "The American Experience," a co-production of WGBH/ Boston, WNET/New York and KCET/Los Angeles; written by Mr. Spain; edited by Ms. Spain and Andrew Fredericks; Judy Crichton, executive producer of "The American Experience"; Charles Kuralt, narrator.

HEADLINE: 24 Candidates Jostle in the Stampede To Be the Next Mayor of Los Angeles

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 14

 BODY:
For a job that carries comparatively little formal power and faces daunting urban problems, it is extraordinary how many people want to be the next mayor of Los Angeles.
Twenty-four people have announced their candidacies in the April 20 election to succeed Mayor Tom Bradley. Mr. Bradley, at age 74, is retiring after leading the nation's second largest metropolis, after New York, for two decades. 
 The election will be a turning pointfor Los Angeles, an ethnically divided and economically struggling city of 3.5 million people that is vastly different from the one Mr. Bradley took over in 1973. The coalitions that put him in office and kept him there are shattered, the city is trying to recover from last year's civil disorders, the population has changed from mostly "Anglo," as non-Hispanic white people are called here, to mostly minority, and nearly all the top leaders, including the police chief and district attorney, have been swept away.
It is a city that the historian Kevin Starr recently likened to Yugoslavia: likely to be led next by "one of many warring chieftains -- tribal warriors, enclave politicians, who slashed their way, temporarily, to the top."
The candidates face an odd demographic fact of life: Even though about two-thirds of the city's population is now made up of Mexican-Americans, blacks, Asian-Americans and other minorities, more than two-thirds of the voters are still Anglo. One reason is that many immigrants are not citizens and are therefore ineligible to vote. Another is that minority citizens who are eligible tend to turn out in low numbers.
 
Battle in White Areas
 Thus the campaign will be fought hardest in the largely white San Fernando Valley and on the West Side, where fear of crime and further racial strife runs deep. Two of the four leading candidates are from the valley, and a third has his headquarters there; all but one are white men. Tom Bradley may be the last black mayor of Los Angeles for some time.
No dominant candidate has yet emerged in this enormously complex race. The contest, which is nonpartisan by law and has a filing deadline of Jan. 25, is expected to cost each candidate more than $2 million, and many here expect it will turn nasty and negative. The issues of crime and public safety are expected to dominate.
The leaders, in the view of most political experts, are Michael Woo, a 41-year-old City Councilman of Chinese descent; Richard J. Riordan, 62, a wealthy New York-born businessman and lawyer; Richard Katz, 42, an influential state Assemblyman who represents part of the valley, and Joel Wachs, 53, a Councilman who has represented parts of the valley for 22 years.
The race was further complicated Wednesday when Linda Griego, Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, entered the race. She is expected to have strong appeal with women's and Hispanic groups.
Below them is a second tier of candidates, none of whom can be taken lightly. They are Nate Holden, a black City Councilman who came close to forcing Mayor Bradley into a runoff four years ago; J. Stanley Sanders, a prominent black lawyer making his first run for public office; Nikolas Patsaouras, a Greek immigrant who is a wealthy consulting engineer and longtime backer of Mayor Bradley; Julian Nava, a Mexican-American who is a former ambassador to Mexico, and Tom Houston, an Anglo who is a former deputy mayor.
"This is a donnybrook; it's really wide open," said Bill Robertson, a confidant of Mayor Bradley who is secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.
With such a large field, it is almost certain that no candidate will win a majority. That would force a runoff between the top two on June 8. The new mayor will take office on July 1, just in time to start coping with a staggering budget shortage that is expected to exceed $300 million because of declining state government support for local governments.
 
How They Stack Up
 So far, most attention in the race has focused on Mr. Woo, the son of an immigrant wholesale grocer and banker. He has drawn financial backing from Asian-American groups in New York, Chicago, Detroit, Houston and other cities.
At the end of the year, Mr. Woo had raised a little more than $500,000. That placed him behind Mr. Riordan, who had about $600,000 in his campaign treasury, but ahead of Mr. Katz, who had about $450,000, and Mr. Wachs, who had about $250,000.
"The race here is viewed by many Asian-American groups as a bellwether for the 90's," said Mr. Woo, who has represented the Hollywood area on the Council since 1985. "There is a recognition that if an Asian-American can be elected mayor of the second city, it will shatter stereotypes about Asians' being successful only in certain endeavors." He acknowledged, however, that he feared his candidacy might also bring anti-Asian sentiments to the surface.
With Asians only about 3 percent of the electorate, Mr. Woo has had to seek support from a variety of other groups. He has courted blacks as the first major politician to call for the ouster of Chief Daryl F. Gates after the police beating of Rodney G. King in 1991. He also has strong support from Jews, homosexuals and the Hollywood movie industry.
Mr. Riordan, a self-made millionaire, philanthropist and downtown power broker, is a bundle of contradictions. A conservative, he is widely called "the Ross Perot of Los Angeles" for his wealth and businesslike solutions to urban problems.
He is expected to appeal to conservative white voters, urging limits to the terms of local officials and portraying himself as an alternative to professional politicians. But his personal fortune of more than $100 million may not be enough to put across his conservative Republican message in this overwhelmingly Democratic city.
 
Carville in His Corner
 Though not as well known as Mr. Riordan, Assemblyman Katz has strong backing in his San Fernando Valley base and is one of the most powerful members of the State Legislature: he is chairman of the Transportation Committee and close to Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. He has also hired James Carville, the campaign strategist who guided Bill Clinton to the Presidency, a move that enhanced Mr. Katz's credibility and potency in the eyes of his opponents.
In an interview, Mr. Katz said he would campaign on his record of what he has accomplished for the city, in rail transit, earthquake protection and job creation. Like Mr. Woo, Mr. Katz has strong appeal among Jews and in the movie industry.
Generally considered to have less of a chance, Councilman Wachs also has a strong following in the valley as well as support from many Jews, people in the arts and films and homosexual voters. He is the author of anti-discrimination legislation.
"People say the city is not governable," said Mr. Wachs, whose family moved here when he was 10 partly because of his hay fever. "I do not believe that. The city's got a future."
The candidates operate against a shifting backdrop of split alliances and changing demographics. For all the attention to black issues, blacks are a shrinking minority. Hispanic residents, fast increasing in number, are now 40 percent of the population but scarcely more than a tenth of the vote.
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, one of several prominent figures who tested the electoral waters but recoiled, said, "None of the candidates have emerged as the logical citywide force to bring people together and make the tough decisions that may drive people apart."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 19, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
One entry in a series of brief profiles of candidates for mayor of Los Angeles on Friday described the electoral history of Assemblyman Richard Katz incorrectly. He was elected in 1980, and has been re-elected every two years since.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- Japan and East Asia;
A Rising Sun; Crises-in-Waiting

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
For all of what Bush Administration officials describe as their foreign policy successes elsewhere, the concede that they are leaving Mr. Clinton with an overarching problem in Asia: a Japan policy that is in disarray, with few fresh ideas about how to deal with America's biggest economic competitor.
The trade deficit, after declining temporarily, is almost at record levels -- nearly $50 billion in 1992. With Japan in the midst of one of its steepest economic declines in years, the chances for a boost in imports of American goods this year are virtually nil. And the Japanese fear a backlash that will lead to unilateral American action to restrict Japanese imports, poisoning early relations with the new Administration. Lurking beneath the surface is resentment at the failure of the Bush Administration to focus on Japanese concerns; as Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d spent more time visiting Ulan Bator than Tokyo. 
 Before the election, Mr. Clinton acknowledged that "we really do not have a good, coherent policy toward Japan that will lead us to open markets and give us enough respect in their country." But he has not explained how he thinks the United States should become re-engaged in the country or the region, beyond his domestic goals for enhancing competitiveness.
 
Early Challenges
 Among Mr. Clinton's early challenges will be how to promote a greater presence of American manufacturing and services in Japan -- without looking like he is creating jobs for Japanese instead of Americans -- and how to replace the Bush Administration's fizzled effort to remove "structural impediments" to trade between the two countries.
Japanese officials are now publicly saying the Bush Administration's initiative lost credibility because the United States never followed through on many of its own commitments to economic reform, the quid pro quo for changes in Japan. But the Japanese, one senior American official here noted recently, have failed to come up with their own initiatives to greet Mr. Clinton. "They are going to Washington with even fewer new ideas than we have," he said.
Elsewhere in Asia, Mr. Clinton faces two crises-in-waiting: Cambodia and North Korea. With the Khmer Rouge unwilling to take part in the elections scheduled for later this year, Mr. Clinton may soon have to decide whether the new American role in enforcing United Nations resolutions extends to a new involvement in Indochina. Continued evidence that North Korea may be developing nuclear arms likely poses the largest threat to peace in the region, and will almost certainly slow any effort to reduce American military presence in the Pacific. Mr. Clinton will also face hard decisions on future relations with Vietnam.
But the most delicate problem for Mr. Clinton may be finding the right security role for the Japanese -- as a member of the United Nations Security Council, as United Nations peacekeepers and as a nation once again able to exercise power of a noneconomic nature -- in a way that will not reawaken fears elsewhere in Asia.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- China;
Beijing Awaits Decision on Trade

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
America's relations with China for years to come may be determined by Mr. Clinton's handling of a single issue in the next six months: extension of "most-favored-nation" trading status for China.
Mr. Clinton suggested in the campaign that he wanted to add human rights conditions to any extension of this status, which guarantees the low tariffs that are applied to virtually all of the United States' trading partners. If Mr. Clinton decides to impose tough conditions that Beijing feels it cannot meet, relations could deteriorate precipitously. 
 A secondary issue is whether Mr. Clinton will press ahead with plans for the establishment of a proposed Radio Free Asia to broadcast to China and other countries. The Communist leaders in Beijing would regard this as an attempt to subvert their rule and probably would react harshly.
With these matters at stake, Chinese-American relations are widely seen as at a crossroads. But in the past few months, both sides seemed to peer over the abyss and then back away from their more confrontational statements.
 
Help From Bush
 Mr. Clinton said in late December that he was "very hopeful that progress can be made" in negotiations with China. President Bush has also helped Mr. Clinton out by resolving some longstanding problems: he sent Commerce Secretary Barbara H. Franklin to Beijing in December, ending a freeze on high-level visits by United States officials, and he released for delivery military equipment that Beijing had paid for but that had been held abeyance since Chinese Army troops attacked pro-democracy protesters in June 1989.
China has also been conciliatory. It scarcely reacted to the United States sale of F-16 fighters to Taiwan, and it responded to Mr. Clinton's election by announcing a huge purchase of American wheat.
Still, many problems linger on the horizon.
Unconfirmed satellite evidence suggests that China may have secretly delivered M-11 missiles to Pakistan last November, despite Beijing's pledges not to. And the United States' trade deficit with China is second only to Japan's and is growing rapidly.
Further human rights abuses are possible as Chinese dissidents grow bolder about challenging the Communist Government. And China's 88-year-old senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, is frail and his death is certain to provoke far-reaching uncertainties about China's future.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Clinton's Headaches: A World Afflicted by Wars and Poverty -- The Americas;
Haiti, Cuba And Free Trade

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 14

 BODY:
While Bill Clinton was elected President pledging to focus on the American economy like a "laser beam," his attention to domestic issues may be diverted by foreign affairs, a point brought home since the election by events in Iraq, Somalia and Bosnia. Here is a region-by-region look at the world, showing some of key issues that the new President is likely to face.
The Clinton Administration will need a delicate touch in handling the intricate economic issues surrounding the consolidation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and the expected expansion of trade arrangements to other countries in the region. 
 And although Mr. Clinton has indicated that he will seek to make economics the basis of more and more foreign policy thinking, experts in the regional affairs expect that two island neighbors, Haiti and Cuba, could present the new Administration with some of its stickiest political crises.
With the new trade agreement, Mr. Clinton must find a way to reach new pacts with Mexico that will require enforcement of minimal standards of working conditions and environmental protection, without which, many complain, American labor and industry will face unfair competition. Although Mr. Clinton has already met with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, extracting new concessions from Mexico without causing the complex knot of the trade agreement to unravel will be a difficult trick.
In Haiti, which has suffered perennial unrest since the downfall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986, the Clinton Administration must find a way to restore democratic order to a country as deeply divided as any along class lines.
 
Haitian Refugees Still to Be Returned
 One of the reasons for doing so is to stop the tide of refugees fleeing to the United States from Haiti, an issue that came into sharp relief today when Mr. Clinton announced that he plans to temporarily continue the Bush policy of repatriating boat people picked up at sea. Thus Mr. Clinton, who criticized the Bush policy during the campaign, decided that he needed to maintain the policy to block a new exodus.
Clinton aides have been taking part in diplomatic efforts to restore the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown in a military coup in September 1991.
Father Aristide's opponents in the army and the nation's tiny economic elite, meanwhile, have shown no signs of willingness to relinquish their control over the country's affairs. Any failure to bring these two distant sides together will probably further increase the prospects of mass emigration.
In Cuba, the Clinton Administration faces a more unpredictable, but potentially even more explosive challenge. In the last year, President Fidel Castro's inability to reverse his island's steep economic decline has become apparent. And while repressive police policies have prevented the emergence of mass opposition organizations, experts in Cuban affairs say the end is fast approaching for the 34-year-old Communist Government.
They disagree, however, on how that end might come. A military coup could spark a civil war, the experts warn, as could a sudden popular uprising. Further, the 66-year-old leader's sudden death could set off a chaotic power struggle. With Cuba only 90 miles away, any of these situations could generate a refugee flood to dwarf the recent outpouring from Haiti.

HEADLINE: Robert G. High, 46, Securities Executive And Puzzle Designer

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Robert Gordon High, a Connecticut securities executive and a devotee and promoter of go, the ancient Asian game of strategy, died last Friday in an accident in Chile. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
 Mr. High, who was also a white-water rafting enthusiast, died while on the first commercial rafting expedition on the Futaleufu River in the southern Chilean Andes. His raft capsized after entering a canyon, said Michael J. Simon, treasurer of the American Go Association in New York, of which Mr. High was the new president. 
At the time of his death, Mr. High was an assistant vice president and chairman of the research committee at Greenwich Capital Markets. An expert in computer programming, he specialized in financial analysis.
 Born in Oakland, Calif., Mr. High spent eight years studying mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley. He received an M.A. and passed the doctoral orals with distinction in 1969 at the age of 22. But instead of finishing his Ph.D., he worked for several years with Chilean refugees and human-rights advocates opposed to the Pinochet dictatorship. He also taught mathematics at the University of Chile in the early 1970's.
 A designer of puzzles, Mr. High contributed mathematical games to international magazines and became a keen competitive player of go. The game engages two players who seek to control territory on a square, checkered board by strategically placing black and white "stones" on the board's 361 intersections. The object is to capture the opponent's stones and secure control over open spaces on the board.
 The game is played by many people in this country and by millions in Japan, China, Taiwan and Korea. Mr. High was a major organizer of the American Go Association, which has about 1,500 members. His election as president became effective just eight days before his death.
 Mr. High was engaged to Terry Assael of Manhattan.
 He is survived by a brother, Tom, of San Francisco.

The Economy
Consumer inflation was just 2.9 percent in 1992, the lowest annual rate in six years. The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy, fell to 3.3 percent, the slimmest rise since 1972. Another report showed that industrial production moved up three-tenths of 1 percent in December. [Page 1.]
Lower exports caused the trade deficit to widen by 5.1 percent in November. The Commerce Department also said it had under-reported the nation's imports of Japanese cars and trucks by $1.84 billion over the last three years. [44.] 
 The surging stock prices of technology companies is a declaration by investors that dominance in the computing industry is shifting from makers of mainframes and minicomputers to companies that supply the means to improve office productivity. [35.]
The assessed value of property in New York City has fallen for the third year in a row, which will cost the city millions in property-tax revenues and hurt effots to balance the budget. [24.]
 
Companies
A settlement of future claims against 20 companies by workers injured breathing deadly asbestos fibers was proposed by lawyers for both sides. But the plan, which could lead to $2 billion in claims over the next 10 years, covers only a fraction of the defendant companies. [35.]
Two more top Salomon executives resigned from the scandal-tinged firm struggling to re-establish its footing on Wall Street. The co-head of fixed-income securities and the head of international investment banking will depart. [35.]
The recently deposed chairman of Sunbeam-Oster is the first to admit that he irritated and intimidated many of his managers, which led to an executive mutiny and his ouster. [35.]
The 15-month-old New Dartmouth Bank could sell for three times what the owners paid, an illustration of how the rubble of failed savings institutions can be made viable. [37.]
A Frenchman was named to head Euro Disneyland, replacing the American who oversaw the park in its troubled first year. [37.]
The publisher of The New York Post said a deal that could have stabilized the newspaper financially was virtually dead and that he would consider selling a controlling interest in the paper. [25.]
 
Markets
The Dow recovered from late-afternoon selling related to the expiration of options and futures contracts to close with a gain of 3.24, to 3,271.12. For the week, the Dow gained 19.45. [36.]
Treasury bond prices rose moderately after the Government released a favorable inflation report. The price of the 30-year bond rose, and its yield fell to 7.34 percent. [44.]
Oil prices lurched higher amid tensions in Iraq and a surge in prices for unleaded gasoline. [45.]
The dollar finished higher on rumors that Germany and France would cut interest rates. Gold prices fell. [45.]
 
Your Money
How to restore a tarnished credit rating? The case of an Upstate New York hospital administrator who reorganized $40,000 in personal debts is a textbook example. [33.]
Wall Street's professional salesmen may not know a debenture from a dividend, but they are masters at baiting consumers into buying shares of companies that have little or no promise. [33.]
The Supreme Court decision backing the I.R.S. on limiting home office deductions affects thousands of taxpayers. [33.]

Profits Emerging From Rubble of 3 Failed Banks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The New Dartmouth Bank, created 15 months ago from the rubble of three failed New Hampshire savings banks, is for sale by its owners, who hope to collect three times their investment.
The revival of New Dartmouth, based in Manchester, N.H., is an illustration of how profitable banks can be if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assumes the burden of losses from bad loans. It also shows how profits can grow when mergers of banks in the same area allow closing of branches, fewer computer systems and work-force reductions. 
 In New Dartmouth's case, the original 55-branch network has shrunk to 37, four computer centers have been combined into one and a work force of 1,173 has fallen to about 600. To cut costs further, the bank reduced interest rates on deposits and ended executive perks like country club memberships and company cars.
Although no buyer has been found for New Dartmouth, confidential documents prepared by Goldman, Sachs & Company, the bank's adviser, show that the bank is being offered for sale.
 
 
'Strategic Option'
 Goldman has told the owners that they should be able to obtain a price far higher than the $40 million they paid in 1991, when New Dartmouth was created. A price of $120 million or more has been suggested to potential buyers, based on New Dartmouth's profitability and prices in other bank sales in 1992.
Robert Keller, president of New Dartmouth, would not confirm or deny that the bank was for sale. But he added that "this is a good earning bank with an attractive franchise, so obviously a sale is one of our strategic options." Other options include a public offering of the bank's shares or acquisitions of other banks, he added.
Goldman's code name for the sale, Pegasus, refers to the winged horse of Greek mythology that emerged from the slain body of Medusa, an ugly creature with snakes for hair. The reference is a fair one for New Dartmouth's origin as three failed savings banks in such bad shape that they may have turned some investors into stone, but which has been transformed into a high-flying, profitable bank.
New Dartmouth profits from Oct. 10, 1991, when it was created, to the end of September 1992 totaled $20.4 million -- an eye-opening return for its owners.
With 37 branches and $1.52 billion of deposits, the New Dartmouth bank is the second largest in the state, behind First New Hampshire Banks, Manchester, a subsidiary of the Bank of Ireland. It is slightly ahead of the Fleet Bank New Hampshire, a subsidiary of Fleet Financial Group, Providence, R.I.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which expects to lose $624 million on the bad loans it took from the three failed banks, gains little from New Dartmouth's revival, except for avoiding even greater losses that would have resulted if it had closed the banks.
 
 
'Best Deal We Could Get'
 The F.D.I.C. invested $31 million in convertible preferred stock of New Dartmouth, but owners of the bank say they expect to repay the F.D.I.C. before the Government agency has the right to convert the preferred stock to common stock.
"At the time New Dartmouth was created, interest rates were not so low and the New England market was full of weak banks," Bob Hartheimer, a deputy director at the F.D.I.C., said. "It was a buyers market, and this was the best deal we could get."
New Dartmouth's transformation started months before its creation. Marshall Davidson, an investment banker then working for Kidder, Peabody & Company, devised a plan for a trimmed-down, no-frills bank that would concentrate on low-risk lending for home mortgages and consumers. That plan -- plus the F.D.I.C.'s help and the presence of Mr. Keller, who had previously combined a group of failed savings and loans in Texas -- was enough to attract investors with $40 million of new capital.

HEADLINE: Good Inflation News Pushes Treasury Prices Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Long-term Treasury bond prices rose moderately yesterday after the Government released a favorable report on inflation.
The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond was up 20/32 , while its yield fell to 7.34 percent, from 7.39 percent on Thursday. 
 The Labor Department reported yesterday that its Consumer Price Index increased by just one-tenth of 1 percent in December. For all of 1992, consumer prices rose 2.9 percent, the smallest increase since a 1.1 percent gain in 1986.
 
Other Data Are Mixed
 That followed the announcement of another positive signal on inflation Thursday, when the department said wholesale prices rose by only two-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Other Government reports provided a mixed economic picture. The trade deficit rose 5.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department said, reflecting a 2.8 percent drop in exports. But the Federal Reserve said the output of the nation's factories was up three-tenths of 1 percent in December, the third consecutive monthly gain.
"We had some good economic numbers; the inflation figure was quite good," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities Inc. "People thought it would be higher than that. That formed the foundation for the improvement in the market today."
Bond prices tend to rise on news of lower inflation, which protects the value of fixed-income investments.
Some analysts said bonds rose on unconfirmed reports that the Treasury Department would restrict supply of the 30-year bond. But Mr. Moran said such speculation had "been around for some time" and probably had little effect on the market.
 
Other Rates Lower
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices on short-term and intermediate issues rose slightly.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.76, to 1,263.44.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 2.94 percent. The discount rate on six-month bills fell two basis points, to 3.08 percent. And the discount rate on one-year bills fell one basis point, to 3.29 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 2.93 percent, down from 2.97 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9729/32 , up 10/32 from Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 6.35 percent, down from 6.38 percent.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Rose Slightly In November

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
A dip in exports caused the United States trade deficit to widen slightly in November, as the weak economies of Europe and Japan bought fewer American goods than in October, the Commerce Department said today. The department also said it had underreported the nation's imports of Japanese cars and trucks by a total of $1.84 billion over the last three years.
The nation's trade deficit grew 5.1 percent, to $7.59 billion, from a revised $7.22 billion in October. Earlier in 1992, rising exports had been a boon for the slowly reviving United States economy but lost momentum by the end of the year. 
 Exports were down 2.8 percent, to $37.97 billion, while imports fell 1.6 percent from October levels, to $45.56 billion in November.
The deficit on trade with Japan, which accounts for more than half of the overall deficit, narrowed to $4.69 billion in November from $4.96 billion in October.
The United States had a deficit of $638 million with Western Europe in November, a reversal from October's slim surplus of $27.7 million.
Exports to both Japan and Western Europe were lower in November than in October.
 
Some Vehicles Not Reported
 The department attributed its underreporting of Japanese vehicle imports over the last three years to the Customs Service. It said customs officials had not provided certain documents to the Census Bureau, which tabulates trade data. The value of the unreported vehicles amounted to several percent of the total value of the Japanese car and truck imports during the three years in question, according to the bureau's data.
A Customs Service spokesman, Steven R. Duchesne, confirmed that some documents had not reached the Census Bureau. But he said the Customs Service had nonetheless collected the import tariffs due on all imported vehicles.
The Commerce Department revised the overall October trade deficit to show a gap of $7.22 billion, instead of a previously reported $7.03 billion.
Foreign sales of civilian aircraft declined in November by $257.9 million, to $2.04 billion. Analysts said beforehand that the Boeing Company's foreign deliveries were down from October levels.
 
Imported Oil Price Off
 The cost of imported petroleum products fell to $4.47 billion in November from $4.83 billion in October. The price per barrel of imported crude oil was down to $17.72 from $18.15.
Imports of autos and parts from all sources climbed by $298 million in November to $7.86 billion.
Exports of industrial supplies declined by $609 million in November to $8.98 billion.
The deficit with Canada, the United States' single largest trading partner, was down to $739.7 million, from $979.7 million in October. The United States had a surplus on trade with Mexico of $382.7 million, up from a surplus of $54.3 million in October.

HEADLINE: Contract Talks Did Not Stress Productivity Gains

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
After insisting for a year that the city would not grant raises unless the municipal unions paid for them through greater efficiency, the Dinkins administration never put forward a concrete list of productivity demands during the crucial bargaining that led to a settlement on Monday, labor negotiators said.
The leaders of some of the major unions involved in the talks said negotiators never reached the point of discussing specific proposals for work-rule changes or other union concessions. 
 "There were not any negotiations that I was in where there was a conversation concerning a particular productivity program," said Barry Feinstein, president of Teamsters Local 237, one of the largest of the 19 unions covered by the settlement. "How could they? We wouldn't talk to them about it."
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel angrily denied that the city did not put specific ideas on the table. He said that the city suggested at least four proposals early in the bargaining, including lengthening hours for tree pruners and reducing the size of road-repair crews, but that the talks broke down because of the unions' refusal to have productivity measures linked to wages.
 
Fear of an Impasse
 "The fear we had was that we would have been thrown into impasse," Mr. Steisel said. "The arbitrators would probably have given them an inflation-based settlement, which would have cost $1.1 billion more."
It was not until December when Mayor David N. Dinkins dropped his insistence that wage increases be linked to productivity gains that the talks began to move forward, negotiators on both sides said.
On Monday, the two sides agreed to a three-year contract with wage and benefit raises totaling 8.25 percent. On the productivity question, they agreed to set up a three-member panel made up of labor, management and an independent arbitrator that would be charged with negotiating work-rule changes in the future. The pact, which covers 180,000 workers, has yet to be ratified by union members.
City officials characterized the settlement as a major victory because the workers will receive wage increases averaging below inflation, a goal central to their bargaining strategy. Inflation is currently running about 3 percent a year.
But fiscal experts said Mr. Dinkins's failure to press a specific list of demands at the bargaining table cast doubt on his commitment to restructuring the municipal work force, something most budget experts believe is crucial to avoid huge recurring deficits in the future.
"Ultimately they blinked, because they never got their act together to prepare the list they could have proposed," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizen's Budget Commission, a private group that monitors the city's finances.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the state Financial Control Board, which oversees city finances, said the city was extremely lax in soliciting solid proposals from agency heads for cutting costs through greater efficiency. "The city did not make an aggressive effort," he said.
 
Negotiations Stalled
 From August until late December, the two sides were paralyzed in a standoff, negotiators on both sides said. The unions refused to talk about concessions until the city put up money for raises, which their members have not had since late 1990. The city insisted raises must be financed with productivity gains.
But even after the city softened its stance just before Christmas, agreeing to sweeten the wage settlement without tying it to productivity, the administration did not push hard for specific programs, negotiators said.
Mr. Steisel said the city switched strategy because the unions persuaded the administration that they could not sell a contract to their members that contained meager wage hikes and at the same time ask workers to be more productive.
Officials were particularly worried about the teachers' union, which is not covered by the settlement. A state-appointed arbitrator began hearings this week on the teachers' contract. Administration officials feared that if the arbitrator recommended a generous settlement for the teachers it would become of benchmark for the other unions.
The administration settled for creating a panel with binding powers to hammer out ways to make workers more productive in the future.
While Mr. Steisel insisted that the administration did ask for productivity measures, labor leaders who participated in the talks said they were never discussed in the final bargaining with the coalition of 19 unions.
Mr. Feinstein, whose leadership of the union has been threatened by allegations that he misused union funds, said the city also never proposed rule changes that would have affected workers across the board like a longer workweek.
Stanley Hill, president of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the city's Labor Commissioner held talks with the heads of individual unions representing parks and highway workers about some work-rule changes. But those changes were never brought to the talks with the coalition, he said.
 
'Work Out a Process'
 "The only thing that they came in with was that wages should be linked to productivity," he said. "The Mayor expected us to work out a process."
The city's Labor Commissioner, James F. Hanley, acknowledged that he did not negotiate detailed productivity proposals with the coalition, but instead angled for what he believed was a fail-safe mechanism for reaching future accords.
Fiscal experts said it would have been politically difficult, if not impossible, for Mr. Hill, whose organization is made up of dozens of local unions covering a vastly different kinds of workers, to agree to a list of labor concessions that would doubtless ask for more sacrifice from some unions than from others.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the state Municipal Assistance Corporation, said the city, which is facing a $2.1 billion deficit in the coming fiscal year, must find efficiencies in the work force or face the possibility of laying off thousands of people. The administration should have advanced specific demands in the talks, he said, because labor traditionally has not proposed such notions on its own.
"It's disappointing," Mr. Rohatyn said of the administration. "Productivity doesn't spring fully armed from the brow of Zeus, and it can't be done by labor alone."

HEADLINE: New Leadership Emerging Among Technology Stocks

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
The surging stock prices of dozens of technology companies since October is a declaration by investors of a changing of the guard among companies dominating the world of computing.
The trend is toward companies that supply the means to improve office productivity, like Intel with its faster chips, and away from big mainframe and minicomputer makers like I.B.M. and Digital Equipment, Richard Whittington, a technology analyst at Gruntal, said. 
 "Clearly, investors wanting to invest in technology now see Intel as one of the core holdings and have moved away from the traditional core holdings, including I.B.M. and Digital Equipment," said Gordon Casey, head of investor relations at Intel, in Santa Clara, Calif.
The rally in technology stocks in the over-the-counter market has been led by Intel, the world's largest chip maker and dominant producer of 486 microprocessors, whose share price has soared 85 percent since Oct. 1.
The index of over-the-counter stocks gained 19.5 percent in that time, compared with virtually no change in the Dow Jones industrial average, which was stalled mainly by an investor stampede from I.B.M.
As a result of the rally, many large institutions have altered their investment plans and put more money into fast-growing smaller technology companies, while cutting back on high-priced, large growth stocks like Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart, analysts said.
"What you want to be out of is white-collar office employees," Mr. Whittington said. "That is where the substitutions are being made of computers for workers, and that is why Mr. Clinton's job retraining program had better work. A lot of people are being put out to pasture from traditional service and manufacturing industries."
Semiconductor stocks outperformed all other sectors on the New York Stock Exchange in 1992, a trend that many analysts expect will continue. Intel plans to introduce its newest chip, the Pentium, by March, which will more than double the processing speeds of the 486, to 100 million instructions per second.
Software companies like Microsoft and networking specialists like Novell, Wellfleet and Cisco have also been among the big favorites in the current technology rally because their products are linked to the productivity surge created since Intel introduced the 486 chip late in 1989.
Virtually all of Dell Computer's desktop models now carry the 486 chip, as do those of Compaq and AST Research. The shares of those three computer makers have soared. Dell, which traded at $27.625 on Oct. 1, was priced at $46.25 at the end of trading today in the over-the-counter market.
 
'Performance-Oriented'
 Mr. Casey of Intel said sales of the 486 chip may not peak before 1995, which suggests that companies with dominant or leading positions in products related to the 486 could have another few years of surging profits. And surging profits are what has caught the eye of investors' in the current rally.
"What is going on in the technology sector is that people are performance-oriented, and favorable earnings surprises are occurring, one after another, in technology," said Byron S. Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Intel contributed greatly to the enthusiasm this week, reporting that net income more than doubled in the fourth quarter, to $429 million, from $189 million in the period a year earlier. The fourth-period figure rose a stunning 78 percent from third-quarter earnings.
"The combination of Intel's phenomenal increase in output of its 486 chip and new software from networking companies has created a boom in office productivity just like in the early days of the personal computer in the early 1980's," Mr. Whittington said.
In addition, he said, big American semiconductor companies such as Motorola, which also reported strong earnings gains this week, and Texas Instruments, have been gaining market share from Japanese rivals.
 
Tracking the Chip Stocks
 Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a stock market research and consulting firm, said the current advance in prices for five semiconductor stocks began last year on April 14, with prices for the group increasing 87 percent through yesterday.
The companies include Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments. Mr. Birinyi has tracked the sector's performance since 1964, and its history since then indicates that the current advance can continue before a likely correction occurs. The group has had three periods when its price gains exceeded 100 percent, he said.
Daniel Klesken, a semiconductor analyst at Robertson, Stephens, in San Francisco, said the technology improvements provided by faster, smaller computer chips should continue "for the next 10 years."
Price declines in office computing made possible largely by cheaper, faster computer chips contributed to $47 billion in spending last year on office equipment used for computing, accounting and other white-collar activities, said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence.
That is a gain of 185 percent since 1980. If prices were held constant for comparative purposes, the spending increase was greater than eightfold, he wrote in a recent report.
Richard Hoey, manager of $148 million in the growth and income fund at Dreyfus, said semiconductor stocks as a group would not have risen so sharply if investors had been more confident in I.B.M. "But you would have had a rise in the leading stocks like Intel no matter what I.B.M. was doing," he said.
But even popular technology shares do not grow to the sky. The shares of Apple Computer lost $4.75 Friday after the company reported a decline of 2.8 percent in earnings for its first quarter of fiscal 1993.
Charles R. Wolf, technology analyst at First Boston, said investors caught up in Intel's earnings report on Wednesday had poured money into Apple shares, which were already considered quite pricey. "There was a lot of air in the stock relative to its prospects," Mr. Wolf said.
Apple's problem was one most companies would envy. It could not buy enough computer chips and other products to fill orders for its popular Powerbook notebook computers. Analysts said Apple has been unable to reduce an $800 million order backlog for the Powerbook.

HEADLINE: Property Values Fall in New York City

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The assessed value of property in New York City has fallen for the third year in a row, a decline that will cost the city millions in property-tax revenues in the coming fiscal year, city officials said yesterday. But revenues from other taxes are beginning to climb, officials said, as the city slowly begins to rise out of the depths of the recession.
The property-tax figures were released as the Dinkins administration worked on its budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1 and struggled to close a budget gap estimated at $1.6 billion. 
 The total assessed value of the city's real estate declined by 2.4 percent in the 1992 calendar year, to $77.3 billion from $79.2 billion, and has declined 16.3 percent since 1990, reflecting the continuing slump in the region's real-estate market. The latest drop will cost the city about $350 million in property-tax revenues in the coming fiscal year, the administration said.
But the drop in property-tax revenues -- the city's largest single source of money, accounting for about $8 billion of a $30 billion budget -- will be partly offset by gains in other city taxes, said Philip R. Michael, director of the city's Office of Management and Budget. He estimated that revenues from other taxes, including personal income taxes and bank taxes, would rise about $350 million in the next two years.
 
Reminder of Recession
 The bad news on property taxes and the more favorable projections on other taxes reflect the mixed state of the city's economy as it begins to shake itself from the recession. The real-estate values are in effect a lagging indicator, still bottoming out while other aspects of the economy start to turn upward.
The decline in assessed value affects all classes of property, from the giant Wall Street office towers to apartment complexes in the Bronx and single-family homes on Staten Island. Reductions in individual homeowners' tax bills, however, will be negligible, averaging about $15, according to city figures.
A week ago, the Dinkins administration was already busy wrestling with ways to close what had been projected as $1.6 billion deficit for the coming fiscal year. Since then, Mayor David N. Dinkins reached an agreement with the city's largest municipal unions that could, if approved, add another $428 million to that figure.
But Mr. Michael said that even though the projected deficit had not included the $350 million decline in property-tax revenue, a number of measures to close the gap had already been identified. These measures, he said, included a combination of bond refinancings, unspent revenues and unanticipated growth in other tax revenues.
 
Some Revenues to Rise
 "There have been a number of developments since the projections came out of the $1.6 billion gap," Mr. Michael said. "We are expecting an upsurge in certain revenue such as personal income tax and bank tax. So there are a lot of things that still need to be added and subtracted."
Mr. Michael said the city was also planning on $400 million from Albany in "Medicaid, educational and other relief." And he cited a $300 million tax package that must be approved by the State Legislature and noted a $700 million package of anticipated savings through personnel cuts, hiring freezes and early retirement program for city employees. "And we are counting on additional Federal aid of $250 million," he said.
Nonetheless, the prospect of lower revenues from property taxes is hardly welcome news for the Mayor. And some state officials said that the measures cited by Mr. Michael were by no means certain to happen.
The Mayor has pledged to freeze property-tax rates.
Allen J. Proctor, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which monitors the city's finances, said that the deficit carried potentially critical challenges for the city. "It means that with the labor settlement and this property-tax decline, we've added another $700 million to 1994's problems," Mr. Proctor said. "And now the city is going to claim that a stronger economy is going to cover these problems."
 
Problem Covering Loss
 Mr. Proctor said that increased revenues from other taxes would still leave the city with a huge problem in covering the projected drop in property taxes. "Even if the city is going to cover the $1.6 billion gap, it will have to have the other taxes grow at almost 9 percent," he said. "And that would be in a year in which we are expecting employment losses."
Billable assessments, the base from which the city collects real-estate tax revenues, dropped to $77.3 billion in yesterday's report, from $79.2 billion in January 1992. Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain said that the decline in assessments was a result of the decline in the market value of real estate.
"This will mean less revenue to the city," she said. "It will also mean lower taxes to New York City property owners."
"While some individual commercial properties and apartment buildings will still get assessment increases, the average New York taxpayer -- whether owning commercial or industrial property or an apartment building -- will see a tax decrease beginning in July," she added.
For those looking to acquire business space in New York City, the news has not been all bad. Ms. O'Cleireacain said that the median sales price for commercial and industrial property fell 9.5 percent in 1992, to $66 a square foot, from $73 a square foot at the beginning of 1992.

HEADLINE: An Alumnus in Space;
Bronx Students Talk to Astronaut From Their School

BYLINE: By LYNDA RICHARDSON

 BODY:
Ebony Miranda got a chance to talk to an astronaut in outer space yesterday. The 8-year-old from the South Bronx was more worried about making an extraterrestrial faux pas than about grilling Lieut. Comdr. Mario Runco Jr. on the principles of physics.
"I need to be relaxed," said Ebony, her hands fluttering as she sucked in a deep breath. "I've got to talk in a mannered way. I've got to say 'yes,' not 'yeah,' and 'excuse me?' not 'what?' or 'duh?' " 
 The third-grader from the Sacred Heart School rose to the occasion yesterday and kept her street lingo down on earth. As her teachers beamed, Ebony also gracefully quizzed the astronaut from the space shuttle Endeavor, which became an orbiting classroom through a live television hookup.
Ebony was one of six students chosen at her school to question Commander Runco, a former student at Sacred Heart, about motion and gravity in a 40-minute lesson called the "Physics of Toys." Commander Runco was one of four Endeavor astronauts who fielded questions from their old schools around the country in a lesson intended to show children how toys behave in weightlessness.
 
A Wind-Up Car
 The collection of toys, which included a wind-up police car on a circular track and balls that swing into each other to demonstrate the transfer of energy, was the lightest payload on board the shuttle. The Endeavor rocketed into space on Wednesday on a six-day mission with, among other things, a communications satellite, medical equipment and a device called a spectrometer that measures the temperature and composition of the gas between stars. After a daylong struggle, ground controllers fixed a malfunctioning detector on the spectrometer yesterday.
For the students at Sacred Heart, the toys in space experiment offered a lesson of hope, more than anything else. The inner-city parochial school has struggled for decades to provide a core of hope and stability in the High Bridge section of the Bronx. It is in a troubled neighborhood. Most of Sacred Heart's students are poor. Many come from single-parent homes.
"These children have dreams just like Mario Runco had when he was a child their age," said Joanne E. Walsh, principal of the school's primary division. "This has brought home the fact that they, too, can be whatever they want to be as long as they are willing to work at it."
 
'The Same Opportunities'
 Sacred Heart has changed a great deal since Commander Runco went to school there, officials said. Like many parochial schools in New York City, it has struggled with the recession, aging buildings and the social problems its students carry with them to school.
"Children are confronted today with situations that children 10 and 15 years ago did not have to confront," the principal said. "But we're determined that our children are going to have the same opportunities to dream as Mario Runco did."
Since last fall, the toys in space program has become a passion for many of the 832 students at Sacred Heart. Students immersed themselves in principles of physics and presented a list of questions to NASA. A science curriculum was designed around the program. Parents held a raffle so that three children could go to Florida to view the shuttle launching. Six students were elected by their peers to question Commander Runco.
Ruby Ulloa, a fourth grader chosen to question Commander Runco, said she had never been interested in physics or space before. But now, Ruby said, her horizon has been broadened because she knows the success of someone like Mario Runco.
Ruby was nervous about questioning the astronaut yesterday. But when it came her turn, she calmly asked Commander Runco whether a toy car needed to be pushed for it to go around a circular track. The astronaut responded that the car needed just a little push because it did not have to overcome gravity.
Jarrell Williams, a fourth grader, said merely watching the astronaut inspired him.
"He was a little kid like me, and he's now in space and experimenting with things," the boy said. "Since he went to this school, that makes us think if we learn and make good grades and go to college, maybe we can get a job like that, being an astronaut."
During the lesson transmitted to the students from 160 miles above the earth's surface, the students muffled their giggles as they watched the astronauts float around. The astronaut, a 1966 graduate, waved at the students. A few waved back.
"I really enjoyed talking to you," Commander Runco said. "I hope you realize that physics and mathematics are part of our everyday lives, including affecting things so simple as toys."

HEADLINE: '92 Consumer Prices Rose 2.9%, The Lowest Inflation in Six Years

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose by 2.9 percent in 1992, the best performance in six years, as inflation decelerated in nearly every major category, the Labor Department reported today.
Even more impressive, various analysts said, was that the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, eased to 3.3 percent. This was the slimmest rise since 1972, when the economy was subject to price controls imposed by the Nixon Administration. 
 Since food and energy prices often gyrate wildly, as they did in 1986 when the price of a barrel of oil collapsed into single digits, economists tend to consider the core rate a better gauge of underlying inflation trends.
The year finished with the best overall performance since July. In December, the Consumer Price Index rose only one-tenth of 1 percent, an increase that was heavily influenced by holiday discounting of women's and girls' clothing.
The figures on consumer prices followed a report Thursday showing that inflation at the producer, sometimes called wholesale, level was practically nonexistent during the autumn. In fact, goods at both the intermediate and crude stages of production fell during this period.
While not representing sudden improvement, this week's results provide ammunition for those who have been urging President-elect Bill Clinton to decide on a hefty package of fiscal stimulation soon after taking office next week. Projections of enlarged budget deficits by the Bush Administration last week had generated fresh fiscal caution in the Clinton camp.
The good inflation news was also likely to reassure the inflation hawks at the Federal Reserve as it approaches a crucial early-February meeting on the course of money policy. Some Congressional Democrats and other Fed critics have been complaining loudly about lagging growth in some of the broad gauges of the money supply.
Relatively few people expect significant inflation pressures to reappear anytime soon. They cite, among other things, the continued slack in the economy, a condition largely unaffected by economic pickup of recent months.
"We continue to make progress" toward price stability, said David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. "We see inflation coming down even though the growth rate has clearly picked up" to more than 3 percent.
In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve found that industrial production moved up three-tenths of 1 percent in December, the third straight gain, but that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines and utilities edged up only to 79.3 percent, scarcely higher than July's 79.1 percent.
"If there are any skeptics left about the likelihood of continued low inflation in the next year, if not two, today's number should help persuade them otherwise," said Robert Giordano, director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
He calculated that if the economy's pace should pick up to 4 percent, more robust than all but one of 50 forecasters polled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, it would still take two and a half years for inflation to reaccelerate. For inflation to become worrisome within a year, Mr. Giordano added, the economy would have to roar ahead at a pace upward of 6 percent.
But the benefits of low inflation -- a welcome accompaniment of what has been sluggish economic growth -- do not necessarily mean higher living standards for consumers. The Labor Department also calculated today that average weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.3 percent in 1992.
 
Workweek Shrinks
 This reflected a 2.2 percent rise in hourly earnings, a 36-minute shrinkage in the average workweek and the 2.9 percent rise in prices.
Before seasonal and price adjustments, the average urban worker earned $369.84 a week last month, compared with $364 in December 1991.
Last year's 2.9 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index is the lowest since a 1.1 percent gain in 1986.
For 1992 as a whole, inflation eased for every major category but transportation, where higher costs of gasoline pushed prices ahead 3 percent after falling 1.5 percent in 1991. Food, housing, apparel, entertainment, "other" goods and services and even medical care all rose at a noticeably slower pace.
In medical care, weighted to account for 6.7 percent of the consumer's market basket, prices advanced 6.6 percent, the lowest since 1987. For 1991, medical inflation was 7.9 percent, down from 9.6 percent in 1990.
At 3.3 percent, the 1992 core rate compared with 4.4 percent in 1991 and 5.2 percent in 1990. It was also the lowest rate since the 3 percent recorded in 1972.
 
Food Edges Up
 In December, food edged up two-tenths of 1 percent after two months of no change as a jump in the price of fresh vegetables and higher cereal and bakery prices more than offset declines for fruit.
Housing rose just one-tenth of 1 percent, mainly reflecting lower prices for household fuels and other utilities, while transportation eased one-tenth of 1 percent with the aid of a sharp drop in the price of used cars after an eight-month run-up totaling more than 10 percent.
The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers now stands at 141.9, which means that the group of goods and services that cost $10 in the base 1982-84 period now costs $14.19.
Services, which account for about 55 percent of the index, rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month while commodities, accounting for 45 percent, fell by that amount.
The industrial output data, which cover about 30 percent of the economy, showed further limited gains. The December increase, three-tenths of 1 percent, was the third in a row and was accompanied by an upward revision for October, to a seven-tenths of 1 percent improvement from five-tenths.
Motor vehicles accounted for the bulk of last month's rise, which otherwise would have been just one-tenth of 1 percent, the report showed.
Output at factories climbed five-tenths of 1 percent for the second straight month while the nation's mines raised output two-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher On Europe Rate-Cut Rumor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher in New York yesterday amid rumors that Germany and France would cut important interest rates over the weekend.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $327.00, off 30 cents an ounce from Thursday. The Republic National Bank quoted gold at a late bid price of $327.40, off 5 cents an ounce. 
 "People were pushing around the rumor that we're seeing some type of rate cut out of Germany and France," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign-exchange dealer at the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
"This is not an uncommon type of rumor to happen when the U.S. will be out of the market" over the weekend, Mr. Waxman added. "It forces the Americans, if they accept the rumor, to start accumulating dollars because they think it's a good position to play."
The dollar traded in a narrow range most of the day. It had little reaction to economic data that showed that the United States economy is slowly improving but still has some big hurdles to clear.
Mr. Waxman called the data "not so terrible," but said the dollar would not respond decisively to economic news until the market got some clear indication from President-elect Bill Clinton about what he would do to improve the economy.
 
Dollar Up Against Yen
 In Tokyo, financial markets were closed for Coming of Age Day, a national holiday. In London, the dollar was quoted at 125.85 yen, up 0.20 yen from Thursday's close in Tokyo. It finished at 126.10 yen in New York, up from 125.85 Thursday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.5315, from $1.5380 late Thursday. In New York one pound cost $1.5305, down from 1.5380 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6360 German marks, up from 1.6245; 1.4975 Swiss francs, up from 1.4850; 5.5280 French francs, up from 5.5040; 1,501 Italian lire, down from 1,504, and 1.28205 Canadian dollars, up from 1.27925.
Dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's rates included: 1.6338 German marks, up from 1.6195; 1.4965 Swiss francs, up from 1.4815; 5.5240 French francs, up from 5.4880; 1.8361 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8210; 1,502.00 Italian lire, up from 1,501.00, and 1.2821 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2785.
Gold traded late in London at $327.70 an ounce, down from $327.85 late Thursday. But gold rose in Zurich to a late bid of $327.85 an ounce, from $327.45 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold fell 41 cents to close at $328.40.

HEADLINE: Post Publisher Says Deal to Aid Paper Is Virtually Dead

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Peter S. Kalikow, the publisher of The New York Post, said yesterday that a deal with an investor that could have stabilized the newspaper financially appeared virtually dead.
Therefore, he said, almost anything -- including a sale of a controlling interest in the newspaper -- is now possible. But The Post publisher, whose extensive New York City real-estate business is in bankruptcy, declined to say The Post is for sale. 
 "I'll do anything to save the paper," Mr. Kalikow said, "even if it means stepping down or giving up control. If that's what it takes, that's what I'll do." Mr. Kalikow is heavily indebted to a bank, Bankers Trust Company, and it is not clear whether he or the bank will control the newspaper's future.
The apparent collapse of the deal with the potential investor, Leon Black, a former investment banker, combined with Mortimer B. Zuckerman's purchase of The Daily News last week, could accelerate pressure on The Post, long the most vulnerable of the New York City newspapers.
It could mean that The Post is reaching the moment of truth forecast by newspaper analysts for years: The Post could either fall to the control of a well-financed owner who could attempt to revive it as a more active competitor in New York City or it could face a renewed financial crisis.
Mr. Black, news industry officials said this fall, was to have invested $10 million to $12 million and assumed liabilities for The Post's pension funds. Mr. Kalikow had been expected to use that money to modernize printing presses and otherwise steady the newspaper for what is expected to be a new war for readers.
Last month, as the negotiations with Mr. Black were deteriorating, Bankers Trust contacted Conrad Black, the newspaper publisher who failed in a bid for The Daily News, to try to interest him in The Post, newspaper industry and financial executives familiar with the negotiations said. They said Bankers Trust has contacted other major newspaper companies as well.
Conrad Black's New York investment banker, Martin E. Maleska of Veronis, Suhler & Associates Inc., confirmed that "Bankers Trust did contact us during December." But he said the newspaper publisher is preoccupied with a Canadian acquisition.
The industry and financial executives said Mr. Kalikow owes Bankers Trust about $30 million. They said that to cover the bank's exposure, Bankers Trust has insisted on obtaining a stake in the newspaper of about 30 percent.
Mr. Kalikow said that under the tentative agreement with Leon Black, Mr. Black was to have obtained 40 percent of The Post, Bankers Trust was to have received 30 percent and Mr. Kalikow was to have retained 30 percent. Mr. Kalikow is currently the sole owner of the newspaper, which he says has been breaking even recently after decades of losses.
That arrangement, Mr. Kalikow said, would have provided for "additional strong management with existing management" left in place, essentially assuring him a continued place as the publisher of The Post. It is not clear whether Bankers Trust has taken a strong position on whether Mr. Kalikow should remain in control.
Thomas A. Parisi, the spokesman for the bank, said none of the bankers involved would comment, and he said the bank is not "involved in or aware of" negotiations for anyone to buy a stake in the newspaper. Asked why the bank's statement appeared to contradict information from others involved in negotiations, Mr. Parisi said he could not elaborate.
Leon Black, a former chief of acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert who has recently been buying stakes in troubled businesses, was in Europe yesterday and could not be reached. But an associate who insisted on anonymity said the potential investment in The Post appeared to have been derailed because of a dispute between Mr. Black and the bank.
"From Leon's viewpoint, he was really looking at it as a business decision," Mr. Black's associate said. "He just decided it didn't make sense" after Bankers Trust insisted on certain terms.
Mr. Kalikow said the discussions about the potential investment with Leon Black were virtually at an end. "If the Leon Black deal isn't dead," Mr. Kalikow said, "it isn't alive by much."
In an industry that has often seen financial adversity make strange bedfellows, skeptics have wondered whether Leon Black was really working to take The Post from Mr. Kalikow under the guise of helping him.
Others have suggested that the Black-Kalikow talks were really an effort by one or both men to get into a position to sell The Post to Mr. Zuckerman or to negotiate some type of joint operation with The News.
Yesterday, some in the industry suggested that the failure of the potential bailout by Leon Black could be used by Mr. Kalikow to try to lure The News or New York Newsday's parent, Times Mirror Company, to make a bid for The Post to remove it as a competitor. Neither Newsday officials nor Mr. Zuckerman have publicly expressed interest in purchasing The Post.
News analysts in recent years have said, however, that so many of The Post's readers also read other newspapers that it has diminished as an important competitor.

HEADLINE: Turning Out the Lights on the Lanes

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LARCHMONT, N.Y., Jan. 12

 BODY:
The balls still rumble down the floodlit lanes and the pins still thunder with each strike, but the sounds at Loyal Inn Bowling are a thin echo of earlier days.
"When I was a kid this place was wall-to-wall people," said Robert DiMicelli, a son of the owner of Loyal Inn, as he looked around the 48-lane bowling center where only four lanes were in use. "It's a shame to see it go down like this." 
 Loyal Inn is the last of seven bowling alleys that once hugged the eastern shore of Westchester County and, like alleys across the United States, it has been battered by profound changes in American family life and by a transformation in the way Americans spend their leisure hours.
 
Less Time for Bowling
 Many of the women who once filled bowling alleys in the morning hours now spend their days at work. And fewer men seem able to commit to spending one night a week as members of bowling leagues, the backbone of the business.
"Women want their husbands home and they give them a little more static than they used to 10, 15 years ago," said Jay Tartaglia, whose Rye Ridge Bowling in Rye Brook closed last April.
Over the last generation, bowling promoters say, athletics-minded Americans have come to prefer high-energy sports like jogging and racquetball while the more passive sports enthusiasts have chosen to collapse at home with rented videos or the rich assortment of sports shows on cable television. The ranks of people who go bowling, a sport that requires only moderate exertion, have been gnawed away from both sides.
Finally, bowling alleys make no economic sense in parts of the country that have seen rents soar.
"The land that a bowling center is on is worth more as something else: an office building or a shopping strip," said Mark Miller, assistant editor of Bowling Magazine, published by the American Bowling Congress, the leading membership group.
For all these and many more reasons, Loyal Inn is now seeking permission from the Town of Mamaroneck, which embraces Larchmont, to convert itself into a five-store shopping strip that will contain satellites of the Staples office supply and CVS pharmacy chains.
If that happens, Loyal Inn will share the fate of 3,500 alleys across the country that have closed in the past 30 years. According to the American Bowling Congress, in the peak year of 1963 there were 10,883 bowling alleys in the United States. Last year, there were 7,395.
 
Fewer League Bowlers
 The number of occasional bowlers -- those who bowl at least once a year -- is still impressively high -- 82 million. But the number of league bowlers is down to 6 million, and, according to Mr. Miller, has been declining by 3 to 6 percent a year. As a result, New York City, which had 160 bowling centers three decades ago, now has just 42, and Milwaukee, Detroit and other meccas of bowling have seen similar erosions. High-tech bowling emporiums have been opened in the Sun Belt and southern New Jersey, but those moves have not been enough to offset the nationwide decline.
Loyal Inn's 62-year-old owner, Vincent DiMicelli, and his son, Robert, blame one specifically local condition for the downturn in their business -- the rising cost of housing in places like Mamaroneck and New Rochelle that have driven out their mostly modest-income clientele.
"We live in a white-collar area and bowling is a blue-collar sport," Robert said. "Executives and high-income people don't go bowling. Mechanics and bus drivers go bowling."
Mr. Tartaglia, who spends a good deal of his idle time hanging around Loyal Inn, believes bowling's blue-collar image is part of the reason for its decline.
"They all seem to relate it to being a Ralph Kramden kind of guy," he said of once likely customers who no longer return. "Remember that movie, 'Arthur.' Arthur wanted to go bowling and his butler said, 'Bowling?' or something to that effect. Or they talk of the kind of girl you used to pick up in a bowling alley."
In truth, Mr. Miller said, bowling is not as downscale as it is often pictured, with the median bowler's household earning $37,100, more than the national median of $28,906.
Loyal Inn opened 33 years ago in bowling's heyday, when the introduction of the automatic pinsetting machines and liberal financing by the two dominant equipment manufacturers, AMF Bowling Inc. and Brunswick Corporation, spurred the opening of hundreds of alleys, perhaps glutting the market.
Loyal Inn, named after a restaurant on the same spot that burned down, is a bunker-like 38,000-square-foot beige brick building squeezed between a car wash and a Saturn car dealership on a commercial stretch of Route 1. The tone of the place is set by an entrance sign that warns bluntly: "Don't Even Think About Bringing Your Own Food in Here."
 
Feeder Programs Dwindle
 Fifteen years ago, the elder Mr. DiMicelli said, at least 40 lanes were booked every evening through midnight by bowling leagues composed of area workers or residents. The alley's dim bar and its coffee shop throbbed with business. Now, two thirds of those leagues have dissolved, he said, as nearby plants have shut down and workers at the remaining ones prove harder to recruit.
Last year, a particularly ominous blow was the dissolution of a league made up of 20 Westchester high school teams that were a seedbed of serious adult competitors.
The elder Mr. DiMicelli, who can still bowl an impressive 200 out of a perfect 300 score, has had to darken half his lanes for most of the day as fewer and fewer bowlers seem to stream to his "center." (Image-conscious bowling promoters avoid the term alley as low-brow and even prefer using the word channel rather than gutter for the trough in which badly targeted balls wind up.)
"When women had to go back to work, that's when I got hurt," Mr. DiMicelli said. "They don't have much idle time to spend for bowling."
 
Exercise and Socialness
 Nancy Lang, a recreational therapist at Rye Psychiatric Hospital, is one woman who still bowls regularly, averaging over 200 and competing with the professionals.
"I like the exercise, the competition, the socialness of the sport," she said.
She does not regard bowlers as dinosaurs and blames the falloff in interest on the recession, which makes it more difficult for people to spare $12 to $14 for an evening of bowling. As the number of alleys dwindle, she said, more people will be discouraged by the sheer distances required to travel for a game.
Gazing across the largely empty expanse of lanes here, Mr. Tartaglia lamented the changes he's seen since he was a boy.
"Everything now is square footage," he said. "Everybody complains there's nothing for kids to do. You take this away from them, what are they going to do?"

HEADLINE: Rehabilitating a Shattered Credit Rating

BYLINE: By DEBORAH M. RANKIN

 BODY:
Byron, a 40-year-old hospital administrator, is a textbook example of how to restore a tarnished credit rating. He is nearing the end of a four-year effort to repay more than $30,000 in debts that accumulated after he lost his job in upstate New York.
The payments on those debts, which included an unpaid tuition bill, furniture loans and big credit card balances, were manageable as long as Byron was receiving a steady paycheck. "But we became accustomed to living up to our income," he recalled, and once his $55,000-a-year job evaporated, Byron, his wife and their two teen-age daughters were in trouble. (To protect their privacy, the family members asked that their last name not be used.) 
 Byron tried to negotiate with his creditors. "I would pay them what I could out of my unemployment check," he said, but while some creditors were understanding, others demanded immediate payment.
Eventually, Byron and his family relocated to the Portland, Ore., area, where they had relatives. By April 1990, he found another hospital job paying $10,000 more a year than his previous job.
 
No More Credit Cards
 But the hounding by creditors continued, and he sought help from a local consumer credit counseling service. The service interceded with the creditors and now Byron is paying $649 a month to satisfy the last of his debts. Family members have no credit cards -- the counseling service insisted on their surrender -- and operate on a cash-only basis. Without the ability to charge purchases, Byron said, "the last few Christmases have been terrible."
But the upside to this new-found financial discipline is that he can see a debt-free future -- perhaps this year if his wife finds a job and supplements the family's income, or by next year if she does not. The slow repayment of their debts, however, will be recorded on the family's credit history for years and make it more difficult for the family members to obtain credit in the future.
Lenders say that perseverance of the kind Byron is showing is the key to improving a bad credit rating. "Unfortunately, there isn't any kind of snap cure," remarked Rhonda J. Wills, a vice president for the Bank of Astoria, a small bank on the Oregon coast. "But over a period of time, no matter how bad the problem is, someone who is determined can do something about it."
 
The Importance of Rating
 Byron is a classic example of such determination. Not only did he notify all his creditors after he lost his job to let them know why he was behind on his payments, but once a new repayment schedule was agreed upon, he held to it.
People who do nothing to cure a bad rating may find it a costly decision. "Without a good credit rating, you may not be able to find an apartment or even get a job," said Jewell L. Bailey, vice president for education with the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Oregon, which handled Byron's case. "Many more employers are ordering credit reports, and a good report is often the deciding factor when a company must choose between one candidate and another."
If you have ever used a major credit card or financed an expensive purchase like a car, you probably have a record at one or more credit bureaus. They gather information on credit users and sell it to banks, finance companies and retailers.
The information shows what each account holder owes or has paid, whether the payments are up-to-date or overdue, and whether it has ever been necessary to take action to collect bills. Events that are a matter of public record, like bankruptcies, foreclosures or tax liens, may also appear in the reports.
Although the information in the reports is supposed to be accurate, it may contain errors or omissions that can make it difficult to obtain credit. The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you the right to have incomplete or inaccurate information corrected without charge, but a rising number of complaints about inaccuracies have prompted talk of stiffer legislation.
If an investigation does not resolve your dispute, you have the right to file a 100-word statement explaining your side of the story and the bureau must include this explanation in your report.
But what if the negative information in your credit report is correct? Then, there is nothing that you can do. Negative information can remain on a report for seven years, and bankruptcies for 10 years. And, in three special instances, negative information may be reported indefinitely: if you apply for $50,000 or more in credit, if you apply for a life insurance policy with a face amount of $50,000 or more, or if you apply for a job paying $20,000 or more (and the employer requests a credit report).
If you have a poor credit history, however, that doesn't necessarily mean you are consigned to an all-cash life until the reporting period expires. Because creditors set their own standards, not all will view your credit history in the same way. Some look only at more recent years to evaluate you, and may grant you credit if your bill-paying history has improved.
One approach is to apply for a "secured" credit card, in which your line of credit is secured by money you deposit with the lender. The amount you can borrow is linked to the amount you deposit; if you don't pay your bill on time, the bank can take that money to pay off your debt. (For list of institutions offering such cards, send $4 to The Bank Rate Monitor, Box 088888, North Palm Beach, Fla., 33408.)

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: End of a Bumpy Road;
Clinton Aides Wondering, 'Where's Our Honeymoon?'

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 15

 BODY:
After a campaign in which President-elect Bill Clinton was credited with skillfully dodging political trouble, his chief spokesman today found himself in the unusual position of acknowledging that the transition to the White House has been rougher than expected.
"Maybe all of us were a little bit surprised by how quickly this all comes upon you," said George Stephanopoulos, the communications director. "The transition really isn't a transition all the time. You're immediately faced with all the difficulties, all the decisions that come with being in office."
 
Relief at Transition's End
 At his last scheduled briefing here before Mr. Clinton is sworn into office Wednesday, Mr. Stephanopoulos wearily said he was "relieved to have the transition end." 
 In the last week alone, the former Arkansas Governor has been accused of backing off several important campaign promises, including pledges to cut the Federal budget deficit in half and to propose a tax cut for the middle class. He has had to defend the ethical conduct of two of his Cabinet appointees. Delays in the selection of his staff in the White House and in other sub-Cabinet jobs led to internal grumbling that he was micromanaging the process.
In addition, Mr. Clinton found himself scrambling to erase the impression created by comments in an interview that he would change American policy toward Iraq.
 
'Bumps in the Road'
 Acknowledging that there have been "some bumps in the road" and "not everything has gone perfect," Mr. Stephanopoulos implored reporters today to give the incoming President at least a brief honeymoon.
"I say judge the President-elect by his performance," he said. "Judge him by the plans that he presents to the Congress. Judge him by his actions in office and judge him by what he achieves."
But as he tried to account for Mr. Clinton's shifting positions, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "Obviously there are some changes between campaigning and governing, as you face new circumstances, as you face new complications."
Some Clinton aides say the recent problems result in part from the disbanding of the vaunted "war room" of top aides that Mr. Clinton relied on in matters of policy, politics and communications during the campaign. Some senior aides who took part in that operation, including James Carville, Paul Begala, Mandy Grunwald and Stan Greenberg, chose to leave the Clinton forces as they moved on to the White House.
 
'Uncertainty' in Transition
 Even the daily conference calls among top aides, which officials said were crucial in developing a daily message in the campaign, have not been revived.
The question facing Mr. Clinton, his aides say, is whether he can recreate a similar core of staff members who can help guide his decisions in the White House. Mr. Stephanopoulos said today that Mr. Clinton was considering establishing an operation similar to the war room in the White House.
Asked about the stinging remark Thursday by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, that he had heard a "clatter of campaign promises being tossed out the window," Mr. Stephanopoulos remarked that "there's a lot of uncertainty in the transition phase." He added, "We're, I think, caught betwixt and between."
Terry Michael, a Democratic strategist, said the mistakes come from a lack of experience. "I think the transition to governance is a much more overwhelming task than running for President," he said. "There aren't a lot of Democrats around who have any practice in Presidential transitions, so they're having to make it up as they go along."
Mr. Michael said the Clinton Administration is "going to have to play some catch up, but I believe that it's a good group of people."
 
Dearth of Appointments
 One criticism is that Mr. Clinton still has not announced any appointments for sub-Cabinet positions, but Mr. Stephanopoulos said the first round of names will be disclosed before the inauguration on Wednesday.
Transition officials said that former Senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat who was passed over for a Cabinet post, would probably go to the State Department as an undersecretary with a broad range of authority and a heavy emphasis on the economy.
Mr. Wirth was initially considered for a position as an undersecretary with responsibility for environmental and scientific affairs, but was said to have rejected the post as beneath his level of experience. Vice President-elect Al Gore, the officials said, intervened to create the new undersecretary position.
Since it could be months before Mr. Clinton replaces many Bush appointees in his Administration, Mr. Stephanopoulos said the holdovers will not be required to adhere to the new Administration's ethics requirements. Among those rules are provisions barring appointees from lobbying their former agencies for five years after they leave office.
Saying he wanted to put to rest "some concern expressed by a lot of holdover Bush appointees," Mr. Stephanopoulos said "the new restrictions apply only to persons appointed by the Clinton-Gore Administration."
The search for new officials took a new twist today when the Bush Administration sent letters to more than 650 political appointees demanding that they step down on Inauguration Day. But there are hundreds more lower-level officials who would not be affected by the letters, and could remain on the job until their replacements are named.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Democratic National Committee;
New Party Chairman Is Planning to Look Beyond Washington

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 15

 BODY:
In naming David C. Wilhelm, a 36-year-old political operative, to run the Democratic National Committee, President-elect Bill Clinton is signaling his intention to use the party to reach beyond the political confines of Washington.
Mr. Wilhelm, an affable Midwesterner who has spent the last year working the phones and stroking the egos of influential Democrats around the country as Mr. Clinton's campaign manager, likes that just fine. 
 "We ought to take the 500,000 people who donated to the party in this general election campaign," Mr. Wilhelm said in an interview today. "We need to turn that into five million. We need to be truly a grass-roots party, truly a party that reaches out into every nook and cranny of this country."
Mr. Wilhelm said he hopes to use his platform as the Democratic national chairman to fulfill some of Mr. Clinton's stated wishes that the party become an agent of political change.
"I think the Democratic National Committee will emerge as the principal vehicle for how President Clinton can communicate outside the Beltway," Mr. Wilhelm said. "That's an enormous job, but it's a very important part of the mission of the D.N.C. to create an environment in which he can succeed."
Mr. Wilhelm, whose selection by Mr. Clinton must be formally endorsed by Democrats in a virtually preordained, vote, was born in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., and reared in Ohio. He has spent most of his career working for politicians and on behalf of causes like tax reform, including a stint as director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a research group supported by organized labor.
But he gained his reputation as a strategist by managing the successful campaigns of Paul Simon for a Senate seat from Illinois in 1984 and Richard M. Daley for Mayor of Chicago in 1989 and again in 1991. He also worked on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s short-lived effort to win the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988, managing his Iowa operation before charges of plagiarism ended Senator Biden's candidacy.
And Mr. Wilhelm is credited with conceiving the idea for the post-convention bus caravans that won a wealth of favorable media attention for Mr. Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, and gave the Democratic campaign an aura of punching through politics-as-usual to appeal directly to voters.
 
Youthful Band of Supporters
 Mr. Wilhelm's election as chairman of the Democratic National Committee would make him the youngest person to lead his party at least since 1961, when the Democrats began keeping such records. He would also join the ranks of a remarkably youthful band of supporters that Mr. Clinton has surrounded himself with as he prepares to enter the White House next week.
Mr. Wilhelm is also different in both political and personal manner from his predecessor, Ronald H. Brown, a Washington lawyer who has long worked the corridors of power in the nation's capital and is now in line to become Mr. Clinton's Secretary of Commerce.
When Mr. Brown took office after the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, in 1988, his job was to mend a badly fractured party and provide a framework for a revival in 1992. Mr. Wilhelm's task, while less visible, is equally complex.
"The job is now very different," said Jim Ruvolo, a former Ohio Democratic chairman who is a member of the party's national committee and knows Mr. Wilhelm well. "The job now is for a technician who understands the Clinton coalition, who will use that coalition to help elect other Democrats, and to re-elect Bill Clinton and sell Bill Clinton's programs."
 
An Early Political Fight
 The son of an East German refugee, Mr. Wilhelm said he first became interested in politics by hearing it discussed at home by his parents, who considered politics and government to be useful tools for economic improvement.
He recalled a boyhood incident in which he got into a fist fight with his best friend. "He was for Goldwater and I was for Johnson, but I didn't know exactly why," Mr. Wilhelm said. "I went home and asked my father, 'Dad, why are the Wilhelms Democrats?' "
His father, he said, told him it was because Democrats "stand up for the little guy."
Mr. Wilhelm said he has "always viewed government as a means to provide economic opportunity." But he decided his highest personal calling was not elective politics when he ran for Congress from Ohio in 1988 and was badly defeated in the Democratic primary by John M. Buchanan. Mr. Wilhelm had returned to his home district after an absence of 10 years, and it the voters scarcely knew him.
In Chicago on the night Mr. Clinton won the Illinois and Michigan primaries, Mr. Wilhelm was being trailed by a television production crew that was taping a behind-the-scenes special on how campaigns are run.
When he was asked how the Clinton team planned to win the election, he paused and broke out in a broad smile. "I could tell you," he said, grinning at the camera. "But then I would have to kill you."

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Offers Guarantees if Kiev Backs Arms Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 15

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said today that he had offered Ukraine security guarantees against nuclear or conventional attack that would come into effect after Kiev's Parliament ratifies the first strategic arms reduction treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The offer came in a meeting with the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, who has promised that Ukraine will become a non-nuclear state within seven years, disposing of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles and other nuclear weapons it inherited after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
 But the Ukrainian legislature has delayed ratification of the treaties after criticism from some deputies that the maintenance of nuclear weapons would be the best guarantee against Russian aggression. Since they regard Russia as Ukraine's only potential enemy, it is unlikely that Mr. Yeltsin's pledge today will satisfy them.
Until Ukraine and Belarus ratify the first strategic arms reduction treaty, known as Start I, the sweeping Start II treaty signed by Presidents Yeltsin and Bush on Jan. 3 cannot go into effect, even if the legislatures in Moscow and Washington ratify it. Western diplomats are concerned that Mr. Kravchuk is delaying too long in pushing his Parliament to ratify the treaties.
 
U.S. Guarantees Asked
 Ukraine has asked for security guarantees from the United States and wants up to $1.5 billion in compensation for its nuclear weapons. In Washington last week, the United States also offered Ukraine unspecified "security assurances," to come into effect only after Ukraine becomes non-nuclear.
Mr. Kravchuk said today that the security guarantees would help persuade the Ukrainian Parliament to ratify the treaties. "We will be able to argue for this document in Parliament, and deputies without doubt will confirm their earlier decision on the non-nuclear status of our state," he said.
Mr. Yeltsin said the two countries, the largest states to emerge from the breakup of the Soviet Union, would also sign a separate agreement on how to dismantle and destroy the missiles in Ukraine, which are not under Mr. Kravchuk's operational control.
Western diplomats believe that the Soviet strategic rocket forces made the Ukraine-based missiles inoperable before the union collapsed. But the diplomats fear that Ukraine could learn how to use, maintain and retarget the missiles in a relatively short time.
 
Agreement on More Oil
 Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Kravchuk also agreed on slightly increased oil supplies from Russia to Ukraine and discussed how to restore disrupted economic and financial ties that are damaging the industry of both countries. Ukraine says it needs 45 million metric tons of oil a year, and Russia had said it could afford to provide only 15 million tons. Today, the ceiling was increased to 20 million tons.
Mr. Yeltsin seemed pleased by the meeting, saying: "The main political result is that we have remained friends. We had sufficient courage and brains to find solutions."
But the two countries have had bitter squabbles over control over the Crimea region and the Black Sea Fleet of the former Soviet Navy, as well as how to apportion the Soviet foreign debt and the shape and purpose of the Commonwealth of Independent States. But besides agreeing today on a new commander, Vice Adm. Eduard Baltin, for the Black Sea Fleet, now shared by both countries during a three-year moratorium on its division, little progress was made on those other issues.

HEADLINE: Nostalgia for Family Can't Undo Cutback Era

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Controversial Truth: Two-Parent Families Are Better" (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), David Popenoe portrays me as an antifamily extremist. Quoting from "Brave New Families," my book, he misrepresents my conviction that nostalgia for an idealized 1950's situation-comedy image of the family has harmful effects on most, increasingly diverse, actual families. 
 My book tries to grapple with the economic, political and social upheavals that underlie family shifts by documenting the suffering, heroism and creativity of ordinary people struggling to remake family life. Mr. Popenoe tries to convert misguided nostalgia for "Ozzie and Harriet" land into social scientific truth.
The view that two-parent families are better is neither controversial nor the confirmed empirical generalization Mr. Popenoe states. It is a widely shared prejudice whose validity cannot be confirmed by the studies he pretends to synthesize. Research on the effects on children of different family structures yields contradictory findings, and few comparative studies take adequate account of profound differences among families in economic and social resources, support networks, quality of child-care options or kin relationships.
Ignoring nearly 20 years of economic decline, social neglect and the erosion of public responsibility for collective needs, Mr. Popenoe blames the greed, narcissism and diversity of families for child neglect. He laments the possibility that we are rearing the first generation of children whose psychological well-being is worse than that of their parents, but fails to note that these parents are the first to be worse off economically than their own parents.
Although child poverty declined during the more socially conscious 1960's, it soared again in the publicly stingy 80's. Redirecting the public resources committed to one savings and loan bailout could do far more to improve children's lives than all the family values jeremiads in the land.
Not even a wild-eyed, antifamily extremist could deny that far too many children suffer serious deprivation or that most children (and their relatives) could benefit from massive infusions of the loving attention, economic and social security, innocence and optimism that "Ozzie and Harriet" families have come to symbolize. However, Mr. Popenoe and the family-values crowd confuse symbol with reality and misdiagnose the social sources of family distress.
The nostalgia they peddle is unhelpful to children or to a social policy arena that has been criminally slow to respond to family transformations. As we look forward to a new Administration and a new century, we need less scapegoating of families and more resolve to rebuild public responsibility for all our children and their kin.

Love Conquers All

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Popenoe may be correct that two-parent families are on the whole better (Op-Ed, Dec. 26), but as social scientists who study the family, we think his interpretation of the evidence is simplistic and may needlessly stigmatize children reared in families that don't meet the "Ozzie and Harriet" model. 
 Contrary to Mr. Popenoe, sociologists of the family are finding that the conventional two-parent household is less critical to the healthy development of children than previously believed. Single parenthood is usually part of a package of factors -- poverty and lack of education in the case of unwed mothers, emotional conflict, disruption and economic loss in the case of divorce. When these are taken account of, the effects of family structure itself are greatly reduced.
Children need love, encouragement and guidance. If they find it in a two-parent family, so much the better. But function doesn't necessarily follow form. Kids who grow up in two-parent families marked by serious conflict, or spouse and child abuse, are not better off.
And those who grow up in nontraditional families -- with only a loving mother or supportive grandparents or with a stepparent, even an alcoholic and occasionally abusive stepfather -- can turn out to be successful and admired. Our evidence? One was just elected President of the United States.

RONZONI PASTA PLANT IN QUEENS MOVING SOUTH

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
A plant in Queens that was the nation's main producer of Ronzoni pasta will shut down July 1, with the company relocating to Virginia and leaving 220 people out of work. Hershey Pasta Group, the parent company of Ronzoni, blamed prohibitive business costs in New York as a factor in the decision to move the operation to Winchester, Va. The announcement ends 43 years of pasta-making at the Long Island City plant. Ronzoni employees will receive severance payments and job placement services when the plant closes. Ronzoni must still repay $2.1 million owed on industrial revenue bonds the city gave the company before Hershey's ownership.

THE LOBBYISTS
How Influence Peddlers Get
Their Way in Washington.
By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum.
334 pp. New York:
Times Books/
Random House. $25. 
 LOBBYING is, paradoxically, one of the most ubiquitous and mysterious arts practiced in Washington. Virtually every Congressional office is a target. But precisely what occurs behind closed doors between lobbyist and lawmaker is often obscure.
Public hearings have become a stylized drama, in which expert witnesses and members of Congress recite lines written for them by their aides. When corporations and labor unions sway members of Congress, they are more likely to do so through the informal give-and-take of lobbying than through the choreographed drama of a hearing.
Jeffrey H. Birnbaum, a Washington reporter for The Wall Street Journal, assiduously followed a number of lobbyists in 1989 and 1990. He attended their meetings with one another and with members of Congress on Capitol Hill, at resorts and in the far-flung districts where grass-roots lobbying is performed. In "The Lobbyists," Mr. Birnbaum describes their techniques and tactics, suggesting why some succeed and others fail.
Mr. Birnbaum quotes one unnamed lobbyist as saying that being in his profession "has long been synonymous in the minds of many Americans with being a glorified pimp." The book shows why that description is no longer valid. To be sure, some lobbyists still do their jobs in smoke-filled rooms with whisky and good fellowship. But at least as many are experts on science, technology, tax law and other highly specialized topics.
Concern about the Federal budget deficit, Mr. Birnbaum explains, has transformed the lobbyist's work. At a time of record deficits, lobbyists must find some way to offset the cost of every bit of largess they seek for their clients. In other words, they must gore someone else's ox to fatten their own.
The book is full of fresh insights, amply supported with detailed evidence. Mr. Birnbaum observes that many of Washington's fiercest battles are between lobbyists for rival industries (truckers versus railroads) or between lobbyists for segments of the same industry (stock life insurance companies versus mutual life insurance companies). Trucking lobbyists, for example, resisted new spending for high-speed rail projects. Mr. Birnbaum shows the need for lobbyists to forge "coalitions of nontraditional allies," like that between universities and businesses to get more Federal money for research. He demonstrates how lobbyists can defeat their cause by overreaching or "overlobbying" -- which, he says, is just what the insurance industry has done at times. He notes that accounting firms have begun lobbying in a big way, often advocating the interests of companies they serve as independent auditors.
Moreover, Mr. Birnbaum shows how the notorious Washington "revolving door" works: Before leaving Capitol Hill, Congressional aides often choose their successors, the very people whom they later lobby. He gives several examples of this practice among aides to members of the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, the two panels that write the nation's tax laws.
But the book would have been stronger if Mr. Birnbaum had supplemented his meticulous observations with more analysis. He provides a wealth of case studies, yet they do not prove, as the subtitle suggests, that influence peddlers always get their way in Washington. Indeed, much of the book is concerned with the unsuccessful efforts of business lobbyists to persuade Congress to cut the Federal tax on capital gains.
Mr. Birnbaum writes that "most lobbyists in Washington represent corporate interests," and he focuses on them. But he appears to underestimate the role of lobbyists for nonprofit groups that portray themselves as defenders of the public interest: consumer groups, environmentalists, Common Cause, Citizens for Tax Justice and others. They may be less numerous than the corporate lobbyists, but on some issues they can be just as effective at influencing legislators and manipulating public opinion. They often shape the climate in which business lobbyists operate, so they are probably entitled to more attention than they receive from Mr. Birnbaum.
This book emphasizes the process of lobbying over the substance of legislation, and that is fine. The passages describing people, their triumphs and disappointments, are much more readable than the sections analyzing legislation. Mark Bloomfield, president of the American Council for Capital Formation -- a man described by the author as "Mr. Capital Gains" -- figures prominently in the book (though at the end it is still not clear whether he is an eccentric obsessed with cutting the capital gains tax or the spokesman for a major political and economic force).
What Mr. Birnbaum demonstrates conclusively is that lobbying is a shrewd investment. Good lobbyists may get a half-million dollars for a particular assignment, but they can win tax breaks worth many times that amount for their clients.

HEADLINE: The Company He Keeps

BYLINE: By Michael Kelly and Maureen Dowd; Michael Kelly and Maureen Dowd are White House correspondents for The New York Times.

 BODY:
We're in a reaching out sort of mood this Inauguration. We're connecting. We're opening up. We're celebrating diversity and embracing wholeness. We're on an odyssey of self-discovery. We're thinking communitarian, New Covenant, a Government that looks like America, inclusive not exclusive, omnicultural. We're having Renaissance Weekends, wearing our names strung around our necks on pieces of colored yarn and talking about renewal of nation and self. We've released our inner children and are looking for nannies for them. We're feeling a little weepy, but that's O.K. (and you're O.K., too, although your family's dysfunctional). We're wearing clothes that look like the Summer of Love, only a lot more expensive, and the designer gives part of the profit to Friends of the Earth. We're not buttoned down and monogrammed anymore: We have a President named Bill, a First Lady named Hillary, a First Daughter named Chelsea and an Attorney General named Zoe. We're hugging trees. We're hugging each other. We're hugging each other's trees.
The Co-Dependent White House is upon us. The President likes to talk of his family's two generations of compulsions (stepfather an abusive alcoholic, mother a gambler, brother a recovering cocaine addict, himself a fast-food addict). He has admitted to marital problems and has been through family therapy for his brother's addiction. 
 Vice President-elect Gore also became involved in family therapy as his son was recovering from near-fatal injuries sustained in 1989 after he was hit by a car. In the ensuing years, Gore developed into something akin to the nation's first Senator-Shrink. He enjoyed weekly visits from a therapist in his Senate office, once conducted a group seminar on dysfunctional families and, in the wake of Anita Hill, was host of a consciousness-raising "gender dynamics" seminar for Slow-to-Get-It Senators and their spouses. He decries "psychic numbness," quotes John (Healing the Shame That Binds You) Bradshaw, and has written a book mixing ecology and psychology in sentences like ". . . just as the unwritten rules in a dysfunctional family create and maintain a conspiracy of silence about the rules themselves, even as the family is driven toward successive crises, many of the unwritten rules of our dysfunctional civilization encourage silent acquiescence in our patterns of destructive behavior toward the natural world."
With their Iron John election-night clinch, Bill and Al struck a blow not only against psychic numbness but also against the unwritten political ban on male full-body contact -- strictly observed since the famous Richard Nixon-Sammy Davis Jr. hug in 1972 bruised the reputations of both men.
What it all comes down to is, we're relating again.
Of course, there are relationships and there are relationships. The word covers a lot of territory. Tristan and Isolde had a relationship. But so did Bonnie and Clyde. Scott and Zelda. Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson. George Bush and Ross Perot. David Letterman and NBC. John F. Kennedy and libido. Richard Nixon and bile.
Washington, never mistaken for Sunnybrook Farm, is, on the whole, more comfortable with the darker side of the relationship picture, preferring sharp elbows to Buscaglian embraces. As power transfers from George Bush to Bill Clinton, from the Republicans to the Democrats, the nation's capital is busy with the sort of relating it knows best: conniving and maneuvering, tossing and turning at 2 A.M. thinking about what jobs are available and whose back has to be climbed over, polishing the old brass knuckles and shining up the shiv. There's so much looking over shoulders that the entire city is practically pirouetting.
Here, then, in the spirit of new-age -- and age-old -- relationships, we offer six to watch as the Administration gets under way. How these liaisons, dangerous and otherwise, play out over the next four years will determine the essential character -- and success -- of the Clinton Presidency.
 
 
BILL AND AL
The Incredible Shrinking Vice President
 THE SCENE IS A familiar one. The new President is at the podium. He is talking on, in that Washington way, at length and about himself. A couple of steps back, tucked in the shadow of his right shoulder, stands the helpmeet, listening and smiling, with an occasional widening of the eyes to mark an especially orotund piece of rhetoric.
But with Bill Clinton, the adoring one standing in his shadow is not his wife, Hillary. (She is probably busy in a smokeless back room, vetting Supreme Court candidates.) It is Al Gore.
Like every marriage, the private relationship between Clinton and Gore is more complicated than the public one. The delicate tension of this uncommon partnership was revealed during the Vice Presidential debate in October, a night expected to be a cakewalk for an A-student over the class clown.
Instead, as Bill Clinton watched in growing frustration, Al Gore failed, time after time, to answer directly Dan Quayle's repeated charge that the Arkansas Governor did not have the integrity and character to be President. "Why the hell isn't Al defending Bill more?" one top campaign adviser asked another. Clinton aides muttered darkly that Al had missed five shots to stand by his man.
Afterward, Gore called a friend. "Do you think I should have responded more to the attacks on Bill?" he asked. "Some people are saying that, but I don't think that's fair."
To a few close friends, Gore confided that he had gone about as far as he thought he could in sticking up for Clinton. Famously straight-arrow, Gore was uncomfortable in the role of character witness to a man who has not always lived a life as careful and disciplined as his own, whose evasiveness was a problem throughout the campaign.
"He felt an inner constraint," says one Gore confidant. "He could not push himself to say something that would sound preposterous. As he said to me, 'There are certain things you can say and certain things you cannot.' "
When they next met on the campaign trail, the two men patched things up. Each recognized that theirs was a beautiful political friendship, not to be risked over misunderstandings, and for the rest of the campaign, Gore went to great lengths to defend Clinton's character. On election night, he delivered a long and sugary encomium to his boss: "He asked for your vote by challenging you to make America better. Where I come from, we have a name for that. It's called character."
For years before the 1992 campaign, the two Southern politicians had circled each other warily. One from the political aristocracy, one a charmed son of the meritocracy, each saw in the other an unswerving ambition, a sense of generational entitlement to the Presidency.
But these political siblings had their weaknesses. Gore, who had tried and failed to reach the White House on his own, was a man of such starchy manner and deliberate speaking style that he seemed, as the writer Michael Kinsley once noted, "an old person's idea of a young person."
In private, there was a playful side. Gore amused friends by balancing spoons and quarters on his nose and he repeated jokes at his own expense. (He told friends that one perk of the Vice President's job would be free medical care from the Forest Service: "They'll send over a tree doctor.") But his public demeanor was numbingly earnest, even by the standards of Washington, where the Senator had been known to show up at dinner parties with charts and graphs to illustrate a lecture on the fate of the ecosystem.
Clinton, by contrast, was a man of too many faces, all of them smiling. Beset by accusations of marital infidelity and draft dodging, his easy charm and seductive expressions smacked of the actor's artifice.
In their campaign symbiosis, each man helped diminish the other's flaws. Gore benefited from the reflected warmth of Clinton's social skills. More important, Clinton received from Gore a dowry, not of geographical balance or political supporters, but of image. With the square-jawed Dudley Doright from Tennessee by his side, Slick Willie from Arkansas did not seem quite so slippery. Having a Vietnam veteran as his running mate helped shield Clinton as he defended his own troubled war history. And with the openly affectionate Gores holding hands beside them, the Clintons were able to sidestep some old baggage, the appearance that their union was less a romance than an arrangement between two calculating souls. "It was like the gestalt theory -- the whole was greater than the sum of the parts," says Tipper Gore.
The two men campaigned together less like the top and bottom of a ticket than like two sides. They both had healthy egos. Clinton was, in the psychological jargon he favors, outer-directed; he craved the adulation he drew from crowds, so much so that he felt compelled to plunge into every rope line he saw, no matter how late the hour, and to keep talking even when audiences grew restless and reporters chanted "Get in the car!" Gore seemed curiously inner-directed for a politician, a man who was nothing so much as his own reflection. It was as though there were two Albert Gores on stage: one a Victorian maiden high on a pedestal; the other at the base looking up in admiration and wonder.
Having come to the relationship bearing a great gift, Gore was always determined to be treated with appropriate respect. He made the point in the Governor's mansion, the morning of July 9, as he and Clinton were rehearsing for the joint news conference they would soon hold to announce that Gore was joining the ticket. An aide, acting as reporter, threw out a question accusing Gore of being an environmental extremist.
Gore answered, but then Clinton cautioned, "We don't want to come off like a bunch of Greenpeace warriors."
Gore, the author of a best-selling psycho-environmental polemic, "Earth in the Balance," shot back: "What do you mean we, kemo sabe?"
After a tense moment, Clinton began to laugh, then everyone else did, too. From that day on, Clinton and Gore appeared as the Alphonse and Gaston of politics, handing off the microphone to each other on stage, picking up each other's points. Except for some Southern focus groups' grumping that the two looked like a couple of yuppies with cellular phones and Rolexes, the act went over big. While George Bush campaigned with rarely a mention of Dan Quayle's name, Clinton used Gore to great advantage, employing him to lead the attack on the Bush Administration's prewar coziness with Saddam Hussein, and to serve as ambassador to Jewish and environmental groups.
Gore used Clinton to achieve true national celebrity, glomming great gulps of time at their joint appearances, grabbing the microphone to interrupt Clinton in midsentence. Campaign insiders said that the words Clinton most feared were, "I'd like to add something to that."
But that was then. That was back when Clinton had to put up with all sorts of things. He doesn't now. He is President. And Gore is not. Clinton no longer needs Gore to rescue him, because when reporters ask Presidents questions about affairs, they mean foreign and domestic -- not extramarital. And those sorts of questions Clinton can handle on his own.
Those familiar with Vice Presidential territory say the job is always difficult for two reasons: The No. 2 has to try to use a largely ceremonial office to polish his reputation so he can someday run for No. 1, and the natural rivalry between the President's and the Vice President's staffs tends to magnify slights and miscues.
The supremely confident Clinton does seem prepared to give Gore a certain amount of influence and a good deal of attention. Gore's power was evident in the transition, as Clinton included him among the handful of people with a final say on Cabinet appointments. "At the table in the Governor's mansion, there were only five people present on a regular basis," says Mark Gearan, the Clinton aide who ran the Gore campaign. "Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Warren Christopher, Bruce Lindsey and Al Gore."
Gore's first big play was to block the selection of the former Vermont Governor Madeleine Kunin as Environmental Protection Agency chief. He preferred that the post go to Carol Browner, his 37-year-old former Senate aide who had most recently served as the Secretary of Environmental Regulation in Florida.
But Gore's ambition may outstrip Clinton's largess. Gore told friends during the transition that he expected to have serious say in at least three or four Cabinet appointments. Instead, a friend says, Gore was told, in essence, " 'Look, you can have Environment.' Then they give him the gift of letting him sit at the table." Gore was also disappointed when his two best Congressional friends, former Colorado Senator Tim Wirth and former New York Representative Tom Downey, were passed over for Cabinet seats.
During the transition, two top Gore staff members sat in the main dining room of the Capital Hotel in Little Rock and talked for an hour over breakfast about who might get the job of Clinton's chief of staff. "We've got to get someone in there who is going to look out for Al and not just Bill," one said.
But Clinton soon made it clear that he does not intend to gear his White House to protect Gore's interests. He chose the candidate most likely to give total loyalty to him -- his oldest friend, the Arkansas businessman Thomas F. McLarty 3d.
Another unfortunate omen for Gore came during Clinton's first press conference as President-elect, when he invited his Vice President to join him on stage, but made no opening for him to say anything. Gore stood silently, staring somewhat vacantly into the middle distance with his arms straight at his side. He looked, said William Kristol, Vice President Quayle's chief of staff, "like an environmentally correct wooden Native American outside a cigar store." The humorist Calvin Trillin later memorialized it in a poem for The Nation, asking "What's that, behind the President-elect --/That manlike object stiff from head to toe?"
No one knows better than Gore that he looks awkward hovering in his boss's shadow, and his friends worry that he might take Quayle's place as the favorite target of late-night comedians. "He's getting more and more stiff because he's cognizant of the fact that, as the Administration expands, his power contracts," says one Gore friend.
In response, Gore has developed a tendency to overcompensate. That was embarrassingly clear at the first really big show of the incoming Administration, the 19-hour talkathon in Little Rock on the economy. Clinton impressed many in the audience at the two-day forum with his knowledge of what he called "megaissues and metaissues" -- macro- and micropolicy, human infrastructure and information infrastructure and technological infrastructure and just plain old infrastructure. Gore chimed in from time to time, trying to show off his own command of policy arcana. But it came across as the class salutatorian trying to keep up with the valedictorian.
Gore also faces one nearly insurmountable obstacle to gaining real power in the new Administration. "Al Gore hasn't yet realized there is going to be a co-Presidency, but he's not going to be part of the co," says one Republican lobbyist, paying backhanded homage to the clout of Hillary Clinton. During the transition, Susan Thomases, Clinton's scheduler and a close friend of Mrs. Clinton's, told associates that Gore did not understand that, once the Administration got under way, he would have to adjust to a smaller role. He could make it easy, Thomases said, or he could make it hard. (Gore had had run-ins with Thomases and other Clinton staff members during the campaign: he wanted more bus tours with Clinton and more visibility in the campaign commercials, and he wanted to make more major speeches.)
One other sign of possible trouble ahead for Gore comes in a story told by a close friend. When the Vice President-elect and his wife did not show up on the invitation list for the highly publicized dinner party for the Clintons at the Georgetown home of the Washington Post Company chairwoman, Katharine Graham, Tipper Gore had to ask Hillary Clinton if that was what she really had intended. Mrs. Clinton said no and instructed a staff member to rectify the oversight. Meanwhile, Graham, who had originally intended to have a separate party for the Gores, had decided on her own to add them to the list. But the Gores blamed the Machiavellian work of Clinton staff members for not making sure they were invited in the first place.
It was for Al Gore a particularly pointed lesson in Vice Presidential humility.
 
 
 
BILL AND HILLARY
From Policy Maker To Cookie Baker and Back
 THE FIRST FIB WAS always that 1600 Pennsylvania was the only household in America where the wife had no say over what the husband did.
Even in the face of strong First Ladies like Abigail Adams, Mary Todd Lincoln, Edith Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, that fiction about Presidential domestic life persisted.
The Clintons hewed to the hoary "Father Knows Best" script long enough to win the Presidency, and then quickly put to rest the notion that East Wing never meets West. After the election, when he was asked whom he wanted in the room when he makes his big decisions, Bill Clinton replied "Hillary" -- shattering, with a single word, 200 years of Presidential protocol.
"If we disagree and I think I'm right," he told Time magazine, "I just go on and do what I think is right. And then she tells me, 'I told you so.' "
Those who try to Balkanize the influence of the new First Lady -- Is she responsible for the liberal Cabinet appointments? The number of women chosen for top spots? -- are underestimating her. "You can't disentangle the two," says one Democrat who has known the Clintons for years. Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton both came east to the Ivy League to remake themselves, and they ended up doing it together. Those who forecast marital tensions as Hillary, the liberal, tugs Bill, the centrist, to the left also misread the pair. "He's a hell of a lot more liberal than people understand," says their Democratic friend. "But he's guileful and he moves crablike, with certain kinds of conservative cover. Part of their initial attraction was that they are both very political people, and there's not a terrific ideological difference between them."
In the end, the ideological truth about the Clintons is like Poe's purloined letter -- so obvious that no one notices it, even though the couple point it out themselves. "It's rare that I think he's wrong," she said in one interview. "We think so much alike and our values are so much alike."
Both Clintons are committed believers in the liberal religion of their 60's college days, the promise that Government activism and central planning could solve the problems of private lives. But far from being liberal sentimentalists, they are political pragmatists. Both husband and wife were chastened by the lesson of Clinton's 1980 defeat in Arkansas: that the public does not like politicians who surround themselves with the kind of people George Orwell once described as "that dreary tribe of high-minded women and sandal-wearers and bearded fruit-juice drinkers who come flocking towards the smell of 'progress,' like bluebottles to a dead cat."
The real tensions in the Clinton marriage have been personal, not political. The focus was intensified by the role Hillary Clinton played in saving her husband's campaign. When she stood beside him, after he euphemistically confessed to past marital "problems," she was endorsing the idea that their marriage was real. As their poll taker, Stan Greenberg, conceded at the time, voters would reject Bill Clinton if they thought that he did not have the imprimatur of his wife, or if they thought the union was a phony arrangement fueled only by ambition.
Some friends say that the Clintons can be affectionate in front of others; campaign insiders say that, offstage, the candidate kissed his wife whenever he came into a room. Other friends, perhaps wishful thinkers, even see the strains in the marriage as evidence of its authenticity. As one dryly notes: "You couldn't sustain that level of irritation if it were an arrangement."
Yet the campaign image of their marriage was, in many ways, contrived. Last April, several of their top strategists sent the Clintons a long memo with suggestions on ways of making their relationship seem more affectionate and Hillary more traditional and maternal.
"More than Nancy Reagan, she is seen as 'running the show,' " the memo said. "The absence of affection, children and family and the preoccupation with career and power only reinforces the political problem evident from the beginning." The remarkably detailed course of action recommended for Mrs. Clinton included "joint appearances with her friends where Hillary can laugh, do her mimicry," a family vacation (preferably to Disneyland) and "events where Bill and Hillary can go on dates with the American people."
But whatever romance was dished up for public consumption, and whatever painful patches they have gone through in private over the years, the Clintons have a political partnership so tight that, as one former Carter Administration official puts it, "they make Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter look like strangers."
"I don't doubt that she's probably wanted to kill him sometimes -- and with good reason," says a lawyer who is a close friend of Hillary Clinton's. "But this relationship is more than a cold, practical bargain. They like each other immensely."
More than most Presidential marriages, the Clintons' will need to have a happy public face. The image of the incoming President as a honest, decent man depends on the carefully cultivated idea that though he may have sinned, he has been redeemed. "He can't play J.F.K.," says a top Democrat. "If he does, it would be a killer. All bets would be off."
Bill Clinton told his family long ago that he didn't want to marry a beauty queen. Rather, he wanted to marry the smartest girl in the class. When they met at Yale Law School, he was immediately drawn to her ambition, discipline and love of liberal causes, and since then he has never shown any desire to diminish her -- except when, as in the 1992 campaign, it was politically expedient to do so.
When George Bush decided to run for President, there were suggestions that Barbara Bush spruce herself up. "I'll do anything you want," she told Roger Ailes, the campaign media adviser, "but I won't dye my hair, change my wardrobe or lose weight."
By contrast, Hillary Clinton, supposedly far more independent, transformed her looks from plain to glamorous, from campus radical frump to blond Junior Leaguer with velvet headband -- a curtsy to the mainstream. After her husband's 1980 gubernatorial defeat, she also gave up her surname, Rodham, a sacrifice to prove she wasn't an uppity Northern feminist, and took the name Clinton.
But the R-word was always hovering, just out of sight. Even at the height of the campaign controversy over her crack that she could have just stayed home baking cookies and having teas, and even when she was in a tremendous rush, she always made sure to sign autographs Hillary Rodham Clinton, the same way she signed her tax returns. Staff members refer to her as H.R.C., which is also the magic-marker monogram on her bulging file boxes.
Other First Ladies perpetrated the myth that they would never think of talking to the President about anything as serious and complicated as foreign affairs, but they might whisper to him about some White House staff member who was overstepping bounds. The new one isn't playing that game.
The real Hillary Clinton, superseded for much of the 1992 campaign by a quiet, smiling baker of cookies, popped back up in an interview with Ted Koppel broadcast on Election Day. The Clintons sat side by side in their airplane seats, and twice, as Koppel directed questions to Bill, Hillary answered for him. Her husband did not seem to mind, nor even particularly to notice.
Mrs. Clinton also sat in on her husband's "Man of the Year" interview with Time, boldly answering questions about policy and politics and speaking not of "he" but of "we." That idea is beginning to sink in. Even the Rev. Billy Graham, who will deliver the Inaugural invocation, recently said that Bill and Hillary "will make a unique team to help lead America and the Western world at this period of history."
Clinton staff members are just as scared of offending Her as Him (the Clintons both have a temper with aides if something is not done to their liking), and they know that if She tells them to do something a certain way, they don't have to double-check with Him.
They don't argue about it, either. During the transition, Clinton's staff worked out the usual arrangement by which the President-elect is always covered by a small pool of journalists. One afternoon during their New Year's vacation in Hilton Head, S.C., the Clintons decided to go for a bicycle ride on the hard-packed sandy beach. As they were leaving the house, Mrs. Clinton noticed two pickup trucks, carrying the journalists, getting in position to accompany them on the ride. "No trucks," she said abruptly to the Secret Service agent in charge. And so in a second, because the next First Lady wanted more privacy, the agreement made by her husband's staff was broken.
With the possible exception of Dan Rather, no public figure is the recipient of more unsolicited advice than the President's wife. And the advice is often unpleasantly personal. How the First Lady dresses, how she decorates, what she spends money on, her social manners, the way she raises her children, the way she treats her husband -- these are all subjects the nation has felt utterly free to weigh in on.
Washington, a city prone to devour those who ignore its tribal rules, has always regarded First Ladies as particularly appetizing subjects. Presidential wives who have shown an independent turn of mind have quickly found themselves cast in the role of First Lady Macbeth.
"My sense is that Hillary will get brushed back a little bit," says Edward Rollins, the Republican strategist. "She's got to be careful not to overexpose herself or to play bad cop to Bill's good cop. She can't overshadow him or be perceived as manipulating him."
Sheila Tate, who saw the worst of what can happen to a First Lady's image when she worked as Nancy Reagan's press secretary, agrees: "No matter how careful the Clinton people are to point out how qualified Hillary is, there could be trouble. People don't like the wife mucking about in the husband's affairs. She wasn't elected and they just don't like it."
Mrs. Reagan has told friends that she empathizes with Mrs. Clinton's bumpy press coverage. "They were after me before I even got to Washington too," she told one confidante, and added this about Hillary Clinton's negative publicity: "It's not fair."
One night during the campaign, at a small dinner in a revolving restaurant atop a hotel in Covington, Ky., Mrs. Clinton wondered why Americans treated the First Lady's office as though it were Miss Havisham's dining room, circumscribed by the cobwebs of the past and great expectations for the future. She did not understand why people cared whether Rosalynn Carter attended Cabinet meetings. She did not see why she could not behave in the White House just as she had in Arkansas -- shepherding some legislation in areas of interest to her (education, for example), helping her husband choose who would run departments, being as deeply involved in policy as he.
Hillary Clinton's friends say she does understand, however, that as First Lady she will have to thread her way through at least three sets of demands -- feminists urging her to smash the mold, liberal interest groups wanting to coalesce around her and conservatives complaining she wasn't elected to anything. Like Anita Hill, she will undoubtedly come to serve as the canvas on which others, warring over the shifting role of women in American society, may paint their individual passions. She is clearly a First Lady with her own agenda and power base. What she cannot yet fully know is what structural tensions with the West Wing may surface, and whether she will be able to control the forces that seek to use her name and influence.
"Hillary feels like she's walking into Washington with her arms wide open and smiling, but she's watching on both sides," says Linda Bloodworth-Thomason, the Arkansas-bred television producer of "Designing Women," "Evening Shade" and "Hearts Afire" who has known the Clintons for years. "She's not a fool. She knows that Washington is treacherous." But unlike her husband, Hillary is not someone, Bloodworth-Thomason says, who "feels the overwhelming need to be understood and validated by everyone. She will do everything she can not to be misunderstood. Then she will be who she is and let the chips fall where they may."
But, as Mrs. Clinton has shown through much of her public life and particularly during the transition, she does not intend to jeopardize her husband's efforts to move his party toward the center -- efforts that are at the very heart of his political success.
The Clintons have been careful to keep a strategic mix of liberal and conservative in their Democratic appointments so far. And Mrs. Clinton shares with her husband an ability not only to look for compromise but also to keep both eyes on the prize. When two campaign honchos, Susan Thomases and Mickey Kantor, both "Hillary people," crossed swords with political advisers during the campaign and transition, they were the ones who were forced to back down.
"Hillary is willingly taking on the freight of a lot of liberal groups," says one prominent Southern Democrat who knows the Clintons. "But she is not a little high priestess of idealism, either." The Democrat points out that while Mrs. Clinton served on the board of the liberal-activist Legal Services Corporation, she also served on the board of Wal-Mart and has been a corporate litigator for the Rose Law Firm, one of Arkansas's three largest.
Mrs. Clinton is still struggling to figure out how to bring her role into modern times. She has speculated with friends about the possibility of a job outside the White House, teaching law part-time perhaps. She does not know to what extent she should formalize her position in the new Administration. Should she be in the paper loop of critical documents, or should she just wait until evening to look at them? Should she have office space in the West Wing, to be closer to the action? She still feels she was burned during the campaign by her husband's open talk of giving her a Cabinet post and by the use of the motto, "Buy one get one free." She wants to tread more gingerly now.
But there are signs that the new First Lady has little patience for what is conventionally expected of the attentive political wife. At the end of the Clintons' Hilton Head bike ride, he stopped to play a game of touch football with their daughter, Chelsea, and 40 or 50 others, in front of a cordon of cameras eager for a happy-family-at-play shot. Hillary Clinton never paused in her pedaling but sailed serenely on, without a backward glance at the scene behind her.

 
 
BILL AND HIS ENEMIES
The Top 10, Even Before He Takes Office
 CLINTON'S FRIENDS LIKE to say that he cannot hold a grudge. And indeed, the President-elect's instinct for consensus is so strong, going back to his earliest days as a play(Continued on page 48)
ground glad-hander, that this chronic conciliator does seem incapable of personal vendetta. But that hardly matters. Bill Clinton's closest advisers, beginning with his wife, are more than capable of making up any shortfall.
Even before Inauguration Day, the Clinton enemies list is longer than George Bush's was after four years. Herewith, the Top 10 at the moment:
 John Major, Prime Minister of Great Britain, for sending Conservative Party strategists to Washington to advise Bush's campaign on how to beat Clinton.
 Jerry Brown, for being relentlessly annoying, for not knowing when to quit and go home, for just generally being Jerry Brown.
 Representative Charles Rangel of New York, for unhelpfully pointing out, again and again, how little time Clinton was spending in poor black neighborhoods.
 The Democratic Governor of Maryland, William Donald Schaefer, for, amazingly, endorsing Bush.
 Clifford Jackson, a former Oxford Friend of Bill's turned enemy, for his unceasing peddling of dodge-the-draft stories.
 Republican Representative Robert K. Dornan of California, for being the architect of the McCarthyite assault to depict Clinton as the last pinko.
 The former Republican Representative from Michigan Guy Vander Jagt, for holding a news conference two days before the election to accuse Clinton of having carried on a campaign-trail affair -- without a scintilla of evidence.
 Marilyn Quayle, Rich Bond, Bob Novak and anyone else who ever said, implied or even thought anything mean about Hillary.
 NBC (the Nail Bill Clinton network, staff members called it), especially the correspondent Lisa Myers and the magazine program "Dateline: NBC," for its long piece during the primaries examining whether, as Governor of Arkansas, Clinton had sought to cover up two allegedly fatal mistakes by his mother as a nurse-anesthesiologist.
 Mary Matalin, the acid-tongued Bush deputy campaign manager, who once insinuated that Clinton was a "philandering, pot-smoking draft dodger." Yet Matalin gets a special Presidential pardon on the grounds that she is already undergoing the punishment of writing a "he said, she said" campaign memoir with her lover-political foe, James Carville, sentencing herself to relive her mistakes and his shrewd moves.
Aside from those whom Bill Clinton has reason to dislike, there is another growing list of people who have reason to bear him ill will. Heading that list at the moment are former Senator Wirth, former Governor Kunin and the Washington lawyer Brooksley Born, the one-time leading candidates to head up, respectively, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department. They all came away from talks with Clinton believing they had been chosen, only to lose out at the last minute.
How many enemies a politician makes is not much help in forecasting how he will fare. Richard Nixon stumbled with an extremely long list and George Bush stumbled with an extremely short one. All his life Bill Clinton has tried to avoid having any enemies at all. But the President-elect seems to offend as many people by making them think he agrees with them as he would if only he let them know that he didn't.
 
 
 
BILL AND HIS FRIENDS
It's Payback Time
 FOR THE FIRST Democratic President in 12 years, enemies are not the biggest problem. It's his friends that Bill Clinton has to worry about.
Not his real friends, but his professional ones, the organizers and members of Democratic interest groups. Each faction, from Act Up to Zero Population Growth, holds itself responsible for at least a piece of the Democratic victory, and each wants at least a piece of the President in return.
With his oft-repeated campaign promise of "a Government that looks like America," Clinton had fed the expectations of all. But there was only so much pie to go around, and, by halfway through the transition, some of the President-elect's constituencies were turning on him, and on each other.
"Lesbians to Clinton: Why no Dykes in the Cabinet?" asked a news release from the homosexual activist group Queer Nation.
"Department Secretaries Named to Date: Total: Male 3, Female 1; White 3, African-American 1," counted the Coalition for Women's Appointments during the selection process.
"Dear Mr. President-elect, environmentalists worked very hard to help you achieve victory in November," wrote the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters. They were trying to bring Clinton back to the fold after he had selected Hazel O'Leary (black and female) as Secretary of Energy over Tim Wirth (a white-but-environmentally-correct male).
Responding to all the pressures, Clinton complained, calling the feminist pressure groups "bean counters" who were "playing quota games and math games." Some said the outburst was calculated to distance himself from the feminist lobby and to send a warning signal to all the pressure groups to back off. That may have been the case, but Clinton did seem genuinely outraged, his face red, his voice edged with sharp anger.
His feminist friends shrugged the scolding off. "Right now, he's just starting to squirm a little," says Patricia Ireland, the president of the National Organization for Women.
It boggles the mind, but Bill Clinton may have even more friends than George Bush. The President-elect, one of the great Rolodexers of modern times, has been networking and cultivating the rest of the human race on a vast scale since childhood. Is there a city in America that doesn't boast at least a few people who call themselves F.O.B's? The sheer volume of these friends, with their cacophony of points of view and competing desires for White House access, can mean trouble down the road for the new President.
Republicans eagerly anticipate a four-year siege of Bill's friends trying to push him this way and that. "If this continues," says Dan Quayle's speech writer, Lisa Schiffren, "those of us who are packing up our offices now will be packing up to move back in again in four years."
 
 
 
BILL AND HIS DIET
The President as Omnivore
 WHEN Barbara Bush began living at the White House, she worried about all the elaborate meals she was about to be served and how they would affect her weight problem. But when the White House waiters began putting plates in front of her, she noticed something strange: the portions were puny. "Why aren't they feeding us?" she wondered, telling the story later to friends.
Then Mrs. Bush realized what the problem was: the chefs had been instructed by Nancy Reagan to serve social X-ray portions. But Mrs. Bush decided not to reverse the policy of less-than-normal-size meals. "She figured it was good for her and the President to just ask for seconds and thirds," says a friend of Mrs. Bush.
If Hillary Clinton also adheres to to Nancy Reagan's Lean Cuisine regime, expect the local Domino's Pizza to be getting plenty of 3 A.M. calls from the White House.
We have seen the President as communicator, the President as warrior and the President as healer. Now comes the President as omnivore.
"He eats like a Tasmanian devil -- Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, tin cans," says Mort Engelberg, a Hollywood producer ("Smokey and the Bandit") and occasional Clinton adviser who shares Clinton's accordion appetite. "You'll never find this guy asking for a splash more coffee. He's not a nervous eater. He enjoys it."
Engelberg claims that during the campaign, Clinton had a special radar for finding a Dunkin' Donuts in the middle of the night in small towns. "He'd say, 'Let's just get a cup of coffee,' but then he'd end up eating donuts and soup and broccoli with cheese."
Clinton is not the only President who tends to get, as he likes to put it, "fat as a wood tick." The first thing William Howard Taft did after his Inauguration was to flop his 300 pounds onto a White House sofa, just to prove he was President and could bust any spring he liked.
George Bush eats like a teen-ager, gobbling down nachos, steaks and egg rolls with equal gusto, and once ingested the most disgusting breakfast in Presidential history: oatmeal with a Butterfinger bar crumbled on top.
Clinton eats like a teen-ager, too. Linda Bloodworth-Thomason laughs about her old pal's habit of reaching over and spearing something on a companion's plate, noting, "You don't want that, do you?"
Bill Clinton's favorite foods include chicken enchiladas, tacos, barbecued ribs, cheeseburgers, lemon chess pie, peach pie, beef tenders marinated in Italian dressing and his mom's sweet-potato casserole. (Take 6 pounds of mashed sweet potatoes. Add 1 pound of brown sugar, 3 eggs, half a pound of butter and a pound and a half of sweetened condensed milk. Flavor with nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, allspice and nuts. Top with 10 ounces of melted marshmallow miniatures.)
His weight fluctuates by about 40 pounds, beginning at a minimum of 190 and going up to 226. One of his more embarrassing food moments on the road came when a customer at a Taco Bell greeted Clinton by reminding him that they had met before -- at a Pizza Hut.
James Carville, Clinton's wiry chief political strategist, recalls eating many an awful plane meal with Clinton. A former heavyweight himself, Carville marveled at the candidate's cheerfully gluttonous feeding patterns. "We would get warmed-over lasagna and two-day-old salad, the worst stuff I had since the Marines, and I never did see him complain," he says. "I suspect if they give it to him, he'll eat it. If the White House chef comes down with an elaborate duck a l'orange, he'll eat that, too."
Clinton's eating habits have already turned into something of a national joke. Political cartoonists have portrayed him with his cheeks swallowing up his eyes, while comics and esthetes alike have begged him to stop wearing short shorts while jogging. "Saturday Night Live" depicted the President-elect in a sketch ending a 30-foot run at a McDonald's, where he foraged through the room snatching burgers and fries from startled customers. Jay Leno asserted that Clinton needs to appoint "a Thighmaster General," pointing out that Vice President-elect Gore is "just a Big Mac away from the Presidency."
Warning that the well-upholstered Clinton and Gore might, should their padding increase, become known as "the Blubber Bubbas," the writer and noted eater Calvin Trillin envisioned mud-throwing Republicans questioning whether "men who order the cottage-cheese-and-fruit salad and then pick at a companion's double order of cheese French fries to the point at which the plate requires no washing are really the sort of men you want making life-and-death decisions for this nation."
Even Clinton's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said at a recent political dinner in Washington that those who were skeptical when Clinton said he "didn't inhale" had clearly never been to a McDonald's with him.
But girth is no laughing matter to the gastronomically correct. A group of chefs led by Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, the exceedingly cutting-edge Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, sent the President-elect a snippety letter urging him to appoint a White House chef who would serve food that shows "care for our waters and pastures."
Clinton, reasonably enough, did not feel the need to respond personally to a dietary tract that included among its signatories Paul Prudhomme, the New Orleans chef who has singlehandedly refuted the poet John Donne's contention that no man is an island.
But will the new President continue to flout the social conventions of a nation of Stairmasterers? Calvin Trillin respects Clinton for going beyond what he disdainfully calls the "show eating" of George Bush -- who used pork rinds as a political statement -- and defended the Clinton sweet-potato-casserole recipe as "not as bad as Tricia Nixon's Chicken Divan."
"I'm not so sure how deep into society this whole calorie-counting, cholesterol-watching, stair-stepping sickness ever really went," Trillin says. "The Clinton Administration could be like the Day the Fat People Invaded. This sort of eating may very well be the secret of Clinton's appeal, his link to the common man."
 
 
 
BILL AND THE CAMERA
Are They Spending Too Much Time Together?
 IT WAS ABOUT HALFWAY between Election Day and Inauguration Day that it began to dawn on people that there was simply no escaping Bill Clinton.
It had become almost impossible to turn on a television set without seeing the President-elect talking or waiting for his turn to talk while someone else talked to him. C-Span had come to resemble some sort of 24-hour Clinton channel: "All Bill. All the time."
The deluge reached biblical proportions at the Little Rock economic conference, a made-for-television event featuring more than 300 people talking for 19 solid hours. Clinton, clearly in his element, had never seemed happier.
"And so the specific question I wanted to ask is in this whole idea of redirecting the $15 billion," he told one participant in a discussion on defense conversion. "Do you think we ought to do it through the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency, through a new agency, through expanding that mission? And how, as a practical matter, based on your own experience in this area -- how much dual-use technology can we really do that will benefit, truly benefit both the commercial sector and the defense sector that we're not doing now?"
When it came time on the second day of the conference to break for lunch, Clinton demurred. "I'm not going to have a break for lunch," he said to his fellow gasbags. "This is too interesting." (He also actually referred to a chart at one point as "moving.")
The participants in the conference seemed equally enthralled; never before had so many been allowed to talk so long about so much that was so boring. "Mr. President, words fail me in describing what an extraordinary event this is," said the economic columnist Robert Kuttner.
Clinton replied, "I hope that doesn't mean it's all downhill from here."
It could be. Clinton, the only man in America who would actually pay for C-Span if it became a premium channel, has promised to numb the nation with further colloquia on such topics as health care, welfare reform and the environment. He has hinted as well at further getting-out-among-my-people bus trips, conjuring up the frightening image of the Presidency as nightmare combination of Greyhound tour and "G.E. College Bowl" -- with Clinton leading a caravan of eggheads endlessly through the heartland, touching down periodically for 20 hours or so of stimulating conversation.
In the 1980's, everyone had their 15 minutes of fame; in the 1990's, it looks as though everyone will have 15 minutes on air with Bill Clinton -- especially now that the President will have access to 500 cable channels.
Clinton's never-ending conversation with the American public is going over big now, because, after four years of George Bush's headmasterish style of governing, Americans are starved to have a voice in their own political affairs. But there is a precedent from which it is possible to gauge just how long voters can be expected to tolerate all this listening, and it does not augur well for Clinton.
Jimmy Carter, like Bill Clinton, began his Presidency with an extravaganza of populism. He updated F.D.R.'s fireside chats for television, hosted a telephone call-in show to the White House, held a "town hall" in the town of Clinton, Mass., and traveled around the country visiting with "average Americans." The act palled quickly. By the time Carter ran unsuccessfully for re-election, his strategists were advising him that his best hope lay in staying home, out of the public eye.
Ronald Reagan's advisers, having studied Carter's approach, sharply limited the President's visibility. "The more you expose yourself, the more you expose yourself to trivialization," says Michael Deaver, the Washington public relations executive who was Reagan's chief imagist. "And if things start not working, people are going to say, 'Get off your rear, quit talking and do something about it.' "
At the moment, however, the Clinton camp appears not to be able to conceive of a world in which their chatty boss could be overexposed.
"I think you'll see a lot of town halls, of the sort we did in the campaign," says one Clinton official, his enthusiasm rising as he contemplates the future. "Maybe one every couple of months. Also, bus tours, of course. We have to keep doing those, but not so many, maybe one every six months or once a year. And maybe we could do the old capital-for-a-day bit too. You know, move the White House and the entire Cabinet to some place like Bismarck, N.D., one morning and make it the capital of the whole country for a day. Wouldn't that be great?"
WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON becomes the 42d President of the United States three days from now an oddly unknown man. He has succeeded remarkably well in being many things to many people, but that leaves the question of who he really is.
Is he the New Democrat, or the same old thing? Will he only tell people what they want to hear, or will he be able to say no to important constituencies? Will he continue to act as though the solutions to the country's problems are painless, or will he explain what sacrifices need to be made?
There is a fundamental tension in Bill Clinton between the glib politician and the dedicated student of public policy, the man always looking for approval and the man who knows that wrenching changes are required to put the country on a new course.
In the end, the most important relationship to be sorted out in the next four years is between Bill and Bill.

Snug New Harbor for Maritime Industry

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
IT has been a gradual process -- a tanker company here and a ships' brokerage there quietly moving out of New York City into the suburbs for more than a decade.
Mostly small companies, they are not missed. But as the exodus continues it is now estimated that more than half the maritime industry has left the city. 
 These companies operate by telephone and computer. They own international tanker fleets and other cargo ships, operate commercial charter companies and sales brokerages, or are shipping managers and insurers. There is no longer a need for them to be at the former hub of the industry, around Wall Street and in the East 50's.
Holger Arning, a Stamford realtor and maritime consultant who tracks company movements, says that about 150 have moved to Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk and Westport since 1982. Others, he adds, have gone to Westchester and New Jersey and barely 200 are left in New York.
The Connecticut Maritime Association in Stamford estimates that Fairfield County has acquired as many as 175 companies. "And they are still coming," said William Crawford, director of the 9-year-old trade organization.
Two years ago William Pitt Realtors of Stamford compiled a directory of maritime companies in New York's northern suburbs and found 127 in Connecticut and 14 in Westchester County. "There has been a very positive development of these companies in Greenwich and Stamford," said Al Remsen, a commercial broker at William Pitt. "They are attracted to waterfront buildings by their nature."
Some concerns have pushed eastward to Milford, the New Haven area, Old Lyme, and Stonington at the eastern tip of the state.
Figures provided by Ned Burns and Al Mirin, brokers with CB Commercial Real Estate Group of Stamford, show some 371,000 square feet of vacant space still available in waterfront buildings from Greenwich to Westport, priced from $12 to $30 a square foot.
"People in the maritime industry all know each other and they cluster in waterfront locations," said Mr. Mirin.
It was exactly such clubiness that brought about the creation of Clearwater House at 2187 Atlantic Street, a 9-story, 7-year-old building overlooking Stamford Harbor. In 1991 the 107,000-square-foot structure was purchased, vacant, from a local developer in financial difficulties for $1.75 million.
The buyers, Mallory, Jones, Lynch, Flynn & Associates; Seagroup Inc., and Bergvall & Hudner, are ship brokers and owners with leases expiring in New York and elsewhere.
"These were clients and friends," said Charles Mallory, managing partner of the consortium. "We realized that this was our opportunity for owner-occupancy at a cheap price, cheaper than renting, right on the water with great views and a dock for clients' and our own pleasure boats. We pooled our money and bought for cash."
Revovating to gain a nautical interior, "a cross between the New York Yacht Club and the Larchmont Yacht Club," cost $2 million, said Mr. Mallory. A rooftop restaurant is expected to open next summer.
THE consortium companies employ about 200 people and occupy around 45,000 square feet. During the last year they have leased an additional 10,000 square feet to three maritime tenants, including Bulkamerica, a commercial manager for shipping companies. They hope to rent the remaining space to other compatible companies.
"The building appealed to us because of the concentration of people in our business," said Phillip Schoenster, Bulkamerica's owner, after moving in this month. He started his company in Greenwich two years ago after working for the Navios Corporation.
Navios, which owns and operates ships and shipping terminals around the world, moved to Greenwich from New York in 1982, then to 19,000 square feet at Harbor Park on the Stamford waterfront in 1990. "We used to be a tight group in lower Manhattan," said Sean Day, president of the company, "but there's no need to be there any more. Modern communications make it possible to operate from anywhere. Secondly, this is more convenient for most of our 60 employes who already lived in the suburbs."
Stolt-Nielsen, one of the largest tanker fleets in the world, was the first in the industry to move from Manhattan to Greenwich in 1969. "The other companies thought we were crazy," said Betty Jane Dunn, spokeswoman for the firm. "Our president, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen Jr., and many of our people already lived here, and since we're international we felt we could locate anywhere."
In 1982 the company constructed its own 73,000 square foot office building on Sound Shore Drive where it occupies 50,000 square feet and leases the rest. There are 8,000 square feet currently available.
Atlantic Chartering, at 143 Rowayton Avenue on the Five Mile River in Norwalk, moved out of the city in 1979. "Living in the suburbs and working in New York kept us out of touch with the London market at its peak," said John Raby, director of the 11-member firm, "because we were commuting from 6:30 to 8 A.M."
Among recently moved companies is Scanports Shipping, an arm of Salomon Inc., the Salomon Brothers holding company, at 500 Nyala Farms Road in Westport since last September. Groton Pacific Carriers at 666 Steamboat Road in Greenwich arrived 18 months ago, and five maritime companies leased almost half of the 40,000 square feet at 53 Forest Avenue in Greenwich last year.
A company that has not succumbed to the suburb's siren song is Jacques Pierot & Sons, Manhattan ship brokers for 40 years. "I live in Fairfield County," said Robert Pierot, a principal in the concern, "and we considered a move last year. Even though many of our clients have moved out we will remain. With good communications, we can reach them as well here as elsewhere. Our firm happens to like the environment here."
ACCORDING to Mr. Mallory, nobody in New York cared or tried to do anything about keeping the maritime industry. "There weren't thousands of jobs at stake," he said. "There was no publicity, people just picked up and left."
"Of course we care!" responded Catie Marshall, vice president of New York City's Economic Development Corporation. "If that many maritime companies have moved out, that's quite a loss and we're sorry. We would urge anybody considering relocation to give us a call."

HEADLINE: Banking's New Bosses in Congress

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHEN Senator Carol Moseley Braun, newly elected to represent Illinois in Washington, received her committee assignments, most of the attention focused on the seat she won on the high-profile Judiciary Committee. After all, the meteoric rise of this African-American woman from obscurity reflected dissatisfaction over the committee's famed hearings into the confirmation of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
But to her, that assignment is second to the seat she had most avidly sought: one on the Banking Committee, where her presence is just one sign of sweeping change to come in how the new Congress is likely to look at the financial services industries. 
 Bankers, take note: the House and Senate Banking Committees are suddenly full of people like Carol Moseley Braun, some of them newly elected and others increasingly powerful, more of them black, female and Hispanic, fewer of them beholden to banking interests, and more of them likely to promote what are billed as pro-consumer and pro-community initiatives. These are ideas that many bankers view with suspicion, if not hostility. Yet they are the kind of ideas that bankers may have to accept in exchange for such cherished objectives as increases in interstate banking or reductions in burdensome regulations.
What is the appeal of serving on these committees? Certainly not that they had to grapple with the taxpayer-financed bailouts of financial institutions over the last few years.
"I have been hoping for a seat on the Banking Committee," Senator Moseley Braun said, "so that I can work to generate economic growth and community development that will revitalize the economy of our nation -- particularly rural and urban low-income neighborhoods."
She endorsed President-elect Bill Clinton's plan to establish a network of specially chartered banks to plow money into distressed neighborhoods, and noted that the idea's best-known example is Chicago's own South Shore Bank.
"That bank is in my state and I've been involved with it since it got started," she said. "I have seen how it creates jobs, promotes small businesses, develops housing and turns lives around. We need more of those successes."
Mr. Clinton's plan for community development banks is just one of several issues facing the Congress, many of which have broad implications. The first item to be decided, left over from the last Congress, involves how to finance the takeover and sale of bankrupt savings institutions. More broadly, Congress will address a comprehensive reorganization of the regulatory agencies that supervise banks and savings institutions.
There are likely to be debates over limiting regulations, limiting deposit insurance and expanding interstate banking powers. But there will also be discussions of issues affecting consumers -- possible changes to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and restraints on abuses in mortgage and home equity lending, and reform of bankruptcy laws.
IT is far too early to predict how any of these debates will turn out. Much depends on the Clinton Administration. But consumer and community groups, such as the well-organized Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN, are gearing up to use their newfound allies in Congress.
"We believe that the banking industry needs to put its house in order before the Administration seriously considers the industry's demands for product and geographic deregulation," ACORN said last week in a letter to Treasury Secretary-designate Lloyd Bentsen. "We believe that the priorities of any new banking legislation should lie in the areas of increased consumer protection, community lending and assurances that regulatory measures are in place to protect Federal deposit insurance funds and the taxpayers who stand behind those funds."
Experts say that such voices are likely to be heard with sympathy on Capitol Hill.
"Changes in both parties will make the House and Senate Banking Committees much less sympathetic to industry restructuring and more responsive to consumer and community activists," said Karen D. Shaw, a banking analyst, in a report published this month by her advisory firm, the Institute for Strategy Development.
"Several moderate Democrats who formed a base of support for commercial banks have left the House Banking Committee because of defeat, retirmement, or reassignment," said Ms. Shaw, who has advised clients in both the financial community and the incoming Clinton camp. "They have been replaced by a Democratic freshman class with many minorities and liberals."
NOT only did Illinois elect Senator Moseley Braun, for example, but also Chicago elected to the House new Democratic Representative Bobby Rush, a former Black Panther and, since 1983, an alderman on the Chicago City Council, and Luis Gutierrez, another alderman. Both of them are on the House Banking Committee.
Bankers do not believe the changes in Congress necessarily portend major changes in the industry's financial underpinnings after so many stressful years. But they say the changes are important nonetheless.
Ken Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association of America, said he was especially struck by the addition of 24 new members, 23 of them freshmen, to the 51-member House Banking Committee.
"This is a major shift toward a committee with a socially aggressive agenda, although in the final analysis, it has nothing to do with the safety and the soundness of the banking industry," he said.
Those who contend that the traditionally conservative white- and male-dominated banking establishment needed an infusion of minorities, women and liberals are rejoicing.
"This is the new civil rights movement," said an aide to Representative Joe Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, son of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the new chairman of the House Banking Committee's Consumer Credit and Insurance subcommittee.
A reorganization of the full committee is giving the Kennedy subcommittee new clout, expanding its reach to include such issues as interstate banking, as well as traditional consumer issues. According to Representative Kennedy, the committee's ideological complexion is changing as well.
"Many times in years past, we have seen the consumer affairs committee really stacked with Republicans and conservative Democrats to try and create an environment where the kind of progressive challenge that changes the agenda of the banking community has been prevented," he said.
This year, he continued, nearly every minority member of the Banking Committee wanted to serve on the subcommittee, and Representative Kennedy predicted, the panel's interests will be "on the front burner" in the months ahead.
EQUALLY significant to bankers is the loss of some powerful friends. Among the House Banking Committee members who retired were the ranking Republican, Representative Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, and Democrats Doug Barnard of Georgia and Thomas Carper of Delaware. Ms. Shaw described all three as "valuable allies" of the industry.
Among those defeated at the polls was Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, who despite her pro-consumer stance had come around to the banking industry's views on some key issues during her long years on the committee.
Among those illustrating the diversity of the committee's 24 new members are Nydia Velazquez of New York, the first Puerto Rican woman in Congress; two Yale-educated liberals, Melvin Watt of North Carolina and Peter Deutch of Florida, both interested in community development issues, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, representing a heavily Hispanic district in California.
The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Banking Committees, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas and Senator Donald Riegle of Michigan, are not changing, but both of them are already somewhat populist in their leanings, and with new support from their committees are likely to press for initiatives to spur community development lending.
On the House Banking Committee, many of the new Republicans seem, if anything, more conservative than the veterans, suggesting that partisan debates could be increasingly divisive.
 
 
THE D'AMATO DIFFERENCE
 A look at the Senate Banking Committee shows that even in Republican ranks there are changes for bankers to worry about. Notably, Senator Jake Garn of Utah resigned, to be replaced as ranking Republican by New York's firebrand, Alfonse D'Amato. While no liberal, Senator D'Amato is far more consumer-oriented than Senator Garn was on banking issues.
Senator Garn, according to Karen D. Shaw, head of the Institute for Strategy Development, "was a strong advocate of sweeping industry restructuring, as well as a vigorous opponent of initiatives to increase the industry's consumer and community responsibilities." Senator D'Amato tends to take just the opposite tack.
"The banks don't love me," the New Yorker said in an interview. "If you don't agree with them 100 percent, they put you down in some category." A memorable example is his effort a few years ago to drive down the interest rates on credit cards.
Like many of his more liberal colleagues, Senator D'Amato is pushing for increases in lending, especially to meet the needs of impoverished cities.
"Capital is the thing that will help redevelopment of our inner core cities, create decent housing, expand this economy, and meet those needs," he said.
As the committees are shaping up this year, the bankers are likely to welcome Senator D'Amato's views of how to spur community investment. He flatly opposes using Federal funds to subsidize inner-city lending. Instead, he said, he will offer legislation to allow banks to meet the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act, which sets standards for banks to lend locally, by contributing capital to the new community development banks that President Clinton will propose. That way, he said, banks would be freed of the paperwork and other features that they do not like under the current system.
That approach has been rejected out of hand by more liberal supporters of community development banks, who view them as a supplement, not a replacement, for the existing requirements for community reinvestment by banks. Traditional commercial banks have nothing against innovative community development banks in principle, and they would welcome a way to avoid aggressive enforcement of community lending
"I would say, 'Nice try, but try again,' " said Representative Joe Kennedy when asked about the approach Senator D'Amato favors. "The notion that somehow community development banks will relieve banks of the burden of making loans in their own communities would be a real misrepresentation of what Governor Clinton has put forward."

When Your Warm-Up Act Is Merely David Rockefeller

BYLINE: By FLETCHER ROBERTS

 BODY:
No one has to tell John E. Avery that he has big shoes to fill. At the Americas Society, where Mr. Avery is the new chairman, those shoes belonged to David Rockefeller. The society is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that seeks to promote economic, political and cultural cooperation between the United States and Latin America, the Caribbean and Canada. Mr. Rockefeller, as founding chairman, presided over the society's rise to prominence in inter-American affairs.
"You can't replace David," said Mr. Avery, 64, a longtime executive of Johnson & Johnson. "He's the closest thing we have to royalty." 
 Founded in 1981, the Americas Society is largely the brainchild of Mr. Rockefeller, who brought together organizations like the Pan American Society at its Park Avenue headquarters in Manhattan. The Americas Society and its affiliate, the Council of the Americas, sponsor lectures, conferences and publications.
With an increased openness to trade, thanks partly to the North American Free Trade Agreement, and "450 million people sitting down there," Mr. Avery sees enormous opportunities for business in Latin America.
The society's roughly 1,000 members come from all walks of life, while the council is a business association of some 250 American-based corporations.
Where Mr. Rockefeller delegated, Mr. Avery expects to bring his more hands-on management style from business. Since taking over as chairman of the society and the council on Jan. 1, Mr. Avery has applied himself to learning "the in's and out's" of the job.
Mr. Avery seems to have the credentials for the task at hand. At Johnson & Johnson, he had for nearly 13 years overseen the pharmaceutical giant's operations in Latin America and the Caribbean. He is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, having lived in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for three years in the late 50's.
Asked just how large those shoes he's trying to fill might be, he figured about a size 20. But by the time his stewardship ends, Mr. Avery's 10's may have proved plenty big.

HEADLINE: Profile/Don Tyson;
Mr. Chicken Goes to Washington

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: SPRINGDALE, Ark.

 BODY:
When Ross Perot heaped scorn on Arkansas last fall as a state of low-tech chicken-pluckers, it was Don Tyson who should have been offended more than Bill Clinton.
Low-tech? Hardly. Mr. Tyson is known around the rolling green pastures here in northwest Arkansas as Mr. Chicken, or Super Chicken, and that is just fine with the puckish, high-energy chairman of Tyson Foods Inc. Plucking chickens, and selling them 3,000 ways, has made Mr. Tyson very nearly a billionaire -- a number sure to get Mr. Perot's attention. 
 And this week Mr. Chicken goes to Washington, for a bit of partying. One of Bill Clinton's main business allies back home, Mr. Tyson has supplied money and occasionally political muscle from the first stirrings of the President-elect's public life in Arkansas in the mid-1970's.
So when the inauguration parties get going today, Mr. Tyson, 62, will be among the more sought-out members of the Arkansas revelers. His calling cards: a rapidly expanding personal fortune in Tyson Foods stock ($900 million and counting), his formidable prospects for getting an occasional audience with the star of the show and his buoyant wit.
Friends say that anyone having trouble picking Mr. Tyson, with his well-plucked scalp, out of the crowd should look for the man having the best time. "You can't keep up with him," said Ronnie Hawkins, the rockabilly singer who grew up with Mr. Tyson and who is performing at several inaugural events.
"I used to have to find an iron lung after a night out partying with Don," Mr. Hawkins said, "but he'd just shower, shave and go to work. I don't think anybody could keep up with him when he was young, and I expect it's still that way."
Tyson Foods has a role in several events, including the Absolutely Unofficial Blue Jeans Bash for members of the Clinton-Gore campaign team tonight, and an inaugural night gala for 12,000 at the Washington Convention Center.
Mr. Tyson's rise in business has epic proportions. Since taking control after his father, John Tyson, the company's founder, died in 1967, he has propelled Tyson Foods to become the nation's biggest chicken processor and one of the world's biggest marketers of chicken, pork, beef and other meat products. The company has 55,000 employees in 17 states, including 22,000 in Arkansas, compared with just 52 when Mr. Tyson came home from the University of Arkansas 40 years ago with a degree in agriculture.
Even Ross Perot, with all his billions, may wish he had swapped some Treasury bills years ago for a bundle of Tyson Foods shares. A 1972 investment of $1,000 in these chicken-pluckers is worth about $180,000 today.
Mr. Tyson's personal stake would reach an even billion if the company's stock leaped from its current $23.625 to about $26.
And Mr. Tyson clearly wants more. He's preparing a war chest of cash, stock and bank credit lines that within a year could finance $2 billion in acquisitions. Mr. Tyson, who long ago adopted the maxim of grow or die, has acquired more than 20 companies. The most costly and contentious deal was the $1.5 billion fight that wrested Holly Farms Inc. from the grasp of Conagra in 1989.
A big part of the debt from the Holly Farms deal has been paid, and Mr. Tyson says now that he is aiming for more deals because he wants to double Tyson Foods' sales, to $8 billion, by the end of 1995.
"We're dangerous! We're fishing hard!" the short, round-faced Mr. Tyson crowed during a recent interview at headquarters. His office is a replica of the Oval Office, which he first visited when Jimmy Carter worked there, and his desk is a copy of Mr. Carter's. Mr. Tyson headed Farmers for Carter in 1980 and was active in Mr. Carter's 1976 victory.
Mr. Tyson's affiliation with the Democratic Party is rare among big chicken growers and processors, said James B. Blair, Tyson Foods' general counsel. As a result, Don Tyson has been "the major player in the poultry industry who has been a consistent and long-term supporter of Clinton," Mr. Blair said. "Clinton has never done everything that Don Tyson asked him to do, and has never refused to listen to him."
Last month, Mr. Tyson was one of four business executives invited to make summary statements on the closing day of the Little Rock economic meeting. Mr. Tyson's message: Job creation should be the Clinton Administration's top economic priority, with an emphasis as well on worker training programs supported by tax credits.
 Betsey Wright, Mr. Clinton's chief of staff in Arkansas, said: "Don was a very key partner in some of the economic development and education programs that were important to Bill while he was Governor. If he is putting together a private-sector involvement in educational advancement, Don Tyson is one of the first people we will think of."
She said many Tyson plants have programs where workers can learn to read and complete high school. The Tyson family foundation also finances literacy programs in the state, and supports 200 employees working on college degrees.
Mr. Tyson was a principal organizer of the Arkansas Business Council, a group of business leaders whose biggest goal has been improving Arkansas schools. The group supported an increase in corporate taxes to pay for improvements, which state legislators approved in 1991.
Because Tyson Foods exports about $400 million a year in chicken products, Mr. Tyson will be particularly interested in Mr. Clinton's positions on trade issues, "especially all of these foreign subsidized-farmer situations," Mr. Blair said.
Calling himself a moderate Democrat, Mr. Tyson talks as if he would be just as comfortable among middle-of-the-road Republicans. He favors free-trade policies where Washington negotiators can achieve them, in part because he thinks Tyson Foods can take a big share of any world market.
"Our plants in the United States are highly efficient," he said. "If it wasn't for government interference or government subsidies like in the E.E.C., we should produce all of the chicken in the world" from American farms. He added with a laugh, "And I'd be glad to."
Tyson Foods' hourly labor rate, including fringe benefits, reached $8 last year, compared with 58 cents when Mr. Tyson managed his first processing plant in 1958. But consistent research spending on machinery, much of which is created by Tyson Foods' engineers, has helped the company improve productivity despite rising labor costs. Mr. Tyson said the company prepares 3,000 chicken products at a lower overall cost today than the one cent-per-pound average in 1958.
Exports accounted for about 10 percent of Tyson's sales last year. And Japan, where Tyson has shipped chicken processed in the United States since 1968 -- first to fast-food giants like Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's and more recently to leading grocery chains -- contributes the most sales among the 56 countries where Tyson Foods operates.
"Everybody views this as a chicken company, but this is a food-service business," said John M. McMillin, food industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York.
Partly to pursue his love of deep-sea fishing, Mr. Tyson yielded the chief executive's post two years ago to Leland Tollett, 54, a longtime Tyson executive with a knack for machinery, plant operations and bringing Mr. Tyson's latest ideas to life.
Mr. Tyson's current passion when he is at sea on his 63-foot yacht is to hook a rare 1,000-pound blue marlin in the Atlantic north of Rio de Janiero. An 1,100-pound black marlin that Mr. Tyson caught is mounted in the Tyson Foods boardroom.
"He is very intense at work, and that intensity shows off when he's out fishing," said Mel Immergut, a Wall Street lawyer and a world record-holder for bluefin tuna. He and Mr. Tyson were named to Power and Motor Yacht magazine's list of 10 best American fishermen in 1991.
Mr. Tyson often returns from fishing excursions with notepads crowded with ideas for new acquisitions, products and markets.
Mr. Tyson and his wife, Jean, have a son, John, 39, who has been a corporate director since he was 30, and now heads the company's engineering unit. One daughter, Cheryl, 38, heads the family's Tyson Foundation, and another, Carla, 36, works in the company's marketing unit.
Mr. Tyson has a reputation for generosity, once paying to rebuild a poor congregation's church that had burned down. And he helped bankroll three Farm Aid concerts for the organizer, his friend Willie Nelson. But he does not live ostentatiously. He has occupied the same family home for years, though he owns bigger homes near his favorite fishing spot in Baja California and in England.
Will the capital's glitter lure him? Mr. Tyson said he had no plans to become a corporate statesman, huddling frequently in Washington on weighty issues of economic policy. "My theory about politics is that if they will just leave me alone, we'll do just fine," he said. "We pretty much stay home and run chickens."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
The Economy's $1.6 Trillion Gorilla

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Long just a bit player in the world of capital markets, the mutual fund industry now commands the stage with $1.6 trillion in assets under management. Yet its incredible muscle is still not appreciated by most financial researchers or policy makers.
Mutual funds are still analyzed largely for how they serve the individual investor and too little for how they serve the economy as an important component of growth. 
 The result has been a misreading of what is driving the markets that some assert has led to significant policy gaffes and too little attention in Washington to the turf battle building between banks and funds.
"Macroeconomists tend to think that all good flows come from banks and that money coming from mutual funds is suspect," said Charles Trzcinka, an associate professor of finance at the State University of New York at Buffalo.
The fund industry was born in 1924, crashed with the stock market in 1929, then blossomed during the go-go 60's before being almost destroyed again by the 1973-1974 stock market collapse. But from 1975, when assets totaled $45.9 billion, the industry has shot ahead, helped along by the creation of money market funds in the 70's. By late last year, industry assets of $1.6 trillion compared with just $1.3 trillion held by domestic banks in mortgages and commercial loans.
In sum, companies today can finance their short- and long-term capital needs almost entirely via the securities markets, a shift that has already greatly reduced the demand for bank credit.
It is a development that policy makers would have done well to notice. For example, in June 1990, then-Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher officially declared the existence of a "credit crunch," saying bank credit had been severely reduced to many companies. Congress held hearings, and the squeeze was assigned more and more blame as the recession deepened.
Yet a 1991 Brookings Institution study by Ben Bernanke and Cara Lown concluded that the drop in commercial bank lending came not because banks reduced supply but because demand for bank loans had fallen. That reflected in part cutbacks by recession-ridden corporations, but in addition, companies have increasingly discovered they can finance operations by issuing the debt and equity being snapped up by mutual funds -- and do so relatively cheaply.
This important development, says Professor Trzcinka, has been somewhat obscured by the fact that junk bonds have been so closely aligned with the financial excesses of the 1980's. But take a look at commercial paper. Almost nonexistent in 1960, now used by more and more companies to finance short-term borrowing needs, it currently accounts for about 12.5 percent of the short-term credit market. At the end of 1991, money market funds held about 40 percent of the $530 billion in commercial paper outstanding.
But again, policy makers appear to be missing the point. Even while bemoaning the presumed crunch on corporate credit, Congress is thinking of discouraging access to the place where corporations can raise lots of money. That is, it is considering limiting the tax deductions available to borrowers on interest they pay on their junk bonds.
Funds, meanwhile, have also increased the marketability of corporate equity. In 1984, aggressive growth and growth funds, which mostly buy shares in smaller firms, held $39.1 billion, or 30 percent, of all equity fund assets. In 1991, they held 42.6 percent of a total that had swollen to $156 billion. (Funds investing in distressed companies have increased the liquidity of that market too.)
Through individual investors, mutual funds have also changed the workings of the marketplace itself. For one thing, investors in common stocks have grown more patient than investors in bonds, showing a willingness to hold low-dividend stocks in hopes of high capital gains, Peter L. Bernstein found in a 1992 study published in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance.
Observers say that is a result, at least in part, of the increasing financial sophistication of American investors as encouraged and developed by the fund industry. Yet paradoxically funds are also the greatest contributor to the increasing volatility of the stock market, says Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own investment research and consulting firm in New York.
In the bull market of the 80's, the major forces driving the markets were pension plans and corporations. But that, Mr. Birinyi says, has changed. Although conventional wisdom still holds otherwise, Mr. Birinyi asserts that fund managers are more concerned with performance and thus more likely than pension managers to trade as markets shift. The market soared in late 1992, he says, not because of pension managers -- who were, in fact, "largely negative" -- but "because of individual investors, who drive the market now."
In Washington, with banks protesting a proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission to ease rules for selling fund shares and funds complaining that banks should be regulated like funds when they sell similar products, policy makers need to reconsider the sea change in the banking-mutual fund balance.

THE ECONOMY

 
The Middle-Class Tax Cut Gets the Almost-Silent Treatment 

Is President-elect Bill Clinton backtracking on his campaign promises regarding the economy. That question arose last week when his choice for budget director, Leon E. Panetta, addressed Congress during his confirmation hearings. Mr. Clinton's promised middle-class tax cut was shuffled to the background, as Mr. Panetta stressed other issues. "What we're looking at is a deficit line that's shooting straight up," Mr. Panetta said. That much red ink had caused the new Clinton team to shift its priorities. "Our first priority," he said, is to develop a deficit reduction plan. The next priority is to "lay out the investment path we want to follow and targeted investments we want to make." Finally came a hint on the tax cut: "Dependent on that lies the question of whether or not we can go any further with regards to any kind of further reduction in taxes." But not only would tax cuts be last on the budgetary list, the new Administration also appeared to be moving away from its pledge to cut the deficit by 50 percent in four years. The problem, Mr. Clinton claimed, was that the deficit estimates released recently by the Bush Administration showed that the balance sheet was in far worse shape than he had thought. But few believed he had been in the dark.

A Bush Legacy in the C.P.I.
 
When they exhume the economic time capsule from the Bush years, it won't be filled with many mementos of rapid growth. That was the Reagan legacy. Still, they will find at least one indicator of success -- steadily falling inflation. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose by only 0.1 percent in December, bringing the annual consumer inflation rate to 2.9 percent for 1992. That was the best showing since 1976. "Inflation is very low, reflecting worldwide economic weakness," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. But there is a caution. While 2.9 percent is respectable, it is still "a high base on which to build an expansion."

Scratch One Potomac Party
 
Those Democrats may be party animals, now that they won back the White House, but at least one party won't be held. President-elect Bill Clinton said the Friends of Ron Brown bash, in honor of Ronald H. Brown, Mr. Clinton's pick to head the Commerce Department, was inappropriate. The problem had to do with who was picking up the tab for the affair. A few dozen companies -- including Anheuser-Busch, Pepsico, J.C. Penney, Textron and Sony Music Entertainment -- were to have kicked in $10,000 each to fete Mr. Brown. But some of those companies have issues that could come before the Commerce Department -- the reason Mr. Clinton objected to the gala. It's one thing to head a political party, Mr. Clinton said, but it's another to have "a Commerce job where you actually make decisions."

Big Board Bids for Business
 
Many established companies have seen their market share nibbled away by upstarts, but the New York Stock Exchange? While the Big Board still trades the most shares dollar-wise, it's losing out to smaller exchanges when it comes to individual investors. To win back those customers, the Big Board said it would cut certain transaction costs by 15 percent -- wooing their brokers. The new low fees apply only to trades ranging from 100 shares to 2,099 shares. Brokers, unlikely to pass these savings along to their customers, might flock to the Big Board again, finding it a more lucrative place to do business than the regional or electronic exchanges. "I look at this as a traditional exchange finally saying, 'Hey, we have got to be part of the 90's and focus on the needs of our client base,' " said Joseph Grano, head of retail at Paine Webber, who worked on the proposal.

The Final Tally on Christmas
 
After examining all those cash-register receipts from the holiday season, the Commerce Department last week told the nation how it did. December's retail sales climbed 1.2 percent from the corresponding period the year before. . For all of 1992, retail sales grew by 5.1 percent.

Brady Says It Yet Again
 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is passing to his successor, Senator Lloyd Bentsen, but he's doing it with a warning. Hands off the economy, Mr. Brady said. The incoming Clinton Administration would be unwise, Mr. Brady said, to try to accelerate the pace of growth and create new jobs with a flurry of short-term spending programs. Mr. Brady's advice -- largely the same he's offered since before the recession began -- was to leave job creation to the private sector. "The government doesn't create jobs. Two-thirds of the jobs are created by small business," he said.

The Hope for More Hiring
 
One indication that the economy is bouncing back can be seen in the nation's factories, mines and utilities. According to the Federal Reserve, industrial production increased by 0.3 percent in December, the third monthly increase in a row. Though the increases were industrywide, the most spunk was shown by the automobile sector, where output grew by 8.7 percent in December. Inventories, meanwhile, were up by only 0.2 percent in December, the Commerce Department said. That was good news for the unemployed. "Inventory stocks are unusually lean," said Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington economic forecasting firm bearing his name. Increasing production to rebuild inventories "means more people will be hired."

 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
380 Right-Hand-Drive Jeeps . . .
 
For the nation that put a man on the moon, moving automobile steering wheels from the left side to the right -- so they can be driven safely in Japan -- shouldn't be such a big deal. Nearly three-quarters of America's trade gap with Japan comes from the near one-way trade in automobiles. But it took until last week, when the Chrysler Corporation unveiled a right-hand-drive Jeep Cherokee, before Japanese consumers could buy a right-hand-drive American car. But even with the new Cherokee, the trade gap is not about to go away. According to Osamu Nagata, general manager of marketing for Chrysler Japan Sales, 380 people have placed orders for the cars, which will sell for $29,800.

. . . Won't Shrink the Trade Gap
 
Only 380 Cherokees? At that rate the trade gap will never go away. According to the Commerce Department, America's trade deficit grew by 5.1 percent in November to $7.59 billion. Though imports overall fell by 1.6 percent from October levels, imports of cars and car parts climbed by $298 million in November to $7.86 billion. Analysts said the trade gap would not have been so large if Europe and Japan were not in recession, which caused American exports to fall by 2.8 percent. Commerce Secretary Barbara Franklin cautioned that November's poor showing did not indicate American products were less competitive overseas. "Our exports have expanded 5.9 percent in the first 11 months over the same period last year," she said.

 
 
COMPANIES

 
Intel, Riding High on Chips
 
For the Intel Corporation, business has been good, thank you very much. Intel, the world's largest producer of semiconductors, reported fourth-quarter profits of $428.6 million, or $1.97 a share, more than double the $188.7 million, or 90 cents a share, for the same quarter a year earlier. Intel's stock jumped $8.125 on the news to $110.125 and closed the week at $111.75. For the year, Intel earned $1.07 billion, up 30 percent from $818.6 million the year before. Why is Intel succeeding while so many computer companies are limping along? It still sets the industry standard. "In 1992, our second-wave processors, Intel 486 and Intel 386, became the clear favorite of computer users," said Andrew S. Grove, Intel's president.

Just What's Up With the C-17?
 
It's one of the largest Air Force projects ever -- a $37 billion contract to build 120 C-17 transport planes. But the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which is building the planes, says $37 billion is too little money. Changes in the plane's design and the Air Force's desire to bring in the Lockheed Corporation to build the airplane's wings, caused McDonnell Douglas to lose money. (The wings had to be redesigned. )So it will be putting in a claim with the Government to pay an additional $1.2 billion for the planes. "It's not an unusual procedure," said Lieut. Col. John Kirwood, an Air Force spokesman. But not all analysts think McDonnell's problems are the Government's fault. "The C-17 has been mismanaged by the company and this is an attempt to blame the Air Force," said Howard Rubel, a military industry analyst.

Finally, a Letterman Decision
 
Comics need audiences -- awake audiences, that is -- and David Letterman, whose wee-hours NBC time slot made his show the nation's highest-rated night light, is about to get one. Mr. Letterman will take his hip humor to CBS opposite NBC's more traditional "Tonight" show at 11:30 P.M. Mr. Letterman had originally wanted to become host of the "Tonight" show after Johnny Carson's departure. Jay Leno got that, of course, and while there were rumors NBC was considering dropping him, no such event took place. "David wanted to be on at 11:30," said Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment. But winning Mr. Letterman to CBS did not come cheap. He will earn about $14 million a year.

Sears Lightens Its Portfolio
 
For Sears, Roebuck & Company, it's back to basics. Last week it sold its Sears Business Centers chain to the Inacom Corporation, a computer company in Omaha.
 
Labor Strife at Boeing
 
It takes two to make a deal but the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees' Association -- which represents 28,000 engineers and technical people at the Boeing Company -- says the nation's No. 1 airplane maker won't talk. As a result of Boeing's refusal to discuss its pay demands, the union will call a one-day strike on Tuesday -- its first ever. But Boeing remains stubborn. It rebuffed the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service Commission, which said it should go to the bargaining table. Charles Bofferding, the union's executive director, said Boeing "continues to maintain their stonewall tactics." Why won't Boeing talk? Its workers have nowhere else to go. Just as crucial, the union has no strike fund.

Closed-End Losses Overseas

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD

 BODY:
CLOSED-END funds that invest overseas were nothing to brag about in 1992. Sixteen new issues came to market and every single one lost money. Foreign equity funds lost 18 percent on average. while foreign bond funds went down 11.5 percent.
The reasons for the dismal performances ranged from market dislocations to political upheaval and scandal to civil unrest -- currency problems, the Danes' negative vote on the Maastricht treaty on European economic and financial unity, the impeachment of Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello and riots in India, Thailand and Korea. 
Add to these problems the costs of getting closed-end issues to market -- costs that are built into the share price and thus are ultimately borne by investors in new issues -- and those who took the plunge were sorely disappointed through 1992, said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami-based analyst who specializes in closed-end fund investment.

HEADLINE: At Work;
A Populist Cowboy for the Airwaves

SERIES: An occasional look at the experiences of people changing careers.

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
Is Jim Hightower selling out? He has never been a make-a-million-bucks/C.E.O.-by-40 sort of career aspirant. He has been a Washington political op, a journalist, a progressive activist. From 1983 until 1991, he was the Texas Commissioner of Agriculture. He has had enough freedom, influence and access to power to make the frugal life style activism imposes worthwhile.
Mr. Hightower, however, is about to shift into one of the hot careers of late-20th century, fin de siecle American culture, and, no, he is not joining the warrior crew at "American Gladiators." In February, assuming negotiations now under way come together, Mr. Hightower will become a radio commentator, providing a populist voice in a medium now heavily weighted toward the right and beyond. 
 "Radio is infested with Rush Limbaugh and G. Gordon Liddy," Mr. Hightower said during a recent interview in New York, naming some of the more strident figures who turned to radio to maintain their voice. His model is Paul Harvey, a more traditional conservative who is, says Mr. Hightower, a compelling storyteller and conversationalist.
Radio is not an obvious career move for Mr. Hightower, a trim man who turned 50 last week, but in many ways he is a natural for it. There is that easy-on-the-ears East Texas accent, which can make listeners actually want to hear the details of, say, a plan for decentralizing the nation's food distribution system.
And there is the wily way he has with language. He is, after all, the man who once admonished centrist Democrats that "there's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos." And he is fondly remembered in certain circles for characterizing George Bush as a "toothache of a man."
But mostly there is his desire to bring forth issues that have not had a hearing since the last time Democrats roamed the land and bestrode the White House, a time that seemed as remote as the Pleistocene until the ascendancy of Mr. Clinton. Mr. Hightower spent a good many of those years as a public servant in Texas, first narrowly missing election to the state railroad commission, and then, in his second race, winning his bid to become Commissioner of Agriculture.
If the commissioner's office seems like an odd place for him to alight, consider that Mr. Hightower did what progressives, smitten with the implicit righteousness of their causes, tend to forget to do: develop a constituency. He was helped by the fact that in Texas the locally owned farm is still a living institution, as is populist hostility to interests -- big oil and big agriculture, to be precise -- that dominate the state to the detriment, in the view of some, of the hardscrabble working people. In such an atmosphere, even a man with some wild-eyed, ecofreakish ideas about controlling crop-eating pests could flourish and develop a network of support.
 The interests finally came to get Mr. Hightower. He believes his highly visible speech to the Democratic Convention in 1988, which contained not only the "toothache" remark but the wisecrack that Mr. Bush "was born on third base and decided that he'd hit a triple," goaded the notoriously thin-skinned immigrant from Connecticut to set his own Texas networks thrumming.
Mr. Hightower lost his seat in 1991 to a well-financed opponent who ran a campaign mostly via advertisements in the state's two major media markets, Houston and Dallas. The campaign attacked not Mr. Hightower's policies as commissioner but his patriotism, using an image of him rising from the flames of a burning flag.
If Mr. Hightower's career shift is not altogether voluntary it comes toward the end of a de facto moratorium in Washington on opinions from his side of the political spectrum, a fact that presumably accounts for the interest of radio stations in several major regions. Mr. Hightower's sample commentaries include homiletic denunciations of corporate pollution and the North American Free Trade Agreement, the latter with the slogan "Nafta, do we hafta?"
Mr. Hightower will build his new radio identity on the presumption that Americans want to hear about issues that in less fragile economic times would have been wonk-level arcania. His experience in Texas and at grass-roots gatherings around the country leads him to believe there is an audience hungry for a dissident voice of reason. "I'd like to broaden the center all the way back to moderate," Mr. Hightower says with a laugh. "I'm not trying to pretend this is more than it is. It's only one voice, but it's one more than we had today."
 
 
 
MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT CLINTON
 Like many progressives, Jim Hightower waxes both skeptical and hopeful about Bill Clinton's Administration-in-waiting. "I'm going in with my fingers crossed but my eyes open," said Mr. Hightower, a superdelegate to the Democratic Convention in New York last summer. He supported Tom Harkin and Jerry Brown before coming around to Mr. Clinton.
So far it looks from a progressive perspective as if there will be no great break, except perhaps in tone, from the recent past. The appointment of, in Mr. Hightower's words, "the Wall Street firm of Bentsen, Rivlin, Altman and Rubin" -- a reference to Mr. Clinton's principal economic advisers -- signals business as usual. It is nice, he says, that Robert Reich, Mr. Clinton's Labor Secretary-designate, talks about retraining, but Mr. Hightower would like to know what the plan is for creating the $15-to-$20-an-hour jobs Americans need to prosper. "Training for what? Auto workers are highly trained and they're losing their jobs," he said.
Mr. Hightower will use his new radio show in part to encourage development of "green conversion" industries that can provide jobs in environmental cleanup, alternative energy and "green" products -- areas that mainstream business tends to sniff at.
Mr. Clinton could help by reinstating money for research on alternative energy that was cut in favor of the traditional energy industries during the Reagan-Bush years.

HEADLINE: THE NIGHT;
The Beach: That's a Life?

BYLINE: By Bob Morris

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH

 BODY:
It was Saturday night, but Kenny Scharf wasn't going out. The boyish artist, who once turned the basement bathroom of the Palladium in New York into a psychedelic Armageddon, wasn't going to the dinner at Barocco Beach with Lisa Phillips, the Whitney Museum curator, who was in town. He wasn't going to Byblos, the new club that replaced the Cave, which replaced Boomerang, all within a year. He wasn't even going to check out Les Bains, the new club of the week.
Mr. Scharf, the 34-year-old neo-expressionist who had a show at the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in the fall and contributed art for Interview magazine's forthcoming all-Florida issue, wasn't even in South Beach. At 11 P.M., he was at home with his family, 50 blocks north of the Art Deco district, in the ranch house that he moved into in July. 
 For one thing, he didn't want to miss "Deep Space 9," the new "Star Trek" television film. For another, he was exhausted. Vogue had been around all day, shooting him, his wife and their two daughters in Todd Oldham's clothing. At 5 P.M., he ran out for pizza, cake and ice cream. At 6, his 9-year-old daughter Zena's slumber party began.
By 11, when the clubs were just starting to cook, Mr. Scharf was watching "The Sound of Music" on the VCR with six little girls with wet hair. They sat in their pajamas in the screened porch by the pool that he'd customized with his squiggles and swirls.
"It's pretty fast-paced here," he said after looking in on his wife and their house guest, Drena De Niro, who were watching television in the bedroom and planning to go out after midnight. "But I like having a little nature to ground me in reality. My garden's important to me. I'm growing collard greens, okra, squash, tomatoes and all kinds of tropical fruit trees. Right now, the mango tree is flowering. The other stuff, the night life and stuff, is frivolous and fun, but I don't take it seriously. It's not sustaining, that's for sure."
Apparently, "Deep Space 9" wasn't too sustaining either. By midnight, Mr. Scharf was snoring softly in front of the television set in the bedroom. On the screen, orbs and stars and strange creatures reminiscent of his paintings were spinning and shooting around the cosmos. Another day in the life of a postmodern nuclear family had wound itself down to this, a quiet night at home in a private, gated community, with a gentle rain tapping on the roof.
 
The Sitters and the Sinners
 He was Lebanese. She was a Latvian Jew. Her accent was Yiddish, his Lebanese, but it was hard to tell the difference. On Sunday night, they were sitting on the porch of a transients' hotel on Collins Avenue.
He was tan from the sun. She wasn't. He sat way back in his lawn chair like a big shot. She sat straight up in hers like a schoolteacher. They were both widowed and seemed to like each other.
"We talk to each other," she said. "That's all."
"She doesn't want to get married," he said. "When I follow her to her room, she closes the door."
"What do I want to think about marriage when I'm old?" she asked.
"She thinks she's old, but she has a very young face," he said.
"He sits here," she said. "I sit here. What, I have to sit in my little room because I am scared of him? We're different. He's an Arab. I come from Europe."
Folding up his chair, he went inside, wounded. A much younger man, an unemployed actor and used-car salesman who lives in the hotel with his wife and son, joined the woman. He said he wanted to write a play about Hurricane Andrew. He took a swig from a bottle hidden in a paper bag.
"What you drink?" she asked. "Wine?"
"Rum," he told her.
"Alcohol?" she said. "Oy, Gott!" She picked up her chair and retreated to her room.
The streets were packed with young people on the prowl. The police were frisking three men on the corner. "It's Sodom and Gomorrah here," the would-be playwright said. "A lot of models live in this hotel. The cheap ones. That bar over there is a gay disco called Warsaw. You should see the way the guys are dressed in little white undershorts and black boots when they go in there.
"Right around the corner's the Spot, where Mickey Rourke goes. The men and women that go in there all look like they're competing for sex and money. Across the street, the old guys drink whisky in the alley. One sleeps in a Dumpster. He's got gangrene on his feet, and he doesn't have a year to live."
He continued: "There's even a club called Hell. That epitomizes the Beach. It's both fabulous and cruel. I see lots of people talking to themselves. You know why? Because there are haves and have-nots, and they despise each other. It's like Sodom and Gomorrah here, where every evil thing that God hated went on."
Another pull on the bottle. "As long as you're in Sodom and Gomorrah," he said by way of explanation, "you're part of it."
 
Muscles Outside and Sentiment Inside
 At Restaurant Las Americas on the Lincoln Road Mall Sunday night, Tiny Valdez, a very, very large man in his 40's, was at his usual place at the piano. Mr. Valdez, who came to Miami Beach 25 years ago, was serenading the mostly Cuban clientele.
Outside, men bulging out of their muscle shirts were coming and going at the gym nearby. Women in mean-looking black wedgies were heading for Lyon Freres, which everyone thinks of as the Dean & DeLuca of South Beach. Had they looked inside Las Americas, they would have seen a bubble of another Miami Beach, where the residents speak Spanish and the children wear starched sailor suits to dinner.
Sometimes Mr. Valdez's face became sad as he sang and swayed to his old-fashioned songs, as if he were remembering an unrequited love or perhaps Cuba before Castro. His playing wasn't sophisticated, but it sounded so essential and true that it could make you look at your life. It could make you want to start saying hello to the old people stuggling with their groceries on Collins Avenue, to volunteer somewhere instead of going to the gym so much, even to cancel the call-waiting option on your telephone.
But Miami Beach is an island of contradictions. One minute Tiny Valdez is singing songs from the old country, and the next he's arranging a gig on his cellular phone.
 
What's a Parent to Do? Well, . . .
 The Blue Moon Salon is one of the many boutiques in South Beach that have become a late-night colander for the consciously cool. Last weekend, Christopher Siragusa, a fashion editor at Wire, one of the many stylish free weeklies on the beach that tell stylish people what's stylish, was talking about "Secret Sex," a poem he had written.
"It's about how we never see our parents love and touch," he said. "When we were children, every time they wanted to have sex they just threw us in front of the television. God forbid we even knew they had erotic feelings for each other."
And God forbid those parents should show up in Miami Beach these days. The entire Deco district has become a parent-free zone of the prematurely bored who seem to have sprung into the world physically flawless.
If there are parents in the vicinity, you rarely see them out with those models-in-waiting and Portofino poseurs. And if the next Linda Evangelista is going home to crash at Grandma's after a night on Ocean Drive, that's none of your business.

HEADLINE: How to Create Jobs in a Changed Workplace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "New Jobs Depend on Fast Economic Growth, Experts Say" (Business Day, Dec. 29), you convincingly present the main difference between today's economic recovery and those of the past: growth in gross domestic product, with much less than normal employment growth. Unfortunately, this problem is of a much longer term than you indicate and reflects in a fundamental way structural changes that result from the application of modern workplace technologies.
Many organizations are redesigning the way they do work because of the programmability, versatility, high capacity and speed of computer and telecommunications technologies. Productivity improvement may have been stimulated by foreign competition and a prolonged recession, but the changes are designed not only to boost productivity in output but also to perform all tasks within the business more efficiently. As gross domestic product increases, the new systems and procedures permit greater levels of output with little additional hiring. 
 A key concern for policy debate must be that this redesign of work around new technologies is taking place everywhere simultaneously, in smokestack industries and highly sophisticated service companies, on the factory floor and in offices. Past experiences with mechanization and automation were slower and less ubiquitous, allowing for adjustments over time.
To oversimplify a bit, huge productivity increases occurred in agriculture when factory jobs were expanding; factories were automating while the service sector expanded. Today, almost all kinds of work are affected: shop-floor employment in factories is at a standstill; clerical employment, once one of the most rapidly expanding, is projected to grow very sluggishly because of the efficiency of word processors and other office equipment; middle management is being reduced by the thousands, while work systems are redesigned; new businesses expand with relatively few employees.
All of this is not an argument to stop or slow down technological progress. That would be both foolish and impossible. What is needed, though, is a recognition that these technical changes are changing the nature of the game.
If the United States is to see significant employment growth, as it must, then much more is needed in addition to the traditional tools of economic stimulus for business. We have to think about ways to reduce work time, an important mechanism for absorbing productivity growth in the past, which has been all but unavailable for decades.
Factory workers used to work 12 to 15 hours a day, six days a week, without vacations or pensions. With technological advances, the five-day week became standard a very long time ago. Unfortunately, the use of forced overtime to avoid new hiring is not uncommon today, exacerbating the problem.
Certainly, a great many important social needs are not being met by the private sector; we need to explore ways to encourage businesses to serve those needs and, when necessary, to expand Government employment to assure performance of necessary services. And we need to understand better the relationships between technological changes and job and workplace design, to deal better with education and training needs.
In short, a great deal more than traditional macroeconomic analysis is required, certainly in the short term, but also to deal with continuing, long-term trends.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Helped by Friendly Trade Rules, Trucks Fly Off the Lots

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
TRUCK-LIKE vehicles mini-vans, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks -- have replaced more and more cars as everyday transportation since the 1980's, defying expectations within the automotive industry that the trend would reach a plateau.
Last year saw yet another rise in the percentage of car buyers choosing mini-vans, pickups or sport utilities. In 1992, trucks of all kinds accounted for 37.4 percent of the 13.1 million vehicles sold, up from 24.5 percent a decade earlier. 
 This is terrific news for the domestic automotive industry, since importers haven't been able to seriously dent the highly profitable truck market. Indeed, the segment has become the Big Three's most important moneymaker. "It's one category in which America has a big advantage over the Japanese," said Cliff Winston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in automotive issues.
By 1990, 91 percent of all United States households owned one vehicle and 58 percent owned two or more, "so it makes sense that a second or third vehicle is more likely to be a mini-van or the like because it has uses that a car does not," said Ronald Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco.
Fortunately for American automakers, larger, heavier and more utilitarian transport seems to be gaining cachet, a shift for which the automakers can take some credit, having softened the rugged, male image of many earlier models. Consider the Ford Motor Company's Bronco II, a two-door utility vehicle. When Ford added a four-door version in 1989, it dropped the name Bronco II and renamed the line Explorer, conveying a more gender-neutral image that attracted women and families.
A less obvious reason for the strong sales is Federal law. A United States trade rule carried over from the 1960's imposes a 25 percent tariff on many imported truck models. The tariff could become even more comprehensive under President Clinton, a goal for which the chairmen of the Big Three lobbied strongly in Little Rock. The Japanese automakers in 1989 won a ruling from the Treasury Department that exempted mini-vans and four-door utility vehicles from the tariff.
Also, Federal fuel efficiency and safety regulations are less stringent for mini-vans, sport utilities and pickups than they are for cars, which helps explain the decline of the big station wagon. Safety rules were less stringent for trucks because they were not primarily passenger carriers, and because they had to be bigger and heavier, trucks could not meet significantly higher fuel efficiency standards. Engineers discovered that they could easily turn trucks into vehicles that passengers like, adding space, creature comforts and power.
Under the Federal mileage-efficiency standards called the CAFE standards (for corporate average fuel economy) , current model cars must get no less than 27.5 miles on a gallon of gasoline, while trucks must meet only a 21 mile-per-gallon standard. Every new car is also required to have a "passive restraint," which in most cases is met by an air bag. The rule is being phased in gradually for mini-vans, sport utilities and pickups and won't cover all of them until 1998.
"The trend will be toward more car-like features, including safety equipment," said Gary Meteer, a manager in the General Motors Corporation's truck division. Sophisticated suspensions and other control mechanisms can now simulate the performance of a car, which research suggests have helped make trucks more pleasing to women than ever before. G.M. said it will equip all its trucks with driver's-side air bags by 1995 and for all front-seat passengers by 1998.
Buyers have generally selected a truck brand on the basis of its reputation or performance characteristics, like the weight or number of passengers it can carry. But esthetics are becoming more important. The higher perch and rugged feel of truck-like vehicles have long appealed to drivers seeking a better field of vision and a greater sense of safety. Now automotive stylists are striving to impart distinct personalities to trucks by shaping their exteriors and adding interior features normally found in cars. This trend was highlighted at the North American International Auto Show here two weeks ago, when the Chrysler Corporation introduced its new Dodge Ram full-size pickup -- a startling contrast with its boxy competitors from Ford and Chevy.
"We wanted to make a breakthrough in pickup truck design," said Robert A. Lutz, Chrysler's president. The Ram's exterior styling, with exaggerated front fenders and a bold faux grille, pays homage to the trailer-trucks of Peterbilt and Kenworth.
Ford is trying to reach younger buyers later this year with its "flareside" Ranger pickup, the Splash. The company found that many younger owners of pickups in California were customizing the cargo bed in a way that added stylish fenders while cutting its capacity. Ford is hoping to sell about 35,000 of the new model this year.
"A truck can fulfill a younger buyer's need to be expressive, whereas a car in that price category might not," said Dean Schultz, a Ford research manager.
The luxurious Range Rover from Great Britain, which sells for $45,000, was once the only sport utility that offered leather upholstery. But now leather will be offered on a limited edition of the Explorer, and others are sure to follow. Just like many luxury cars, the Jeep Grand Cherokee offers an infrared remote entry system.
Domesticating influences notwithstanding, a hard core of enthusiasts still buy pickups and Jeeps to drive off-road, using bumper-mounted winches to extract their vehicles from ditches and mud pits. Often these are the folks who crowd stadiums to cheer monster trucks.
"Something in the American spirit likes great size and a failure to be subtle," said Leon Mandel, publisher of AutoWeek magazine. "Nothing accomplishes those things better than a truck."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Driving Is Safer Than Ever, Since Sobriety Sank In

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

 BODY:
FEWER people died in motor vehicle accidents last year than in any year since 1962, continuing a long-term trend in highway safety. Auto safety specialists insist that even more lives could be saved if more drivers used their seat belts and fewer of them mixed drinking and driving.
Factors contributing to the downward trend include improvements in motor vehicles and in driving habits and greater public responsibility for highway safety, prompted by stronger laws and by increased awareness. The sluggish economy last year also helped reduce accidents by curtailing driving strictly for pleasure. 
 But the Department of Transportation's estimated total of 6.2 million crashes and 39,000 deaths in 1992 -- a 5 percent reduction from in 1991 -- are still somber figures.
"We certainly should be able to go below 1.0 fatalities for every 100 million vehicle miles traveled," said Clarence Ditlow, president of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer affairs group. Last year's rate of 1.8 deaths per 100 million miles is the lowest on record. "We've made more progress on driver programs in the 1980's than on vehicle programs," he said.
"One of the canards in talking about public safety and Americans' driving habits is that 'You cannot change the way people drive,' " said Marion C. Blakey, administrator of the Federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "In fact, we have definitive evidence in front of us this year that Americans are changing the way they're driving, and driving a lot better."
Fewer people are driving while intoxicated. The Government projects a continuing decline in alcohol-related deaths -- from 57.3 percent of motor vehicle fatalities in 1982 to 45.8 percent last year. All states now have a minimum drinking age of 21.
"There's no doubt that Americans are regarding it as not only their own responsibility not to drink and drive, but as something they have to take responsibility for more broadly -- as hosts, as friends, as restaurant and bar owners," Ms. Blakey said. Some of this is the result of lawsuits against party hosts and bar owners.
"It's fair to say that the alcohol industry is stepping up to the plate," she continued. "You see this in their advertising." To a great extent, the response mirrors this country's changing attitudes about alcohol.
However, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, noted that many states have no prohibition against drinking while driving. "You can hold the steering wheel in one hand and a bottle of liquor in the other," Mr. Dorgan told a hearing of the Commerce, Science and Transportation committee last week.
Another improvement reflects the rate of seat-belt use, which increased to 62 percent last year from 12 percent in 1982, partly because of state laws. Only eight states have no requirement that drivers use seat belts.
 
Income Drops, So Does Social Travel
 Joan Claybrook, the president of the consumer group Public Citizen and a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the economy also played a role. "When the economy's in the sink, the death rate goes down because discretionary driving is reduced," she said. "People drive less for social reasons, and this includes teen-agers."
At the same time, Ms. Claybrook said she regarded the increase in highway safety as a vindication of programs she has long championed, including the use of seat belts, airbags and antilock brakes. "A huge number of efforts to reduce the death and injury rate are beginning to pay off," she said.
Half the cars sold in 1993 will have airbags, Ms. Claybrook said, and all new cars are required by law to have them beginning with the 1996 models, which become available in the fall of 1995.
Beginning this fall, all cars that have driver-side airbags must also have them on the passenger side. Ms. Claybrook said all states now have laws requiring automobile restraints for children. By the mid-1990's, all new cars and large trucks must have antilock brake systems, improved roof structures to protect against head injuries and rollovers, booster seats for children 5 to 8 years old and side-impact protection.
"The public interest campaign for safety has finally been bought by the automobile industry," Ms. Claybrook said. "For once, the consumers are selling the industry a product that both will buy."
Tom Carr, vice president for technical affairs of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, which represents domestic car and light truck makers, agreed that the industry has made big strides in safety.
"Our cars have antilock brakes, airbags and better headlights, windshields, tires, heaters and defrosters, steering and air conditioning, which reduces driver fatigue," Mr. Carr said. "We also have better roads, better road signs and better lighting, all of which contributed to driver safety."
But unlike Ms. Claybrook, who expects the improvements to continue, Mr. Carr believes the advances have peaked. "We're squeezing a dry sponge," he said.
"We're at a point of diminishing returns, because the numbers are so low," he said, referring to the number of fatalities per vehicle miles traveled.
Mr. Ditlow of the Center for Auto Safety disagrees. "We certainly haven't gone as far as we can go," he said. "We're not seeing the full effect yet of all the new programs that will take effect in the 1990's."
"These standards could have been issued 10 years ago," Mr. Ditlow said. "That's the tragedy. It's great that we've gone under 40,000 fatalities for the first time in 30 years. But the real question is: Why didn't we go under 30,000? The answer is delays in auto safety programs over the past 12 years."

HEADLINE: The Real Challenge of the Deficit Is Deciding How to Live With It

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
BILL CLINTON'S inclination to emphasize reducing the budget deficit, even at the risk of breaking campaign promises, might lead one to think that he has at last seen the light. But when it comes to the deficit, there is no light. If how to deal with it were a multiple-choice question, the possible correct answers would fill this page.
Mr. Clinton and his team focused last week on deficit-cutting because the latest Government figures had projected that the deficit would rise again, reaching $327 billion this year. Their reaction suggested that fighting deficits is a response to true economic principle. But dealing with deficits is not a matter of truth. It is a matter of judgments about how Americans should live, now and in the future. 
 "The first thing to do is to demystify deficits," said Robert Heilbroner, an economic historian, offering a view held not only by fellow liberals but also by conservatives like Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "The deficit hysteria is unfounded," Mr. Kudlow said flatly.
The Federal budget, in fact, has been in deficit every year since 1969, and almost no one holds out hope of getting rid of big deficits in this century. The question is how to regulate them so that they work for the country rather than against it. And here there is room for endless disagreement.
"Anything you do about the deficit involves making a choice from among competing values," said Joseph White, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution and co-author of "The Deficit and the Public Interest."
"But these competing values don't show up until you propose to do something about the deficit."
The debate over the budget always seems to highlight phrases like "profligate spending," "living beyond our means" and "saddling our children and grandchildren with our debts" -- as if the Government always behaved like parents who leave their children $10,000 in cash and $30,000 in a still unpaid car loan for a B.M.W. Ross Perot, campaigning as a deficit-cutter, drew on public antipathy to such unthrifty behavior. But what if the debt that the children inherited had paid not for a car, but for their college education? Does that make them willing to pay off their parents' loans?
The comparison is not far-fetched. Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, a man uneasy about big deficits, draws the parallel in this example. What if the Administration and Congress spent $300 billion over several years, adding much of it to the deficit, to clean up pollution and to help urban ghetto families rise from poverty? Would the environmental and social dividends make the next generation willing to pay the bill?
"The basic issue is how much do you want to emphasize future standards of living versus present standards of living," Mr. Reischauer said. "That requires a value judgment, and the deficit is an element in the equation."
 
Bad to Worse
 The Office of Management and Budget, in newly released projections, estimated Federal budget deficits for fiscal 1993 and 1994 that are higher than earlier estimates as well as last year's $290 billion figure. New projections are due later this month from the Congressional Budget Office, and they also are likely to show deficits this year and next that are somewhat higher than earlier estimates.
Reacting to the figures, Mr. Clinton's nominees to top economic posts dashed hopes for quick action on the middle-class tax cuts that Mr. Clinton promised during the campaign. But in Senate confirmation hearings, they stuck by proposals that might require increased deficit spending for job training or investment in public works -- and thereby made value judgments.
Another judgment will undoubtedly involve health care. The new deficit projections reflect sharply rising Medicare and Medicaid outlays, and if the Clinton Administration tries to cap these in the cause of cutting the deficit, said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist and consultant, it will have made a de facto social choice.
"In the name of bringing Medicaid-Medicare costs under control, we will probably end up cutting back medical care for the elderly," Ms. Freedman said. "Someone who is working might get very expensive kidney dialysis, because it would get that person back to work, but an elderly person might not."
The deficit can get too high, of course. That would happen if it rose much more rapidly than the national wealth, like a family floating a mortgage to purchase a vacation home when its income is not rising and it barely has enough to pay the mortgage on its main home and meet its other expenses. "The danger comes when the deficit grows explosively over a long period of time; that has not happened yet," said Francis M. Bator, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
The deficit last year was equal to 4.9 percent of the $6 trillion in new wealth created in the United States, as measured by the gross domestic product. That is well above the 2.9 percent in 1989, but is not considered high for a country emerging from the costs of lost tax revenue, higher unemployment insurance and other outlays associated with a recession. The deficit hit 6.3 percent of G.D.P. in 1983, as the nation came out of the last recession, and it stayed at 5 percent or more until 1987.
 
Debts and Jobs
 The big debate over values will come if the national wealth -- the family income -- fails to rise rapidly enough to accomplish two things at once: to keep up installment payments on the rising national debt and create enough new jobs to bring the unemployment rate, now at 7.3 percent, below 6 percent within a year or two.
To achieve this goal, many economists contend, the gross domestic product must grow at an annual rate of well over 3 percent for several years -- and if it does not, then the Government should spur the growth through public investments and other job-creating measures, even if this temporarily adds to the deficit.
There are two major value judgments in this view. One is that putting people back to work so quickly is more important than the risk of higher inflation and higher interest rates on loans, both often by-products of strong economic growth. Rarely, if ever, have political leaders led the public in a debate over a safe, acceptable level of inflation.
Mr. Clinton has not ruled publicly on the issue of inflation versus job growth, but he does hold to a belief that Wall Street economists like Mr. Kudlow and many other Americans do not share. The assumption that Mr. Clinton has promoted is that public investment creates rather than wastes wealth; that new highways, bridges, and research facilities, Americans and their companies more efficient and prosperous.
Disagreeing, Mr. Kudlow says: "The private sector is always a more efficient resource user than government." The bottom line of such a view is that government should not borrow and spend if it raises the deficit in the process. The national savings should be left for corporate America to invest, in its own good time.
"The deficit is a label that hides a lot of judgments," Mr. Reischauer said. "One has to look under the hood, to borrow a Ross Perot metaphor, to make a judgment as to how large a deficit we as a society should be willing to tolerate."

HEADLINE: If Kennedy's Musical Was 'Camelot,' What's Clinton's?

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
EACH evening from December to December, of all the images that linger of America's last boy-king, none is more enduring than the notion of John F. Kennedy's thousand days as "Camelot." It was a conceit graven in the national consciousness by his widow the week after his murder, when she recalled to Life magazine how he loved to listen to the hit Broadway album late at night.
As envisioned in the show's libretto (by the President's Harvard classmate Alan Jay Lerner) King Arthur's court was a place where young men of honor would use might only for right, and would "Talk! Discuss! Make laws! Plan improvements!" 
 Now, as the earnest crop of New Covenanteers arrives in Washington, led by a man who may be the suavest political image-maker since J.F.K. and who often takes pains to conjure up his legacy, the question arises: If "Camelot" was the Kennedys' musical, what would the Clintons' be?
The possibilities are tantalizing. Could it be "Hair," with its generational celebration of the counterculture in 1968, just before young Bill Clinton decided he should "Miss Saigon"? Or "Promises, Promises," a hit about infidelity from the same year?
Ken Mandelbaum, the author of "Not Since Carrie: 40 Years of Broadway Musical Flops" nominated "Bye-Bye Birdie," with its evocations of Elvis, while David Zippel, the lyricist of "City of Angels," suggested another Lerner show, "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," in tribute to Al Gore's environmentalism.
As it happens, Arkansas looms disproportionately large in the musical comedy canon, as any uninitiated Clintonites may learn on the Mall in Washington this afternoon when Broadway stars join the inaugural festivities. Carol Channing is to reprise her 1949 triumph as Lorelei Lee in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." "Just a Little Girl From Little Rock," who soon
up and left old Arkansas
Like a little lost lamb I roamed about
Till I came to New York and I found out
The one you call your Daddy ain't your Paw.
"She said to me the other night that she's been singing this song for all these years and it took the Clintons to finally make Little Rock really famous," recalled Jerry Herman, the composer and lyricist of Ms. Channing's other big show, "Hello, Dolly!" whose title song became "Hello, Lyndon!" for President Johnson's 1964 campaign. "So many things are going on that I don't think one musical could contain this administration."
For the foreign policy wonks, there is Nellie Forbush, the Navy nurse who left "Small Rock" to find romance in Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific." In a lament cut from the show before its New York opening but restored for the movie version, Nellie joins her fellow American, Lieut. Joe Cable, in wistfully asking
How far away, Little Rock, A.R.K.?
Princeton, N.J.
How far are they?
From coconut palms, and banyan trees
and coral sands and Tonk-in-ese?
Ethan Mordden, a Broadway historian, noted: "Little Rock is never a setting. People are from there, and it's sometimes a place people are very glad to get out of."
The new President would probably just as soon not be reminded of the one musical set in a mythical version of his home state: "Lil' Abner" takes place in Dogpatch, U.S.A., which the cartoonist Al Capp is said to have based on Arkansas. But Mr. Clinton might be flattered by Johnny Mercer's rip-snorting hymn for the Dogpatchers, who return from a visit to Washington proclaiming:
The Treasury says the national debt is climbing to the sky
And government expenditures have never been so high
It makes a fella get a gleam of pride within his eye
To see how our economy expands
The country's in the very best of hands!
In fact, Mr. Clinton has no known affinity for any Broadway show, and this uniquely American idiom seems unlikely ever again to stand tall enough in pop culture to cast such a shadow as "Camelot." Still, Mr. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, did use it when she was just 5 years old, in a handwritten letter to Ronald Reagan about his visit to a German graveyard where SS men were buried.
"Dear Mr. President," Chelsea wrote. "I have seen 'The Sound of Music.' The Nazis don't look like very nice people. Please don't go to their cematary."
Whatever his fate, there is surely one song Mr. Clinton, whose fondness for cholesterol is now as famous as his stories of his abusive stepfather, hopes he will not be singing for at least eight years. Ethel Merman introduced it in 1936, in Cole Porter's "Red, Hot and Blue":
I'm already in the kitchen fryin' chicken
and I hear Paw givin' Maw her daily lickin'
While a stretchin' on the floor
Is the mule that we all adore
Oh, the Ozarks are callin' me home.

HEADLINE: It's Never Fair to Just Blame the Weather

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
THE world still thinks of famine the way that Malthus did, as Mother Nature's revenge on hapless humanity. In fact, famine is anything but what the dour English economist called "nature's last most dreadful resource." As in Somalia, it is often a man-made disaster, an avoidable economic and political catastrophe.
The kind of famine that struck there -- created by clan warfare, not by crop shortages or endemic poverty -- is the rule, not the exception, according to several economists who have studied famines in Africa, Asia and Europe. 
 World food production has kept well ahead of population growth. Drought or flood do often precede famines. But declines in food production rarely account for them, says Amartya Sen, a Harvard economist whose 1981 book, "Poverty and Famines" (Oxford Press), changed the way many scholars analyze hunger. Typically, as thousands die, there's enough food in the country to go around or enough money to import it.
Disaster strikes because the poorest, most downtrodden members of society suddenly can no longer afford to buy food, usually because of sudden unemployment or a surge in food prices. And, particularly since World War II, whether or not a country starves depends more on whether it has a free press and a democratic government than on whether it has enough grain, trucks or foreign aid.
 
Death Amidst Plenty
 In eastern and sub-Saharan Africa, for example, there has been, on average, twice as much food available per person as in other flood- or drought-prone countries that managed to avoid mass deaths.
One of the worst recent famines -- Bangladesh's in 1974 -- took place in a year of unusually high rice production. As Martin Ravallion, a World Bank economist who specializes in poverty in Asia, described it: Severe flooding disrupted rice planting and threw landless rural laborers out of work. Then false fears of shortages doubled rice prices in a few weeks. For the poor, who spend more than three-quarters of their wages on food, the blow was catastrophic.
But the famine, which was largely over even before the rice crop was harvested, was hardly inevitable.
"Almost everything the government did made things worse," said Mr. Ravallion. Bangladesh's authoritarian rulers sent the army out to "bash hoarders," convincing people that it had lost control and fueling the price surge. The United States contributed by announcing that it would withhold food aid to punish Bangladesh for, of all things, selling jute to Cuba.
But poor countries need not starve. Famine relief has almost as long a history as famines. In the 4th century B.C., a Sanskrit book on statecraft advises: "During famine, the king should make a store of foodstuffs and show favor to the subjects or institute the building of forts or water works."
France and England suffered through dozens of famines in the Middle Ages. But since 1500, when they began growing enough to feed the population, their poor never starved because granaries were bare, as Malthus thought, but because they couldn't afford the grain.
Robert Fogel, a University of Chicago economic historian and an author of "Time on the Cross," a book that challenged the conventionl wisdom about the economics of slavery, has analyzed 500 years of food consumption, health and productivity in Britain and France. Even during the worst harvests, he concluded, inventories never fell below three months' worth of grain. But even a 5 percent drop in production sent prices zooming.
Kings James I and Charles I largely succeeded in averting famines between 1600 and 1640 by forcing merchants, bakers and brewers to sell their food stocks cheaply. Alas, the English civil war ended such benign intervention for the next 100 years.
In 1846-1851, Ireland starved in the potato famine largely because Parliament would not raise English taxes enough to save it, though it raised $60 million for the Crimean War.
Modern transportation has made it easier to move relief supplies. But far more important are the incentives governments have to save their own people. It's no accident that the familiar horror stories of the 19th and early 20th centuries occurred in one-party states, dictatorships or colonies: China, British India, Stalin's Russia.
"There has never been a famine in any country that's been a democracy with a relatively free press," said Professor Sen. "I know of no exception. It applies to very poor countries with democratic systems as well as to rich ones."
India, for example, has had no episodes of mass starvation since independence in 1947, despite food shortages in 1967, 1973, 1979 and 1987.
In western India, droughts led to surges in unemployment in 1972 and 1973. The average amount of food per capita in the area was half that in sub-Saharan Africa, but public works projects kept people from starving.
Meanwhile, Somalia, Ethiopia and the Sudan paid heavily for the absence of democracy. Wars, corruption and government reluctance to admit problems let droughts grow into starvation.
"There are countries that are not democratic and don't have famines -- Latin America, for example." said Professor Sen. "My point really is that if famine is about to develop, democracy can guarantee that it won't. When newspapers are controlled, it's amazing how ignorant and immune from pressure the government can be."
In Mao's China, up to 30 million may have starved during the Great Leap Forward. The government confiscated millions of villagers' family plots to gather them into collective farms, assuming the owners would keep working out of loyalty to socialist ideals. Output plummeted.
But Beijing did nothing, partially because it did not realize the program had failed; it actually increased the amounts that rural areas were required to send to cities. By 1960, as the famine was coming to a peak, the authorities thought they had 100 million more metric tons of grain than they did.
"In the process of deluding the world," said Professor Sen, "you delude yourself."
But even with the world alerted, handing out foreign grain isn't the best solution.
"It's just as important what happens to domestic markets and relative incomes as how effectively the army can deliver food to people," said Mr. Ravallion. "The indigenous institutions can do it much better."
Giving out make-work jobs, as India has often done, can help the poor buy grain and rebuild the roads and bridges for food trucks. Getting them back to their farms can help them grow it. Even announcing that shipments are on the way can drive the price down so they can afford it.
History suggests that America's mercy mission won't solve Somalia's starvation problem. Stable governments let farmers grow and democracy helps protect the poor.
"One hopes," said Mr. Ravallion, "that just by providing the framework -- peace -- a credible government will evolve. The people of Somalia have to do it. The U.S. Army can't."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Beyond the Confetti;
Capital Plans Party, but Reality Awaits

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
With a ringing of bells and a trademark bus tour, Bill Clinton and Al Gore ride into Washington on Sunday for a celebration they hope will recreate the magic of their campaign and obscure the muddle of their transition.
After leaving Little Rock, Ark., this evening to fly to Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Clinton will rise Sunday morning for a church service and then rumble into Washington by bus caravan, following the route Thomas Jefferson took by carriage 192 years ago from his home, Monticello.
 
No Dilution of Themes
 On paper, the inauguration will be a salute to Mr. Clinton's favorite themes and political techniques -- a televised fanfare for the common man played by a mob of celebrities. There will be bows to ethnic diversity, music from rock to rap, an entourage of certified little people and balls for Italians, animal lovers, police chiefs, homosexuals, Hispanic-Americans and the homeless. 
 For the next five days, America expects to see the sure-handed staging and crisp pacing that won the White House and the purity of themes that is probably only possible in campaigns, conventions, inaugurations, football half-time shows or fiction.
Then comes the nonfiction. After Tony Bennett on the Mall comes Saddam Hussein in the situation room. After America's Reunion comes the thorny business of mending South-Central Los Angeles. After the champagne come the confrontations between campaign promises and the budget ledger.
 
Seeking a Second Honeymoon
 Actually, it has already started. The confetti greeting the President-elect's arrival in Washington includes the fresh shreds of headlines questioning his allegiance to his campaign promises, the ethical behavior of his appointees and his grasp of the subtleties of foreign affairs. They also bring news of Ross Perot: He's back.
Mr. Clinton's quest for a second honeymoon stems not from any one event but from a series of missteps, backsteps and two-steps. Some were little things, like his decision to send his daughter to one of the most expensive private schools in Washington, even though he ran on a commitment to public education. Some were matters of appearance, like his ballyhooing of new ethics guidelines, while turning a blind eye to plans, since canceled, for his Commerce Secretary-designate, Ronald H. Brown, to be feted by corporate lobbyists paying $10,000 a table.
But the greatest damage was done by the President-elect's record-setting pace of putting off campaign promises -- even before being sworn in to deliver on them. In the space of a week, Mr. Clinton backed away from his pledges to enact a tax cut for the middle class, to halve the budget deficit in four years and to trim the White House staff by 25 percent. He also completely reversed his vow to throw open the borders to Haitian refugees seeking political asylum, after it became apparent that thousands were building boats to attend his inauguration in person.
The net effect of it all has been that some of the same pundits who led cheers for Mr. Clinton's election have started to raise the question, Who is this man on the bus from Monticello?
Mr. Clinton's response has been that he is the same man he was during the campaign; it is only the circumstances that have changed.
"The American people would think I was foolish if I said, 'I will not respond to changing circumstances,' " he said on Thursday. "I think that it would be irresponsible for any President of the United States ever not to respond to changing circumstances."
But that is too easy. The public, of course, would expect a President to adjust to changing circumstances that are beyond his control. But many of the circumstances Mr. Clinton now rails against are of his own making. In Haiti, for instance, the only circumstances to change since Mr. Clinton pledged to allow Haitians into the country were that thousands believed him and tried to take him up on the promise.
 
Changing Currency of Words
 In other words, the changed circumstances that Mr. Clinton finds himself wrestling with are not so much with the budget or events overseas as with the difference between campaigning, when words are cheap, and governing, when they are not.
Mr. Clinton, who ran on a platform of having a more specific, more detailed and more reasoned plan for the country than Mr. Bush, is paying a price for those specifics in the season of governing. Clinton aides admit they were not quite ready for this transition. It first became apparent three days after the election when Mr. Clinton off-handedly remarked that he was intent on carrying through with his promise to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military and was shocked to find those few words as the lead item of the next morning's newspapers.
"I think, obviously, there are some changes between campaigning and governing as you face new circumstances, as you face new complications," said Mr. Clinton's communications director, George Stephanopoulos. "But he is going to follow through on those major commitments."
And that explains why this inauguration is more than just a celebration for the Clinton team. It has an overt political objective, which has taken on urgency because of the way the transition evolved.
The inauguration is an effort to recapture the innocent optimism and popular good will that characterized the bus trip that Mr. Clinton and his running mate and their wives took after the convention, or that golden moment in Little Rock just after the results came in when Mr. Clinton closed with his signature line: "I still believe in a town called Hope."
"Let's not forget we have a President who was elected with only a plurality of the votes," said Barbara A. Bardes, professor of political science at Loyola University in Chicago. "We have a President who lost seats in the House and may do so in the Senate, and a President who is taking office while a third-party force led by Ross Perot is re-emerging. He doesn't have a landslide to support him. He has a fragile base but wants a national mandate."
It is quite clear from the polling data, noted Kevin Phillips, a Republican political analyst, that the public was feeling very good about Mr. Clinton between November and the New Year, before the rockiest moments of the transition period.
"But you are starting to see a change in the tenor of elite analysis," Mr. Phillips said. "His long list of broken promises, his slowness in getting started, is adding up to a sense of not ready for prime time. Right now it's mostly inside the Beltway, but it touches on something the wider public has in the back of its mind about Clinton, and the next few weeks will determine whether it mushrooms outside."
Interestingly, it is the Republicans who tangled with Mr. Clinton during the campaign who are now least willing to write him off before he has even started. They are keenly aware that with a great inaugural speech and a solid economic recovery package before Congress in a few weeks, he could easily come back into sharp focus for the vast majority of Americans, even if his package is not everything Mr. Clinton promised during the campaign.
"People should have learned in the last year not to underestimate him," said William Kristol, the chief of staff for Vice President Dan Quayle. "He can tolerate a fair number of negative press stories until Jan. 20, but if he gives a good inauguration speech and comes out fast after that, it will all be forgotten. He has a chance for a second honeymoon, but his bit of fumbling in the last few weeks of the transition has increased the pressure on him to come out fast."
Indeed, the Republicans are still wary of drowning in what they see as a reservoir of good will that still exists for the man from Hope.
"I think he is going to have a lot of good will," said Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, in a telephone conversation from Florida. "I was running on the beach today, and I saw a lot of people and they would shout at me: 'Give him a chance. Give him a chance.' "

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Perot Factor;
PEROT IS EXPANDING HIS GROUP TO SWAY THE NEW CONGRESS

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Ross Perot plans a major effort to influence legislation on Capitol Hill during the early years of the Clinton Administration, starting with the May 1 special election in Texas to replace Senator Lloyd Bentsen, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice as Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Perot said in an interview on Friday that in the first 24 hours after he announced his intention to resume political activity last Monday, more than 500,000 people called his telephone banks and more than 400,000 joined United We Stand, America, the organization that grew out of his independent Presidential campaign in 1992. Tens of thousands of letters are piled in a warehouse here, waiting to be opened. The group's annual dues are $15. 
 In a year or two, he said, the group may be financially self-sustaining, but he will be its spokesman and will help it financially as needed. He waved aside any suggestion that it constitutes a nascent third-party organization.
 
Inviting the Candidates
 For the special election, which will be an important test of his political muscle, Mr. Perot said he hoped to "stage huge rallies across Texas and invite the candidates to come and address our agenda, then put the whole thing on television." The candidate who spoke most convincingly to issues like the Federal deficit and governmental reform would be endorsed.
Mr. Perot asserted that in the Senate run-off election in Georgia last Nov. 24, the backing of his supporters provided the margin of victory for Paul Coverdell, the Republican candidate. Mr. Coverdell, whom the Perot backers (but not Mr. Perot himself) endorsed because he had pledged to cut the deficit, defeated the incumbent Democrat, Wyche Fowler Jr., by only 17,000 votes.
Georgia politicians said people wearing Perot buttons had been conspicuous in Mr. Coverdell's crowds, but precisely how many voted for the Republican is not possible to determine.
After Texas, the next step will be electronic town meetings. At a series of such meetings all over the country later this year, Mr. Perot said, supporters will discuss issues with the help of expert testimony, either delivered in person by academic or other specialists, or possibly summarized by discussion leaders. They would then vote for the approach they favored on, say, medical care or taxes, and through the use of computers, he said, it would be easy to compile results by Congressional District and by state that could be used to bring pressure on Representatives and Senators. The implication was that unyielding legislators might well find themselves with Perot-backed opponents at the polls.
 
'Little Guys' Together
 The whole effort would be conducted at the grass roots and coordinated from Dallas, with no Washington headquarters, no marches or demonstrations in the capital and certainly no paid lobbyists, Perot aides said.
"It gives the little guy a voice by putting him together with other little guys," Mr. Perot said. "At least these members of Congress will know what their constituents think, and I think that will have some influence."
"If we have enough votes," Mr. Perot argued, "they'll pay attention. If we get a big enough turnout, we'll knock everyone right on their ear."
During a 90-minute conversation in his attractive but not notably luxurious suite of offices in North Dallas, Mr. Perot said at first that he intended "to back off and give this Clinton group a little time." As he warmed up, he spoke critically about Mr. Clinton's policies, but he refrained from personal attacks, even exempting Ronald H. Brown, Mr. Clinton's choice for Commerce Secretary, who has been widely criticized for his lobbying activities.
"Clinton was strong as horseradish on government reform during the campaign," he said. "When their delegation came down here to see me that day, when I was deciding whether to get back into the race, they were going to get rid of lobbyists, they were going to get rid of special-interests money.
"But there's been a drift since. They talk about their new ethics rules, but they've left all those lobbyists in place who gave them big money."
 
Admiration for Bentsen
 Sitting in a small conference room at a Formica-covered table, with souvenirs of his adventures as a young naval officer in France and Japan framed on the wall behind him, Mr. Perot outlined his plans with less flamboyance but just as much determination as he has displayed in television appearances.
He welcomed a suggestion by George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, that the Clinton White House would reach out to his supporters on fiscal issues. And he said he was pleased that David C. Wilhelm, Mr. Clinton's choice to head the Democratic National Committee, had indicated that reform in such favorite Perot areas as voter registration and campaign financing would be given a high priority.
But he said he had had no contact with either Mr. Clinton or with Senator Bentsen since the election. Mr. Perot so admires Mr. Bentsen that he once said he might not have run for President had Mr. Bentsen been the Democratic nominee. The only "feeler" he had had, Mr. Perot said, was a suggestion by Mickey Kantor, who is to be Mr. Clinton's trade representative, that Mr. Perot might want to attend the economic conference that Mr. Clinton held in Little Rock.
"We both decided against it," Mr. Perot said, "because we were afraid I might be the focus of media attention instead of the economic issues."
Although Mr. Clinton's associates had indicated that the President-elect would name Perot supporters or Republicans to prominent positions in his Administration, and although his own relatively narrow popular-vote majority suggested that such a move would be politically wise, Mr. Clinton has so far not done so. Preliminary talks were reportedly held with John White, who helped put together Mr. Perot's economic program and then backed Mr. Clinton, but nothing came of them.
 
Possible G.O.P. Appointees
 Choosing Cabinet members or senior aides from other parties has been a common practice under recent Presidents. John F. Kennedy chose Douglas Dillon, a Republican, as Treasury Secretary, and Richard M. Nixon named Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now a Democratic senator from New York, as his top adviser on urban poverty. James R. Schlesinger, a Republican, has held ranking positions under Presidents of both parties.
Some Republicans may yet win sub-cabinet positions. A recruiting effort, headed by Bob Nelson, a political consultant from Southern California, has been working on the problem, transition officials reported. One possible candidate is said to be a former Representative from Rhode Island, Claudine Schneider, a moderate Republican. Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, is another Republican who has been mentioned as a possible sub-cabinet choice.
But it now appears extremely unlikely that anyone with significant ties to Mr. Perot will be given any position in the Clinton Administration.
Would Mr. Perot himself be interested in giving advice to Mr. Clinton? "Only if I was sure they were serious and not just using me, only if the topic is something we're going to do, not just talk about," he said.

HEADLINE: Riley Sims, 90, Dies; Leader in Cable TV And in Construction

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Riley V. Sims, who rose from poverty to success in the construction, concrete, telecommunications and cable television industries, died Wednesday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., his home town. He was 90.
He had cancer, his family said, 
 When Mr. Sims, a native of East St. Louis, Ill., was 12, his father died. The youth quit school after the seventh grade to support his mother by baling hay for 50 cents a day and shucking corn for 6 cents a bushel.
During the Depression, after the family had moved to Florida, he formed a handshake partnership with a friend, Russell Burnup. Both were unemployed carpenters. They pooled $30 in cash and their tools and began doing repair jobs and transporting sand for construction.
Eventually Sims & Burnup grew to become a major contractor, erecting office buildings, schools and shopping centers in West Palm Beach. Their company introduced ready-mixed concrete to South Florida and by the 1940's they operated 65 concrete plants across the southeast United States and the Caribbean.
At Mr. Sims's initiative, the company shifted into the installation of lines for rural telephone service, and from that expanded into installing cable television.
In time Sims & Burnup became the nation's largest cable television installer. Over the last 32 years, it has wired a quarter of the nation's 5,800 cable systems. Last years it reported $153 million in sales.
Mr. Sims, who won the Horatio Alger Award from the American Schools and Colleges Association, remained chairman of the company until he retired in 1989.
He is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Lillian Bamford; a daughter, Sandra Millspaugh of Asheville, N.C., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Old Order;
A Power Couple, Suddenly Powerless

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16

 BODY:
Together they make more than $200,000 a year, he as the chief negotiator on textile matters at the Commerce Department, she as a high political appointee at Treasury. They are the quintessential Reagan boomer couple, with a first home in a town house on Capitol Hill, now with a "real" house in the upscale suburb of McLean, Va.
Thanks to the Federal Government, that bloated bureaucracy Republicans so like to lambaste, Ronald Sorini and Desiree Tucker-Sorini, both in their mid-30's, have never been without a job on the public payroll for over 10 years. 
 Now it is coming to an end. They are being thrust out into the cold world of the private sector.
"Noon on the 20th," said Ronald Sorini, whose job carries with it the rank of ambassador and an annual salary of $115,000. His wife's salary is the same.
 
Scary and Exciting
 In an interview in Ms. Tucker-Sorini's executive office suite, whose windows look out on the splendid view of the West Wing of the White House, Mr. Sorini said the prospect of job hunting in a tight market was "scary."
"And it's exciting," added Ms. Tucker-Sorini, whose position as assistant secretary for public affairs and public liaison has taught her the value of nuance.
"It's exciting and scary at the same time," continued Mr. Sorini. "I haven't been out looking for a job since college. I've been very fortunate. Since I got my first job, I've always had another job offered to me without much effort to go out and look for one."
Ms. Tucker-Sorini, who has the affirmative demeanor of a 12-step program instructor, is slightly more upbeat about her prospects, perhaps because she has had experience in the private sector. She worked as a marketing director for Xerox for a year after she graduated from Colorado State University in 1980, and one year as a fund-raiser for a company she and her father created.
She first worked at the Commerce Department as a press secretary, then in executive positions. She moved to the Treasury as deputy assistant secretary in 1989 and has held her current position since 1991.
Now that her resignation to President Bush is submitted and accepted, Ms. Tucker-Sorini, 35, has had a sudden revelation that Washington is not a real place after all.
"I've never considered Washington home. I don't know how anyone can," she said. "People here are much more interested in your position and socialize on that basis. The power here is your ability to influence policy, or your access to people and information. There is nothing wrong with that, but we'd really like to live a life that reminds us of where we grew up."
 
'Knew This Day Might Come'
 The Sorinis' situation is not one that the thousands of Americans who lost jobs in the recession are likely to empathize with, even though Ms. Tucker-Sorini noted that their income will "be zero until we find a job." They do not have children and are not expecting any cash-flow problems.
"We knew this day might come," said Mr. Sorini.
Mr. Sorini, 37, began working for the Government as a trade specialist in the Commerce Department immediately after receiving his master's degree from Georgetown University in 1980. He became Deputy Assistant Chief Textile Negotiator in 1988, and took his present position in 1989. He helped work out the North American Free Trade Agreement to lower trade barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico, and is currently working on the 180-nation world trade talks.
Until Jan. 20, Federal conflict-of-interest laws prevent Mr. Sorini from even entertaining any job offers. His wife, however, has had several interviews.
"Governor Clinton said several times during the election that he'd bring some Republicans into his Administration," Mr. Sorini said. "A lot of people called me and said, 'Well, do you think you'd be one of those Republicans he'd bring into his Administration?' I kind of chuckled because a lot of Democratic friends of ours would tell us privately: 'Are you kidding? We've been out of office 12 years! We're not giving any positions to Republicans.' "
Asked if he would have accepted if such a position had been offered, Mr. Sorini paused. "Gee, that's a tough one," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photo: "We knew this day might come," said Ronald Sorini of the termination of his Government job and that of his wife, Desiree Tucker-Sorini, on Jan. 20. Mr. Sorini, whose job carries with it the rank of ambassador and Mrs. Sorini, an assistant secretary for public affairs and public liaison in the Treasury Department, have not been without a job on the public payroll for more than 10 years.

HEADLINE: Arizona Hopes Holiday for King Will Mend Its Image

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 16

 BODY:
The citizens of Arizona have a perfect retort for the talk show hosts, ghetto rappers and East Coast pundits who have pilloried their state as a racist backwater, one of the last holdouts against a paid holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
On Monday, after years of botched legislation, rescinded gubernatorial decrees and failed ballot measures, Arizona will officially celebrate the King birthday for the first time. And with chins jutted forward, Arizonans can brag that when they resoundingly voted in November to approve the holiday, they made Arizona the first and only state to honor Dr. King by popular vote. 
 "I keep pointing out that we're the only state in the union to put it to the people," said Gov. Fife Symington, who delights in distancing himself from Arizona's last Republican Governor, Evan Mecham, who rescinded a King holiday five years ago, costing the state millions in convention revenue and reams of bad publicity. "That vote makes a wonderful statement about Arizona. I think the whole image thing flipped on Election Day."
Governor Symington's boast was repeated by the Rev. Warren H. Stewart, pastor of the First Institutional Baptist Church and a leader of last fall's electoral campaign, which reversed the results of two earlier ballot failures and made the slain civil rights leader's birthday a paid holiday for more than 66,000 state workers here.
 
Only State to Vote
 "No other state in the nation dared to seek voter approval," Mr. Stewart said this weekend, as Arizona readied itself for the big day on Monday. "And had they done so, many states would not have had a holiday all these years."
Mr. Stewart added that Arizonans of all colors had supported the holiday this time to "restore our collective self-esteem, which was injured and falsely maligned by the last vote," in 1990.
That sort of defensive self-congratulation echoed in the legislative chambers here this week, from church pulpits and at a huge civic celebration on Friday morning at the downtown basketball arena, where politicians, civil rights leaders and celebrities shared the spotlight with gospel choirs, step dancers and steel bands.
But that kind of talk was totally absent in the auditorium of the Martin Luther King Jr. School in south Phoenix, so named in 1972 and busy ever since staging commemorative assemblies, parades and poetry readings while the state's political, civic and business leaders fought about how and whether to declare a formal holiday.
 
Observance in School
 "I'd rather see a sermon anytime than hear one," said the principal, Mavis J. Edwards, who made no remarks about the politics of Martin Luther King Day at Friday's school assembly, when 570 children from kindergarten to fourth grade turned out with scrubbed faces, crisp hair ribbons and proud parents in tow.
Instead, Mrs. Edwards turned the stage over to the youngsters, who played squeaky violins, lighted memorial candles, crowned an African-American queen and a Mexican-American king to lead their holiday parade, signed pledges to live in peace and justice and sang a rollicking "We Shall Overcome."
Arizona was not the last state, merely the most notorious, to accept Dr. King's birthday as a state holiday, which has happened elsewhere by legislation or gubernatorial decree. Montana, Idaho and North and South Dakota were slower to match what Congress and President Reagan did in 1983, when they created a King holiday for Federal workers by combining Lincoln and Washington's birthday into one joint day off. And New Hampshire climbed on board just this week with a resolution from Gov. Steve Merrill.
But Arizona, a state that never does anything because everybody else does, had been the most ostentatious holdout. And the soap opera began in 1987 when Mr. Mecham, a one-time Pontiac dealer and devout Mormon, replaced Bruce Babbitt as Governor and, in his first official act, rescinded the holiday that his predecessor had decreed.
 
Matter of Law or Bigotry
 Mr. Mecham (pronounced MEE-kum) claims to this day that the Babbitt decree was illegal and that his motivation was reverence for the law, not bigotry. But Mr. Mecham was prone to offending minority groups and quickly became an embarrassment to Arizonans, who eventually impeached him for corruption and deceit that political experts here say would otherwise have gone uninvestigated.
Mr. Mecham said this week that he was neither apologetic nor bitter about what he did regarding the holiday and what happened to him later. But he had no plans to participate in Monday's observance. "I won't be asked and I have no desire," he said. "Let them all whoop it up and have a good time."
Once Mr. Mecham was out of office, the matter of the King holiday was thrown back to the legislature and ultimately onto the ballot. In 1990, voters considered two competing measures, one that would have eliminated Columbus Day in favor of King Day and the other that would have added an extra paid holiday. The first plan offended Italians and the second was costly. But more important, voters were confused.
Complicating the 1990 campaign, and, pollsters said, sealing the defeat of both measures, was the threat by the National Football League to move the 1993 Super Bowl from Tempe, Ariz., to Pasadena, Calif., where it will be played later this month. Folks here resented the outside pressure (political blackmail, some called it) and asserted their signature don't-mess-with-me attitude at the ballot box.
 
Vote Didn't Turn on Race
 Amazingly, given all the reasons not to vote for a holiday, 65 percent of the voters did, in one form or the other, but neither measure won a majority. And the combined vote suggests that racial attitudes, especially outside cities and in retirement communities, were not the deciding factor.
The 1990 defeat of the King holiday was costly since Arizona became the focus of an economic boycott like the one that is now draining convention and tourist business from Colorado, which recently passed a measure that bans gay-rights laws.
According to Arizona tourist officials, the failure to pass a King holiday cost the state $190 million in canceled conventions and another $150 million because of the lost Super Bowl, which may return here in 1996 thanks to the recent election results. Tourist officials added that a half dozen of the canceled conventions had rebooked since November. And in recent days, Arizona has picked up a few of the conventions that are boycotting Colorado.
 
Different Kind of Campaign
 The 1992 campaign was very different from the one two years earlier. There was only one measure on the ballot, a twin of the Federal law. The minority and business communities worked together, relying on low-key advertising that avoided accusatory rhetoric and blended economic and moral arguments. There were heavy registration drives in churches and on college campuses. And the measure passed by a margin of 61 to 39.
The impact of victory was more symbolic than real since Phoenix and nearly two dozen other cities, home to 2 million of Arizona's 3.7 million people, had already declared local holidays. But for blacks, who represent less than 3 percent of the population, the official sanction mattered.
"We did not need the state's permission to honor Martin Luther King because we were already doing that," said Opal Ellis, a retired city administrator. "But we as a people had been rejected. The holiday itself became a symbol of my somebodiness and my peoples' somebodiness."
 
Hopes to Erase Caricature
 Both whites and blacks this weekend were hoping that approval of the holiday laid to rest the caricature of Arizona as a racist state, mocked by the rock group Public Enemy and the television program "In Living Color," among others.
That is wishful thinking, said political and civil rights leaders, who pointed to continued red-lining in poor neighborhoods, to sharp reductions in health and education spending and to the distinct issues faced by the Hispanic and Native American people of Arizona, who are are more numerous than the blacks but often less assertive.
But racial divisions could be eased as a result of the state embracing the King holiday, some experts said. "It has raised the visibility of people who the power structure would prefer to ignore," said Peter Goudinoff, a state senator from Tuscon and a lecturer in political science at the University of Arizona. "People here are not so much racists as they don't pay attention. Making Martin Luther King an issue has built sensitivity and that in itself is a good thing."

HEADLINE: HAITIANS EXPRESS SENSE OF BETRAYAL

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CA IRA, Haiti, Jan. 16

 BODY:
A week ago, those planning their escape from Haiti spoke of President-elect Bill Clinton with reverence. His statements in favor of Haitian refugees had earned him a common saying, "After God comes Bill Clinton."
But his decision this week to maintain for now the Bush Administration's policy of summarily returning fleeing boat people to Haiti has caused many here to regard Mr. Clinton as the author of the ultimate betrayal. 
 "Now we consider Bill Clinton to be a macoute just like the rest of our tormentors," said Claude Mimi, a bare-chested 22-year-old who was daubing blue caulk in the hull of one of a dozen boats nearing completion on the half-moon beach here. Macoute, or bogeyman, is perhaps the lowliest epithet in Haitian Creole.
 
U.S. Sends Ships
 In an attempt to block a wave of refugees who were expected to sail in hopes of arriving in the United States on Wednesday, Inauguration Day, Mr. Clinton announced on Thursday that he would return the boat people without giving them a chance to apply for asylum. On Friday, the Coast Guard began to move ships toward Haiti to help discourage people from fleeing.
But Mr. Mimi and dozens of others interviewed along a boat-filled shore 25 miles southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince, said that given what they consider such a blatant show of American bad faith they had no other option but to flee anyway.
For these Haitians, many of whom sold everything they owned to set out from here during another chaotic wave of emigration last spring, Mr. Clinton's promises to redouble Washington's efforts to restore democracy to their country mean almost nothing now.
"We counted on him once, and now we are in an even worse predicament," said Jean-Fritz Sera, an unemployed 23-year-old who freely admitted to angling for a spot on a boat next week. "Do you think we can have faith in him again? The only thing left to do is try to escape the misery that is strangling us all."
 
Hypocrisy Is Charged
 As Mr. Sera spoke, others chimed in, each comment angrier than the last.
"George Bush always said he'd bring Aristide back too, but he was the one who did the coup," said Sylvain Christony, referring to the military's violent overthrow of the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in September 1991. "Clinton said he would give the Haitians dignity. Now he is blockading our country, not to keep up the embargo, but to keep us out of Miami."
Mr. Christony noted what many here consider the hypocrisy of stopping Haitians at sea while allowing maritime commerce to prosper despite a hemisphere-wide embargo decreed against Haiti shortly after the coup. A few miles from Ca Ira, a huge oil tanker unloaded its cargo this morning while a Coast Guard cutter had to negotiate its way through a congested port before unloading 212 Haitians intercepted at sea on Friday.
If the poor of this country had invested Mr. Clinton with outsized hopes, the army and many in the tiny elite who fiercely oppose the return of Father Aristide had begun to regard the President-elect, and his pledges to work hard for a political settlement here, with great trepidation.
But Haitian political analysts say that Mr. Clinton's recent switch may have another unintended effect: convincing those who have resisted international calls for a return to democracy that Washington is less than serious.
"After the inauguration, once the boat people hysteria dies down, a lot of people are already saying you will see Clinton turning to his domestic agenda and putting us on the back burner," a wealthy businessman said. "The new team has already lost a lot of credit here, and people will not be listening to what they say so much as watching what they do."
 
U.N. Sends Envoy
 Reactions like this come as the United Nations has sent a high-level envoy here to meet with military and civilian leaders to persuade them to accept a large mission of human rights monitors, a step many see as necessary if conditions are to be created where negotiations between Father Aristide's supporters and country's de facto rulers can take place.
"If there is going to be any hope of settling this thing, we have to be very careful not to send any mixed messages," said a diplomat who has been in frustrated negotiating efforts since the beginning of Haiti's current crisis. "I am afraid this came dangerously close to sending a mixed message."
Other diplomats, however, said that if Mr. Clinton's change of direction on refugees had been an unpleasant surprise for many here, the decision to send a large flotilla of Coast Guard and Navy ships to the waters near here would have a positive, if indirect, effect on the calculations of Haiti's rulers.
"Word immediately went out here that this was a naval blockade, even though it was never described as a blockade," said a diplomat who requested anonymity. "Whatever they call it though, it is an impressive demonstration of power that will not be lost on a bunch of people who are already a bit shaken up."

HEADLINE: Earth Needs Change to Survive, Study Says

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON Jan. 16

 BODY:
Despite growing interest in the fate of the planet, nothing short of sharp changes in government policies and people's attitudes will rescue the earth's ailing ecosystems from destruction, a report from the Worldwatch Institute says.
In the institute's annual report on the state of the world, Lester R. Brown, president of the Washington-based environmental research group, is not without hope. Indeed, Mr. Brown notes that there were more journalists at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June than there were participants in a similar conference in Stockholm 20 years earlier. But he warns that the strides made in Rio were not nearly long or swift enough to save the earth. 
 The report, "State of the World 1993," cites familiar examples of the earth's environmental problems, including rising population, increasing carbon emissions (which many scientists blame for global warming), depletion of the ozone layer, vanishing forests and the erosion of topsoil.
It contends that if such trends continue, the world will be populated by too many people with too few resources to sustain them. By the middle of the next century, the report says, poverty, hunger and pollution will be even more widespread and perhaps irreversible.
Though recycling and conservation can help alleviate these problems, the report says such measures are insufficient and calls for sweeping changes by government, industry and the public.
 
Higher Taxes Possible
 People in industrialized nations must want, and even demand, environmentally sustainable technologies, although this may require higher taxes, the report says. Governments, in turn, must make private companies responsible by enacting policies "that make economic and ecological imperatives converge."
Governments should regulate the burning of fossil fuels, the production of hazardous chemical and nuclear waste, and the use of pesticides, the report says. More important, it goes on, they should subject all of these activities to taxation. The carbon tax, which is intended to discourage the use of fossil fuels, would be one such example. Sweden, Finland, Denmark and the Netherlands have already adopted it.
The report suggests that environmental taxes would not only encourage thrift but would also spawn many new, environmentally sustainable technologies that drew from alternative sources like solar and wind power.
In an interview, Mr. Brown said the measures called for in the report would involve investments in the trillions of dollars, but he added: "People are always asking how much it would cost us to respond to these problems. I ask how much it would cost if we don't."
He said a mandate for environmentally friendly technologies could be an economic boon for some companies and a powerful stimulus for industrial innovation.
 
Winners and Losers
 "Those corporations that anticipate how environmental trends will influence the evolution of the global economy and incorporate them into their long-term plans will be the winners," he said. "Those companies that resist change will be the losers."
Copies of "State of the World 1993" can be obtained for $10.95 from the Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington 20036.

HEADLINE: Florio Strives To Be Phoenix of '93 Politics

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Two and a half years after he angered virtually the entire state by pushing a record $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature, Gov. Jim Florio has risen from the political dead. Even his severest critics say he will be tough to beat in November.
The Governor's bleak poll ratings began to thaw last August, and Mr. Florio, a scrappy Brooklyn street kid who went on to become a Navy middleweight and is now a cerebral policy expert with the charisma of a flow chart, has a fighting chance for re-election 10 months from now. 
 A poll by The Asbury Park Press to be released on Sunday puts Mr. Florio, previously considered a sure loser, neck and neck with one potential Republican rival, former Attorney General W. Cary Edwards, and within striking distance of the other, Christine Todd Whitman, the new Republican star who almost beat the state's senior Senator, Bill Bradley, in 1990.
 
G.O.P.'s Principal Message
 The poll, of 501 respondents who identified themselves as likely voters, found that 32 percent would vote for Mr. Edwards and 31 percent for Mr. Florio, with the rest undecided. When the respondents were asked to choose between Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman, 36 percent selected Mrs. Whitman and 30 percent Mr. Florio, with the rest undecided. The poll, taken on Jan. 8 and Jan. 10, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
Buoyed by such signs, the Governor is poised for a re-election campaign based on two main themes: Voters might not like it, but he did what was necessary, and he steered the state out of recession and onto a path to solid recovery.
The Republicans, however, will drum home one message: You cannot believe Jim Florio. They will stress that regardless of whether the economy picks up, whether or not Mr. Florio takes credit for it and regardless of who their own nominee is.
 
A Message to Sell
 "What Governor Florio has got to say," said Cliff Zukin, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, and a former director of its political poll, "is that, 'You might not like what I've done, but it was necessary for the state.' If he can't sell that, he can't be re-elected."
"He really can't say to the voters, 'You really do like me' because they don't. All the polls say that. And he can't shift the political ground to something else. No matter what he does, he is the issue. He has got to say, 'I have earned your respect.' "
Can it work?
"Yes, it can be done," Mr. Zukin said. "Brendan Byrne did it. The question is whether Jim Florio can."
Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's popularity plummeted to 17 percent in a poll conducted by the Eagleton Institute about a year after his administration imposed an income tax in 1976. Dubbed "one-term Byrne," he managed to convince voters that the tax was necessary and was re-elected handily in 1977.
Although Governor Florio is by no means well liked, his approval ratings edged up last August, when 32 percent of voters gave him a favorable rating in an Eagleton/Star-Ledger poll. His rating plummeted below 25 percent percent in July 1990. It stayed there for two years as anti-tax demonstrators marched on Trenton, "Impeach Florio" bumper stickers blossomed across the state and a Trenton radio station introduced its State House news with the sound of hogs snuffling at the trough.
But history may have absolved Jim Florio. Since he rammed his $2.8 billion tax package through the Legislature in the wee hours of the morning -- one ailing Democratic Senator, Walter Rand of Camden, rose from a sickbed to provide the critical vote -- many other states have raised taxes, including neighboring Pennsylvania.
The Governor's second theme for this year's campaign was illuminated by his State of the State Message this week. Part of it was in the form of a glossy primer on the state's achievements that featured no fewer than 13 photographs of Mr. Florio in 24 pages, holding up shovels at ground-breakings and chatting with blue-jeaned workers in factories.
This is a year of major political import in New Jersey, which both sides agree is being watched across the country. On Nov. 2, the Governor and all 120 members of the Legislature are up for re-election, which happens only once a decade.
 
Potential Mudslide
 Though Governor Florio must be rated the underdog, he has other things going for him: The two Republican candidates might well damage each other in a bitter primary on June 8, spending more than $2 million each in the process. That would leave Mr. Florio relatively safe on the sidelines until the middle of June, and allow him to bank his own primary war chest, since no serious primary opponent has emerged.
Too, Democratic strategists say the Governor can count on help from the new President, Bill Clinton, who was helped considerably by $4 million that Mr. Florio helped him raise in New Jersey, and by the all-out political effort by the Democrats that delivered this state to their party's Presidential candidate for the first time in 28 years.
Mr. Florio's campaign will also be guided in part by James Carville, the political consultant who guided Mr. Clinton's successful campaign.
Mr. Carville has been on retainer for the New Jersey State Democratic Committee for more than a year, even before he went to work for Mr. Clinton. He said in a telephone interview from Washington that he had met with the Governor several times over the last few months and would begin work intensively in the state "around the beginning of February."
"I'm very committed to this race," he said. "I'll be up there a lot."
Mr. Carville suggested that he would cast Mr. Florio as a leader undeterred by politics.
"I believe that there is a better than sustainable case that he has done more in four years than anybody else has in eight," Mr. Carville said. He intends to insist that Mr. Florio's opponent, "whether Mr. Edwards or Mrs. Whitman," provide "their own ideas, plans and policies" in an effort not to allow Mr. Florio's negatives, like the tax increase, to monopolize the debate.
"We are going to look forward, and if they want to try to turn the clock back, they can do it," he said.
 
Effect of Economy
 And will his former client, Mr. Clinton, be available to campaign for Mr. Florio?
"I'm sure he will," Mr. Carville said.
Even Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, the Republican Assembly Speaker and the Governor's chief critic in Trenton, has conceded that despite his liabilities on taxes, "Jim Florio could be tough to beat."
Mr. Haytaian took himself out of the running despite a fledgling boom among young conservatives that he take on the Governor. The Speaker said that if the state's economy came alive -- as he expected it to -- Mr. Florio would reap the benefit.
"Sure, if Jim Florio ran today, he would lose. But you don't win or lose in January. You win or lose in November," Mr. Haytaian said.
Mr. Florio's advisers differ over whether he is better off running against Mr. Edwards or Mrs. Whitman. Mr. Edwards has an extensive political background, and therefore both a claim to experience and potential liabilities if his record can be effectively attacked.
Mrs. Whitman, on the other hand, has limited governmental and political experience, but she can claim to be a new force for reform, unfettered by the errors of the past.
"They've both got strong points and weak points," another adviser said, "so he has to run as Jim Florio regardless."
 
'Do You Believe?'
 Stephen A. Salmore, a political scientist on the staff of the Eagleton Institute who is a consultant to Mr. Edwards, said that despite Mr. Florio's improved standing, "it is still the Republicans' race to lose." But, he adds, "It would be foolish to write Jim Florio off."
The Republican candidate should run on policy issues, Mr. Salmore said, but whether it is Mr. Edwards or Mrs. Whitman, he said there is always a trump card: "Do you believe Jim Florio?"
The firestorm over the 1990 tax increase was fanned not only by the size of the increase, but also because, as even Mr. Florio acknowledged, many voters thought he "lied to them." During his campaign in 1989, he said repeatedly that he did not think that a tax increase would be necessary, but he pushed one through only six months after taking office.
Of the candidates, only Mr. Edwards has officially declared, and Mrs. Whitman has scheduled her formal announcement for the last week in January. An aide said the Governor would announce in March.
Jeffrey Michaels, Mr. Edwards's campaign manager, set off the first major tiff between the two Republican candidates when he accused Mrs. Whitman last week of of "misleading New Jersey voters" by filing with the elections officials but delaying announcement of her candidacy until the end of the month.
That brought a retort from the Whitman camp that Mr. Cary was reduced to "desperate, old-school politics" and the barb from a Whitman press aide, David Marziale, on the eve of her opponent's statewide bus tour that Mr. Edwards "can travel by bus or helicopter but either way he has missed the boat with the voters of New Jersey."
That was a reference to charges that Mr. Edwards overused the state's official helicopter while he was Mr. Kean's chief counsel and Attorney General, at a cost to taxpayers of about $400,000.
Although fund-raising efforts are just beginning, all three camps are confident they will be able to raise and spend the maximum amounts allowed by the campaign spending law, $2.6 million in the primary and $5.9 million in the general election.
An imponderable is the potential impact of a Republican candidate for governor who is a woman. The high-profile winners in national contests last year, "the year of the woman," were all Democrats.
"I think this primary race will not be as heavily ideological as it has in the past," said Jay Severin, a New York-based Republican political consultant who has worked extensively in New Jersey, "and while I like Cary Edwards, I think Christie Whitman would be better able to capture more Republicans, independents and even Democrats than Cary would."

HEADLINE: Incremental Pay Increases Recommended for State's Judges

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16

 BODY:
A commission formed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has recommended that state judges at all levels receive incremental raises over the next two years to compensate for a salary freeze that has lasted for five years.
The commission suggested that the state spend $24 million from April 1993 through October 1994 to raise salaries for the 1,175 judges in the state system. That is less than the amount that was requested by the state's Office of Court Administration, which asked for $22 million just for the fiscal year that begins on April 1. 
 Under the schedule recommended Friday by the Temporary State Commission on Judicial Compensation, the salary for the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, the state's top court, would eventually rise to $129,000 from its current level of $120,000. Mr. Cuomo receives $130,000 as Governor.
Salaries for other judges on the Court of Appeals would rise to $125,000 from $115,000. Presiding Justices of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court would receive $122,000, up from $107,500.
 
Cuomo Noncommittal
 Associate Justices of the Appellate Division would receive $119,000, an increase from $102,500. And judges who sit on the Supreme Court and Court of Claims would see their salaries rise to $113,000 from $95,000.
Mr. Cuomo remained noncommittal today about raises for judges, saying he would study the commission's report. His press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said the Governor would submit the judiciary's budget request to the Legislature, as he is required to do by state law. Mr. Cuomo plans to propose his 1993-94 budget on Tuesday.
In late 1991 and early 1992, Mr. Cuomo waged a bitter fight with Sol Wachtler, who was then the state's Chief Judge, over court financing. Before it was over, Judge Wachtler had sued Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Cuomo had sued Judge Wachtler, and a Federal judge had chastised both men for what he called "an unseemly conflict."
The dispute was settled last January when Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature agreed to earmark $19 million for the courts so they could rehire employees who had been laid off.
The commission, which was led by James R. Jones, the chairman of the American Stock Exchange, concluded that the Consumer Price Index had risen by 23.7 percent since judges received their most recent salary increase.
 
Paid Less Than Professors
 It also found that judicial salaries are significantly lower than the salaries paid to associates in New York City law firms and to full professors at law schools.
Second-year associates at large New York City law firms earn $94,400, almost as much as the $95,000 received by Supreme Court judges, according to the commission's report. By the third year, the lawyers' salaries far surpass those of the judges.
But the commission found that New York still ranked among the top three states in judicial salaries, with New Jersey and California the other states at the top. New York ranked either second or third, depending on the level of judge being compared.
"The commission concluded that, despite the continued uncertainty of the state's economy, judicial salaries show a definite loss of purchasing power and may not serve to attract judicial candidates from a wide range of legal backgrounds," the report said.
Matthew T. Crosson, the state's Chief Administrator of the Courts, said in a statement that while he welcomed the conclusion that raises were deserved, the increases the commission recommended were inadequate and would give judges smaller raises than the state is giving its unionized workers.
"The amount of the increase recommended by the committee, and the timing of it, are disappointing and difficult to understand," Mr. Crosson said.

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.
She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece. 
 Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families.
 
Sought Real Neighborhoods
 The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.
Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.
She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.
Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."
She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.
She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.
The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.
After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.
When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.
There are no immediate survivors.

HEADLINE: Personal Touch Marks Large Gifts to Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Few people make a habit of writing personal checks for $20,000, but B. Mark Smith took the experience in stride. As a bond trader, he spends his days juggling million-dollar deals amid the kind of claustrophobic frenzy generated when dozens of Type A personalities gather in the same room to haggle over prices and yields.
But the check Mr. Smith sent to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund did carry some poignancy for him, for it reminded him of the shock he felt two years ago when he was unexpectedly laid off from his job. Though he was quickly hired by another firm, he said he would never forget that sense of humiliation. 
 "It certainly helps you sympathize a little more when it happens to you," Mr. Smith, 39 years old, said the other day from his office at Goldman, Sachs & Company in Manhattan. "I happen to be very lucky now. I've had a very good year. I feel an obligation to help people who are less fortunate."
The Neediest Cases Fund has received more than 10,000 donations so far in the current campaign, including hundreds for more than $1,000, from all types of people in all areas of the country.
 
Honoring Friends
 Janice A. Troia, a 39-year-old accountant in Manhattan, sent $2,000 in honor of friends who looked after her when she suffered a serious back injury that left her too weak to walk for more than a few minutes at a time.
"Barbara and Fred Kiesecker arranged for me to stay at the home of their parents, Fred and Florence, whom I've known, but hadn't seen for quite some time," Ms. Troia said. "They took care of me for eight weeks during the summer and nursed me back to health. I will always appreciate what they did for me."
Carol and Theodore Shen of Brooklyn sent $1,000 as a symbol of their love for New York City, which has been their home for 25 years. Mrs. Shen works in Brooklyn Heights as a literacy volunteer for the Hope program, which teaches job skills to homeless people. "We feel very committed to the city and Brooklyn in particular," Mrs. Shen said.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund supports seven charities that provide food, clothing, shelter and health care to tens of thousands of people. This year, the fund is facing a sharp drop in donations even as the recession has heaped added burdens on social-service agencies across the region.
The Times pays the expenses for the Neediest Cases appeal, so all donations go directly to the charities. This year's campaign continues until Feb. 28, so there is still time to give.

HEADLINE: Prodding the Pace of City Work

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
After years of debate over how to get more work from the city's labor force, Mayor David N. Dinkins seemed to have scored a major victory last February when city officials obtained what they described as a significant concession from the sanitation workers union.
Because New Yorkers had begun recycling, the daily load for many sanitation workers had been drastically reduced, allowing some to finish the work of their eight-hour shifts in as little as four hours. The city and the union agreed that within a month they would extend collection routes in a sample district. And within a year, they pledged, all the routes in the city would be redrawn. 
 But 11 months later, the two sides have yet to agree on even the sample routes, and the matter is bogged down in arbitration.
The city's failure to get a more complete workday was cited often last week, after Mayor Dinkins and labor leaders representing New York's 180,000 nonuniform workers reached tentative agreement on a new contract.
 
Change by Committee
 The pact calls for an increase of 8.25 percent in wages and benefits over 39 months, but failed to produce the promised productivity increases that Mr. Dinkins said would be required before he could agree to wage increases. Instead the agreement creates a three-member panel that is to decide six work-rule changes by June.
The Mayor and the union leaders contend that the new panel will ultimately bring big changes in the way municipal workers do their jobs, perhaps by altering things like the size of road repair crews or the caseloads assigned to social workers.
But many fiscal experts and Mr. Dinkins's political foes dismiss the panel as mere window dressing, saying that the inability to extend the garbage collection routes shows why New Yorkers should be skeptical of the latest settlement. They called the city contract a missed opportunity.
At the same time, some experts argue, the Mayor's inability to wrest significant concessions from the unions shows how difficult it can be to alter the work culture of municipal government, particularly in a place like New York, where municipal labor unions have enormous political clout and where managers are often hamstrung by a maze of Civil Service regulations and union work rules.
 
The Philadelphia Experience
 "Unions in New York have always been in a really distinctive position," said Richard P. Nathan, the director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, which is part of the State University of New York.
"There's hardly another city in the country that is as chock-full of services that are city-run. If you've got all the union members on your side and all their sisters and mothers and uncles, as Gilbert and Sullivan said, you've got a lot of people on your side."
In evaluating New York's approach to productivity, many critics and politicians find examples in other cities that have made more drastic changes in municipal employment. City Council President Andrew J. Stein, who plans to challenge Mr. Dinkins in the Democratic mayoral primary next September, points to Philadelphia, where Mayor Edward G. Rendell has won major concessions.
Philadelphia, which has flirted with bankruptcy and was blocked from the credit markets for more than a year, reached agreement on a contract with two large municipal unions last October that gave the city broad power to shift employees among different agencies, changed longstanding work rules and reduced the number of holidays and sick days.
 
Competition for Contracts
 The contract also allowed Philadelphia to revise workers' schedules, introduce new technology and use private companies to perform some functions traditionally reserved for union workers.
Other cities, particularly those in the West and Southwest, where unions are often less powerful and Civil Service less entrenched, have experimented with new ways of providing better services less expensively. In Phoenix, for example, officials divided the city into five sanitation districts and put several districts out for bid to private companies for trash pickup.
The Public Works Department in Phoenix, which had been totally responsible for garbage collection, competed -- at first unsuccessfully -- with the private companies. Over time, the city department tried various experiments, including having garbage-truck drivers redesign their routes and giving bonuses to employees for the best suggestions.
The department eventually won back the contracts and now services all of the city's districts. The competition produced extraordinary efficiencies, said David Osborne, a writer and government consultant who co-wrote "Reinventing Government" (Addison-Wesley, 1992). Phoenix's garbage collection costs have been going down 4.5 percent a year since the public-private system was created during the early 1980's, Mr. Osborne wrote.
 
Bonuses for Managers
 In Sunnyvale, Calif., a city of 120,000 people in the heart of Silicon Valley, the municipal government has been as creative as anywhere in the country. The city sets service objectives, and managers can earn bonuses of as much as 10 percent of their salaries by exceeding the goals.
Managers also have much greater flexibility in Sunnyvale, both because California's labor laws give them more discretion and because of the details of their labor contracts, said the city manager, Tom Lewcock. Sunnyvale revises its garbage collection routes routinely and has the right to do so as long the changes do not affect the safety or wages of city workers.
Sunnyvale has made its workers more productive in many other ways, Mr. Lewcock said. By automating its library, he said, the city was able to absorb a 50 percent increase in library use without hiring additional workers. And by shifting how its park maintenance crews were organized -- taking crews that had been stationed at individual parks and developing roving crews with specialized skills -- the city increased the park workers' productivity by about 30 percent, he said.
"Our political climate is different," he said. "The larger the organization is, the more politicized the organization is and the more tied to traditional ways of doing things."
 
In New York, a Litmus Test
 In New York, a severe recession has brought calls for governmental reorganization and criticism of Mr. Dinkins for failing to make the municipal work force more productive. Mr. Dinkins and his aides contend that they have made some changes, such as the consolidation of several economic development agencies and the creation of new community medical centers.
But the Mayor had also indicated for the last year that their hopes for significant change hinged largely on the labor talks.
"That is why there is so much disappointment around town," Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog group, said after the labor settlement last week. "I think the contract was the key element, the litmus test."
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former United States Attorney who ran against Mr. Dinkins in 1989 and expects to be his Republican challenger again in November, called the panel "a farce, a joke." He said, "The test is out there with the sanitation workers. What you get at the bargaining table is what you get."
But the Dinkins administration maintained that the productivity panel was a significant departure and would produce major changes in the way that city workers perform their jobs.
"This is a very powerful mechanism," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. "I believe there is a commitment to a process that will create fundamental change."

Chart: "ASK THE EXPERTS"/Improving Productivity: How to Manage New York City's Workers
 
 
 
Barry Feinstein,
President of the Teamsters Local 237

The first thing to do to make the city work force more productive is to train management in how to supervise and how to run business. The key to any ability to reduce the cost of government without harming the services is to have management understand what productivity is...
In order to accomplish any productivity program you need to have the support and cooperation of the work force. They have to believe they are being treated as equals....The city cannot dictate terms. We cannot reject terms. There has to be an understanding that we are partners...
It is not simply identifying what a program for productivity is going to be. It requires an understanding on both sides that this is a joint venture and that each side must be treated with respect. The only way these programs can work is if the work force believes their ideas, their methods, their procedures are going to be taken seriously in the implementation of a productivity program.
 
 
Raymond D. Horton
President, Citizens Budget Commission

You need quality managers who do not all come up through the ranks. That's to get at the closed system of promotion that still dominates many agencies. You've got to be able to innovate, which includes the introduction of new technology. We're still using 19th Century firetrucks to go to every fire. You need a workforce that's small, well paid and willing to work hard and long hours.
You need mayors who are tough enough to demand these changes even if it threatens political retribution from municipal union leaders. You need union leaders who are willing to have smaller work forces and thus fewer members from whom to collect dues. I think this is a dynamic that people miss. I think there has been a conscious decision, seldom articulated, that most union leaders would rather have a lot of members than fewer members who are better paid.
And ultimately, you need a citizenry that makes it clear in no uncertain terms to the mayor that it is tired of being shafted by the bureaucracy in the form of higher taxes and reduced services."
 
 
David Osborne
Writer and consultant
 There a number of fundamental things that seem to work in other places. One is you've got to measure productivity, so you know when organizations are getting more productivity. Second, you've got to link strong incentives to productivity improvement, preferably financial incentives for managers and employees, and it works for both. The state of Florida gave line workers in a couple of departments productivity bonuses, and in some units people had immediate increases of 30 or 40 percent.
The third thing you need to do is give your workers more authority. Listen to them, use their ideas, empower them to change the way work is done, because they are the people who know how to increase productivity. And then as you are doing those things, New York needs to radically reform its civil service system, so that the rules that govern how much you can pay, and who you can promote, and who you can fire and who you can hire. New York is still operating with a 19th century-style civil service system.
 
 
Charles Millard
Republican Councilman of Manhattan

In the 1980's, 50,000 people were added to the city work force. New York City has over 570 emoployees for every 10,000 residents while Boston has 350 and Philadelphia has 200. Yet amid all the talk of downsizing and restructuring, last year the Mayor and the City Council adopted a budget that added hundreds of people to the city payroll. This has to stop. In this year's budget, the Council should impose a cap on the size of the work force at 10 percent below its present size.
The Mayor should not have settled contract negotiations with the city's municipal unions without having obtained productivity increases. I have long advocated incentive pay as one such measure. A reduction in the size of the work force, while it would not carry with it incentive pay, would force greater productivity and less waste. This would not be micromanaging by the Council but setting broad parameters within which the Mayor and the work force would have to find ways to function more efficiently.

HEADLINE: Housing Projects Aim To Retain Workers

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY, N.Y.

 BODY:
A lack of affordable housing has begun affecting even the affluent in Westchester County, as many of the workers who provide necessary public services are forced to leave the area for communities where real estate is still within the reach of working families.
Town workers say they are no longer available for midnight calls; they have moved north, to Putnam and Dutchess Counties. Volunteer fire and ambulance officials say their response time suffers because members cannot afford to live nearby. And teachers facing long commutes are curtailing after-school activities. 
 Faced with the growing inconvenience of a distant work force -- and the prospect of higher taxes if they are forced to replace volunteers with paid emergency workers -- officials in many communities in New York and Connecticut are considering building housing for their workers.
 
Volunteers Are Commuting
 At the heart of the problem is demographic change driven by real-estate prices. Increasingly, third- and fourth-generation volunteers from blue-collar families are commuting to jobs in the commuter towns where they grew up. And newcomers who can afford to buy homes in the area generally do not volunteer, according to officials in several Westchester communities.
In the 80's, said Margaret Slavin, the Village Administrator for Dobbs Ferry, "we built all of these office buildings in Westchester and never thought about where people were going to live, or made any provisions for affordable housing. But your labor force has to live someplace."
In the mid-80's, nearly a third of the members of the Dobbs Ferry volunteer fire force moved out of town when it came time to leave their parents' homes. They simply could not afford to buy property there. This fall firefighters got the first chance to buy 32 modestly priced town houses built in a public-private partnership on land donated to a local fire company in the 1950's.
"We definitely would have had to move somewhere else," said Patrick Lindsay, a 24-year-old volunteer firefighter in nearby Ardsley who set the date of his November wedding to Nancy Cullen, a Dobbs Ferry firefighter, to coincide roughly with the opening of the complex.
 
Exploring Similar Projects
 Before the new residents moved in, officials from more than two dozen neighboring towns toured the units and began exploring similar projects, said Philip M. Adler, the managing director of the company that built the Dobbs Ferry town houses. The company, North American Equities in Port Chester, is now working with other towns in Westchester and Rockland Counties and in Connecticut.
But it is clear that the need far outstrips the number of moderately priced homes that towns can build. In Dobbs Ferry, there were 889 applicants who hoped to buy one of the two- or three-bedroom homes for $87,680 or $92,000 in an area where houses typically sell for more than $300,000. Firefighters were given priority, with city workers next in line, followed by other town residents -- all of whom had to meet a variety of income requirements to qualify.
Besides debating the economics of building housing, towns must balance competing needs such as concerns about the environment and preserving open space, particularly in Westchester County, which is "land poor," Ms. Slavin said.
 
Living With Parents
 Meanwhile, town workers hang on where they are, often living with their parents well into their 30's, and hope that the proposed projects come through before they are forced to follow their contemporaries to more affordable areas.
"Unless they're going to live with Mom and Dad until they inherit the house, they've got to leave town," said Steven Wright, chief of the volunteer fire department in the hamlet of Millwood.
Dennis Montaruli, 25, a motor equipment operator for Irvington's Public Works Department and a volunteer ambulance driver, dropped by the village administrator's office last week for an update on proposed construction in his hometown, where a longtime resident recently donated property and commissioned a feasibility study.
Mr. Montaruli said he had to move just up the river to Tarrytown to find affordable housing after he married a year ago. He volunteers only during working hours, and worries about the 20-minute delay when he is called in at night to clear the roads during snowstorms. He and his wife are expecting their first child in June, he said, and he is now working three jobs, also doing auto detailing and driving for a limousine service two nights a week, to avoid having to move even further away.
 
'It's Just Sickening'
 John Caoili, a 31-year-old New Castle police officer, and his wife, who is a nurse, have a combined annual income of about $100,000, he said, but still cannot afford to live anywhere near his work. "It's just sickening," said Mr. Caoili, who is the son of a Rockland County physician and recently bought a house an hour away in Beekman, in Dutchess County. "You have to find a house in Putnam or Dutchess if you want to live like a human being."
Last spring, the Westchester County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke, responded with an affordable housing program that offers municipalities infrastructure grants -- for roads, sewers and sidewalks -- as well as grants for site improvements and no-interest loans for construction.
About 130 affordable units built in Westchester over the last 18 months in Bedford, Croton, Yonkers and Dobbs Ferry have given priority to the emergency and town workers they count on for essential services, as well as to the elderly, who often cannot afford to stay in their hometowns beyond retirement, said Lynn Oliva, the Westchester County Planning Commissioner.
 
More Projects Scheduled
 "A lot is happening," she said. "In the last two years people have been talking about it, but in the last year it's a real crescendo, with more communities worried about their volunteer companies."
Another 117 affordable units are in the pipeline in New Rochelle, Mamaroneck, Croton and Harrison. Among the towns discussing similar projects are Irvington, Greenburgh and Rye.
"We want to bring emergency-type workers closer, and back into Rye," said Fred E. Zepf, the City Planner for Rye. "An awful lot of them do have to commute because of the prices."
Even under ideal circumstances, building housing can take a long time: In Dobbs Ferry, where the land had already been donated, the project took more than four years from conception to completion. In several Westchester communities, including West Harrison and New Castle, the projects face considerable local opposition.
"There's a lot less resistance outside this area," Mr. Adler said. "People are afraid it will decrease their property values."

Mark Leggierro, with his month-old son, Michael, is a volunteer firefighter who again lives locally after buying one of the houses. (Alan Zale for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: NOTEBOOK;
Some Baseball Salaries Really Do Decline

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Then there is the other side of the dollar.
Not every player, free agent or otherwise, who has signed a contract this winter has received Barry Bonds's $43.75 million or Cecil Fielder's $36 million or Fielder's $10 million signing bonus or David Cone's $9 million signing bonus or Ken Griffey's $24 million at the age of 23. 
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, projects that 13 percent of the players will earn 50 percent of the total major league payroll this year. Many of the remaining 87 percent are those on the other side of the dollar. They have become the chorus to the Pavarottis and Domingos of the baseball stage.
The homeless, the unemployed and the minimum-wage earners will not feel sorry for these players, but some have suffered economic shock as a result of this relatively recent development that has reached a new level this winter.
The Houston Astros, for example, earlier this month signed Kevin Bass and Jose Uribe as free agents. Three years ago, Bass signed a three-year contract with the Giants for $5.25 million, and Uribe a three-year deal with the same team for $3.85 million. Negotiating with the Astros, Bass accepted $500,000 for this year, and Uribe $400,000.
 
Fighting for a Job
 They at least signed major league contracts. Tim Burke, after completing a three-year, $6.3 million contract, signed a minor league contract with Cincinnati. That means he has to win a job with the Reds to get his $500,000 major league salary.
Dave Smith of the Chicago Cubs, like Burke a veteran relief pitcher, is in a similar position. He earned $4.95 million from his contract the last two years, but he signed a minor league contract with the Cubs and has to make the team to get a $250,000 major league salary.
Lance Parrish, long one of the best catchers in the majors, came off a three-year contract that brought him $6,825,000 and signed a minor league contract with Los Angeles that guarantees him nothing and will pay him $600,000 if he wins a spot on the Dodgers' roster.
The Mets signed Joe Orsulak for half of the $1.3 million he earned last year. Mark Eichhorn re-signed with Toronto for $700,000, not even half of the $1,805,000 he earned last year. Juan Samuel will have a $700,000 salary if he gains a spot on the Reds' roster, but that's less than a third of his 1992 salary of $2,325,000.
Tom Reich, the veteran agent who negotiated some of these contracts, calls these players the "haircuts."
"You have to take a haircut to get employment," Reich said, lamenting, not making fun of, the situation. "A player has two alternatives when he gets to that position: retirement or haircut. I view it as the hardest, most important job we have: to protect the jobs of guys who are vulnerable, to keep them alive in the system."
The clubs, of course, show no sympathy for the many players in the job-seeking position. Most of the 153 players who filed for free agency last November have been in that position and have been joined by the 39 players who were not tendered contracts last month and others who became free agents when they were released last October.
After signing their stars or putting aside the millions they know they will have to pay arbitration-eligible players, the clubs check their budgets and see how much they have left to sign the relief pitcher they need to fill out their bullpen or the veteran who will be their backup catcher or platooned third baseman or fourth outfielder.
It is those players the clubs will pay as little as possible. It doesn't matter that the average salary will be over $1 million; only by giving these "haircuts" well under that level can they prevent the average from soaring well beyond $1 million.
"It's a matter of trying to fit guys in with what you can afford," said Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager. "You know the prime guys at the top are going to get the big money. Now we're seeing what's happening at the other end of the spectrum. We're trying to get the message across that everyone can't jump in at the $4-$5 million range. A ball club can't afford too many of those guys."
 
'A Supply-and-Demand-Game'
 The players plummeting to the lower end of the scale, Reich emphasized, are not finished as players.
"Unfortunately, the salary system makes them vulnerable, but vulnerable means they're not in demand," Reich said. "It's a supply-and-demand game. If they're not in demand, it doesn't mean they can't play. If they're not in demand, you have to do everything you can to get them a job and keep them in the system. Some of them will recover."
Some players in that classification don't deserve to be there, the agent added, "but that doesn't matter."
"Nobody said the system is fair," he added.
The owners want to change the salary system in negotiations that have begun with the players. The clubs desperately prefer a salary cap, but meanwhile, they have adopted the strategy now in full force.
Wood said the Astros are a classic example of what is happening.
"Last year, we were at a budget of about $14 million," he said, discussing the club's payroll. "Obviously, we made a big jump into the free-agent market with Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell, so that ate up a chunk of dough right there."
Adding up other salaries and projected salaries, Wood said he came up with a possible payroll of $31 million.
 
A New Class System
 The opposite directions salaries are taking have created a class system the sort of which baseball has never seen. "We were pleased that we could get guys jobs, but not pleased with what's happened to the system," Reich said. "The category of the have-nots has increased exponentially. The spread between haves and have-nots is growing."
Are the newest members of the have-nots shocked?
"I'm sure some guys were disappointed that there was no demand for them and therefore no money for them," Reich said. "These guys aren't running around thrilled, but they're employed."
 
Finding a Home
 Twenty-eight active players have played in the major leagues for 15 years or more. Only five have played their entire careers with the same team. They are as follows:
George Brett, Kansas City -- 19 years, 21 days.
Robin Yount, Milwaukee -- 19 years.
Jim Gantner, Milwaukee -- 15 years, 58 days.
Lou Whitaker, Detroit -- 15 years, 26 days.
Alan Trammell, Detroit -- 15 years, 26 days.
Gantner is a free agent and his future, whether with Milwaukee or someone else, remains uncertain. Paul Molitor played his first 15 seasons with the Brewers but has joined the Blue Jays as a free agent.
Nolan Ryan has the most major league service among active players, 25 years, 101 days (172 days constitute a season), and he has spent that with four teams. Of the 28 players with 15 years or more, Rich Gossage and John Candelaria have played for the most teams, eight each.
 
Better Advice Needed
 If Jesse Jackson wants to induce the owners to hire more black and Hispanic people for nonplaying positions, he would better serve the cause by acquiring greater knowledge about his subject than he has shown.
In speaking to owners and reporters in separate sessions last Tuesday, Jackson made issues out of two matters he knew were nonissues: Bill White's position as a candidate for commissioner -- White has never wanted the job -- and the Players Association's stand on Marge Schott -- it has called for a disciplining of Schott. But Jackson also displayed a poor grasp of some of the facts and subtleties on other issues he addressed.
Jackson mentioned Hank Aaron as a candidate for the role of commissioner. Does Jackson know that in Aaron's 13-year tenure as the Atlanta Braves' director of player development, he hired only two blacks for minor league jobs?
Jackson said the American League had no black umpires last season. He missed Chuck Meriwether.
Jackson listed a series of eight former black stars and asked how they could not have a place in baseball. Of those, Bob Gibson was a major league pitching coach for four years in the early 1980's; Joe Morgan was offered jobs as manager and general manager and declined them; the Reds have hired Ferguson Jenkins to work in their minor league system; Willie Mays seldom performed his duties when he worked for the Mets, often not even showing up, and Reggie Jackson wants a job of his own creation: consulting. Both Jackson and baseball might benefit from having him in a more important role.
Although Jesse Jackson is trying to call attention to a serious issue that demands attention in baseball as well as other sports, he would very likely be more effective if his advisers included people more knowledgeable about the baseball world.

HEADLINE: Some Gift Greenspan's Given Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Regarding "Greenspan's Gift to the Nation: No Bank Crisis" (Market Watch, Dec. 20), Alan Greenspan, like Paul Volker before him, is a banker's man -- not the "whatever is good for the overall economy fellow." And, of course, there is a whole difference. While banks pay 2.7 percent interest (plus or minus) to depositors, they charge 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent interest and more for secured loans and 23 percent and more (including interest, annual "membership" fee, dealer's charges and "late charges") on credit cards. 
 Is there any business in the world that would not make obscene profits if its cost of goods was $2.70 and sales price $23?
Mr. Greenspan's gift is that the country's businesses, especially small ones, are so weak, and unable to get bank loans, that economic recovery has been put on hold. Consumers are so strapped with high interest costs that they cannot afford to spend in order to get the economy going.
What Mr. Greenspan needs to do, and he can if he wants to, is close down 50 percent of the banks, retain the best personnel available and tell them to make loans available in the areas where they would do the most good for the overall economy. Drop interest rates on credit cards to the prime rate plus four points and cancel all cards issued to deadbeats.
The alternative is that we will have only one booming industry in the country: banking! And it is not even a component of gross domestic product. What a bummer!

HEADLINE: Not a Convenience, but a Need

 BODY:
"$68.50! That drives me crazy!" Henrietta, Dorothy, Yvette, Pearl, Gertrude and Sylvia are all on the line, peppering a government administrator with questions about New York State's prescription drug program for the elderly.
For the ladies patched into this conference call, getting the ear of a bureaucrat on the telephone is more than a convenience. This educational party line, sustained by donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, is a lifeline for impoverished, infirm seniors who might otherwise never receive the help they need. 
 Their advanced age makes it hard for these women to trek to government offices to obtain services specifically designed to help them. And many seniors are legally blind; they cannot read a mailed brochure or cope with the bureaucratic runaround of being told to dial several different numbers just to get one query answered.
Without the conference calls, operated under the auspices of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the problems that afflict these proud but isolated women would multiply dangerously. Declining interest rates on savings and pensions, the soaring cost of living in New York City and cutbacks in local services add heavily to their burdens.
The Neediest Cases Fund, now in its 81st appeal, addresses the special plight of the aged. Through a variety of nonsectarian programs providing transportation, home visits, telephone links and other vital services, the fund helps needy seniors maintain their health and a higher quality of life, so that the universally difficult process of growing old is not a daily agony of pain, poverty and isolation.
"'You're a very nice person," one of the women said into the phone. The conference call participants are quick to praise the administrator who has patiently answered their questions and promised assistance. But without private help, the link would never have been established.
The sole purpose of the Neediest Cases Fund is to find and assist the overlooked and the helpless, to care for this city's most vulnerable citizens.
The fund passes every dollar to the neediest through seven private social service agencies. No money is kept back for administration or solicitation.
Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Any amount is welcome. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: When the Arms Dealer Turns Policeman

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Peace on Earth, by Posse" (editorial, Dec. 28), goes some way toward touching on the moral points to be considered when contemplating military intervention.
But moral posturing is to no avail if the root causes of armed conflicts are not addressed. And we must start with our own house: the United States needs a foreign policy that acknowledges our role as the world's major arms supplier. 
 There is no lack of case histories to prove we use weaponry as policy. We armed Iraq in a futile attempt to buy a military dictator's allegiance and went in, guns blazing, to rescue Kuwait. Nonmilitary aid often comes in a poor second.
In El Salvador, it remains to be seen whether or not the United States, having spent $6 billion in military aid over more than a decade, will spend even a fraction of that to support the country's rebuilding after a United Nations-negotiated peace.
Further, the Bush Administration proposed supporting the defense industry through a program of providing "allies" with commercial loans to buy our weapons. Yet such economic growth comes at a high cost. Case in point: Somalia, where the teen-age looters carry both Russian and American arms, supplied in the conduct of foreign policy by superpowers that couldn't think of any moral arguments not to arm the world.
This country must deal with its sinister double before it can debate the moral high ground. A "standby force ready to move quickly," even led by the United Nations, only makes sense if it is not undermined by economic or policy considerations, ostensibly in our own best interests, that supply the arms for future conflicts.
The United States can claim, as you suggest, to be the strongest force for leadership in a world faced with such rescue missions as in Somalia. It is also true we are reaping the fruits of our role as world arms dealer.
Foreign policy must not become force policy, an identity that this country has too easily worn while in the meantime the moral debate carries on.

HEADLINE: Off-Campus Lessons for College Volunteers

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER

 BODY:
MAUREEN SULLIVAN'S volunteer work with Hispanic children in New Haven has taught her lessons about life that she never would have learned in the classroom.
Her friendship with the children began at Quinnipiac College in Hamden, where Ms. Sullivan and other students held a Halloween party for about 50 children from Latino Youth Development, an organization that provides education and recreation for children from poor families. After seeing how much attention the youngsters needed, Ms. Sullivan, a junior who is majoring in psychology, decided she could not simply say goodbye when the party ended. 
 She and a few friends started taking time out from their studies to visit with the children every Friday. And they plan to set up an after-school tutoring program for the 8- to 12-year-olds.
The experience opened Ms. Sullivan's eyes. "I realized I didn't need as many material things as I thought I did," she said. "In spite of everything that happens to these kids, they can laugh."
Ms. Sullivan is like many other college students who are finding that service to others is becoming an important part of their adult lives. In some cases their volunteer work has led them to change their career plans in favor of a job that pays less but is more satisfying emotionally.
 
Service and Civics
 "Financial gain and individual development were important in the 80's but now I see people discussing a meaningful life, which includes service and civic responsibility," said the director of the volunteer office at Connecticut College in New London, Tracee Reiser. This year 450 students are expected to volunteer in projects such as tutoring schoolchildren and teaching prison inmates to read, Ms. Reiser said.
Forty-four colleges and universities in the state were among at least 175 schools across the nation that were recently awarded Federal grants to support community-service projects on campus. The grants, totaling $5.2 million, will enable the schools to make community service part of their course work, establish service projects on campus and train teachers and volunteers.
In Connecticut, Quinnipiac and other colleges and universities belong to regional networks, organized by the State Department of Higher Education, that received $491,671 in grants last year from the Federal Commission on National and Community Service. The networks enable the schools to share training, information and technical assistance.
Some schools are building on existing programs while others are creating new ones. Campus volunteer offices serve as clearinghouses where students are matched with positions in community agencies. Connecticut College's $11,200 grant will help the volunteer office expand so that more students can participate. It will also pay for a promotional video and enable the office to explore ways of including community service in students' course work.
 
Money Well Spent
 Even during an economic recession, when many school systems are hard pressed to pay for textbooks, college students say that financing for volunteer projects is money well spent.
When students working in urban projects encounter homelessness and hunger, often for the first time in their lives, volunteering becomes a stimulus for change, Ms. Reiser said. Students working in a soup kitchen not only help others but also have a chance to think about why people are hungry in a wealthy country.
Young people have seen families "in more difficulty and society with more problems," Ms. Reiser continued. "They hear more and more that things really need to change."
Students are carrying heavy course loads, holding part-time jobs and working in other campus activities, but they still find time to build relationships with people outside their world who need help.
 
Danger of Dropping Out
 Bronwen Weiss, a sophomore at Connecticut College, is a volunteer in the school's mentor program, which matches students with children from New London who are in danger of dropping out of school, or are using drugs or are pregnant.
Ms. Weiss, a theater major from New York City, spends five hours a week as a big sister to a girl who is in the fifth grade. The two spend time on campus roller blading, visiting the science center and the art museum, playing cards and working on math problems together in the library.
"Spending time with her opens me up to new experiences," Ms. Weiss said. "I can't even compare what I'm giving her with what she's giving me. She's teaching me how to be stronger in dealing with the problems in my life."
Volunteering also offers students a chance to learn job skills. Jose Hernandez, a communications major at Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, is creating a record of special events at Natchaug Elementary School by videotaping assemblies and classroom activities.
Mr. Hernandez, married and the father of two daughters, said he decided to go back to school when he realized his job as a security officer wasn't getting him ahead. And although the video work does not earn college credits, it ties in with his career plans and brings him satisfaction. "I'm recognized by the students," Mr. Hernandez said. "Just being there and accomplishing something makes me feel good."
Three years ago, Eastern Connecticut State University started requiring all resident students to perform four hours of community service each semester. The university is using its $5,000 grant for the next step -- making community service part of the curriculum. The director of career and experiential education, Pat Martin, said the money would also go toward efforts to draw adult and commuting students into volunteering and to expand the school's projects beyond the Willimantic area into New London and Hartford counties.
 
Rigorous Courses, Part-Time Jobs
 David Francis, a senior psychology major at the university, plans to earn a master's degree in social work. He credits his mother for instilling in him a desire to help others. He has gone far beyond the school's four-hour requirement by raising money for the American Cancer Society and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, cleaning up the grounds of a camp in South Windham for disabled children and adults and collecting donations of food for local soup kitchens.
At the University of Connecticut, a $6,500 grant will go toward a new course in community service for graduate students in public affairs. The course will be designed to reward students who continue to volunteer while taking rigorous courses and holding jobs. Its purpose is to open doors to nonprofit and community-service employment, said Richard Kearney, a professor of political science and director of the graduate program in public affairs.
And at Naugatuck Valley Community-Technical College in Waterbury, a $3,000 grant will help set up a program linking community service to the classroom. The director of student activities and volunteer service learning, Robert J. Butler, said that the average age of Naugatuck Valley students, all of whom commute, was close to 30. For these people, most of whom work at least part time, the incentive to enroll may be a transcript of volunteer work to present to prospective employers, Mr. Butler said.
 
Confronting Faculty Resistance
 Colleges must not only sell the value of volunteering to students whose time is at a premium, but they also face the task of breaking down resistance from the faculty. Ms. Reiser said she thought that "some professors feel strongly that academic work is in a classroom and focuses on theory, concepts and critical thinking." Such attitudes can be changed, she added, by pointing out the value of volunteering in discussions and with model courses.
Students say the experience is one in which everyone gains. They tell stories about the child living in a housing project who learns from a volunteer that college is not beyond her reach. And a college student studying for a career in advertising who starts thinking about teaching in an urban school. Bonds are formed between people of widely different cultures.
Jose Berrios Jr., a coordinator with Latino Youth Development in New Haven, said the students working in his program are more involved with the children than past volunteers. "They get attached," he said, "and form little, close families."

HEADLINE: ART;
Where the Faces, Not Artifacts, Are the Center of Attention

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
CHIEF JOSEPH; Sitting Bull and his sons, Crowfoot and John; Rain-in-the-Face, and Young Man-Afraid-of-His-Horses: legendary American Indians are hanging in the Gallery of Contemporary Art, at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, photographed as if they were big game trophies. And the simile is not far-fetched, for at the time the pictures were taken, the pacification of the tribes was all but complete.
No dates are given for the photographer, David Francis Barry, but he was the last to photograph George Armstrong Custer before his Last Stand, remained active in the Dakota Territory during the 1880's and was in New York City as late as 1926. His subject there was Sitting Bull's son John Sitting Bull, a deaf mute who had joined the Sells-Floto Circus. 
 Barry himself had begun as an apprentice to O. S. Goff, a collodion wet-plate specialist who toured the frontier recording the remnants of the Seventh Cavalry and the "hostiles," who had defeated them at Little Big Horn.
But it was Barry who documented the 10th anniversary of the fiasco, and the Denver Public Library purchased his collection in 1934. This included about a thousand negatives, many of them made by other photographers, including Goff, together with correspondence and mementos pertaining to the Sioux.
Visitors may purchase (for a stiff $7) a small brochure explaining the origins of the collection and documenting the efforts of the library to preserve it while making available limited editions of prints. This will continue until the year 2009, when the negatives will be retired.
The brochure notes that one of the portfolios comes with an essay by Alvin Josephy Jr., a Greenwich resident who has been editor in chief at American Heritage Magazine and Publishing Company, as well as a consultant to the Secretary of the Interior. Mr. Josephy has also written numerous books and articles about Indians and the West and is the board chairman at the Museum of the American Indian in Manhattan.
For a people who had the economic and social rug pulled from under them, posing for ethnographic photographs was a way of making a living, as was participating in circuses. Yet the pose is with such dignity, and sometimes hauteur, that the effect is of wild animals trapped but not broken.
Sitting Bull's adopted brother, Gall, was so displeased with Barry's picture of him in war paint, posed with a bow, that he pulled a knife on the photographer.
In another study, also by Barry, Gall wears an undershirt with the collar adjusted to reveal his well muscled neck and a chest that is almost feminine. Considering that he was one of the few Indians who rated a bounty, and that he had sustained multiple bayonet wounds, this warrior with flowing hair looks remarkably Byronic.
Sitting Bull, his face seemingly tattooed with wrinkles, appears frequently, wearing one or two eagle feathers or, as in the joint portrait with Buffalo Bill Cody, a war bonnet that trails the floor. The pair stand on a grass mat against a backdrop painted with a Corot-like landscape, Cody sporting a pair of thigh-high boots and pointing out of the picture, and the Indian, who stands half a head shorter, looking down at the ground. Opinion is divided as to whether the picture was taken by the Canadian photographer William Notman or his son, David.
Presumably, the clothes worn by the Indians are studio props. As portrayed by Barry, Sitting Bull and Rain-in-the-Face wear the same bonnet trimmed with antelope horns; the "noble savages" also pose in the same wildly inappropriate Italianate decor. Of special interest, though, is the cane held by Rain-in-the-Face, which could have been carved by a black folk artist.
But it is the faces rather than the artifacts that rivet the attention, many of them dominated by noses like ships' prows and mouths that evoke pre-Columbian statuary, especially that of the Olmec. When journeying up the Missouri River half a century earlier, Karl Bodmer documented very similar visages in his watercolors and, while his burial scaffold is the work of the Assinboin and Barry's two burial trees are Sioux, the images pack the same punch.
Men are the subject in every case, except a group portrait of Christianized Sioux women, which is as depressing a spectacle as that of the cattle lying dead inside a paddock. The idea here was to corral the animals where they could be shot from horseback, as if in a buffalo hunt -- a kind of dude ranch for the dispossessed.
Also on view are prints by two contemporary Indians, Larry McNeil and Pena Bonita.
Mr. McNeil works in black and white, focusing on Kootznoowoo Elders in hats resembling those worn in Asian rice paddies, except that they are made of wood and carved with designs evoking the totem poles of the Northwest.
Ms. Bonita effectively renounces her background in favor of up-to-date self-expression, adding gold leaf, paint and sand to color prints of movie-style Indian children and adults. There are times when the conscious effort to preserve ethnic character seems as ill-advised as the restoration of land that has been strip-mined.
The show is more impressive and far more poignant than one would suppose from its title, "A Century in the Making: The Mending of the Hoop." But interested parties must make haste, because it closes on Thursday. Gallery hours are noon to 7:30 P.M., Tuesday through Thursday.

When the Bronx Arts Ensemble started its "Glasnost in the Bronx" concerts two years ago, featuring Russian and American chamber music in collaboration with the Leningrad Chamber Orchestra, it did not anticipate the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
 "We need a new name," said Louise Scribner, a musician and publicist for the group. "We may have to resort to a series -- 'Russia in the Bronx,' 'Azerbaijan in the Bronx,' 'Ukraine in the Bronx' and 'Belarus in the Bronx.' "
Two or three of these concerts are given each year, with the next one scheduled for next Sunday at 2 P.M. at the Russian Mission to the United Nations Residence in Riverdale, where all the performances have taken place. The featured guest artist will be Masanobu Ikemiya, a Manchurian-born Japanese pianist and harpsichordist with music degrees from the Oberlin Conservatory and Indiana University. The pianist, an accomplished ragtime performer, will include "Russian Rag" in his program. The rag, written by George Cobb, is a takeoff on a Rachmaninoff Prelude. The program will also include works by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev and Amy Beach.
In 1980 Mr. Ikemiya founded the Arcady Music Festival in Bar Harbor, Me., and recorded ragtime classics for a compact disk released in 1992 by Jazz Mania. His influence in strengthening musical ties between Russia and the United States was recognized with an award from the Philharmonic Society of Krugan, Siberia, and a United Nations citation.
The residence is at Mosholu Avenue and West 255th Street. Tickets are $20, $15 for students and people 65 and older. They can be obtained by calling (718) 601-7399.
 
NEW 'ANCIENT' POTTERY
 Jeff Shapiro's indoor and outdoor sculptures look as though they were made centuries ago and suffered some grievous abuse in the interim. Their charm, however, stems from their altered states. In fact, one of the pieces is called "Altered Water Vessel," but it is reminiscent of objects that might be found in ancient Oriental temples.
Another piece is titled "Torn Lip Bowl," an apt description of its rough, misshapen rim. The pieces are 9 and 12 inches high and are priced at $800 and $1,500, respectively.
The pottery, on view at the Gallery at the Courtyard in Katonah through next Sunday, was created with old Japanese techniques, learned during 12 years of study in Kyoto, Bizen, Fukuoka, Ehime and Hamasaka.
Mr. Shapiro has shown at the Japan Society, the American Craft Museum and the Azuma Gallery in Manhattan, the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse and the Koko Gallery in Tokyo, among others, and this is his second annual show at the Katonah gallery.
Using a 1,000-year-old process, he does not glaze his pottery but fires it in an Anagama kiln that is 30 feet long and requires 6 cords of wood to reach a temperature of 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit. The firing takes eight days and produces a surface that appears to have been tempered by a volcano.
Two outdoor lanterns, made of stone and clay and weighing about 600 pounds each, are 3 feet high and 3 feet wide. They may be lighted with candles or electrified, and they are for sale at $1,500 and $3,000. One of them has a lid that is a natural piece of stone upon which moss continues to grow.
The gallery, at 223 Katonah Avenue, is open Mondays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., Sundays from noon to 6 P.M. The number to call for more information is 232-9511.
 
FORUM ON PLANNING
 Environmental and land-use concerns will be addressed by various Westchester political figures in a forum titled "The Importance of Regional Planning to Westchester," scheduled from 8 to 10 P.M. Thursday at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.
Organized by the college in partnership with the city of Yonkers and the Westchester Land Trust, the forum hopes to achieve better collaboration among county agencies and officials in correcting the piecemeal approach to land use, which, officials say, has left the county without an overall concept for protecting its environment through comprehensive land-use planning.
The speakers will be Assemblyman Richard Brodsky; County Legislator Katherine Carksy; Alfred B. DelBello, former County Executive and currently special consultant on economic growth to Westchester County; Herman Keith, minority leader of the County Board of Legislators; Stephen P. Tenore, chairman of the Board of Legislators, and David Holmes, Commissioner of Planning and Development for Yonkers.
The forum will take place in Reisinger Auditorium, and admission is free. For more information or registration, the number to call is 395-2412.
 
REFINISHING WORKSHOPS
 Waclaw Godziemba-Maliszewski, a master cabinetmaker and owners of London Joiners, a furniture restoration shop on Route 124 in Pound Ridge, will conduct four hourlong workshops on refinishing wood furniture on Saturday at 10 and 11 A.M. and 1:30 and 2:30 P.M.
Not for the faint of heart or biceps, the methods Mr. Godziemba-Maliszewski espouses are classical and time-consuming, trying one's patience but producing spectacular results when properly followed.
Wax polishing, for example, began with the Egyptians thousands of years ago. They used reeds filled with beeswax and rubbed them over surfaces until the wood gleamed.
French polishing, which dates from the late 1700's and traveled to England and America half a century later, takes refined lac flakes -- a resinous substance extracted from the East Indian lac insect -- and suspends them in mentholated spirits, producing a blend of binder solvent that dries instantly and may be layered time after time up to hundreds of layers. Similar to earlier Oriental techniques, it is the derivative of the word lacquer.
The Italians also used lac, but combined it with mineral oil, creating a barrier against destructive oxygen.
Mr. Godziemba-Maliszewski was born in Scotland and studied cabinetry with traditionalists in Florence and Paris. He is an expert at marquetry, frisage (the joining of parquet floors), stone-inlaid wood (pietra dura), jeux de fond (geometric inlay), chinoiserie and gold leaf. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has hired him to restore pieces in its antique furniture collections.
He says he has found that many women pursue restoration as a career, attracted to its artistic elements and the patience required to apply its exacting techniques. Admission to the workshops, sponsored by the Pound Ridge Historical Society, is $5. For reservations, the number to call is 764-4538.
 
JOHANNESEN TO PLAY
 Grant Johannesen will be the piano soloist with the Greenwich Symphony Orchestra on Saturday at 8 P.M. and next Sunday at 4 P.M. The concerts will be held at the Greenwich High School Auditorium on Hillside Road off Route 1.
Mr. Johannesen will perform Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 -- the "Emperor" -- and the orchestra will give the premiere performance of a work composed by its conductor, David Gilbert, titled "The Shadowy Waters," based on William Butler Yeats's rhapsodic play about a man and a woman seeking ideal love. Tickets are $18, $9 for students; reservations may be made by calling (203) 869-2664.
Each year at this time gifted instrumental music students in Fairfield County, Port Chester and Rye can apply for the Dorothy Gluckmann Music Award of $1,000 offered by the Greenwich Symphony Orchestra Guild. Applicants are required to submit a 20-minute cassette tape recording of their playing along with a completed application form. The forms are available through the music departments of all secondary schools or by calling (203) 637-1680 or (203) 869-2664.
Those who qualify to compete in auditions will be notified by March 10. The auditions will take place in April in Greenwich, and the winner will be honored at the season's final concert on April 25 at Greenwich High School. He or she will also be invited to perform a 35-minute recital at the guild's June 3 lunch.

HEADLINE: For Weapons Makers, a Time to Deal

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Last spring, the Air Force warned the three major contractors for the F-22 jet fighter -- General Dynamics, Lockheed and Boeing -- that if costs continued to escalate, the program could be drastically scaled back or even canceled as part of the Pentagon's deep budget cuts.
Predicting that there wasn't room for three F-22 contractors in a shrinking weapons market, General Dynamics offered to buy Lockheed's majority share of the program. But Lockheed refused to sell, saying that the F-22 was crucial to its aeronautics business. 
 Then Lockheed, also leery of the industry's overcapacity, made a counteroffer for General Dynamics's stake. Last month, the two struck a deal for Lockheed to acquire General Dynamics's entire military aircraft division for $1.53 billion.
The deal was hardly an anomaly. After years of cutbacks and now the end of the cold war, the military industry seems to be galloping toward consolidation.
The marching order is to concentrate on areas of strength and ditch the rest. For some, like the General Dynamics Corporation, that means abandoning markets in which they can be only marginal players. For others, like the Lockheed Corporation and the Martin Marietta Corporation, it means big purchases in areas they can dominate. While still others, like the Grumman Corporation, are taking a wait-and-see attitude, those that will survive and thrive must move quickly or else risk being left behind, weapons industry executives and other experts say.
The shift is sure to have broad implications not only for the shareholders and employees of the nation's 9,000 primary military suppliers but also for the economy. Weapons companies account for about 3 percent of the gross national product, employ slightly more than three million workers and perform critical research and development. Even if the consolidations are handled well, they promise painful dislocations at a time when the economy is still struggling to emerge from the recession. The impact will be felt most heavily here in southern California and in Texas and other states where there is a high concentration of weapons producers.
The shift has already resulted in a string of big deals, the largest being Martin Marietta's purchase in November of the General Electric Company's aerospace electronics division for $3 billion.
 
Picking Up Steam
 As the Clinton Administration takes office this week, it brings with it the promise of a more directed focus on deficit reduction that could further diminish the military budget and in turn accelerate the consolidation.
Indeed, according to a recent study by the management consultant firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton, between 75 and 80 percent of existing weapons contractors could be swallowed up by more aggressive industry leaders or simply leave the market by the end of the decade.
"Defense contractors have three options: becoming the very best in a specific area through acquisitions, selling off their overcapacity or simply shutting it down," said Ronald W. Stahlschmidt, an aerospace and defense industry analyst for Ernst & Young. "Waiting for the clouds to clear is not the way to weather this storm. This will not pass. It is a permanent resizing and reshaping of the industry."
Just how big a reshaping can be seen from the magnitude of the budget cuts. Government spending for military supplies -- everything from uniforms to aircraft carriers -- has declined 22 percent, to $161 billion in 1992 from a high of $206 billion in 1987, according to the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based research group.
That has resulted in the loss of some 315,000 jobs in the industry, nearly 10 percent of the total. More job losses seem inevitable, given that spending is expected to drop to $133 billion by 1997 under the latest projections.
In the past, most contractors adapted to cutbacks by increasing foreign sales and converting to commercial work. But while foreign sales have been rising in recent years, they are not expected to offset the steep budget-cutting. In addition, American contractors face increasing competition abroad from foreign suppliers.
So far, conversion from weapons to commercial production is not occurring on a major scale, and many analysts say it may never happen. This is partly because attempts at conversion failed after the Vietnam War, and many contractors are now avoiding them altogether. Those who are attempting them are finding that opportunities for making consumer products are few in a weak economy.
That makes it increasingly important for companies to consolidate, industry experts say. Those who move first stand to benefit the most because they can select the best deals at the best prices.
"If you don't do anything, you can quickly move from a No. 1 position to a No. 3 or 4 position in a given market," said John R. Harbison, vice president for aerospace at Booz Allen Hamilton. For example, Mr. Harbison cites the Hughes Aircraft Company's acquisition of General Dynamics's missile division last year. The deal suddenly put Hughes on an equal footing with the Raytheon Company, which had been the leader.
"If you are Raytheon and suddenly overnight you are no longer the biggest guy in tactical missiles because of a consolidation, you are going to be more than a little concerned and then go out and try to acquire someone else," Mr. Harbison said. "And hopefully there's still someone left to buy." (In fact, Raytheon did make a run at the missile unit of the LTV Corporation, but lost out to the Loral Corporation last August.)
What do buyers look for? Among other things, complementary operations for existing programs and technical skill to develop new ones.
But once a contractor acquires a new business, there is still the challenge of successfully integrating it into the rest of the company.
"Simply acquiring more assets is not enough," said Jerrold T. Lundquist, a vice president at McKinsey & Company, the management consultants. "The real task is making the asset an integral part of the company and not just transferring capacity."
Notwithstanding the push toward consolidation, there are obstacles, a big one being the Federal Trade Commission. Just last month, Alliant Techsystems called off its acquisition of the Olin Corporation's ammunition business when the F.T.C. threatened to file an antitrust suit. The F.T.C. contended that since the merger would leave the company as the sole supplier of some types of tank ammunition, the cost to the Government would increase.
Some industry experts oppose the F.T.C.'s interference in such situations, arguing that the Pentagon has full access to suppliers' costs and, as the sole customer, could closely regulate the price.
But Mary Lou Steptoe, director of the F.T.C.'s competition bureau, said the Government has found that some agencies overseeing military contracts lack the sophistication and personnel to protect against overcharges when there is only one supplier.
Another cautionary note relates to the weak economy. Though the rate of weapons consolidation is expected to increase during the Clinton Administration, many industry watchers predict that the new President will wait for the economy to improve before undertaking more extensive cuts.
"The prudent man at this juncture will wait a little bit until he sees just how the Clinton budget unfolds," said Richard Bitzinger, an analyst for the Defense Budget Project. "It would be highly unfortunate to buy something big and then see the Administration cancel its programs."
What follows are three starkly different approaches to the changes now reshaping the military industry.
 
Buy, Buy, Buy:
Marietta, Lockheed
 "Our strategy is to win more than our fair share of aerospace business through acquisitions and focusing on future technology," said Charles Manor, a Martin Marietta spokesman.
That was the underpinning for the largest acquisition last year, Martin Marietta's purchase of G.E.'s aerospace electronics business. G.E. has announced a strategy of remaining only in businesses where it can lead and the deal allows it to leave the electronics market where it faced limited growth. By contrast, Martin Marietta is now poised to become the nation's premiere aerospace electronics supplier.
Analysts have speculated that future weapons systems will integrate land and sea radar, which the G.E. aerospace operation specialized in, with advanced sensing systems, which has been Marietta's forte.
Market dominance and synergies are also expected to come from the Lockheed-General Dynamics military aircraft deal. The merger of the two divisions is expected to reduce overhead costs, bring together technical expertise that would ultimately produce more advanced aircraft, and generate enough revenues to make Lockheed the market leader.
"We first had to define what area we wanted to concentrate in and then this great opportunity came along so we took advantage of it," said Vince Marafino, Lockheed's vice chairman.
 
Wait and See:
Grumman, McDonnell
 Some contractors, like Grumman and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, have taken a much more cautious approach toward consolidation, deciding first to restructure internally and divest smaller assets before taking any giant steps.
Grumman, based in Bethpage, L.I., announced in November that it would combine its aircraft, space and electronics groups to cut costs and become more competitive. Most of its aircraft programs are being phased out or are modest in size and in recent years the contractor has been shrinking its production capacity as its contracts near their end, producing erratic earnings.
Nonetheless, Grumman, which also makes space systems and commercial aircraft components, has about $250 million in cash and little debt.
"We don't feel that we are under any immediate pressure to acquire or sell something," said Robert P. Harwood, Grumman's vice president for public affairs. "We are more optimistic about certain segments of the industry than are others. If you run out and buy just anything you could be getting a pig in a poke."
Still, Mr. Harwood said that Grumman is looking for acquisitions, especially in the radar-surveillance and information integration fields, which he said the company expects to grow.
But analysts said that companies like Grumman and McDonnell Douglas, which have a wide variety of weapons programs, are overexposed and should focus on a few businesses and shed the rest.
McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest military contractor, announced a huge restructuring last year to consolidate operations and cut costs. In a separate move, it sold its international information systems and visual simulation businesses.
But the St. Louis-based contractor is struggling as some of its largest production programs face cancellation in the next few years. McDonnell has also been unable to remain competitive with its rivals in the commercial aircraft industry -- the Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie, the European consortium -- which have kept their manufacturing costs lower than McDonnell's.
Analysts expect McDonnell to shed more assets to obtain much-needed cash to buttress the troubled commercial end of its business.
 
Sell, Sell, Sell:
General Dynamics
 A year ago, General Dynamics announced a new strategy that has become the mode of operation for the majority of companies in the industry. Faced with declining orders, the St. Louis-based contractor said that it would divest itself of all businesses except its four core operations -- aircraft, tank, space-launch vehicles and shipbuilding, where it hoped to remain dominant or become so.
So far, General Dynamics has sold $1.3 billion of "nonessential" businesses, including missile systems and Cessna Aircraft. But the contractor also sold its military aircraft division to Lockheed, a move that has led some analysts to speculate that General Dynamics sees little future in the weapons business as a whole and is liquidating.
Company executives deny that they are cashing out. They add, however, that they are now willing to sell core businesses because in some instances they cannot acquire operations from other contractors that would strengthen those areas.
The asset sales have produced a mountain of cash that General Dynamics is using in part to reduce debt. It is also returning some of the money to shareholders, in the form of higher dividends and stock buybacks.
General Dynamics is still seeking acquisitions to bolster its three remaining product lines, said James J. Cunnane, a senior vice president, but the company will not pay a premium for them.
"The smaller, weaker, more peripheral players in this industry will probably go under. We didn't want to be one of them," Mr. Cunnane said. "There will be a General Dynamics 5 or 10 years from now, but it's hard to say what it will look like."

HEADLINE: Two Scientists Find a Way To Make Cheaper Methanol

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A team of chemists in California has discovered what appears to be a cheaper way to turn natural gas into methanol. If it can be commercialized, the process could create vast supplies of transportation fuel from reserves of gas that cannot now be tapped economically.
The process is described in the current issue of the journal Science by seven scientists from Catalytica Inc., a company in Mountain View, Calif. 
 Natural gas is composed primarily of methane, a molecule with a carbon atom at its center and four hydrogen atoms attached. It can be converted to methanol, a liquid, by tearing off one of the hydrogen atoms and replacing it with two atoms that are bonded together, one of oxygen and one of hydrogen. But the process is difficult and expensive because in methane the bond between the carbon atom and the hydrogen atoms is very strong.
The use of methanol in vehicles is increasing in this country because it creates fewer of the pollutants that cause smog, although it produces other forms of pollution. Burning it in automobiles requires modified fuel pumps, seals and lubricants, but those technical challenges have already been overcome.
 
A Mix With Gasoline
 It can also be used as a raw material to make methyl tertiary butyl ether, which can be mixed with gasoline in conventional cars.
By 1994 the capacity to produce methanol will be three times what it was at the beginning of last year, according to David A. Zinamon, a fuels expert at Petroleum Industry Research Associates, a consulting firm in New York.
The world market for methanol could become tight in the middle of this decade, he said, and a new technology would be useful in meeting new demand, although world use of methanol is not expected to increase greatly. Methanol cannot compete with gasoline on the basis of price in this country; a gallon of gasoline sells at wholesale, before taxes, at 50 cents, but a quantity of methanol that delivers the same amount of energy costs 80 cents, Mr. Zinamon said.
Natural gas reserves nearly equal oil reserves in energy value. But bringing natural gas to market would require huge capital investments. The North Slope of Alaska, for example, has substantial gas reserves, but there is no pipeline to the lower 48 states, and the price of liquefying the gas for tanker shipment is far too high to be justified under current market conditions.
 
Use of Catalyst
 The new system uses a catalyst, a material that speeds up a chemical reaction but is not consumed by it. In this case, a form of mercury with an electric charge is used.
"You can buy this off the shelf," Roy A. Periana, the project leader at Catalytica, said in a telephone interview. "Any chemist can do this reaction."
At one point in the process the reaction produces sulfuric acid, and at another it makes sulfur dioxide, but both those chemicals are consumed in later steps. The process occurs at temperatures far lower than conventional methods for making methanol.
But another researcher, Professor John J. Thomas of the Florida Institute of Technology, warned that the need for acid-resistant containers could drive costs up. In addition, he said, even when a process has been demonstrated on a laboratory scale, substantial engineering work is needed before a pilot plant can be built. "Those two things kill a lot of processes," he said.
In the Catalytica process, the ingredients required are methane and oxygen from air; at the end it yields methanol, along with carbon dioxide.
Dr. Periana said that so far chemists had carried on the process in liter quantities.
"We would not want to represent that it's ready for commercialization, but it is a significant improvement in science, a breakthrough," he said.
Catalytica has filed documents in preparation for a public sale of stock, and Dr. Periana said that as a result he could not discuss the commercial possibilities in detail.
The research was financed by Petro Canada and Mitsubishi Oil, he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 24, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a new process for converting natural gas to methanol misidentified a chemical. From 1992 to 1994 the United States is expected to triple its capacity to make methyl tertiary butyl ether, which is derived from methanol, not to triple the capacity to make methanol itself.

HEADLINE: Finally, a Bottoming Out?

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
APARTMENT prices in New York City fell, for the most part, in 1992, but the overall rate of decline appeared to be smaller than in the last two years. There was a small increase in average prices for large, high-end properties in prime neighborhoods, but a steep drop among studios and one-bedroom co-ops, most condominiums and units in marginal areas.
 The easing in the overall rate of decline may indicate, according to many local brokers, that the plunge in prices that began in 1988 may have bottomed out. To be sure, this isn't the first time that brokers have heralded the end of the city's residential real estate recession. In the early months of 1991 and 1992, many of them predicted, incorrectly, that prices had reached their nadir and would soon rise. 
This year, though, there does appear to be evidence that some apartments in some neighborhoods may be appreciating. Moreover, brokers seem to be tempering their hyperbole of past years and now concede that the prices of many Manhattan apartments may not hit the highs attained in the mid-80's for several years to come.
 "I think we've got stable prices for the next year or so," said Alan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, a Manhattan brokerage and management firm that recently released a five-year study of the city's co-op and condominium market.
 "After that, perhaps," he continued, "we'll start to see increases in certain sectors, starting at the top and filtering down."
 Assessing the direction of the city's amorphous apartment market is difficult not only because of disparities between neighborhoods and unit sizes, but also because the selling prices of co-ops, which far outnumber condominiums and one-family homes, are not publicly reported.
 Several Manhattan brokers, most notably Douglas Elliman and the Corcoran Group, have their own surveys and indexes, as does the National Cooperative Bank.
 These reports, though, have not been independently verified, and they are often skewed in some form and thus report different findings.
 For example, the average price of a Manhattan apartment rose by 0.5 percent in 1992, according to the year-end Corcoran Report, based on 1,835 co-ops and condominiums adjusted for what it calls an 18.4 percent negotiability factor.
 "It's a slow, push-me, pull-me kind of recovery in our type of market," said Barbara Corcoran, president of the concern. "You have cheap money and cheap prices, and I haven't seen them both at the same time. Buyers have come to the consensus that there is good value."
 But the National Cooperative Bank, which derived its findings from 160 sales and 900 resales, takes a more dire view. Its report showed a 14.4 percent decline for the city's co-ops in 1992. For Manhattan alone, the drop was 7.6 percent. "Balance our numbers and Corcoran's to find where the market is," said Grace Ann Huebscher, a senior vice president at the bank.
 BY coincidence, perhaps, Douglas Elliman's report was about halfway between Corcoran's and the National Cooperative Bank's. Based on 5,261 sales from January 1988 through December 1992, its report showed that the price per room of a Manhattan co-op fell by 3.2 percent in 1992 from the price a year earlier.
 For sellers, if there is anything positive that can be culled from a 3.2 percent drop in prices, it is that the figure is less than the double-digit declines recorded in the previous four years. Indeed, according to Douglas Elliman's report, the price per room of the average Manhattan co-op has fallen 30.2 percent since 1988. The National Cooperative Bank puts the figure at 36 percent; Corcoran figures 27.5 percent.
 Furthermore, sale prices for one-family homes in many of the New York suburbs, and in much of the Northeast, have fallen just as much in the last five years.
 Economists and real estate analysts have attributed the drop in co-op prices to the slack demand created by the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the city, particularly in the financial service industry, since the stock market crash in October 1987.
 They have also said the decline is an inevitable outcome of the rapid escalation in the 80's. Other factors include tightened lending policies, low bank appraisals, skyrocketing maintenance charges and precarious underlying mortgages on many co-op buildings that are less than 50 percent owner-occupied.
 There is also the trepidation many potential apartment buyers feel not only about the long-term investment required to realize a profit in real estate but also about the economy, particularly about holding on to their jobs. Others note, too, the dwindling number of prosperous first-home-buying baby boomers moving to the city.
But even among those sellers who have had their Manhattan apartment on the market for months and even years, there appears to be more optimism than in past years.
 "We put our place up for sale in 1990, and the amount of traffic was so different last year than in 1990 and 1991," said Philip F. Charles, a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Princeton, N.J., who is still trying to sell the Upper East Side co-op his wife lived in before they were married. He is currently renting it.
 "We must have had 40 or 50 showings in a three-month period," he said. "That shows that there is too much supply and people have the option of picking and choosing. But at least they are looking."
 The sharpest drop has been for studios. The price of the average Manhattan studio, according to the Douglas Elliman report, fell 35 percent, to $40,538, in 1992 from $62,326 in 1988. In 1992 alone, the price fell 16.9 percent.
 "Studios and one-bedrooms are still going down," Ms. Corcoran said. "The smaller the unit, the more it's going down.
 Apartments in marginal areas or parts of the city, such as the East Village, the Lower East Side and the Upper West Side north of 96th Street, where gentrification stalled in the late 80's, have also not fared well.
 Steep declines, however, have also been posted in other nonselect neighborhoods. In midtown Manhattan, for example, the price per room of a co-op fell 38 percent, to $68,986, in 1992 from $111,222 in 1988, according to the Douglas Elliman report. In 1992 alone, the price dropped 23.4 percent. By comparison, the steadiest part of the Manhattan market appears to have been large, upscale apartments, particularly in prime neighborhoods.
 "The eight- and nine-room units have increased in activity and the three-room has decreased," said Roberta Faulstick, a senior vice president at William B. May Company, "Also lofts are increasing in activity."
 Howard Diller, a Manhattan lawyer, was one of the owners of a large luxury apartment who, after two years of trying, finally managed to find a buyer for his eight-room apartment on Central Park West in 1992. He listed it two years ago for $1.4 million, but it is now priced at $800,000.
 "We have noticed that things have changed in the past year," he said.
 Besides size, price has been an important factor in maintining an apartment's value. The price per room of apartments selling for more than $1 million has dropped only 11.7 percent since 1988, to $214,732 from $243,293, according to the Douglas Elliman report. Further, in the past year, the price actually rose 4.6 percent over the 1991 average of $205,248, one of the few increases found in any sector of the market in 1992.
 Geographically, the firmest prices have been found on the Upper East Side, west of Lexington Avenue, where, according to Douglas Elliman, prices fell 28.2 percent to $137,520 in 1992 from $191,536 in 1988. In 1992, however, prices rose 3.9 percent over the previous year.
 CO-OP prices in Brooklyn and Queens are difficult to assess, even more than in Manhattan, as Douglas Elliman and Corcoran do not study them. The one survey available, the National Cooperative Bank's, showed an 11.9 percent increase in Brooklyn and Queens during 1992. The previous year, though, co-op prices fell by 17.8 percent, an indication of either the volatility of the market or the imprecision of the survey.
"The advice for buyers is the same as it has always been," Mr. Rogers said. "Go for prime location and quality of building or get as close as possible."
 Condominium sales in Manhattan, which unlike co-op sales can be precisely calculated because they are actual property transfers, haven't fared much better than co-ops. In 1992, the number of units sold dwindled to 1,853, compared with 2,006 the preceding year and 5,832, the high point, in 1988, according to Yale Robbins, a Manhattan real estate analyst.
 Prices have also been dropping. The total dollar value of the condominium units sold in 1992 was $528.3 million, compared with $732.3 million in 1991 and $1.8 billion in 1988.
 The price per square foot for condominiums, computed by Douglas Elliman as of Sept. 30, 1992, fell 14.8 percent to $306 from $359 for 1991 and $392 for 1988.
 As is the case with co-ops, the most decline-resistant condominiums are those priced at the high end and those in prime neighborhoods. Those units on the Upper East Side, west of Lexington Avenue, dropped 2.3 percent, to $417 a square foot from $427 a square foot in 1991, according to the Douglas Elliman report. The biggest decline in 1992 was in Midtown, where the price per square foot fell to $324, 20.4 percent lower than the $407 per square foot in 1991.
 Despite the downturn, many brokers are bullish on the future for condominiums, 17 percent of the apartments in the city.
 Condominiums are considered a more stable investment because financing is easier. They are also unusually attractive to foreigners, who often have trouble getting the approval of co-op boards and have difficulty finding comparable property in their own country for the same price. Moreover, foreigners, especially Europeans, have not been greatly affected by this country's economic problems and benefit from a devalued dollar.
 "Co-op ownership is an outdated form of ownership," said Jack C. Heller, a luxury-condominium developer with Heller Macaulay Equities in Manhattan. "The only benefit to a co-op is the perceived ability to restrict who your neighbor is. In return for that, you are giving up a fantastic amount of economic freedom. You all but forfeit liquidity. That, therefore, erodes the value of the home."
 "The exceptions are prewar buildings," he added. "People there are exchanging risk for beauty. They will do anything to live with 10-foot ceilings, mouldings and fireplaces."
The downside for condominiums, some brokers warn, is that there are very few high-quality buildings. And, as it is for co-ops, new construction, is practically nil.
 This lack of construction, brokers believe, will eventually help push prices of many apartments higher as the existing units for sale are absorbed by the demand.
 In the meantime, though, the prognosis for prices in 1993, for both condo and co-ops, is guarded, despite lower interest rates and depressed prices.
 "I think things are going to get better," Ms. Huebscher said. "But let's be cautious. I expect very little appreciation in the 90's."

HEADLINE: Making a Difference;
A Bank That's Committed To South-Central L.A.

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
While the inner city still smoldered after April's riots, Carlton Jenkins organized luxury bus tours past burned-out businesses for some top executives.
The "tours" were a new twist in an old campaign by Mr. Jenkins, managing director of Founders National Bank, California's only black-owned bank. Long before the violence he pressed for greater economic development in the South-Central section, hardest hit by arson and looting. Now conscience-stricken white executives have joined his cause. 
 "I'm not going to sit and wait for Rebuild L.A. with my hand out," said Mr. Jenkins, who is 36, referring to the group set up to revive the area.
Instead, Mr. Jenkins has been trying to raise his bank's capital base, which would allow it to grant more loans to minority-owned businesses.
Last month, ARCO said it would invest $1 million in the bank, buying preferred stock. If Founders can raise another $1 million, ARCO will match that. Since banks can lend roughly $15 for every dollar of capital, $3 million could translate into $45 million in loans.
"They grabbed the idea and ran with it, unlike many other Fortune 500 companies," Mr. Jenkins said of ARCO. "We wanted to show the world that you can invest in the inner city and not feel that it represents an inordinate or unacceptable risk."
Founders plans to add more loan officers and possibly add branches. Bank of America is considering providing Founders with capital to buy two of its closed South-Central Los Angeles branches.
Mr. Jenkins's grandfather, Leon T. Garr, a one-time carpenter from Louisiana, bought the failed South-Central savings and loan in 1991. He used $250,000 from outside investors, $750,000 of his own funds and a $2 million loan from the Resolution Trust Corporation.
Emerging with a new charter as a bank, Founders had assets of $61 million and profits of $1.2 million last year.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Weighs Possibility of Job Layoffs

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
RECENTLY, when the talk at a party in Rye turned to speculating about the reverses of Westchester's largest employer, I.B.M., one of the guests, an I.B.M. employee, said he was worried only about two things: "My job and my stock."
He wasn't being facetious. The announcement by International Business Machines, whose corporate world headquarters are in Armonk, that this year it was cutting 25,000 more jobs worldwide and reducing its budget for research, development and engineering by $1 billion may signify that the company will have to initiate the first layoffs in its history. Up to now the company has used voluntary means like job buyouts and early retirement to eliminate jobs. 
 "Understandably, I.B.M. employees are nervous," said Noreen L. Preston, the economic-development specialist for the county. "You hear of I.B.M. executives in their 40's and 50's with 25 years with the company taking early retirement." Yet, she added, the latest cutbacks -- 12,000 employees at I.B.M. U.S.A., headquartered in Purchase, targeting chiefly those in manufacturing -- is not expected to have a major impact on the county's economy. I.B.M. employees in the county are in such divisions as marketing, research and development and services.
 
22 Percent Drop in Employment
 "We have already absorbed much of the I.B.M. job loss," Ms. Preston said. "I.B.M. reached its employment peak in Westchester in 1985 when they had a work force of 15,000 employees here." In 1991, she continued, the number of I.B.M. employees dropped to 12,000. And the latest figures that came out last month show another drop to 9,400. "In the period from 1990 to 1992, I.B.M. U.S.A. cut employment by 23 percent; in Westchester, I.B.M. employment dropped 22 percent in the same period, so we are closely following the national average," she said.
But despite the drop in employment, Ms. Preston said, I.B.M. is still the largest employer in Westchester. "By at least several thousand," she said. "I.B.M. accounts for 9 percent of the total job loss in the county." The second largest private employer in the county is Nynex and its subsidiary New York Telephone, with about 5,000 employees; Westchester's second-largest employer is the county, with 8,900 employees.
"I.B.M. is an important presence," Ms. Preston said. "They have a far-reaching influence on other industries. Suppliers depend on them. And when they vacated space, for instance, it had a serious impact on the commercial real estate market."
"On the other hand," she continued, "there is something of redeeming value taking place, which hasn't gotten much attention -- the I.B.M. spinoffs." Prodigy, in White Plains, an I.B.M.-Sears partnership, is one of them, and Intelligence Systems Solving Corporation, a new company, is also an I.B.M. spinoff, situated in Tarrytown. These companies lease space here -- Prodigy just took more space -- and employ many county people.
When asked where the I.B.M. job cuts would be made in Westchester, an I.B.M. spokesman, James Ruderman, said, "We don't know yet where the cuts will come, but we will make them as early as possible. Manufacturing capacity will certainly be reduced, but that doesn't affect Westchester; but some business units will also be affected. And if current conditions don't improve, our full-employment practice may change, and we may have to make the first layoffs in the company in 50 years."
I.B.M.'s first payroll cuts for 1993, possibly totaling 3,500 jobs, are scheduled to take effect at plants in East Fishkill, Poughkeepsie and Kingston, which produce mainframe computers and the semiconductor chips used in those large computers, sales of which have significantly dropped. I.B.M.'s local suppliers, which Mr. Ruderman said the company always tries to use, may also be adversely affected.
"In order to reduce costs and expenses, certain facilities will be doing more jobs in house, such as mail-room functions," he said.
An effort by the company to reduce occupancy costs will also accelerate, said Ken W. Sayres, an I.B.M. real estate spokesman. "The company has been following a consolidation strategy for years, moving out of leased space into buildings we own," Mr. Sayres said. "Now we are assessing all the space we have in Westchester. One option under consideration is to sell our 442,000-square-foot U.S. headquarters building at 2000 Purchase Street in Purchase on a lease-back basis."
Managers at the branch-office level, Mr. Sayres said, will be measured on the way they use their assets. "One way is how they reduce occupancy costs. If they can find a way to cut back on space of 5,000 square feet or more, it can be done possibly by eliminating such areas as conference and meeting rooms, thus freeing the space, then it can be given to I.B.M. Real Estate Services in Stamford for sublease."
 
$1 Billion Cut in Research
 Ten percent of the $6.6 billion I.B.M. spent last year on research, development and engineering went for research and development activities at I.B.M. research centers in Yorktown Heights and Hawthorne, in San Jose, Calif., and in Switzerland, said Michael D. King, director of communications at the company's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights.
Mr. King said that the effect of the $1 billion reduction in the overall budget for research, development and engineering will reduce research and development operations by about 10 percent. "It's a dip, but not of overwhelming significance," Mr. King said. "We anticipate operating with a budget of about $500 million this year."
The Watson Research Center is the heart of I.B.M.'s research and development activities. A work force of 2,400 scientists, technicians and operations people are employed at the research centers in Yorktown Heights and Hawthorne.
When asked about the morale of the scientists in the face of announcements that I.B.M. was planning to shift the direction of its research to high-growth areas, such as client services and software, Mr. King said:
"Of course, they're concerned, but I think morale is holding even. The scientists understand what the company is trying to do. The question many of them have to ponder now is, 'Is the work I'm doing of value to I.B.M.?' Their managers will want to know what is its payoff to the company."
In the past, Mr. King said, a lot of research that was conducted by I.B.M. scientists was pure science, with no direct mandate for them to work on projects solely to add value to the company.
"There will be changes and redirection," he said. "Jobs will be cut through early retirement and normal attrition, but the company is absolutely committed to research and development."
Although hiring for research and development is minimal, Mr. King stressed that it was still going on, especially when people with specific skills are needed.
But some of the job cuts at I.B.M. may prove to be a selling point that can be used to attract high-tech industries to Westchester, said Robert Bierman, manager of the Hudson Valley Region of the State Department of Labor, with offices in White Plains.
 
Difficulties Can Be Expected
 "Highly trained people, such as scientists and technicians, are extremely valuable to the region's economic well-being," Mr. Bierman said. "We see them as a magnet for bringing new companies here."
But, he continued, white-collar workers and middle managers who formerly earned good salaries at I.B.M. can expect difficulties in finding new jobs.
"Right now, there is a surplus of white-collar and middle-management people in the county," Mr. Bierman said. "The recovery is slow, and we're not seeing any major growth in demand coming soon."
 
Managers Turned Entrepreneurs
 What is happening, Mr. Bierman said, is that many middle managers have become entrepreneurs who have started their own businesses. "This is good news," he said. "Start-up companies are very important to the recovery."
And despite the downsizing of I.B.M., Ms. Preston says she already sees signs of recovery in the county's economy.
"Retail numbers for the holiday season are coming out strong, and you have to remember we are not a one-company town," she said. "We have a lot of other blue-chip companies headquartered here, and some of those major employers -- Texaco and Pepsico and also Con Ed -- have recently added staff."

HEADLINE: George Herbert Walker Bush: A Premature Historical Verdict

BYLINE: By Michael R. Beschloss; Michael R. Beschloss is a historian and author of "The Crisis Years: Kennedy and Khrushchev, 1960-1963." His latest book, written with Strobe Talbott, is "At the Highest Levels: The Inside Story of the End of the Cold War," to be published next month by Little, Brown.

 BODY:

From "The Historians' Guide to American History," published 2008.
 
BUSH, GEORGE (HERBERT WALKER) (b. June 12, 1924, Milton, Mass.) 41st President of the United States (1989 to 1993) 
 A President's historical reputation usually sinks just after he leaves office, especially when he has been defeated for re-election. George Bush was a victim of this phenomenon for an additional reason. His defeat by Bill Clinton in 1992 ushered in a 16-year cycle of progressive activism. During an era dominated by two energetic Presidents -- Bill Clinton and his successor, Al Gore -- the stature of a right-of-center chief executive like George Bush, who recoiled from using the full powers of the Presidency, was bound to suffer.
Thus, throughout the decade after he left office, memories of the Bush Administration remained vague. Those Americans who thought of the former President at all tended to blame him for mismanaging the economy. In 1994, during a $50,000 speech to the Electric Toaster Manufacturers Association, a horseshoe was thrown at Bush by a protester who blamed him for the loss of his house during the 1990-92 recession. Otherwise the 41st President was rarely mentioned in the press.
The former President was also treated badly by his own party. After his term ended, Republican leaders instantly disowned him as an unwanted reminder of their flirtation with ideological moderation. At their 1996 convention in Salt Lake City, when Representative Robert Dornan of California was nominated for President, Mr. Bush was not invited onto the podium. Dornan and his running mate, Representative Newt Gingrich, rushed to the retirement homes of former Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan for endorsements but eschewed all invitations to be photographed with Mr. Bush.
During the 1990's, Mr. Bush enjoyed approximately the same esteem among historians as former President William Howard Taft did during the New Deal. One scholar described Mr. Bush as "another Taft, but without the personality." There were other obvious similarities: both Mr. Taft and Mr. Bush were Yale Republicans with Ohio forebears who owed their Presidential elections to the popularity of their predecessors, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Most historians now believe that, like Mr. Taft, had Mr. Bush made a stronger public effort to acknowledge his ideological and political debt to his predecessor, the Republican votes he would have gained might have won him re-election.
Other developments during the 1990's continued to whittle away at Mr. Bush's historical standing. Memoirs by his aides portrayed him as a weak, indecisive figure who consistently refused the counsel of the more brilliant advisers around him -- notably Richard Darman's "I Told Him So" (1993), John Sununu's "Genius: My White House Years" (1995) and James Baker's "Presidents Who Have Known Me" (1997). In "Conscience of a Conservative: The Sequel" (1998), Mr. Bush's Vice President, Dan Quayle, blamed his former boss directly for the failure of his own 1996 Presidential campaign, from which he was forced to withdraw after finishing second in the Indiana primary.
Mr. Bush's military triumphs in Panama in 1989 and the Persian Gulf in 1991 also came under a cloud. Just as many historians now blame John F. Kennedy for mistakes that helped create the Cuban missile crisis while praising his efforts to end that episode, the public learned more of how Mr. Bush privately encouraged the ambitions of the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein before changing his mind and striking at each regime with military force.
After Noriega's release from prison in 1998 and Saddam's ouster by military coup in 1999, the two men held a joint news conference in Asuncion, Paraguay, during which they played tapes of private conversations with Mr. Bush. According to the tapes, then-Vice President Bush told General Noriega in 1985: "We love your commitment to democracy. Keep it up!" During a 1990 telephone call to Mr. Hussein, then-President Bush praised Iraq as "an island of stability in a troubled region."
Mr. Bush also remained shadowed by his 1992 pardon of Caspar Weinberger and others involved in the Iran-contra scandal. Historians still differ over whether Mr. Bush used the pardon to keep a Weinberger trial from disclosing information that would contradict his own claims of limited involvement in the affair. With his investigation now in its 22d year, independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has yet to sustain a conviction.
A DECADE AFTER MR. Bush left the White House, his stock on the historical exchange, depressed for so long, began to rise. One reason: the left-of-center activism embodied by Presidents Clinton and Gore was faltering. In 2002, for the first time in a half-century, Republicans seized control of both houses of Congress and quickly voted to strip the funds from numerous White House-sponsored programs, such as Clinton's National Service Corps and Gore's Global Warming Initiative (G.W.I.). This legislative drive drew the support of perennial Presidential candidate Ross Perot and nearly all of the other 38 billionaires who declared their candidacies for the White House in 2004.
World events at the start of the 21st century -- like the breakup of the Russian Federation into 284 mutually hostile republics, the purchase of Brazil by the Taiwanese, the Quebec-Ontario border war and acquisition of nuclear weapons by such entities as the Government of Barbados and the talk show host Rush Limbaugh -- made the early 1990's in the United States seem by contrast a heroic period. Scholars now grant Mr. Bush far more credit for his world leadership in that period than did the voters of 1992.
Mr. Bush's once-maligned leadership style also attracted unexpected praise. A book called "Another Hidden Hand: Bush as Leader" (2006), made the case that the 41st President should be viewed not as another Taft but another Eisenhower. It used newly released papers to demonstrate that, like Eisenhower, Mr. Bush was far more commanding and articulate in private than his news conferences or the memoirs of his spiteful aides suggested.
The book also argued that Mr. Bush had deliberately modeled his Presidency on Eisenhower's -- eschewing traditionally divisive domestic issues in order to unify Americans after a period of national controversy -- but kept his decision to emulate the moderate President secret out of fear that it would infuriate conservative Republicans. The book further revealed how guilt-ridden Mr. Bush was when he compared himself during the 1992 campaign to Harry Truman, a one-time political enemy of Eisenhower's. It quoted from Mr. Bush's private diary: "Beloved President Ike, so sorry to be doing this. Have to understand. Just in campaign mode now. Don't mean it. What a way to make a living!"
As Mr. Bush's reputation gathered steam, some scholars even recast what had been thought to be the weakest part of his record, his handling of the economy. "Message -- I Care: Bush's Economic Management" (2007) argued that Mr. Bush's much-vilified 1990 budget compromise with Congress that broke his campaign pledge -- "Read My Lips: No New Taxes" -- actually helped make the so-called Bush recession shorter and shallower than economists at the time understood.
Now 84, Mr. Bush has proven to be one of America's longest-living ex-Presidents. Like William Howard Taft, who became Chief Justice, and Jimmy Carter, who served as a human rights activist, Mr. Bush enhanced his reputation by engaging in activities that seemed to suit his temperament more than the Presidency had. In Houston, he established the Bush Center for Internationalism, which became his platform for lectures and writings opposing growing isolationist impulses in both parties. President Gore appointed him to undertake special diplomatic missions to post-Communist Cuba, the semi-autonomous republic of Northern Moscow and to Monaco, where peace talks with France inspired by Mr. Bush were entering their 16th year.
In retirement, Mr. Bush has also been a fierce opponent of the Hispanic-American secessionist movement. In Kearny, N.J., in 2003, he gave a famous address against "suicidal nationalism." (Foes lampooned it as the "Chicken con Kearny speech.") When his Hispanic-American grandson, George P. Bush, was elected to the United States Senate from Florida in 2006 on an anti-secessionist ticket, Mr. Bush was guest of honor at the South Miami victory rally. The Senator-elect turned to his grandfather, thanked him for campaigning on his behalf in Hobe Sound and Palm Beach and then repeated a battle cry he had uttered as a young man at the 1992 Republican Convention: "Viva Bush!" The 41st President's eyes filled with tears.

Just Leave Laura Tyson Alone

BYLINE: By LEWIS B. KADEN and LEE O. SMITH; Lewis B. Kaden is chairman and Lee O. Smith is executive director of the Governor's Commission on Competitiveness of the State of New York.

 BODY:
A few disgruntled economists have criticized the appointment of Laura Tyson, the University of California at Berkeley economics professor, to head the President's Council of Economic Advisers. We know Laura Tyson well, having worked closely with her for the past six years on the development of new national economic policies. We believe that her far-ranging knowledge and her realism about the global economy make her an outstanding choice for the job.
By tradition, past Presidents have given the top job at the council to economists who were experts on how the Government's monetary and fiscal policies influence the level of demand, the rate of growth and the level of unemployment. 
 For most of the post-World War II era, this was enough. With little global competition and the world's most modern factories, American industry achieved the high levels of productivity growth necessary for a steadily rising standard of living.
But beginning in the late 1970's, America's economic problems spread beyond the cycles of growth and recession to the long-term structural problem of a declining standard of living caused by diminishing competitiveness. The conventional view among economists was that the competitiveness problem was due to an overvalued dollar, curable by devaluation. Yet despite five years of a cheaper dollar, our trade deficits remain huge andour standard of living continues to stagnate.
MS. TYSON'S approach to the problem is different. She has argued that a purely macroeconomic response to competitiveness problems -- primarily, lowering the value of the dollar -- is inadequate. She has argued that how well we produce determines how well we live and she recognizes that excellence in production in turn depends on factors such as technology, trade policy, public investment, education, employee participation and corporate governance.
To hasten the reform of the nation's economic system, President-elect Clinton is seeking to create a realistic, structural approach to economic policy. One element of the strategy is a new macroeconomic policy to increase private and public investment, thus spurring demand to strengthen the current recovery, as well as to make industry more competitive and to achieve major deficit reduction in the next five years.
But we should not stop with investment and long-term deficit reduction. The shortcomings of many of America's most important institutions -- from our labor markets to our inner-city schools -- are holding us back. While managers, workers, investors, parents and educators will have to take the lead in most of these reforms, Washington can help enormously if policymakers understand the institutions that make for excellence in production and the role for positive government action.
Rather than produce narrow forecasts of growth, the President's chief economist has to be able to articulate the Administration's far-reaching structural economic policy. That is one of the reasons that Ms. Tyson is such an excellent choice to head the council. She will provide economic realism and expertise in trade, investment, industrial structures and technology as well as the macroeconomics needed to help Mr. Clinton shape a long-term program of economic renewal.

PROMISE AND POWER
The Life and Times of Robert McNamara.
By Deborah Shapley.
Illustrated. 734 pp. Boston:
Little, Brown & Company. $29.95. 
 Robert S. McNamara has not exactly made things easy for his biographers. Mr. Mc Namara rose within the Ford Motor Company to become its president -- briefly -- in 1960, but by that time he had already emerged as a sharp critic of the corporate culture that nurtured him. As John F. Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara developed a reputation for possessing a steely, computerlike mind that seemed to feed on and disgorge statistics; and yet that same Mr. McNamara was emotionally fragile, capable of breaking down in tears -- to his own intense embarrassment -- on public occasions. Although he quickly discovered that Kennedy's 1960 campaign allegations of a "missile gap" had been exaggerated, he presided over a significant buildup in American nuclear weapons and delivery systems during the early 1960's, which may well have provoked the Soviet Union into following suit. Now he claims that he regarded nuclear weapons as unusable all along, and that he so advised the Presidents he served.
More than anyone else apart from President Lyndon B. Johnson himself, Mr. McNamara bears responsibility for the escalation, and ultimately for the failure, of the American military effort in Vietnam. Almost alone among Johnson Administration officials, however, he has made no attempt, until now, to explain or defend his decisions. Mr. McNamara chose instead a kind of silent penance at the World Bank, which he ran for 13 years -- as if by saving lives in the third world he could somehow compensate for the lives lost in Indochina.
Mr. McNamara has written no memoir, and apparently intends none. He has been content to let the historians sort all of these issues out; but as Deborah Shapley, a Washington journalist and the co-author of a book on American technology, comments in the most comprehensive biography of Mr. McNamara to date, what this has really meant is, "Let the historians sort me out."
Ms. Shapley has bravely undertaken this task in "Promise and Power," and has even managed to elicit a certain amount of cooperation from Mr. McNamara, who with some reluctance made himself available for interviews. She has consulted Mr. McNamara's family, friends and associates, few of whom have been as reluctant to talk as he himself is. And she has used declassified documents to supplement her account, confronting Mr. McNamara with them directly when they seemed to contradict what he had told her.
The result is the best study of Mr. McNamara yet available, especially for what it tells us about his upbringing, his family life, his years at Ford and the World Bank, and his role in shaping the war in Vietnam. It is nonetheless an unsatisfying biography, because Ms. Shapley herself often seems unsure what to make of her subject.
The difficulty she faces, as any biographer of Mr. McNamara must, is to explain the contradictions that have been so striking a feature of his public life. How was it possible for the same man to be both a corporate success and a corporate critic? To be a number cruncher and a sentimentalist? To build up, but also to abhor, America's nuclear weapons arsenal? To be a hawk and then a dove on Vietnam?
One explanation, to which Ms. Shapley returns repeatedly throughout the book, is that Mr. McNamara may simply be a liar: that he habitually told those he most wanted to impress what he thought they most wanted to hear. Having thereby satisfied his bosses at Ford, or the Presidents for whom he worked, or the scholars who will ultimately determine his historical reputation, he then went on, she suggests, to believe his own falsehoods, passionately and with utter conviction.
Ms. Shapley does indeed catch Mr. McNamara in a number of instances in which he appears to have been less than candid. Examples include his flat denial to reporters that there were Soviet missiles in Cuba just days before Kennedy announced that fact in October 1962; his failure to inform Congress of difficulties in developing the TFX fighter plane; and his upbeat public portrayal of the war in Vietnam, when he knew it was going badly. But she provides no standard against which we can judge what she calls these "tactically useful fibs." Did Mr. McNamara employ them more frequently than other public figures do? To what extent were they really tactical, which implies deliberate intent, and to what extent did they reflect the malleability of memory, something that afflicts even those not particularly concerned with how they will be remembered? Since Ms. Shapley so strongly emphasizes Mr. McNamara's alleged habit of prevarication, she owes her readers a more thorough discussion of these issues than she provides.
There is another possible explanation for Mr. McNamara's inconsistencies over the years, however, and although Ms. Shapley offers considerable evidence for it, she does not fully develop it. It is that, in contrast to many figures in public life, Mr. McNamara may actually have learned on the job. Top officials usually take up their responsibilities with their positions on the issues more or less in place; it is unusual for them to alter those views while in office, and even rarer for them to admit to having done so.
But as Ms. Shapley points out, Mr. McNamara became a public figure almost overnight. Thrust abruptly from the insular environment of Detroit into the Pentagon and often the Oval Office, he had no time to evolve or to season his views, but rather had to devise them all at once. This he did, with all of the energy and bluntness for which he became famous; but experience, together with the wisdom it produces, had to be acquired along the way. Mr. McNamara's inability to conceal his emotions insured that his educational process would be a highly visible one.
This alternative explanation by no means diminishes Mr. McNamara's responsibility for what happened on his watch. Ms. Shapley is right to note, at the beginning of her book, that he "carries a large load, indeed." But to explain Mr. McNamara's inconsistencies in terms of a propensity to lie may be to miss a more interesting possibility: that he was that rare public servant who was capable of reconsidering underlying assumptions and reversing course if necessary, even while in office, and even at the price of appearing to be inconsistent.
IF that is the case, though, why did Mr. McNamara support the war in Vietnam for as long as he did? He now claims to have become convinced, as early as the end of 1965, that the conflict was unwinnable; and yet he remained in office for another two years, years in which his opposition to the war only gradually became publicly known. Mr. McNamara's explanation to Ms. Shapley is that he continued to hope throughout 1966 and 1967 that increasing military pressure would bring the North Vietnamese to the conference table, even if a North Vietnamese capitulation was nowhere in sight.
Ms. Shapley criticizes Mr. McNamara for not having left office and launched an open protest against the war; no doubt his reputation among historians would be a good deal higher if he had done so. Resignation in protest was not Mr. McNamara's style, though, any more than it was for others of his generation who were appalled by what their Government was doing, yet stayed on in Washington in the belief that they could somehow alter the policies to which they objected.
But Ms. Shapley also acknowledges that Mr. Mc Namara did, in the end, accomplish such an alteration. By quietly developing criticism of the Vietnam War effort from within the Pentagon itself, he prepared the way for his successor, Clark Clifford, to convince President Johnson early in 1968 that existing policies were not working and would have to be changed. It is not easy to see how Mr. McNamara could have achieved this result had he resigned earlier with a public condemnation of Administration policies.
As this example of wanting to have it both ways suggests, Ms. Shapley's account is not always as reflective as it might be. Her book also shows signs -- as do so many others these days -- of hasty composition and superficial editing. Names and titles are at times garbled, endnote citations are often imprecise, episodes are recounted more than once and the writing itself is frequently slack.
Ms. Shapley occasionally leaves out important parts of the story as well. The Kennedy Administration's October 1961 decision to expose the "missile gap" as nonexistent -- an act many historians believe precipitated Nikita Khrushchev's decision to place Soviet missiles in Cuba -- receives only an endnote. Ms. Shapley's account of the missile crisis itself makes less than adequate use of recent revelations about that event from both Russian and Cuban sources. Her discussion of the Johnson Administration's decision to proceed with the development of an antiballistic missile system in 1967 gives only cursory attention to what precipitated that development: the Soviet deployment of a comparable system around Moscow.
The fact that the puzzling but consistently intriguing figure that is Robert S. McNamara remains elusive reflects, at least in part, the shortcomings of this biography. But it also no doubt reflects Mr. Mc Namara's own -- perhaps calculated -- intractability as a subject.

Travel Light and Carry a Big Envelope

BYLINE: By Cara Greenberg

 BODY:
MILAN, Italy, is on sale this month at Now Voyager -- just $199 for a round-trip ticket. Moscow and St. Petersburg are now $359, but a couple of weeks ago, they, too, could have been had for $199. And last-minute specials at this air-courier agency can make trans-Atlantic travel cheaper than a new suitcase.
"Brussels still open for tonight?" Julie Weinberg, the owner, asked her staff one day last week. "Sell it for $99." 
 Ms. Weinberg started the business in 1984, and it was her mother, Marci, who came up with Now Voyager, after the 1942 Bette Davis movie of the same name. But the phrase was originally Walt Whitman's: "Now, Voyager, sail thou forth, to seek and find."
Now Voyager is an intermediary between freight companies and airlines. Since unaccompanied cargo is likely to be bumped from flights or to wait in customs for days before it is cleared, it's to the freight company's advantage to have someone accompany it. But such companies usually can't be bothered recruiting couriers: that's where Now Voyager comes in.
"I have to tell people, you're not going to be strapped to the wing," Ms. Weinberg said in her office on Varick Street in Manhattan, where five employees answered telephones that rang incessantly. "They think they're going to be deprived of food, or the movie, or asked to carry drugs, guns or bombs."
Sure, there are a few strings. An air courier is limited to one carry-on bag. The discount in air fare is in exchange for giving up baggage space, which is used by the freight companies to ship timely materials, like film or business documents, on regularly scheduled commercial airlines. The task of a courier is to hand an envelope containing shipping paperwork to a representative of the freight company at the destination airport, both coming and going. Couriers do not even see the cargo in question.
Couriers may have to leave on a few hours' notice to get the cheapest fare. They must travel solo (there is only one courier seat a flight), and must pay a $50 annual registration fee. They are locked into a return date, usually one to two weeks after departure. And not all airlines grant couriers frequent-flyer miles. Aside from those differences, couriers are treated like typical economy-class passengers.
Catherine Drillis, a freelance art consultant, approached the counter at Now Voyager one day last week. "Got anything to London on the 21st?" she asked. "I just got a sudden urge to go." She booked a round-trip flight for $159, plus the $50 annual fee.
Ms. Weinberg said, "I see us as inspiration for people who didn't think they could afford to go to exotic places." Though students and aspiring actors are typical customers, she said: "Women in Chanel and Gucci march in. They save on the air fare and stay in first-class hotels."
Nothing illegal has ever been transported by the companies with whom Now Voyager works, Ms. Weinberg said. "The only problem we had was a courier who went to Rio and tried to bring back hundreds of string bikinis in his backpack," she said. "I think he planned to sell them on Canal Street."
January and February are slow months for cold European destinations like Copenhagen, Stockholm, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. "You can get some of the cheapest flights of the year," Ms. Weinberg said. Rio de Janeiro, where it is now summer, is sold out until March. But round-trip flights to Caracas, Venezuela ($220); Buenos Aires ($499), and Mexico City ($259) are still available, as are trips to Bangkok, Thailand ($675); Singapore ($510); Hong Kong ($559) and Sydney, Australia ($699). All fares are subject to change.
Although seats can be booked up to three months in advance, prices get much lower on the day before or day of departure. "People are hip to that fact," said Jay Baez, who has worked at Now Voyager for four years. "They'll come into the office and sit for hours to see if the price goes down."
Poh Ee, contemplating a world map in the hall outside the office, didn't think the deal would work for him. "I'm going home to Singapore," said Mr. Ee, an architectural draftsman. "An ordinary flight is $680 one way. This is $510 round trip. The problem is, I have two large bags, and books and stuff. And I want to stop in Paris."
A woman entered, asking, "Do you have Milano or Rome near the 19th?" The woman, a freelance musician, refused to reveal her name. "My colleagues would razz the life out of me for doing this," she said. She got a nine-day round trip to Milan for $199.
"This courier business isn't for everyone," she said. "Sometimes you have to wait around for an hour or two at the airport for the representative to show up. The only place they're ever prompt is in London. But it's always worked out very well for me."
Now Voyager's office, at 74 Varick Street at Canal Street, is open Monday through Friday from 11 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. and Saturday from noon to 5 P.M. For a listing of available destinations, call (212) 431-1616.

HEADLINE: RAID ON IRAQ;
BUSH LAUNCHES MISSILE ATTACK ON A BAGHDAD INDUSTRIAL PARK AS WASHINGTON GREETS CLINTON

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea launched about 40 cruise missiles at what officials say was an Iraqi military complex in a Baghdad suburb today, as the United States brought battle to the Iraqi capital for the first time since the end of the Persian Gulf war.
Bush Administration officials said that today's strike, the second in five days, was a response to Iraq's decision to restrict United Nations weapons inspectors and to challenge the no-flight zones imposed by the United States and its allies. A senior Pentagon official left open the possibility that additional air strikes could be carried out soon, if Iraq did not comply with United Nations demands. 
 Bush Administration officials said that the Zaafaraniya complex, 8 miles southeast of downtown Baghdad, was a large industrial park, equipped with advanced computer-controlled machinery that the Iraqis had used in their nuclear weapons program.
 
No Assessment of Damage
 The Pentagon declined to provide any battle damage assessment. Asked today if the strike on the complex was successful, a senior Pentagon official said, "We do not know yet."
But Pentagon officials said tonight that it was possible that one of the cruise missiles had slammed into the Rashid Hotel, a favorite of foreign journalists in Baghdad and the site of an Islamic conference. A Pentagon official said that some missiles had been routed near or over the hotel.
Another official said that a couple of the cruise missiles may have been shot down and that one of them may have crashed into the hotel.
The Defense Department said it did not know how many casualties had resulted from the attack. The Associated Press in Baghdad said that there were reports that 3 people had been killed and up to 30 wounded in several parts of the city. It was not immediately clear whether the casualties were caused by falling antiaircraft shells or by American missiles.
In announcing the attack, the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said it "demonstrates the United States' and the coalition's determination to demand Iraq's compliance with all U.N resolutions."
 
Weapons of Mass Destruction
 Mr. Fitzwater added that the attack was intended "to insure that Iraq never again acquires weapons of mass destruction: nuclear, chemical and biological."
President-elect Bill Clinton, whose bus cavalcade arrived in Washington today, said he fully backed the attack. "Saddam Hussein's continuing provocation has been met by appropriate and forceful response," Clinton said in a statement. "I fully support President Bush's action."
Today's attack, which came on the second anniversary of the Persian Gulf war, followed a series of words and acts of defiance by Iraq. This morning, Saddam Hussein gave a fiery speech in which he proclaimed a "moral victory" in the 1991 Persian Gulf war
"This is the new chapter in the 'mother of all battles,' " the Iraqi leader said. "If the enemy continues its military aggression, or even if it stops, it is the final and decisive chapter which will be the end of all chapters."
After the attack, President Hussein addressed Iraqis again, this time on the radio, calling on them to "strike back" at the enemy.
 
Iraqis Challenge Allies
 As Iraq said it was prepared to use force to defy some of the restrictions imposed after the Gulf war, Iraqi military forces were challenging the allied enforcement of the no-flight zones.
Early this morning, an American F-4G Wild Weasel plane blew up an Iraqi SA-6 surface-to-air missile battery with a HARM antiradiation missile after the missile battery menaced allied warplanes patrolling the no-flight zone in northern Iraq. Pentagon officials said the SA-6 battery was attacked after it activated its targeting radar, directing it at five coalition fighters: two F-16's, two British Jaguars and a French Mirage F-1.
An hour and 40 minutes after the missile battery was destroyed, an Iraqi MIG-23 ventured into the northern no-flight zone and was shot down. A Pentagon officials said that the MIG flew about 10 miles into the northern no-flight zone and was being chased out of the area when it was shot down by an Amraam radar-guided missile fired from an F-16.
An official said the Iraqi MIG was several miles north of the 36th parallel, which marks the southern boundary of the northern no-flight zone, when it was hit. The plane crashed several miles south of the parallel.
 
Iraq-Kuwait Clash
 In addition, an Iraqi was killed by Kuwaiti border guards who, fortified by the deployment of an American battalion, have begun to challenge the Iraqi incursions into territory awarded to Kuwait by the United Nations.
After the air strikes, Kuwait said that Iraq had begun to dismantle six Iraqi police posts that marked the old border. But there was still no resolution over the confrontation between Baghdad and the United Nations over the conditions Iraq has imposed on the flights of weapons inspectors. Tonight, the special commission that monitors the demolition of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction rejected Baghdad's latest condition -- that allied air patrols stay out of the no-flight zone in southern Iraq when United Nations aircraft are in the area.
The multi-billion-dollar Zaafaraniya complex, which Pentagon officials said contains about two dozen buildings, covers an area of 2,200 by 900 feet. The complex, just north of the Tigris River and near the highway from Baghdad to Salman Pak, was not a target during the gulf war.
 
Uranium-Enrichment Process
 After the war, American intelligence learned that the computer-controlled machine tools at the complex were used to make components of the calutrons Iraq used to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. United Nations inspectors destroyed the calutrons, which were discovered after the war.
A calutron is used to separate uranium isotopes and produce enriched uranium. American intelligence officials said they were surprised to learn after the war that Iraq had attempted to use this relatively antiquated method to develop nuclear weapons.
Weapons inspectors have also been concerned that the machines at the Zaafaraniya complex may have been used to make components for Iraq's Scud surface-to-surface missiles, as well as a new ballistic missile that Iraq planned to develop that could carry a nuclear warhead.
Iraq has insisted the plant was merely an engineering complex used for civilian purposes.
Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the United Nations special commission that is overseeing the demolition of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said in a telephone interview that weapons and ballistic-missile inspectors have visited the complex four times. Seals have been put on some of the machines so that they could not be used without detection. But Mr. Ekeus said that he had no way of knowing if the machines had been used after inspectors visited the site late last year.
 
Concern Over Nuclear Program
 Mr. Ekeus said that the United Nations was concerned that Iraq might use the complex to revive its nuclear weapons programs. The machine tools, for example, could be used to manufacture parts of centrifuges for enriching uranium. The United Nations had planned to monitor the complex and was considering ordering the destruction of some of the equipment when today's strike was carried out.
Gary Milhollin, the director of the Wisconsin Project on Arms Control, said that today's attack was of more political than military significance.
"By knocking it out we are telling Saddam Hussein that his military infrastructure is on the target list," said Mr. Milhollin, who added the installation had advanced equipment that could be used for military or civilian purposes.
 
Little Effect Is Seen
 He asserted that the attack would probably not have much effect on the Iraqi nuclear program since Baghdad's efforts to use calutrons to enrich uranium have already been stopped and because the complex had been inspected.
But some American officials said that the complex gave Iraq the means to try to revive its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction. The Central Intelligence Agency recently warned that Iraq had not abandoned its efforts to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, for his part, appeared to undercut the military rationale for the attack when he said on the ABC News program "This Week" that Iraq's military infrastructure had been badly damaged in the gulf war and that the economic sanctions imposed after the war had denied Saddam Hussein the opportunity "to develop weapons of mass destruction."
But one Administration expert said that, along with economic sanctions, the destruction of the complex could deal an important setback to Iraq's nuclear ambitions. The machine tools would be useful for a variety of weapons purposes. If they were destroyed in the raid, the Administration specialists said, it is likely to be difficult, if not impossible, for Iraq to acquire replacements in the face of economic sanctions.
 
3 of 4 Targets Missed
 In Wednesday's strike on the southern no-flight zone, allied patrols damaged command posts and radar stations but missed three of four missile batteries that were among their targets.
Today's attack, though limited in scope like Wednesday's raid, brought the war to the outskirts of Baghdad.
With Mr. Clinton's inauguration 72 hours away, the decision to use cruise missiles, instead of manned aircraft, reflected the political imperative that no Americans pilots be shot down and captured in a raid over Iraq. The firing of more than 40 cruise missiles, however, entailed some risk of civilian casualties since it was possible that some of the unpiloted weapons might be shot down and others might stray off course.
The attack had been planned for last Friday, but was put on hold so that the allies could better assess whether Iraq intended to comply with the United Nations demands.
Several Administration officials said today that the decision to put the attack on hold followed a conversation between Prime Minister John Major and President Bush in which Mr. Major expressed concern over acting too precipitiously.
 
Advice From Major
 British spokesman declined today to say what advice Mr. Major had provided. Mr. Fitzwater acknowledged that the attack had been delayed but denied that Mr. Major's advice was the reason.
Declaring that Saddam Hussein has been "courting trouble" and now "has had trouble," Mr. Major said tonight that the United States cruise missile attack was undertaken with the full consultation and approval of Britain and its gulf war allies.
"If they will not comply, then there will be a response," the Prime Minister said, referring to the Iraqi Government's repeated refusal to adhere to Security Council resolutions.

HEADLINE: New Standard for Drug Makers: Proving the Cure Is Worth the Cost

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Later this month, the Synergen Corporation will complete clinical trials of a new biotechnology drug for treating sepsis, a deadly bacterial infection. With the spotlight on health-care costs, Synergen intends to show that its new molecule not only saves lives but also saves money over other sepsis treatments.
Drugs have long been held to just two standards -- safety and efficacy. But huge customers like insurance companies and health maintenance organizations are beginning to insist on a third: cost-effectiveness -- that is, whether one drug more than another can reduce hospital stays, say, or employee absenteeism.
 
Standard Gains Support
 The criterion is gaining sway with Government regulators and may be embraced by the Clinton Administration, which has vowed to make drug-price containment a cornerstone of its plan to cut the nation's health-care bill. 
 And perhaps the most conspicuous targets are the wonder drugs of biotechnology companies like Synergen, many of which can cost patients as much as $30,000 a year. The industry says its research and development as well as expensive manufacturing processes justify these prices.
Yet to prove that their products are worth the price, companies like Synergen are hiring new specialists called "pharmaco-economists," who have degrees in both economics and pharmacology and look at the cost-effectiveness and quality-of-life issues of drugs. Synergen has added two pharmaco-economists to its clinical research staff, and in the case of its antisepsis drug Antril, it decided to conduct cost-effectiveness tests alongside clinical trials rather than holding them after the drug received Federal approval, as is customary.
"Before we ever heard of Bill Clinton, before he was a Presidential candidate, I believed that in the 90's, just as sure as you had to prove safety and efficacy, you also would have to convince people that you are delivering economic value, and that even goes for life-saving therapies," said Jon S. Saxe, president and chief executive of Synergen, which is based in Boulder, Colo.
But measuring a drug's cost-effectiveness can be tricky. How does a company show the cost to society of, say, arthritis to prove that a remedy is worth its hefty price tag?
And some drug executives warn that regulating drug prices may not have the intended effect, even carrying potential bad side effects. Drugs account for only about 8 percent of total health-care spending and only 1 percent of gross national product, so cutting their prices may not make much of a dent in medical bills. While European countries regulate drug prices, they spend a far greater percentage of their health-care budget on drugs than does the United States, so containment has a greater impact.
In addition, drug makers warn, regulating prices could constrain the amount they spend on research and development, possibly hobbling an industry that is competitive worldwide and contributes significantly to United States exports. "Countries that have no price controls or limited controls have the greatest research efforts," said Bernard S. Bloom, a research professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine. "Countries with very strict controls have no research."
 
An Easy Political Target
 Yet because drug prices are one health-care cost that can be controlled, and because the industry's high profit margins are so visible, political pressure to restrain drug pricing is inevitable, economists say.
While the Food and Drug Administration does not use price as a criterion in approving a new drug, advisory panels of scientists that help the agency evaluate new types of therapies have started taking cost into consideration.
Earlier this year, the F.D.A. refused to approve another biotech drug for sepsis, Centoxin, made by Centocor Inc., primarily because the drug showed effectiveness only in a small subgroup of patients who could not be readily identified in advance. But the advisory panel that reviewed Centoxin indicated that the drug's high cost -- $3,750 a dose -- was also a factor.
Biotech companies shouldn't "get so enamored with their technology that they miss the point that this is a product," said Cynthia Robbins-Roth, publisher of Bioventure View, an industry newsletter. She recalled one panel member saying, "Cost is another form of toxicity."
Drug pricing reform is likely to come under the umbrella of managed competition, that is, the creation of an environment that fosters competition between different kinds of health-care providers. Managed competition "signals an era in which people in all parts of the health-care provider constellation are going to have to prove cost-effectiveness, not just clinical viability," said Jeremy Rosner, vice president for domestic policy with the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington.
Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of health economics at Princeton University, said drug purchases would increasingly be made by "mega-buyers" like health maintenance organizations or public health programs. That could subject prices to rigorous scrutiny.
"Public mega-buyers will be far more responsible in worrying about leaving the drug companies money for R.& D. than the private buyers, who will worry only about their own profit margins," Dr. Reinhardt said. "Once the H.M.O.'s are forced to compete on price, you can expect them to be fairly brutal with the drug companies."
 
Synergen Trials for Antril
 Synergen has not yet set a price for Antril, but judging from biotech patterns, it could cost at least $2,000 a dose. In its clinical trials, Synergen aimed to show that more sepsis patients survived when treated with Antril than those who had not taken the drug. Additionally, the company wanted to prove that treated patients spent less time in the hospital and less time in intensive care than those who were not treated, and therefore cost less.
"What we're trying to do is figure out what is the most efficient way to save a life," said Gilad S. Gordon, director of health sciences research at Synergen.
But the usefulness of these data is dubious. "Most of us feel it's worth paying thousands of dollars on the front end, if on the back end the patient's stay is reduced significantly," said Glenn Yokoyama, director of pharmacy at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. "But I have not seen any company so far that has shown that clearly. When you actually try to prove it in a clinical setting, it's very difficult to do."
While the length of a hospital stay may represent the costs of treating an acute illness like sepsis or a heart attack, finding reliable measures of costs of chronic disease like arthritis or diabetes can be difficult.
"Doing pharmaco-economic research is an art and a science," said Raymond J. Townsend, vice president of international applied health care research at Glaxo Inc. in Durham, N.C., a unit of Glaxo Holdings P.L.C. of London. With its new migraine drug, for example, Glaxo was able to show fewer lost work days and improved quality of life.
 
Proof Often Hard to Get
 But with some very expensive drugs and some very rare diseases, showing cost-effectiveness may be impossible, and some critics of the industry argue that these drugs should not be made.
That is the suggestion of a recent report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment on Genzyme Inc.'s Ceredase, a genetically engineered treatment for the rare enzyme deficiency called Gaucher's disease. The report estimates the cost of treating one patient with Ceredase at anywhere from $71,000 to $500,000 annually and notes that "cost considerations cannot be ignored in the development and diffusion of any treatment."
Genzyme officials said the cost of the drug for most patients fell between $20,000 and $60,000 a year and reflected high manufacturing costs, which could not be calculated in advance. "Ethically, you should not use cost to determine whether or not to develop a drug," said Alison Taunton-Rigby, Genzyme's senior vice president of therapeutics. "If there's a scientific way of treating a disease, we have to develop it, and we as a nation have to figure out how to pay for it."
Even when cost-effectiveness can be shown, it may not deflect criticism or persuade buyers to pay for a more expensive drug. "So what that you have proven cost-effectiveness," said Viren Mehta, analyst with Mehta & Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research. "Can you really get away with charging $3,500 per year, especially when your gross margins are 82 percent?"
Indeed, some critics of the industry deride the cost-effectivness argument as a red herring, a justification for charging high prices. Drug companies "have no shame in what they charge," said John Coster, an aide to Senator David Pryor of Arkansas, who has proposed legislation to reform drug pricing. "The price has no relation to the cost of production."

Chart/Table: "It Saves Lives, Can It Save Money?"
 Under pressure from insurers to market drugs that are not just safe and effective but also cost-effective, drug manufacturers are beginning to promote the efficiency of their products.
 For a drug called Antril, Synergen published a study indicating that despite an expected hith price tage, the drug can more than pay for itself by shortening the average hospital stay of sepsis* patients.

 	 	 	 	Standard			Average stay	treatment with	Survival	Average stay	in intensive	antibiotics plus:	rate	in hospital	care unit	 	 	 	 	No Antril	 	 	 	(a placebo instead)	56%	30.6 days	19.7	Small dose of Antril	 	 	 	(17 mg. an hour)**	68%	27.6	15.4	Medium dose	 	 	 	(67 mg. an hour) 	75%	27.5 	14.4	Large dose	 	 	 	(133 mg. an hour) 	83%	24.3 	11.7	
 
*Sepsis syndrome, popularly called blood poisoning, is a massive bacterial infection resulting from a serious injury or from infection during surgery, followed by a dangerous overreaction by the patient's immune system. It is frequently fatal; the length of stay data used in the study include only patients who survived the illness.

HEADLINE: RAID ON IRAQ;
Iraq's Gamble: Sharp Words, Dull Claws

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, Jan. 17

 BODY:
In choosing inauguration week for his latest challenge to the United States, President Saddam Hussein appears to be gambling on two things:
First, he hopes to demonstrate that the gulf war allies are not likely to go to war against Iraq again, and thus he may weaken the American-led coalition that crushed his forces two years ago. 
 Second, he hopes that in the long run, this high-stakes gamble will enable him to break the back of the sanctions that have nearly destroyed the Iraqi economy.
 
He's Still Standing
 Thus, in a blustery address to his people today, the Iraqi President sought to remind the world that on the second anniversary of the allies' war against Iraq, he has survived, while President Bush, his archenemy, is about to leave office.
But beyond these personal barbs, Mr. Hussein is believed to have concluded that many Arabs are uneasy about watching further punishment inflicted on Iraq in the name of the United Nations while, as he pointed out, non-Arab countries like Israel and Serbia flout United Nations resolutions.
This sentiment has been strong enough to cause Syria and Egypt, which joined the allies against Iraq in 1991, to express their "deep regret" at the allied air raids on Wednesday.
Mr. Hussein has miscalculated before. He thought he could quickly conquer Iran, and instead ended up with an eight-year standoff that bled his country. He also apparently thought he could snatch Kuwait without paying much of a price. Instead, he provoked the gulf war.
Now, he appears to be counting on the fact that other major trouble spots like Somalia and Bosnia have more resonance in the West. And he is clearly aware that President-elect Bill Clinton has set his priorities on the domestic economy.
Mr. Hussein, of course, is playing without much of a hand. His economy is in miserable shape, his military is severely weakened and his country is divided, with the Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south outside his tight control.
But another factor plays to his advantage: the rising challenge of Islamic fundamentalism and Iran's ability to help it along while Iraq is prevented from doing much to block it.
Even though Mr. Hussein started the Iran-Iraq war in 1980 by invading Iran, he was backed at the time by the Saudis and the Kuwaitis, who feared that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's revolutionary fervor might spread across the gulf.
Several Arab leaders, including close allies of the United States, openly express the view that the continuing bleeding of Iraq, and the possible breakaway by the Shiites in the south, where Iran wields great influence, will lend great momentum to the fundamentalist movement, which preoccupies nearly every Arab Government from Algeria to Saudi Arabia.
What diplomats here and elsewhere in the region marvel at, however, is the willingness of Mr. Hussein to bluster when Iraq is virtually a beggar. It has been deprived of oil income for more than two years and is running out of cash and goodwill. Iraqi currency has become worthless; food and spare parts are in short supply.
 
A Little Muscle Still Threatens
 "Every time he feels the pinch of the sanctions, he provokes another confrontation with the West," said Adel Darwish, a Middle East specialist in London.
Above all Saddam Hussein, the man, the leader, has no place to run. His enemies are too numerous.
"He is playing poker again," said an Iraqi dissident who has watched Mr. Hussein closely for years. "He is saying that anyone who wants to deal with Iraq has to deal with him on his terms, not theirs."
Although Mr. Hussein's miscalculations have been many and brutal, he may have sound reasons of late to believe that at a small cost, he can tilt the balance of power of the allies enough to get breathing space. His immediate objectives are to ease the sanctions and, of course, to stay in power.
 
Anti-Kuwait Oratory
 While fully aware that Iraq is not in any military position to intimidate its neighbors, he may believe he is still capable of keeping vulnerable Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait jumpy. The repeated Iraqi incursions into Kuwait in recent days have triggered a panic here, with Kuwaitis withdrawing their hard-currency accounts from the banks and many readying cars to flee to Saudi Arabia.
Perhaps because he was aware of the fragile nature of the Kuwaiti state, Mr. Hussein took particular aim at the Government here, saying Iraqis and Kuwaitis were "one people" and would ultimately be united.
He sought to inflame the Kuwaitis' distaste for the ruling family, which he described as a bunch of "robbers" who had turned Kuwait into "an oil company producing oil for the Sabah family" and had fled their country during the gulf war like "renters breaking a lease."
 
'Decisive Chapter'
 And he vowed that Iraq had the power to keep the region unstable, calling on Iraqis to make any battle to come a "final and decisive chapter that will be the end of all chapters."
While much of this can be discounted, there is an underlying message meant for the new Administration in Washington: while Iraq may indeed be down, President Hussein is still very much in control and will remain a thorn in the side of any inhabitant of the White House -- particularly one like Mr. Clinton, who has repeatedly said his priorities should be domestic.
The Iraqi ruler's speech was greeted with gloom by a Kuwaiti population still traumatized by the Iraqi invasion and further shocked by assertions from Mr. Clinton that he would be willing to seek normal relations with Iraq if President Hussein modified his behavior. Mr. Clinton and his aides have hastened to clarify those comments, saying they can see no chance of having good relations with Iraq while Mr. Hussein remains in charge, but the doubt has been sown in Kuwaitis' minds.
 
'A Big Chill'
 "Clinton's statements have cast a big chill over this whole country," said Ahmad al-Khatib, a physician and a member of Parliament and a leading figure among the Kuwaiti opposition.
Kuwaitis, like virtually all the Arabs along the Persian Gulf, look to President Bush for their security from both Iraq and Iran, taking it for granted that as long as Mr. Bush remained in the White House, he would make it his business to strip Mr. Hussein of power.
Thus, Mr. Bush's political defeat came as a deep shock to many in this region, a fact that Iraqi propaganda has not tired of emphasizing.

HEADLINE: Old Mill Pioneers Workers' Education

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLYOKE, Mass.

 BODY:
For 100 years, ever since Robert K. Fowler's great-great-uncle built a sprawling red brick paper mill here, the paper was colored in the same time-honored way. Machines fed rolls of white paper under flint stones taken from the nearby Connecticut River and slowly buffed color onto the paper.
All the workers had to know, recalled Mr. Fowler, now the president of Hampden Papers, was to punch the green button on the machine in the morning to start it and the red button in the evening to stop it. They did not have to know how to read or write. 
 But in recent years those machines have been replaced by computer-operated equipment that can turn out as much paper in a minute as the old ones did in an entire day. A mistake is now ruinously expensive, and Mr. Fowler came to realize that he needed workers who were more highly skilled.
So in 1988 he began two innovative education programs for his 185 employees. One program pays any worker to take classes within the factory to earn a high school equivalency degree. The other pays all the costs for any worker or executive to attend college or graduate school, including business and law school.
 
Father's Testimony
 Mr. Fowler is a pioneer among a small but growing number of businessmen who in the last few years have come to see that improving workers' education is critical to restoring America's economy.
Mr. Fowler, a soft-spoken 47-year-old man, worried at first that workers would balk at the programs. "It's kind of pulling your pants down to tell your boss you can't read," he said. But one day a machine operator approached him on the street, seized him by the collar and gave his own lecture about the importance of education.
"Have you ever considered what it's like to have to take your 10-year-old daughter with you to go shopping because you can't read?" the worker asked.
The worker education programs at Mr. Fowler's gritty, century-old factory exemplify one of the main plans advocated by President-elect Bill Clinton as a way to restore America's competitiveness and increase the number of high-skill, high-paying jobs.
 
Clinton's Emphasis
 Both Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have long been vigorous promoters of workplace education. Mrs. Clinton was co-chairwoman of the Commission on Skills of the American Work Force, a not-for-profit group that advocates increased education for workers. In Mr. Clinton's book, "Putting People First," which served as his economic platform during the Presidential campaign, he called for requiring all American companies with more than 50 employees to spend at least 1.5 percent of their annual payroll on training. If they did not, they would have to pay an equivalent amount into a Government fund that would be used for worker education.
Mr. Clinton's nominee for Secretary of Labor, Robert B. Reich, said at his Senate confirmation hearings on Jan. 7 that he would push for the 1.5 percent target. Mr. Reich, a lecturer on public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, has made the need to upgrade the skills of American workers a central theme in many of his writings.
Mr. Reich has indicated to colleagues at Harvard that the new Administration may move slowly on imposing the 1.5 percent spending target, seeing if companies voluntarily comply. He is said to be concerned that the added cost to business could interfere with a speedy economic recovery and would further complicate the Clinton team's efforts to reduce the deficit.
 
Trailing Europe
 But Anthony P. Carnevale, president of the Institute for Workplace Learning, an industry-financed group based in Washington, says American industry will have to move in the direction of increased financing if workplace education is to survive. "The basic logic of competition is taking us there," he said.
The United States is "at the low end of all industrial countries in spending on training," Mr. Carnevale continued, especially on front-line workers like those at Hampden Papers, many of whom have not finished high school. France and Australia already require employers to spend 1.5 percent of their annual payroll on worker education, and German companies spend an average of 4 percent a year, he said.
American companies spend 1.02 percent of their payroll on training, Mr. Carnevale said, or about $30 billion, and that is concentrated in an elite 10 percent of "the most progressive companies."
In addition, the great bulk of this education spending goes for things like executive seminars in Palm Beach, Fla., or courses for engineers, managers or sales people, Mr. Carnevale said.
 
Revising the Bottom Line
 What is driving the need for greater education, Mr. Carnevale said, is not only increasingly sophisticated technology that workers must handle, but also the organization of the workplace. Now, with growing global competitiveness, American factories can no longer succeed only on low costs, but must also pay attention to quality, service and innovation, all of which require more skilled workers, he said.
Hampden Papers in Holyoke, a battered 19th-century mill town in western Massachusetts, might seem an unlikely candidate to be on the cutting edge of innovation. From the outside the factory is indistinguishable from other aged brick plants nearby, some of which are deserted. Its product, colored paper for match boxes, book covers and wrapping paper, is not a high-tech business.
 
Class Near Factory Floor
 But Mr. Fowler has read widely about the problems with American manufacturing and seized on a grant from the administration of former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to begin the education programs.
Mr. Fowler hired a private teaching organization in Northampton and, to prevent embarrassment of workers, ordered that test scores not be shared with the company. The classroom is a large, crisply painted room set off from the main factory floor and equipped with three personal computers. The 18 workers now enrolled can drop by anytime in the afternoon for individual instruction from the two teachers. They must put in a regular work day, but the company pays for time spent in the classroom.
Mr. Fowler is often asked how his education programs are affecting the company's bottom line. "I can measure the cost," he replies -- 1.97 percent of his overall payroll. "But it is tricky to measure the benefits."
Still, that does not bother him. "I believe in it; we need better trained workers," Mr. Fowler said. Then he had to go. Like 25 of the plant's 75 managers and technicians, he was off to an evening class, under the company's college reimbursement plan. "To practice what I preach," he said, he has enrolled in law school at Western New England College in Springfield.

HEADLINE: Despite Critics Right and Left, Mandela Pushes Talks With de Klerk

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Nelson Mandela, the president of the African National Congress, said today that mounting alarm about South Africa's economy had created a new sense of urgency that he believes will bring the end of white rule this year.
In an hourlong interview before he left for Washington for the inauguration of President-elect Bill Clinton, Mr. Mandela brushed aside one by one the obstacles that have made some politicians pessimistic about the path ahead. 
 These include sharp differences with the Government on details of the new order, resistance from leaders of some black homelands, threats of violence from the white and black fringes, an army and police force that Mr. Mandela still regards as hostile to black rule and the restiveness of more militant members of his own organization.
 
Dissent Within
 Mr. Mandela defended the A.N.C.'s plan to share power indefinitely with the white minority after elections, a concession that has ignited dissent -- most recently from his estranged wife, Winnie Mandela -- and complaints that he is giving away too much.
"We know how to handle pressure and heat," he said when asked about the danger of losing his grass-roots following by seeming to be too solicitous of white concerns.
Mr. Mandela's buoyant mood reflects a new marriage of expediency with President F. W. de Klerk after repeated breakdowns in negotiations and periods of recrimination.
The anti-apartheid leader said the delays "drummed into the minds" of him and other politicians the danger that a three-year recession and the wariness of foreign investors would leave a new democratic Government with no means to begin satisfying the expectations of the black majority.
Mr. Mandela and Mr. de Klerk have agreed to push for the country's first nonracial elections by the end of the year, or early in 1994 at the latest. Voters would chose an assembly to write a new constitution and serve as an interim parliament.
Mr. Mandela, 74, said he did not intend to seek an assembly seat or any interim post, preferring to campaign for the presidency after a permanent constitution is in place, which is not expected before 1995 or 1996.
"It would be wrong for the president of an organization to get himself bogged down in details of government when it is an interim government, instead of building his organization for the final election," he said.
By remaining outside the interim parliament, Mr. Mandela would also remain a symbol of the fact that majority rule was not yet complete.
 
An Appeal to Clinton
 While Mr. Mandela is in Washington this week, emissaries from the A.N.C. and the de Klerk Government are to meet to cinch agreements on the mechanics of transition. The Government and the leading black organization would then go to multiparty talks as a united front, where they would try to win over such skeptics as Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party.
Mr. Mandela said his "high expectations" for the year had been enhanced by the election of Mr. Clinton, who is expected to listen attentively to Mr. Mandela. The black leader said that in his two telephone conversations with the President-elect, he had appealed for help in keeping the transition smooth, but he declined to say just what kind of help he expected.
Despite President de Klerk's purge last month of 23 military officers suspected of conspiring to sabotage the transition, Mr. Mandela said he did not believe the Government had brought its security forces under control.
"It's not just a question of removing generals, it's a question of removing the whole structure," he said, adding that the A.N.C. would insist that the police and army be put under multiparty control during the period leading up to elections.
 
A Conciliatory Gesture
 In a move to alleviate the fears of the white minority, the congress agreed late last year after fierce internal debate that if it won the election, it would invite the losing parties into a coalition government for an indeterminate period. Mr. Mandela said today that such a promise was necessary to prevent a "counterrevolution" by white civil servants and security forces, and to assure foreign investors of a stable economic climate.
"When we win an election, we don't then gain power," Mr. Mandela said. "We merely hold political office. To gain power means that we should have control of the civil service, of the South African police, of the South African Defense Force, of business. That is going to take some time for us to achieve."
Mr. Mandela said powersharing must not be enshrined in the constitution, but would be at the invitation of the winning party, and would continue as long as necessary. Some congress leaders have said powersharing would last 5 to 10 years, but Mr. Mandela declined to give a time frame.
 
A Wife's Opposition
 "How long it is going to take us to inspire foreign investors with confidence to invest in our country is something only a prophet can predict," he said.
The agreement has already come under fire from more militant members of the congress, including Mrs. Mandela, who in a funeral homily 10 days ago denounced any powersharing arrangement "between the elite of the oppressed and the oppressors."
Mr. Mandela contended the issue had been fully debated and "there has not been a ripple, in so far as the masses of the people are concerned."
"Why attach such importance if poor Comrade Winnie expresses a view she believes in?" he said.

HEADLINE: Envoy Says Haiti's Military Agrees to Allow a U.N. Observer Force

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Jan. 17

 BODY:
After two days of talks here, a special United Nations envoy said today that the Haitian military had agreed to the use of hundreds of civilian observers as part of a process that the diplomat said was aimed at restoring the rule of law and the country's democratically elected President.
Diplomats described the agreement as the biggest breakthrough in negotiations since Haiti was thrown into turmoil and economic isolation by the ouster and exile of the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a violent military coup in September 1991. 
 The United Nations envoy, Dante Caputo, said that a United Nations observer force could begin arriving in Haiti as early as this week, and thus relieve an atmosphere of harsh repression that has contributed to an exodus of refugees and posed a potential immigration crisis for both the old and new Administrations in Washington.
Diplomats said as many as 500 United Nations observers might be used and that the Haitian military had agreed to let them roam freely.
 
Previous Monitors Restricted
 Last year the military allowed a group of human rights monitors to enter the country but stymied their efforts by confining them to the capital, Port-au-Prince.
Mr. Caputo said he expected serious negotiations on the restoration of full democracy to begin within two weeks.
"I have agreement on one central point: that the violence can no longer be the system for settling political problems in this country," Mr. Caputo said. "And to stop the violence, we must have the rule of law."
Officials involved in the diplomatic efforts cautioned that if democracy was to be restored to Haiti, United Nations involvement would have to last years. The challenges include ending violence by soldiers against a cowed population, preventing acts of vengeance by Father Aristide's persecuted supporters and other victims, and helping to rebuild Haiti's impoverished economy and shattered institutions.
Diplomats said a serious threat to the weekend talks had been averted when hard-line former army officers, plotting with elements of the far right, tried but failed to overthrow the current military leadership on Friday.
Late this afternoon another obstacle appeared to be removed when Haiti's pro forma civilian Government delivered a letter to Mr. Caputo signaling that it, too, would allow the use of the United Nations observers.
In a telephone interview, a senior Bush Administration official, Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, described the agreement as "a very important breakthrough."
"There are many issues which still need to be resolved, but barring some catastrophe, this may well be the beginning of the end of the Haitian political crisis," he said.
Because the prospects for a settlement seem promising, the Clinton Administration has asked Mr. Aronson to remain in his post for now.
The Haitian Government refused to grant a request by Mr. Caputo to cancel or postpone some Senate elections scheduled for Monday that have been described as illegitimate by the United States and United Nations.
Diplomats in Port-au-Prince said that while the Haitian authorities appeared to be cooperating more eagerly than had been expected with the United Nations-led diplomacy, the elections could yield serious obstacles to a settlement by packing the legislature with opponents of Father Aristide.
Mr. Caputo said he had warned military and civilian leaders here that with letters of accord in hand, the United Nations viewed their cooperation as part of a contract, "and if you don't respect it, there will be consequences."
Although Haiti's military and civilian leaders have formally agreed only on the use of observers here and the need for political negotiations, diplomats said that the broad outlines of a political settlement, previously endorsed by Father Aristide, were already in place.
Several diplomats said they expected to conclude discussions within weeks on forming a new consensus government led by a figure from Father Aristide's opposition group who would be chosen in consultation with the exiled President. A trade embargo imposed on Haiti by the Organization of American States after the coup would be lifted and President Aristide would be allowed to return.
 
Ouster of Aristide
 Father Aristide, a leftist priest with strong support from Haiti's rural poor, was overthrown in September 1991 after less than eight months in office. He was the first freely elected President in a country that had known decades of dictatorship.
The timing of Father Aristide's return and the future of the army commander, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, whose punishment or exile has been demanded by the deposed President, have been deferred until progress is made in other areas, diplomats said.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: An Impatient Public;
Letting Go of Hope as Clinton Softens Pledges

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ

DATELINE: RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Mo., Jan. 17

 BODY:
Four years after they installed George Bush as President, people here will watch the inauguration of his replacement this week, celebrating more Mr. Bush's ouster than Bill Clinton's ascendancy. They hope for improvement even as they are filled with cynicism.
Without any prompting in conversations over the last four days, voters here cited the campaign pledges that Mr. Clinton already seemed to be pulling back on, like a tax cut for the middle class and easing the immigration of Haitians. Some people were angry about that. But most seem resigned, with looks that said, "What else did you expect?" 
 "America wanted Slick Willie; now it's got Slick Willie," said Charles Chimento, a 56-year-old farmer who voted for Mr. Bush and was on his way home from St. Louis to Springfield, Ill. "Look how he's hedging on his promises. He said he would change things; then he names all these old Carter people."
Roy Goldsmith, a 39-year-old lawyer, put it this way: "They say you should vote issues, not personalities. But politicians lie on the issues. I knew Clinton wouldn't keep his promises when I voted for him."
 
Clinton in Past Tense
 In conversations with 75 people in this St. Louis suburb that is a mix of blue- and white-collar workers, some even spoke of Mr. Clinton in the past tense, as if the promising reformer were already dead, corrupted by the very act of assuming the Presidency.
"Clinton had a lot of charisma," said Tami Rigdon, 24, who sells cosmetics and still has a Clinton bumper sticker on her car. "He seemed sincere. I liked him. In my heart, I wanted him to be different. But I've lost hope in the government system."
To be sure, many people cling to hope despite the cynicism. For one thing, they said, it is too soon to pass definitive judgment. For another, even the most skeptical genuinely want Mr. Clinton to succeed. They sounded like people with a fatal illness, who, in the face of overwhelming odds, hold out hope because they have to.
"I'm optimistic because you've got to be optimistic," said Steve Kirchner, 38, a farmer.
 
Annoyance With Bush
 If there was a slight upbeat feeling about the economy -- and there was -- it flowed not so much from Mr. Clinton's arriving as from Mr. Bush's departing. The opinion of Mr. Bush has gone from bad to worse compared with similar interviews here and throughout the country during the campaign. There was some praise for his recent confronting of Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But it was not high on people's lists. Mr. Bush, once seen as merely out of touch and ineffectual has become a laughingstock. People seem annoyed that he has hung around, as if he should have moved out the day after Election Day.
"It doesn't surprise me that Clinton's pulling back on some of his promises," said Sally Miller, 39, who coordinates the sale of cosmetics for half a dozen stores. "But even if he follows through on only a tiny portion, it's an improvement. There's nowhere to go but up."
That is what passes for optimism these days. But even those who voice that modest hope are impatient. They had wanted a bolt of lightning from Mr. Clinton. They have yet to see it, and his time is running out. He has had his honeymoon, they seem to believe. After all, they forgave him for the rumors about having an affair with Gennifer Flowers and efforts to avoid the draft. Now, after watching him talk about the issues for a year, they say it is time to get on with it.
"I think Clinton wants to do what he said he wants to do," said Rodney Jones, the 26-year-old manager of a Brentano's bookstore, who voted for the Arkansas Democrat. "But people want a fix now. N-O-W. Immediately."
 
Economy Still Main Concern
 Half a dozen people raised Mr. Clinton's call for allowing open homosexuals in the military, with some supporting it and others opposing it. But all said that it was not an important issue and that Mr. Clinton was getting bogged down in what could be resolved later.
During the campaign, the economy -- particularly job creation -- was the No. 1 issue raised in interviews with a thousand voters throughout the country. It still was here over the last few days. But when asked what one promise they most hoped Mr. Clinton would keep, more than a third named revising the health-care system. That is a big increase from the campaign, when the issue was raised mostly as an afterthought.
But while health care seems to be rising in importance, the deficit seems to be declining. So effective was Ross Perot's haranguing about the deficit in his television commercials during the campaign, that many people specifically said "the deficit," not "the economy," when asked about their main concern. But in the conversations here, the deficit was hardly mentioned, probably because people are not seeing Mr. Perot on television pounding it into them.
Yet Mr. Perot himself seems to have regained some ground. Just before his strong showing in the first debate, he was ridiculed here. But over the last few days, there was no ridicule. Many people seemed glad to have him out there, keeping an eye on things. Not one person said he would definitely send money to United We Stand, the group that sprang from Mr. Perot's campaign, but a few said they were thinking about it. Not one made fun of the notion of giving money to a group associated with a billionaire.
 
Criticism About School
 On Election Day, Mr. Perot did about the same in St. Louis County, the suburban area that borders the city of St. Louis but does not include it, as he did nationwide. So did the other candidates. Mr. Perot got 20 percent of the county's vote to 44 percent for Mr. Clinton and 35 for Mr. Bush.
"I'm not sure I would call Clinton a liar on his campaign promises," said Pat Bahre, 58, a librarian who voted for Mr. Perot. "I would say he was whistling in the dark." Asked if she would send money to United We Stand, she said, "I just might."
Of the 75 people interviewed, only two, both black, said they were annoyed that the Clintons were sending their daughter, Chelsea, to a private school, which they said was a slight at primarily black inner-city schools. "It's hypocritical," Zaki Baruti, 45, an educator, said of the decision about Chelsea as he cited Mr. Clinton's pledge to improve education.
But it is a measure people's cynicism and lack of faith in government's ability to do anything, including educate their children, that the overwhelming majority of people, including blacks, supported the Clintons' decision.
 
Eyes on Bush
 "Let's face it, the schools are a joke," said Arvis Martin, a 32-year-old black woman who voted for Mr. Clinton. She looked at her 6-month-old son, Donald and added, "I'm sending him to parochial school."
Most people could rattle off a quick list of issues on which Mr. Clinton has wavered since the campaign, discussing them in one word or phrase: Haiti, middle-class tax cut. Most knew there had been some dispute over Mr. Clinton's nominee for Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, and his connection, as a former lobbyist, to special-interest groups.
But their knowledge was paper thin. That was in contrast to during the campaign, when people followed issues in depth. Over the last few days, many people said they had gotten their information not even from a few minutes on the evening news but from the split-second news blips between prime-time shows.
Most people said they would try to get to television sets to watch the actual swearing in of Mr. Clinton on Wednesday. They seemed to feel that they had genuinely been part of history, that this will be their moment. But again, their joy is not so much in Mr. Clinton's victory as in Mr. Bush's defeat.
"I want to see the look on his face," said Jackie Aherron. She voted for Mr. Clinton but was referring to Mr. Bush. Then came the line, a variation of which was repeated in other conversations here and has been repeated in interviews since the beginning of the election season. It is a line that brings an indescribable look of satisfaction to the faces of the many who utter it.
"Now it's time," Ms. Aherron said, "to read our lips."

HEADLINE: Anniversary Stirs Hawaii Sovereignty Movement

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONOLULU, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Sam Kaina stood among a crowd before Iolani Palace, his hands on the shoulders of his 7-year-old son and tears in his eyes after watching a re-enactment of the 1893 overthrow of Hawaii's last monarch, Queen Lili'uokalani.
"There are deep-down, gut-wrenching emotions," said Mr. Kaina, 35, who compared his feelings to those he had experienced as a boy watching the funeral procession for President John F. Kennedy. "There is a big sense of loss." 
 Thousands of native Hawaiians rallied at the palace over a five-day period that ended today, marking the 100th anniversary of the overthrow of the Queen. The anniversary has become a rallying point for a growing number of people who trace some part of their ancestry to those who inhabited the islands before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778.
 
Variations on Sovereignty
 Today's rally drew about 12,000 members of dozens of organizations advocating some form of sovereignty for the roughly 216,000 native Hawaiians among the state's one million residents. While a tiny minority demand independence for the islands, most favor a sovereignty modeled on the tribal independence of American Indians.
Organizers began marking the anniversary 17 years ago, drawing more supporters to rallies each year.
This week's events included a 100-hour vigil outside the old stone palace, which was swathed in black cloth. Hawaiians in traditional garb, who stood on the spot across from the palace where United States marines took up positions during the overthrow, blew mournful notes from a conch shell, the symbol of the Hawaiian monarchy. Visitors to a temporary shrine placed flower garlands and fruit near photographs of the Queen.
Most of the demonstrators said they backed a decision by Gov. John Waihee 3d, the state's first governor of Hawaiian ancestry, to remove the United States flag from state buildings in Honolulu during the five-day commemoration.
The Governor's decision was attacked by veterans organizations as unpatriotic, and on Saturday two men appeared at the palace waving an American flag.
 
'It's Everyone's Issue'
 Like most people who consider themselves native Hawaiians, the people in the crowd on Sunday appeared to be of mixed ancestry: brown-skinned, full-bodied people with hints of Japanese, Filipino or Chinese blood. Dozens of non-Hawaiians, including students from the University of Hawaii and longtime residents, joined the demonstrators.
"It's everyone's issue," said Carl Arnemann, a former Chicagoan who was in Hawaii job hunting. "If you feel it's not your issue, you're dividing yourself from the rest of humanity."
But even native Hawaiians remain divided over the sovereignty issue, with many saying they are happy with their lives.
The largest of the pro-sovereignty organizations, Ka Lahui Hawaii, favors the American Indian model of sovereignty. The organization, which has written a constitution and elected representatives, claims 14,000 members.
 
Calls for Independence
 But a small number of native Hawaiians say justice demands total independence.
"The U.S. has to withdraw, just like the U.S. was forced to withdraw from the Philippines," said Dr. Richard Kekuni Blaisdell, who favors a gradual restoration of independence through treaties with the United States.
Until the morning of Jan. 17, 1893, Hawaii was a constitutional monarchy with diplomatic relations with England, Japan, the United States and much of the rest of the world.
Then white businessmen, concerned that the Queen was about to break their political stranglehold on Hawaiian government, staged a bloodless coup and appealed to the United States for annexation. A detachment of 168 Marines came ashore from a gunboat to back the coup.
 
A Native Underclass
 Today, Hawaiian nationalists say the ensuing 100 years of rule by outsiders have left Hawaiians shortchanged in their own land.
According to the state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs, native Hawaiians are more likely to be poor, unemployed or jailed than the average Hawaii resident. Infant mortality among native Hawaiians is 28 percent higher than the state average. Only one in 12 native Hawaiians earns a college degree, compared with more than one in five of all residents.
"People ask me, 'Why sovereignty?' " said Kaleikoa Ka'eo, 26, a juvenile counselor who helped organize the rally. "I say to them, 'Do I want my people to live like this, or do I want a better future?' "

HEADLINE: Incinerator Trial Is Blocked, Leading to Test of New Administration

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
A Federal district judge in Ohio has blocked the owners of the nation's newest hazardous-waste incinerator from conducting a series of tests that would lead to full commercial operation later this year.
Judge Ann Aldridge of Federal District Court in Cleveland issued a temporary restraining order late Friday night that barred Von Roll Inc., a Swiss company, from starting trial burning at its incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, on Saturday. 
 The suit was filed by the Government Accountability Project, a public interest legal group in Washingon acting on behalf of residents of the Ohio Valley and the environmental group Greenpeace. The group has also managed to block, at least temporarily, the incineration of toxic wastes in a project approved by Gov. Bill Clinton at an abandoned pesticide factory in Jacksonville, Ark.
In the East Liverpool case, the group had unsuccessfully sought an injunction in November from a Federal district judge in West Virginia, Frederick Stamp, who had been handling the case. It then turned to Judge Aldridge, who will hold another hearing on Friday to determine whether to lift her order or issue a permanent injunction.
Her decision simultaneously ends the Bush Administration's efforts to license the $160 million Von Roll incinerator and gives the incoming President and Vice President the first test of how they will balance their goals of reducing threats to the environment and rebuilding the economy. The outcome of the struggle in East Liverpool could also provide an early indication of the influence of Vice President-elect Al Gore on such issues. Mr. Gore has voiced skepticism about the safety of incineration.
The Von Roll incinerator, if approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, would burn 60,000 tons of chemical wastes a year as one of the largest of the 53 commercial hazardous-waste incinerators in operation in the United States. The plant, the first industrial site built in the upper Ohio Valley in a generation, would employ 125 people and generate $4 million a year in property, income and sales taxes for the city and the state, Von Roll executives say.
"This is exactly what Clinton and Gore had in mind when they talked about new environmental industries and new jobs," Jeffrey R. Zelik, the 36-year-old manager of Von Roll, said in a telephone interview today. "A signal to delay or shut this plant down would certainly discourage investment in any industrial facility because none of them -- auto plants, steel plants, chemical plants -- would have lower emissions than ours."
But the incinerator's location near the center of one of East Liverpool's most populated neighborhoods and in a region known for its dirty air has prompted protests. Opponents worry that the plant will release thousands of pounds of hazardous pollutants, though operators say the material will be safely dispersed by the air. Last month, following up on a campaign promise, Mr. Gore directed the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to examine how Von Roll acquired its construction permits from the E.P.A.
Mr. Gore also asked the Bush Administration to delay issuing the company a permit for trial burning until the investigation was completed. The Bush Administration, however, has insisted that the incinerator is safe, and on Jan. 8, the E.P.A. approved the trial.
Opponents of the plant said they hoped Mr. Gore would intervene and withdraw the approval for the incinerator's trials. "This is really a test for what kind of Vice President he will make," said Sandra Estel, who lives with her husband and five children in a house less than 1,000 feet from the incinerator. "Was this a real campaign promise or does it mean he used this issue just to get elected?"
The interest in the incinerator at the top levels of the Government also attracted the attention of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
Last week, at a hearing on the nomination of Carol M. Browner to be the next E.P.A. Administrator, two Democratic members of the panel, Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, expressed concern about the safety of the incinerator and asked Ms. Browner what she would do with Von Roll's application for a permit for full commercial operation. Ms. Browner said she would wait until the Congressional investigation was completed in February or March before making a decision.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: A Lecture for Clinton;
Inauguration or Not, Jackson Is Driven by the Agenda of Dr. King

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LORTON, Va., Jan. 17

 BODY:
For a master of political symbolism, it was not a place, a moment or a message lightly chosen. As the capital prepared to inaugurate its first Democratic President in 12 years, and observe the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the same week, the Rev. Jesse Jackson was on the outside, highlighting unfinished business.
The guards broke up when Mr. Jackson stopped at the security checkpoint at the Lorton correctional institution on a chilly afternoon last week, threw up his hands and declared that he was carrying "nothing but the Holy Ghost." The joking stopped when he climbed to the stage, confronted his audience of young black men and began to interpret the legacy of Dr. King, mournful and proud but also angry. 
 "He did not die that you should be here," Mr. Jackson said, and the young men listened, unreadable and still.
His message to the inmates of Lorton, the sprawling prison for the District of Columbia, is one he is carrying to other audiences this week, an appropriate one, he said, for this season of King memorials.
"The behavior of the oppressed is an issue to confront," he said in an interview.
 
The Kinds of Shackles
 From the prison stage, he put it: "There are times when we've been held down by the man from without; other times, we've been held down by the lack of man from within. You've got to be sober. You've got to be sane. You've got to be sensitive. You've got to be clear."
He spoke of the way Dr. King spent his last birthday, his 39th, in 1968, reveling in his children -- "raising the babies he made" -- then heading off to an organizational meeting for a national campaign on behalf of poor people. "He didn't spend his day sleeping late, or hanging," Mr. Jackson said.
Mr. Jackson rarely gets criticized for preaching self-help and personal responsibility, a philosophy that costs the politicians little. But he has a lecture for the incoming Administration as well. If Ross Perot is the self-appointed goad to insure that Mr. Clinton lives up to his pledge to cut the deficit, Mr. Jackson says he will hold the new President to his promise of a massive public-investment program. Given his adversarial relationship with Mr. Clinton during the campaign, it is a role Mr. Jackson takes on with considerable ease.
"There are those who say, 'Trash the covenant, get on with the business of governing,' " Mr. Jackson said, mocking those who see nobility in anything done in the name of the deficit. But he argued that the "new covenant" Mr. Clinton campaigned on last year was binding -- as binding as the promises of racial and economic reform made by past Democratic Presidents, from Carter to Johnson to Kennedy. "We had a large deficit, and a $4 trillion debt, during the campaign," Mr. Jackson noted, dismissing the Clinton forces' argument that the deficit had suddenly worsened. "This is not new."
 
Looks to Justice Dept.
 Mr. Jackson said he also expected a Democratic Justice Department to stand with him in the fight against "voter impediments" like runoff primaries. He has long argued that such procedures, which are common in the South and require a second election when no candidate receives a majority of the vote, discriminate against blacks.
And, he said, he expects this Democratic Administration to look after the interests of American workers in trade agreements.
"We must not have our expectations lowered," he said. "We must have high expectations."
On Monday, the official King holiday, Mr. Jackson will be in Atlanta, receiving the Martin Luther King Jr. Nonviolent Peace Prize. Coretta Scott King announced his selection and described him as "carrying forward my husband's unfinished work."
Mr. Jackson said he is comfortable in his present role, his present place. "I've been a social-change agent all of my adult life," he said, after he drove away from the inaugural viewing stands and all the appurtenances of a returning Democratic government. "I am in that tradition."

HEADLINE: Disputes on U.S. Trade Grow in Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 15

 BODY:
Government officials here are speaking openly about taking a harder line against American trade demands even as Japan's most famous business figure, Akio Morita, the co-founder of the Sony Corporation, has been warning that Tokyo is "inviting its own economic decline" by resisting further openings in the economy.
The arguments mirror a rift here between those who view the beginning of the Clinton Administration as a time for Japan to dig in its heels, and those who fear Japan is losing an opportunity to defuse trade tensions with the United States. At its core, it is an argument over which country will change its own economy to look more like the other's. 
 The conflict became more vivid last week when Mr. Morita, who is a top official of Japan's most influential business group, the Keidanren, published an unusually strong essay contending that "Japan itself has become a fortress."
Sounding at times like American trade negotiators, Mr. Morita complained that Japan had been dragging its feet in opening its markets and said that "what changes it has made have been piecemeal, caused by direct foreign pressure."
A day after Mr. Morita's article appeared in one of Japan's most influential monthly magazines, Bungei Shunju, the Foreign Ministry's chief spokesman, Masamichi Hanabusa, told reporters that "two-thirds to three-quarters of the problems" between Japan and the United States were "of American making" and that the Clinton Administration would be wise to "move in a way to reflect that reality."
Mr. Hanabusa spoke of Japan's emerging "as an equal partner" with the United States during the next administration, "asserting itself a little more strongly."
 
Ready for Partnership?
 The same phrase was used in a recent article by Yukio Satoh, one of the chief architects of Japanese foreign policy toward the United States. Mr. Satoh, director of the North America division of the Foreign Ministry, wrote that "the coming of the Clinton Administration appears to provide a good opportunity to develop U.S.-Japan relations into a new and truly equal partnership." But he worried about whether Japan was prepared to "seize this opportunity."
Indeed, in Tokyo in recent weeks American officials have openly worried that Japan is setting itself up for a bad start with the new Administration by failing to step forward with concrete plans to reduce the widening trade surplus and to reverse an unexpected decline in the purchase of American-made goods. The departing American Ambassador here, Michael H. Armacost, reportedly warned Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa recently that it would be a big mistake to meet Mr. Clinton for the first time with "an empty briefcase."
The comments by Mr. Morita were somewhat surprising, in part because he was a member of an advisory panel that recently suggested several "emergency response measures" in case the United States acted unilaterally to limit the sale of Japanese goods. Several years ago he was also the co-author of a much-discussed book, "The Japan That Can Say No," which advocated standing up to American pressure more forcefully.
But for more than a year Mr. Morita has been pressing for faster and more extensive changes in the Japanese economy. In his most recent article, he said that "if there will be problems in creating a common foundation for free competition among Japan, the United States" and the European Community. "I fear that it is Japan where the most difficulty will be found," he said.
"We should lend an ear," he wrote, "to the criticism that Japan in itself has become a fortress." The country, he said, "has encased itself in a hard shell and does not try at all to come out of that shell; Japan grandly subscribes to theories and procedures that have no acceptance in any other part of the world."
It is unclear how many in the Japanese business community subscribe to Mr. Morita's view; he is sometimes regarded as more influential abroad than at home. But there is an emerging view that Japan must reduce its economic reliance on the United States and increase its role in Asia.

HEADLINE: Taiwan, Winning New Friends, Hopes for Another One in Clinton

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
With relations between the United States and Taiwan already improving, Taiwan is hoping for even more from the Clinton Administration.
As Arkansas Governor, Bill Clinton visited Taiwan four times, and a photo of him during one visit hangs in the Foreign Ministry. 
 "He is one of the few leaders in the U.S. who has extensive knowledge of us," Foreign Minister Fredrick F. Chien said of Mr. Clinton. Mr. Chien said he hoped that the new Administration would permit more contacts between American and Taiwan officials, and would loosen the restrictions on Taiwan's representative offices in the United States.
Taiwan also hopes that Mr. Clinton will permit President Lee Teng-hui to pay a private visit to the United States. Mr. Lee is a Cornell University graduate, but the United States, Japan and most other countries have refused to allow him to visit for fear of provoking the wrath of Beijing.
Already in the last few years Taiwan has enjoyed better relations with many other countries, a sharp contrast with a half-dozen years when it was one of the loneliest places in the world.
 
No Longer Forlorn
 It stood by, forlorn and envious, as foreign countries one by one transferred their diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. It sulked as foreign leaders placated China by refusing to visit Taipei and even by banning direct flights to Taiwan.
All that has changed. Instead of whirling downward on a trajectory to diplomatic oblivion, Taiwan is increasing its contacts with the rest of the world. This is stirring anger and alarm in China, and wrangles over Taiwan are proving to be a growing source of tension between Beijing and Western capitals.
"The international environment is more in our favor now, compared with a few years ago," said John H. Chang, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs.
A booming economy is behind Taiwan's diplomatic resurgence. After three decades of breakneck economic growth, Taiwan now has a per capita income of nearly $10,000, plus foreign exchange reserves of $84 billion -- the highest in the world.
 
Two Big Steps by U.S.
 Lured by the economic bounty of Taiwan contracts, the Bush Administration took two important steps in recent months to improve economic ties with Taiwan.
In September, President Bush infuriated Beijing by agreeing to sell up to 150 F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. And in December, the Administration sent its trade representative to Taipei, marking the first visit by an American cabinet-level official to Taiwan since 1979.
In another sign of changing times, the United States Supreme Court in October let stand an appeals court ruling that Taiwan should be treated as an independent country. The little-noticed ruling, in a copyright case, contravenes the official policy of the United States, but it underscores the perplexities of figuring out just what Taiwan is.
Other countries are also slapping Taiwan on the back these days, mostly with an eye on its pocket book. France is selling $3 billion worth of fighter jets and missiles to Taiwan's Air Force, and Germany and the Netherlands are considering major weapons sales as well. Australia and New Zealand have established direct flights to Taiwan, and Russia is discussing an exchange of offices as part of its courtship of Taiwan investment.
 
Recognized by 29 Nations
 In 1979, just 21 countries had formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, as Taiwan calls itself, but now the number has risen to 29. Taiwan has lost its more important diplomatic partners -- just this fall, South Korea transferred recognition from Taipei to Beijing -- but it is glad to have formal diplomatic relations with a growing number of countries, even if they are the likes of Tonga, Belize and other specks on the map.
These diplomatic links at least give Taiwan some international status. "If no countries recognize us, then we will be another Hong Kong," said Mr. Chang, the Deputy Foreign Minister.
Some leaders in Taiwan seem to want to position the island as an entity analogous to South Korea or the former West Germany: as a sovereign country that is only part of a larger nation but that still belongs to the United Nations and has diplomatic relations with other countries around the globe.
Beijing is trying to prevent Taiwan from gaining status in this way, and it automatically suspends diplomatic relations with those countries that also try to maintain formal links with Taiwan. In addition, China last month closed France's consulate general in Guangzhou in retaliation for the fighter sale to Taipei.

HEADLINE: With Canada's Dollar Weak Shoppers Snub U.S. Stores

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. CATHARINES, Ontario

 BODY:
Charmaine Morrison, eight months pregnant, and her husband, Dale, are scouting the big Zellers discount store here at the Fairview Mall for baby clothes and diaper-changing pads. Mr. Morrison's mother, Shirley Trento, is looking at garbage bags and a wood cutting board, while his stepfather, John Trento, inspects paints for the hobby horses he builds in his spare time.
A few months back they would have gone on a shopping expedition across the border, into the malls of Buffalo or Niagara Falls, N.Y. "Now, it's just not worth it," Mr. Morrison, 32, the comptroller at a local auto parts company, said recently. "With the Canadian dollar down so much, you'll break even at best." 
 The Canadian dollar has fallen 13 percent against the American dollar since late 1991, when it was worth about 90 United States cents. Now it is worth 78 cents.
Millions of Canadians, who until a few months back were denuding shelves in American malls and wholesale outlets along the 3,000-mile border, are increasingly finding that the bargains are a lot less attractive.
As a result, the number of same-day car trips by Canadians to and from the United States has been declining all year, the Government's statistics agency reported. In November, the latest month for which figures are available, they were off nearly 20 percent from November 1991 to the lowest level in two years.
"Business is awful," said Don Powell, 32, who sells T-shirts from a kiosk in the Rainbow Center Mall in Niagara Falls. "Most of the people coming to this mall are Canadians, and they're not coming the way they used to."
Robert Joseph, also 32, who owns two shops in the same mall, one selling sunglasses and the other moccasins, said volume was down 20 percent from a year earlier in both stores.
On the Canadian side, stores have cut prices and aggressively tried to keep their customers at home. The magnitude of recent price changes has even prompted some border-hopping by Americans, searching for bargains in Canada. The Retail Council of Canada, which represents 6,000 merchants, says it has had reports over the last two months that Americans have been picking up woolens, china and housewares and even some food items like baked goods. But no figures are available.
 
 
'Dash' Shoppers Disappear
 Other border regions are in similar straits. Convenience centers, usually consisting of a grocery store and specialty retailers, at Blaine, Lynden and Sumas in Washington, just south of Vancouver, reported to the Chamber of Commerce in Bellingham, Wash., that business over Christmas was down 18 to 20 percent from a year before, said Mike Brennan, vice president of the Bellingham chamber.
"We're no longer getting the dash shoppers -- those who come ripping across the line to fill up their tank with gasoline and their back seats with milk and other dairy products," Mr. Brennan said.
But what is bad news for American retailers is good news for Canadian store owners, who deserve some of the credit for luring the shoppers back.
"Our merchants sharpened their pencils, particularly in those goods like food, clothing, electronics and appliances that were cross-border-shopped," said Alasdair McKichan, president of the Canadian retail council.
Canadian retail sales were up 3.5 percent in October to $15.5 billion, the latest month for which figures are available, and most analysts expect further gains when the numbers are tallied for the Christmas season. At its peak, economists estimated that cross-border shopping drained the Canadian economy of $5 billion a year.
 
 
Canadian Retailers Happy
 "Canadian retailers couldn't be happier," said Catherine Swift, senior vice president and chief economist of the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses. Merchants represent 20 percent of the federation's membership of 83,000 small- and medium-size enterprises.
The phenomenon has eased the sting of the severe Canadian recession. "Retailers are not the only ones smiling," Ms. Swift said, "but distributors and manufacturers as well, since the pace of the entire economy is quickened by higher retail sales."
A $2 box of garbage bags in a Niagara Falls, N.Y., supermarket now costs the equivalent of $2.26 for the Canadian who buys American greenbacks at the border. Should the bags be found in a local market for around $2.50 Canadian, nothing is saved crossing the border after gasoline consumption and bridge tolls are added.
As they saw their trade headed south, Canadian merchants complained loudly to Ottawa. Some merchants and officials went so far as to call cross-border shopping unpatriotic.
The border hopping, spurred by high exchange rates and unpopular consumption-tax increases, became an incendiary political issue. The Government responded with further tariff cuts. Duties were slashed on many Japanese-made electronics goods, which were among the more popular cross-border purchases. Many Canadian duties had been twice as high as the American tariffs.
 
 
Tougher Customs Inspections
 Ottawa also enforced more rigorous customs inspections. Fines were stiffened. Canadians are allowed to bring in $20 duty free on single-day trips to the United States. If they are away 48 hours or more, the limit rises to $100.
Paul Walters, president of the 272-store Zellers Inc. chain, which likes to call itself the Canadian Wal-Mart, had one of the sharpest pencils.
"At Zellers the lowest price is the law," he said, citing company policy to beat prices in other Canadian stores.
The Montreal-based chain, owned since 1979 by the 323-year-old Hudson's Bay Company, delivers circulars on its promotions sometimes twice a week to 7.5 million households, effectively the bulk of the country.
For Canadians shopping in the United States, the most popular items remain those that are most highly taxed in Canada, including gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, which still cost more than twice as much as in the United States. But customs officials enforce strict limits on the quantities of these products that can be brought in.
Even if the Canadian dollar should bounce back up, Canadian merchants predict that cross-border shopping will not again become the economic drain and political lightning rod that it had been until a few months ago, because of adjustments in Canadian prices and improved marketing practices.
"Canadians now realize the grass is not as green as they thought it was in the other pasture," said Mr. McKichan of the retail council.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: Inaugural Notebook;
Many Drummers in History's March

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The rectangular greensward of the Mall disappeared today under the boots and sneakers of 400,000 people, a merry mob that danced and trudged its way through a festival that was part Woodstock, part county fair, all mud and all gridlock.
Instead of the august classical columns of the Smithsonian museums, all that was visible from within the crowd were crenulated tent tops and a river of heads, backs and shoulders. The human flood sometimes dammed up and became impassable near the tents humming with the music of Broadway stars or Texas guitars. 
 At one moment, the crowds nearly imprisoned Aretha Franklin as she dropped by one tent to cut a ceremonial piece of Chicago's Eli's Famous Cheesecake. "Marza, don't go anywhere; I need you to get her out of here," a harried inaugural aide called out to a colleague as the crowd closed in around Ms. Franklin's fur coat. "We need to make a wedge. We need to get her out of here."
On the outskirts of that clot of people, 13-year-old Jewel Haskins hoped a celebrity would come her way. But the eighth-grader at Sousa Middle School in Washington could only see the crowd. "It was the famous people I came down for," she said with a sigh. "But I haven't seen anybody."
 
What Are Your Dreams?
 Whether or not people could see, they made themselves heard on the billboard equivalent of talk radio. Phyllis Yampolsky, a New York artist, created an 80-foot-long wall asking, "What Are Your Dreams For America That President Clinton and Vice-President Gore Can Make Come True?"
By midafternoon, the board was virtually covered with recommendations like "Give Socks a Cabinet position."
Although many of the sentiments had the rosy glow of a Hallmark card, there were plenty of pointed reminders about the country's impatience on matters large and small. "The Economy, Smarties!" a man signing himself "Ray P., D.C." wrote. "Good Luck -- You'll have it if you adopt the Canadian Health Plan," said another sign. "More Bathrooms for Women!" said a third.
"Tell Hillary to get a REAL haircut and some REAL clothes," advised a "a California teen-ager." "Hillary for President," another sign recommended. "Divorce Hillary," advised a third.
"It's public poetry," said Ms. Yampolsky, of the billboard concept she calls a "visual town meeting." "Everybody gets to know what everybody else is thinking."
 
Sharing the 'Great' Feeling
 The crowd was getting restless, the security people nervous. Stage hands with headphones and radios prowled at the edges while announcers begged for order. "We need some access," intoned one over and over again. "Will you all move back just a little bit? If you don't do that, we can't get started."
Finally Big Bird bounded in, trailed by many of the other characters from the public television show "Sesame Street." As they sang and danced in jubilation, Cookie Monster did his own version of rap music: "Hey kids, me feel great," the blue puppet sang. "When we feel great, there's one thing we have to do. When we feel great, we have to share it with you."
The beleaguered sound man, trying to balance a bank of controls at the back of the tent while parents and kids clambered onto his platform for a better view, did not seem to feel great, however, until Big Bird and his friends waved goodbye.
If things seemed frantic inside the Family Playground Tent, the atmosphere inside the Reunion Tent was more like havoc. While American Indian dancers in white eagle costumes were UM-tum-tumming, UM-tum-tumming onstage, voices on loudspeakers implored people to clear the aisles. Puzzled people in aisles were immobilized by crowds. Security guards screamed at people who tried to reserve seats for friends. Quarrels broke out here and there as people dove for seats others were trying to reserve. Babies wept. Children whined.
"We didn't have any aspiration of seeing anything," said Joyce Miller of Stamford, Conn.
Her husband, Ed, agreed. "It's a mob scene," he said.
"But a happy mob scene," she added.
 
Swords and T-Shirts
 "Down, down, down!" hissed Peter Bourne to his associate as he yanked back the inaugural T-shirt he had been displaying for sale. Two Park Police officers walked within five feet of Mr. Bourne but remained oblivious of his unlicensed entrepreneurship.
Mr. Bourne, who lives in New York City, was one of a group of eight illegal T-shirt vendors who did a brisk business within shouting distance of officially authorized souvenier stands.
Park Police and inaugural planners issued vendors' permits only to a select group of concessionaires. But as at any big party, there were gate crashers.
While Mr. Bourne worked at being alternately conspicuous and inconspicuous, a streetside sword swallower named Diane Falk showed up in full costume, attracting crowds of astonished gawpers. "This is just fun," she said, swallowing Listerine after one demonstration.
 
In Step at Last
 For a self-described "power babe," the festival was no picnic in the park. It was proof her generation had arrived. The President no longer seems like her grandfather. Her friends are getting White House jobs. The music was right.
"We wouldn't be anywhere else in the world right now," said Holly Welles, a 32-year-old foreign-aid specialist at the Agency for International Development. "We were blown away walking down the Mall, boppin' away, in tune with our generation."

HEADLINE: Economic Memo;
Clinton Goes Head to Head With the Fed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
Presidents have often put pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates down, but President-elect Bill Clinton seems to have gone them one better: his lieutenants are jawboning the Fed even before he takes office.
And the Fed is jawboning right back. 
 Mr. Clinton and the governors of the Fed are on a collision course, because the central bank wants economic growth to continue its slow takeoff, hoping to keep inflation heading downward even though inflationary pressures are at their lowest level in more than two decades. But Mr. Clinton's advisers have a quite different goal: far faster economic growth to fulfill his campaign pledge of slashing the nation's 7.3 percent unemployment rate.
Federal Reserve governors, in interviews last week, cautioned that if Mr. Clinton hit the growth accelerator too hard he just might repeat the mistakes of the one President he seems least eager to emulate: Jimmy Carter, who the governors say overstimulated the economy and ignited double-digit inflation.
Attempting a pre-emptive strike, Leon E. Panetta, Mr. Clinton's choice as Budget Director, warned the Federal Reserve last week not to raise interest rates soon, because that would make it harder for the new President to get tough about cutting the deficit -- something the Federal Reserve wants badly.
Mr. Panetta's message to Alan Greenspan, the central bank chairman, who is often called the nation's second-most powerful official, was clear: You have to play along and allow faster growth, because strong growth and more jobs are needed to ease the pain of slashing the deficit.
"If for any reason the Federal Reserve bails out on us, it's going to be very tough then to try to meet" the deficit-reduction targets "that we've established," Mr. Panetta told a Congressional committee at his confirmation hearing.
 
Escalation a Possibility
 These tensions could escalate into all-out Federal Reserve-bashing if the recent pickup in economic growth were to lead the Fed to raise short-term interest rates, as many economists expect and many Democrats in Washington fear.
Should it do so against the new Administration's wishes, Congressional Democrats seem ready to push legislation to place new limits on the Fed's independence.
The Fed often raises interest rates when growth gathers steam, fearing that increased demand for goods and services will fuel inflationary pressures. Higher interest rates force businesses and households to borrow less, which helps reduce inflation because less borrowing translates into less demand for goods and services.
Mr. Clinton's aides and Federal Reserve officials play down the tensions, noting that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan had a friendly meeting last month in Little Rock and that such tensions have been around, as one adviser said, "since the days of Adam and Eve."
 
A Plunge Into Recession
 Still, Federal Reserve officials invoke the specter of President Carter's economic woes whenever they hear that Mr. Clinton wants to stimulate the economy. Indeed, the Fed's interest-rate increases have been regarded as a big reason for Mr. Carter's defeat in 1980: to combat double-digit inflation, the central bank raised interest rates to a point where bank loans to consumers were made at rates exceeding 20 percent. Such prohibitive borrowing costs plunged the nation into the 1981-82 recession, the worst since the Great Depression.
That history was not lost on David W. Mullins Jr., the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, who said in an interview: "We have to be careful not to take policy actions to achieve rapid short-term growth that run the risk of creating problems down the road. We had some pretty rapid takeoffs in the 1970's, which resulted in rapid landings and reversals."
The Fed's seven governors are keeping their fingers crossed that Mr. Clinton will steer clear of Mr. Carter's mistakes. While they are terrified of too much stimulus, they seen willing to allow him a little leeway.
Many of the governors do not squirm at the Clinton economic team's plans for a modest, short-term increase in deficit spending, probably around $20 billion. A stimulus program of this magnitude, Federal Reserve officials say, is unlikely to overaccelerate growth or to spur inflation, especially if it is tied to a several-year plan to reduce the deficit over the long term.
 
But What Will Congress Do?
 Inside the Fed, though, there is a huge worry that Congress might transform a modest Clinton plan into a $40 billion to $50 billion package. Because members of the House are up for re-election in two years, many are assumed to be more eager than the President-elect to crank up the economy to produce hundreds of thousands of jobs quickly.
And a stimulus plan of that size, Fed officials fear, could overstimulate the economy. That would be counterproductive, they say, because it would fuel fears of inflation and push up long-term interest rates. It could inhibit faster growth by hurting business investment and home building.
In many ways, the tensions between Mr. Clinton and the Federal Reserve boil down to their differing goals for growth. Mr. Clinton's economic team appears to want growth of 4 percent a year while Fed officials are happy with the current 3 percent rate. Expressed that way, the disagreement may sound small, but it is a difference of one-third of anticipated national growth.
Federal Reserve officials say the economy can probably enjoy three straight years of 3 percent growth without fueling inflationary pressures. At that point, the central bank would in theory only have to step gently on the economic brakes, raising interest rates slowly.
But 4 percent growth, they warn, could fuel greater inflation within two years -- and perhaps sooner if it causes production bottlenecks. If history is a guide, the Federal Reserve might then slam on the brakes by raising rates. And that could toss the nation back into recession shortly before the 1996 Presidential elections, which might endanger Mr. Clinton's re-election hopes.
But the Clinton camp is unhappy with 3 percent growth. Lloyd Bentsen, Mr. Clinton's choice for Treasury Secretary, said at his confirmation hearing that the 2.9 percent growth rate forecast for this year was inadequate because it would produce just "a very marginal increase in jobs."
 
Spoiling for a Fight
 Adding fuel to the tensions is that some prominent members of Congress are spoiling for a fight with the Federal Reserve, holding it largely responsible for the nation's anemic recovery from recession. These lawmakers complain that the Fed has not lowered interest rates fast enough and has not made the money supply grow fast enough.
"The inflation performance is very good right now, and you can't make a strong case that there is danger of inflation," said Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who heads the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. "But job growth is very poor. The unemployment rate still remains half a percentage point higher than at the trough of the recession."
Mr. Sarbanes is sponsoring a bill that would remove the presidents of the Federal Reserve's district banks from the central bank's main policy-making committee.
The presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks' directors are selected not by the President but by regional bankers and business executives. They tend to be tougher in fighting inflation than the seven governors of the Federal Reserve, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

HEADLINE: Point Man for Economic Agenda

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE with SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
With thousands of journalists poised to descend on New York for the Democratic National Convention last summer, Robert E. Rubin, the Wall Street financier who headed the convention host committee, wanted someone to throw a party for them. At a breakfast meeting with Michael Fuchs, chairman of Home Box Office, Mr. Rubin broached the notion, only to get a cool response.
"They came and dumped this party on me," Mr. Fuchs said. "They did it in such a friendly, nice way, it was hard to say, 'No,' even though I wasn't looking forward to it." So, courtesy of H.B.O., 8,000 journalists were feted in Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. 
 Mr. Rubin, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice to head the newly created National Economic Council, has a low-key, quiet manner that belies his ability to make things happen. From helping turn Goldman, Sachs & Company, where he served as co-chairman, into the richest private partnership on Wall Street, to luring the Democratic National Convention back to New York, Mr. Rubin brings a quiet determination that can shape issues and motivate people.
 
 
'Better Leader'
 "Bob is not a legendary figure, like some of the people who have run this firm," one Goldman partner said. "I don't think he wants to be. But he has been a better leader than some of the legends."
It is a long way from the spacious office overlooking Goldman's trading floor that Mr. Rubin occupied at the pinnacle of finance, where he earned $15 million in 1991 and amassed a net worth estimated at $50 million to $100 million, to his temporary quarters in Washington. Operating more out of his briefcase than an office, Mr. Rubin has been working 15-hour days, shuttling between Little Rock, Ark., and the nation's capital to consult with President-elect Bill Clinton, trying to move along the process of devising the new Administration's economic plan. He complains about being tired and, to all who see him, looks drained.
Originally proposed by Mr. Clinton during the campaign, the group Mr. Rubin will head is modeled after the National Security Council, the White House group that coordinates foreign policy. Much as the national security adviser briefs the President daily on the state of the world, Mr. Rubin will brief Mr. Clinton on economics and domestic policy proposals generated by various Cabinet-level officials. The council is likely to be composed of the Secretaries of Treasury, Labor and Commerce, along with the heads of the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers, although this may change.
 
 
Access Is Key
 Mr. Rubin will be at the President's side, hoping to be an honest broker among different points of view. Mr. Rubin's position has no statutory power, and he does not have to be confirmed by Congress. Still, in a city where power is often measured by access, he will attend Cabinet meetings, and, when others have left, have the last word with the President. His office will be close to Mr. Clinton's.
"Bob will be the central staff person in devising the economic agenda and communicating with" the President, said Gene Sperling, one of Mr. Rubin's two deputies and Mr. Clinton's chief campaign adviser on economic policy. "He will make sure that we work together as one team."
As he did at Goldman, Mr. Rubin will have to deal with daunting egos and sharp intellects. So far, he is winning over skeptics who felt that his presence would merely add another level of bureaucracy to the formation of economic policy. But his stature as a Wall Street chief executive and his sharp and tough questioning of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers have earned respect for his role.
Last week, for example, he ran a six-hour meeting in the dining room of the governor's mansion in Little Rock, at which Cabinet appointees debated the Administration's economic plans, including the amount of fiscal stimulus and the pace of deficit reduction. Those plans will be referred to in Mr. Clinton's inaugural address and will be presented to Congress in February.
Mr. Rubin set the agenda, warned all in advance that he would cut them off if they rambled, and prodded speakers with pointed questions, people at the meeting said.
 
 
Democratic Insider
 Though a Washington neophyte, the 54-year-old Mr. Rubin is well-known in Democratic circles. His Goldman office was peppered with pictures of Democratic politicians, and he was a key fund-raiser for Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis. He has personally given more than $100,000 to the Democratic Party and persuaded Goldman partners to pony up the same amount for Mr. Clinton.
But "Rubin didn't buy his way into Clinton's inner circle," one Clinton aide said. "If anything, it was his stature as head of Goldman, Sachs."
Mr. Rubin will not speak to reporters on the record. Instead, he talks briefly, and off the record only, on specific matters.
Mr. Rubin and Mr. Clinton met at a New York dinner party, where they found they shared the same concerns about the economy and what needed to be done. Throughout the Clinton campaign, Mr. Rubin was an informal sounding board for Mr. Clinton.
Sylvia Mathews, Mr. Rubin's new special assistant, recalled that during the campaign, "if we were concerned about where the long bond was going, we'd call Bob and have him explain."
Derek Shearer, an economist and member of Mr. Clinton's transition team, said: "Bob helped us figure out how to finance infrastructure in creative ways. He'd advise us on what business was thinking and how markets would react to different proposals." And, Mr. Rubin helped Mr. Clinton prepare for the Presidential debates.
 
 
Adviser to Mayor Dinkins
 Mr. Rubin has been a frequent adviser to Mayor David Dinkins of New York, helping the city convince chief executives not to move their corporate offices out of town. Mr. Rubin's wife, Judy, is head of protocol for the Dinkins Administration.
The Rubins have a Park Avenue apartment and a weekend house in Pound Ridge in Westchester County, north of New York. Mr. Rubin has acquired a Washington apartment, but the couple's final arrangements are undecided.
Mr. Rubin, working with Mr. Dinkins, was instrumental in getting a reluctant Democratic Party, which favored Cleveland or New Orleans, to take another chance on New York for its convention. In a 48-hour period, Mayor Dinkins and Mr. Rubin took the site selection committee on a whirlwind tour of the city, covering everything from hotels to subways.
"It was the Dave and Bob show," Michael E. Schlein, a city economic development official, said. "They charmed the hell out of them and showed we could throw a party."
After that, Mr. Rubin headed the fund-raising drive that brought in $6.5 million to support the convention and oversaw the operation of the host committee, which sponsored hundreds of events.
 
 
Career at Goldman
 Mr. Rubin started at Goldman 26 years ago on a trading desk, after graduating from Harvard, then Yale Law School. He learned the business of risk arbitrage -- speculating on the stocks of companies involved in takeover attempts -- under Gus Levy, a Wall Street legend. Later he would run the firm's stock and bond trading departments and help to revive its J. Aron commodities-trading subsidiary, which trades mainly in oil and currencies and now accounts for one-third of the firm's profits. In 1990 he became co-chairman.
The firm already had blue-chip clients like Sears, Roebuck; Procter & Gamble, and Ford Motor. But Mr. Rubin and his co-chairman, Stephen Friedman, pushed their colleagues to become more aggressive in seeking opportunities. Mr. Rubin, in particular, encouraged the firm to trade on its own behalf, in addition to serving customers. He spearheaded investments into Europe and Latin America and met regularly with heads of state. In 1991, Goldman earned $1.1 billion in pretax profit, the highest on Wall Street that year. Mr. Rubin resigned from the firm on Dec. 10 and is placing his assets in a blind trust.
Whippet slender, Mr. Rubin is rarely seen working without his tie loosened. He ran a firm known for his emphasis on teamwork and toughness. In meetings, his legal training comes through in detailed questioning that has been dubbed "management by cross-examination." He uses his keen wit to poke fun at himself and cut sharply into others and, while a patient listener and open-minded, he nonetheless can be impatient, his associates say.
"He is very unaccepting of intellectually weak and flabby arguments," Mr. Friedman, now the sole head of Goldman, said. "He will cut right through that."
 
 
Share of Problems
 Yet during Mr. Rubin's tenure, Goldman had its share of problems. Women complained about lack of opportunity, and the firm was sued for sex discrimination. (In 1990, it had only one woman partner; today, there are six women among 161 partners.) Robert A. Freeman, a partner, pleaded guilty in 1990 to a felony count of insider trading, with the firm backing him and paying his legal bills.
Goldman was also the banker for the failed leveraged buyout of R. H. Macy & Company, and it traded extensively with the British publisher Robert Maxwell, who was found drowned in 1991 after Goldman called in his loans. And a much-publicized merchant banking fund, called the Water Street Recovery Fund, was ended when clients complained about conflicts of interest.
For now, one of Mr. Rubin's biggest frustrations, aside from the ever-growing Federal budget deficit, is the fact that in Washington he must touch many more bases than at Goldman to get anything done. But while "he probably won't admit it, Bob is enjoying this a lot," said Mr. Sperling, Mr. Rubin's deputy.

HEADLINE: Riley Sims, 90, Dies; Leader in Cable TV And in Construction

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
Riley V. Sims, who rose from poverty to success in the construction, concrete, telecommunications and cable television industries, died Wednesday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., his home town. He was 90.
He had cancer, his family said,
When Mr. Sims, a native of East St. Louis, Ill., was 12, his father died. The youth quit school after the seventh grade to support his mother by baling hay for 50 cents a day and shucking corn for 6 cents a bushel. 
 During the Depression, after the family had moved to Florida, he formed a handshake partnership with a friend, Russell Burnup. Both were unemployed carpenters. They pooled $30 in cash and their tools and began doing repair jobs and transporting sand for construction.
Eventually Sims & Burnup grew to become a major contractor, erecting office buildings, schools and shopping centers in West Palm Beach. The company introduced ready-mixed concrete to South Florida, and by the 1940's it operated 65 concrete plants across the southeast United States and the Caribbean.
At Mr. Sims's initiative, the company shifted into the installation of lines for rural telephone service, and from that expanded into installing cable television.
In time Sims & Burnup became the nation's largest cable television installer. Over the last 32 years, it has wired a quarter of the nation's 5,800 cable systems. Last years it reported $153 million in sales.
Mr. Sims, who won the Horatio Alger Award from the American Schools and Colleges Association, remained chairman of the company until he retired in 1989.
He is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Lillian Bamford; a daughter, Sandra Millspaugh of Asheville, N.C., and six grandchildren.

HEADLINE: STRICTLY BUSINESS;
A Company Flourishes in the Bronx

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Zero International Inc. makes a decidedly humble first impression. It occupies a windowless brick building in the South Bronx with the word "Zero" scrawled in yellow paint on each side.
Not that Zero, which is at 415 Concord Avenue, ever had lofty pretensions. It was born in 1924 when two Hungarian immigrants chose the name for their stab at the American Dream. They chose it because they had no money, no English and no business knowledge. 
 But Zero succeeded. It has grown to become maker and marketer of sophisticated architectural products in scores of countries. Among its products are those that keep the White House library soundproof, protect the rooms housing Wall Street computers from electromagnetic radiation and keep the chamber where space shuttles are tested fireproof. As such, Zero is one of the small jewels of the Bronx's more than 700 manufacturers, which together employ 16,000 people.
Like the flower wholesalers who plan to relocate to the Bronx from midtown Manhattan next year, more than a handful of businesses have long chosen to be in the Bronx for reasons ranging from cheap land to proximity to a huge market to excellent transportation to a large supply of willing workers.
Elias Wexler, the owner of Zero, has chosen not to move for similar reasons. He wants to stay and expand.
"I love the Bronx," said Mr. Wexler, a Romanian immigrant who came to the Bronx to marry the woman he fell in love with in Israel after fleeing Romania in 1973. Once in the Bronx, he went to work for Zero and was able to purchase it in 1986. In his praise of the borough, he particularly cited his dedicated work force of 33 employees. "I love the people here."
 
Thefts and Red Tape
 But it is not always smooth sailing for companies like Zero that prefer to be in the Bronx. Prostitutes and drug addicts sometimes hang out on the tattered streets outside, and thefts have included the windshield of one employee's car. And as Zero has strived to to grow, it has faced a number of hurdles, including government regulations ostensibly intended to help companies. In Zero's case, a major obstacle has been a rule governing how the city disposes of the property it owns.
For the last five years, Mr. Wexler has been struggling to buy a vacant city-owned lot to expand his business. The central point of disagreement has been that he considered confiscatory the city's requirement that he forfeit both a $60,000 purchase price and the lot if he did not build within five years. A practical reason for his objection, he said, is an enormous rock in the middle of the lot.
The building will cost $500,000, an amount Mr. Wexler's bankers have told him they will gladly lend. But preparing the site will cost an additional $400,000. This raises the amount of his loan request to an amount too high for an 8,000-square-foot building, his bankers say. So Mr. Wexler wants to save enough to pay for the site preparation himself, then get a loan for the cost of the building. He worries that he might not be able to do it in the specified five years.
 
A Rule Worth Fighting
 The issue is not whether the city wants to help Zero. Mr. Wexler readily acknowledges that rules have been bent in his favor. The city extended its normal two years for building completion to five years for him, and it cut in half the appraised value of the property because of the rock.
But Mr. Wexler insists his larger problem is justice; He considers it unjust that the government would keep both his money and his property.
"It is like Communism," he said.
The dispute has had many twists, turns and threats, generating a bundle of lawyerly correspondence in the process. And now, it might be over. On Wednesday, Carl Weisbrod, president of the Economic Development Corporation, offered Mr. Wexler a couple of alternative approaches. The one Mr. Wexler seemed to prefer was for him to buy the land with the proviso he could not sell it without the promised building on it.
Lawyers still have to iron out the details, but Mr. Weisbrod already hails the tentative agreement as symbolic of the solicitous approach the city is taking to the problems of smaller businesses. "We bent over backwards," he said.
"It sounds good," Mr. Wexler said.
Mr. Wexler's Zero is an adaptable company. Long ago, it forgot how to make its original product, wooden screens, but it always managed to come up with something new. After the wooden screens, Zero switched to making weatherstripping for doors. But that too died as doors began to be put together in factories, arriving with stripping already installed.
Zero adapted by becoming a wizard of gasketry, the craft of leak-proofing things. Its technology makes the doors of New York City's schools stronger and quieter. And a just-released product will cause doors to swell in the event of fires so smoke cannot escape.
Its sales have doubled in the last five years to just under $5 million. Its target is the top end of the architectural-products market; its strategy is to be first with new kinds of gasketry.
"There are a lot of people making cheaper products," said Joan F. Blatterman, associate editor of Architectural Record. "But Zero is at the top of the heap."
This weekend Mr. Wexler took his first vacation in six years, a three-day one. He hastened to say that he would be working one of the two nights sound-testing a room at Disney World, where some of his products were recently installed.

 BODY:
AFTER spending a decade trying to turn garbage into energy economically -- but mainly burning money in the effort -- the founders of Waste Conversion Systems Inc. think they've finally got it right.
Waste Conversion, which is based in Englewood, Colo., last week patented a "biomass burner," which company officials say efficiently ignites anything from newspaper to old tires and can be used as an alternative fuel source for conventional oil and gas boilers. 
 Company officials said the burner, which operates at temperatures of 1,800 to 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit, has several virtues. First, it requires only a tiny amount of external energy because it relies on the heat produced by garbage once the process gets under way. Second, the process produces a clean, torchlike flame and separates the few components that will not burn without creating a molten mess.
The new burner is based on a two-stage process invented in the early 1980's by two brothers, David and Calvin Hand. Early versions of the burner could accommodate only wood and paper and were thus of limited use. Though the company raised money through a penny-stock offering about five years ago, it has yet to turn a profit.
But the new patent covers a burner that the company said is twice as efficient and can burn almost anything.
The process begins by heating solid wastes, like old tires, in an oxygen-starved chamber until most components are turned into gas. Because the chamber contains little oxygen, the components do not actually burn. In the case of tires, the rubber quickly turns to gas, at about 800 degrees, while components like metal, dirt and nylon simply drop to the bottom of the chamber.
Stan E. Abrams, president of Waste Conversion Systems, said the process of turning solids into gas produced a huge amount of heat that was used to superheat air in a second chamber that ignited the gas. Once the incineration begins, Mr. Abrams said, it is sustained as long as waste material is added.
Mr. Abrams said the new burner was more automated than the original. To improve gasification, solids are agitated on a grate in much the way a person shakes popcorn kernels. The new burner features a liner that retains more heat, making it more efficient and enabling it to produce higher temperatures, he added.
The systems sell for $300,000 to more than $10 million, depending on size.
Mr. Abrams, along with David and Calvin Hand, received patent 5,178,076.
 
Breeding Insects For Crop Control
 Researchers at Crop Genetics Inc., a biotechnology firm in Hanover, Md., patented an insect-breeding farm designed to mass-produce bugs used in place of pesticides and herbicides.
Using insects and viruses produced by insects as "biological control agents" is an increasingly popular alternative to chemicals in both gardening and agriculture. Among other advantages, these living allies pose far less threat to humans and other animals than do chemicals, and they cause less damage to the soil.
Until recently, however, insects were laboriously bred in scores of small containers, said Douglas M. Kolodny-Hirsch, one of the inventors. The new box, called "Alcatraz," is about 6 feet in height and four feet in diameter. Inside is a large number of mesh-screens, each hung vertically. A nutritional gel is poured through each screen, which serves as a nest, and a computer keeps the temperature, humidity and airflow at the optimum levels for breeding.
Mr. Kolodny-Hirsch said Crop Genetics had since developed a number of refinements and was also exploring other approaches to commercial insect breeding. He and an associate, Charles W. Carr, received patent 5,178,094.
 
Surgical Tool For the Inner Ear
 Hoping to simplify the most common surgical procedure for children -- inserting tubes in ears -- a surgeon in New Jersey obtained a patent this week for a tube that does away with the need for a knife.
Invented by James Z. Cinberg, an ear, nose and throat doctor in Short Hills, the tube features a sharp edge that cuts its own way through the ear drum and makes an incision that he said is always the right size.
Doctors routinely insert small tubes in the ears of children who suffer chronic ear infections. The tubes permit the middle ear to drain fluids that create a breeding ground for bacteria.
At the moment, Dr. Cinberg said, doctors make an incision with a very small knife that must be disposed of after virtually every procedure. In addition, he said, if a surgeon makes a cut that is slightly too big, the tube will fall out and be of no use.
The new tube solves both problems, the inventor said. It features a sharp edge that pokes through the drum, so a doctor can just push it into place. The device has been tested in cats but not humans, however, and has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Dr. Cinberg and an associate, Peter J. Wilk, received patent 5,178,623.
Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

Inaugural Addresses: Urban Hopes for a Change

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
URBAN and city are two words that have not been spoken in a Presidential inaugural address for at least a quarter-century, but Mayor Patrick Pasculli of Hoboken figures that this year may be different.
"We spoke briefly when he was here last May," the Mayor said of President-elect Bill Clinton. "He was visiting a vacant school building that we converted into a day-care program that serves several hundred children and includes space for private schools, too. 
 "He was very impressed by what we had done there and he said he would continue to look for ways to carry out programs like this," Mr. Pasculli said. "Already, he's appointed a former mayor as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. We're very optimistic that this Administration is going to pay keen attention to urban centers."
Hoboken needs help. The mile-square city on the Hudson is the densest in America and is emblematic of urban desperation in the region and beyond. Hoboken was the home of Frank Sinatra and also of the horticulturist who introduced the chrysanthemum to America. But the city has also been derided as home to poor relations of the cosmopolites across the river in New York.
"Everything," Stella Adler, the drama coach, once told a young actor who was mumbling through his monologue, "is Hoboken to you."
And last year a city that had metamorphosed from blue-collar to turtleneck and that was being revived by an infusion of young professionals and avant-garde artists and musicians woke up and could no longer smell the coffee. Capping an exodus of manufacturing and maritime industries, Maxwell House, Hoboken's largest employer and taxpayer, had moved to Florida.
Whatever Mr. Clinton says about cities at his inauguration on Wednesday will be more than most of his predecessors have said.
In 1973, a year after Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York City embarked on a quixotic and short-lived campaign for the Presidency, the closest Richard M. Nixon came to mentioning the urban crisis in his inaugural address was to raise the prospect of providing "better education, better health, better housing, better transportation, a cleaner environment -- to restore respect for law, to make our communities more livable -- and to insure the God-given right of every American to full and equal opportunity."
Four years later, Jimmy Carter vaguely promised a "new spirit" and pledged to "fight our wars against poverty, ignorance and injustice."
In 1981, Ronald Reagan proclaimed a "new beginning," pausing to describe the magnificent vista of Washington's "special beauty and history" -- history that would later include the city's deterioration into a murder capital whose mayor was enmeshed in a drug investigation and a vista that would include homeless people encamped across the street from the White House.
Four years later, when Mr. Reagan was sworn in for a second term, he justified the New Federalism that was diverting responsibility but not resources from Washington to governors and mayors by recalling: "We yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves."
And in 1989, still without mentioning the words city or urban, George Bush acknowledged them indirectly when he said: "There are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction -- drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums." He referred to "the rough crime of the streets" and concluded an entire paragraph about illegal drugs by declaring, "This scourge will stop!"
The role that urban issues had played during the 1988 campaign was capsulized not in the President's speech but in a cartoon hanging in an office of the National League of Cities Institute. "Sir, do you have an urban agenda?" a reporter asks. In the four panels of the cartoon that follow, the candidate remains mute. Finally, the reporter asks, "Can you be more specific?"
Four years later, the candidates' urban agendas were also found wanting. Mr. Clinton became the first Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson to win among white voters by playing less to places like Hoboken than to their refugees in the suburbs. Even after Mr. Clinton's election, said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, dean of New York City's Congressional delegation, the incoming Clinton Administration has solicited advice but given few clues to whether New York and Hoboken and hundreds of other cities will be any better off after they rejected a President who many believed could be no worse.
"They listen," Mr. Rangel said of the President-elect's team, "and they say nothing."
The luxury of silence is almost over. But will vagueness then suffice as it did for Mr. Clinton's predecessors? His speech on Wednesday may signal whether he intends to galvanize his constituents' consciences and their self-interest to invest in the Head Start program, in the job-training provisions of the Family Support Act, in alternatives to incarceration and in a national policy to replace "silence, moralizing and withholding of information" about AIDS and teen-age pregnancy.
Those are among the thoughtful policy choices compiled by Rand Corporation analysts in their own agenda. Its title invokes a word that newly inaugurated Presidents have shunned: "Urban America."

HEADLINE: A Lending Plan for the Distressed

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The transition team for President-elect Bill Clinton is drafting legislation to create a nationwide network of 100 community development banks, which would invest in distressed neighborhoods and lend money to poor people starting businesses.
In the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton often praised such banks, citing the South Shore Bank of Chicago as a model. 
 Confidential documents from the transition team show that Mr. Clinton's advisers have recommended that he ask Congress for $850 million to aid community development banks over the next five years, with the money to be distributed through a new national trust. The documents say the creation of such banks would help stimulate the economy by reviving depressed inner-city areas.
 
Bankers' Concerns
 Under the Clinton proposal, existing banks and credit unions could apply for Federal aid. But the purpose of the legislation is to expand the supply of credit, so the selection criteria would favor new institutions.
The banking community has not embraced the idea, saying the Government should not subsidize new institutions in an industry already suffering from overcapacity.
Edward L. Yingling, executive director of government relations at the American Bankers Association, said, "We support the concept of community development lending, but we have a lot of concern about the idea of setting up a network of 100 new banks."
Under the plans being drawn up, a bank or a credit union could qualify for Federal assistance only if it made "an explicit commitment to community development" in an economically distressed area and if a large portion -- perhaps 75 percent -- of its loans and investments were directed toward that area, the documents say. These conditions would rule out participation by most commercial banks.
While existing institutions devoted to community lending generally welcome Mr. Clinton's proposal, they say it is imperative that new legislation not exclude them.
 
Matching Money
 The Clinton plan would allow organizers of a community development bank to receive Federal assistance in several forms, including Government grants. For each dollar invested by the Government, the bank would have to raise $2 from private investors. Mr. Clinton's aides said participating banks might be required to repay some or all of the Government's contribution if they reached a certain level of profitability.
A nationwide plan for community lending is just one of several proposals being refined by Mr. Clinton's transition team to help the economy. Another avenue is the creation of "enterprise zones," a prospect favored by Presidents Reagan and Bush. With enterprise zones, the Government would offer tax breaks to businesses that invest in distressed neighborhoods and that hire residents of such areas.
The idea has languished amid partisan bickering, but Congress seems likely to forge a compromise with the new Administration this year.
A third proposal would create incentives for pension funds to buy bonds that finance public works and environmental projects.
 
Hearing Scheduled
 Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who serves as chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, supports the idea of community development banks. He views them as part of a comprehensive strategy to increase lending to low-income people and neighborhoods with high rates of poverty and unemployment.
Mr. Riegle has scheduled a hearing on the topic for Feb. 3. Clinton Administration officials say they hope to introduce their proposal at that time.
Clifford N. Rosenthal, executive director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, which has 100 members, said, "We are enormously encouraged" by the interest of Mr. Clinton and Senator Riegle. But he said Federal money should be available to existing banks and credit unions.
"We feel very strongly that the Federal program should build on existing experience and institutions," Mr. Rosenthal said.
That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Yingling of the American Bankers Association. "There is an increasing body of expertise among community development groups and bankers," Mr. Yingling said. "You ought to build on the current system, which is showing great promise. If you set up a network of 100 subsidized banks, you will end up with Federal standards saying how such a bank should look. What you really need is a lot of flexibility to experiment, to see what works and to adjust to local needs. Moreover, if you have 100 charters, the decision about who gets one will be highly politicized."
Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, a member of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, said the idea of Federal aid for community development banks had merit, and he predicted that Congress would be eager to approve such legislation.
The Government, he said, should provide "seed capital," not operating subsidies, for these banks. "It's not a panacea, but it's a very good idea that could really help inner cities," he said.
 
Oversight Dilemma
 Mr. Clinton's advisers have recommended that Federal aid be distributed to community development banks through a new Government entity, the National Trust for Community Development Financial Institutions. But they have not decided whether the trust should be an independent agency or part of the Treasury Department or part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In a memorandum to the President-elect, Mr. Clinton's advisers said the program to aid community development banks might be lost or neglected in the Housing Department, which they described as "poorly managed." They said the program would be "a fish out of water" at Treasury because that department has "no community development orientation."
In advocating a nationwide network of community development banks, Mr. Clinton said he was impressed with the work of two institutions: the South Shore Bank of Chicago and the Southern Development Bancorportion in Arkadelphia, Ark. Mr. Clinton's wife, Hillary, has served on the board of Southern Development.
Since 1975, the South Shore Bank, a subsidiary of the Shorebank Corporation, has provided loans to Chicago residents, who have bought and repaired buildings with more than 8,000 apartments, or one-third of the units in the South Shore neighborhood. The neighborhood was rapidly decaying in the 1970's but now has a mixture of tidy single-family homes and apartment buildings. The bank also lends to small businesses.
Shorebank executives helped to plan the Southern Development Bancorporation, adapting their experience in Chicago to the needs of a rural area. Southern Development and its banking arm, the Elk Horn Bank and Trust Company, provide loans, venture capital and technical advice to area businesses.
Officials of these banks are pleased with Mr. Clinton's interest, but they emphasize that new legislation should include the network of community banks that has begun to develop in recent years.
 
 
New York's Example
 The Community Capital Bank in New York City was modeled on Shorebank of Chicago, said Stephen S. Laine, president of the bank.
Community Capital, which opened in Brooklyn in January 1991, has approved $7 million in loans to support low-income housing and small businesses in New York City.
"We seek to make a profit," Mr. Laine said. "Our objective is to show the nation that a new bank opening in the inner city can be a profitable and safe investment for stockholders. We haven't made profits yet, but we expect to do so this year."

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Clinton's Nightmare

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
Bill Clinton wanted, and promised, to be a domestic President. But he is going to take office facing the worst foreign-policy nightmares of any incoming President since the time of Vietnam.
Serbia's savage aggression continues in Bosnia even as its leaders say they are ready for peace. The siege of Sarajevo goes on, as do attacks elsewhere. Instability threatens the whole Balkan region. 
 Serbian leaders moved toward accepting a settlement last week only because the growing anger of Americans and Europeans -- and the approaching inauguration of Mr. Clinton -- made outside military intervention seem imminent. It will take immediate and determined pressure from Mr. Clinton to actually stop the fighting and see that any settlement terms are kept.
Iraq is a major and menacing piece of unfinished business. The latest U.S. air strikes seem unlikely to end Saddam Hussein's capacity, or his desire, for provocation. Iran is buying and building weapons -- possibly including nuclear weapons -- even as it finances the spread of its fundamentalist politics elsewhere.
The Arab-Israel peace negotiations, so filled with hope, are stalled. Israel's self-defeating response to Hamas terrorism, the expulsion of 400 suspected Hamas leaders, has put at least the Palestinian talks on hold. There will have to be a new push from Washington.
Russia is on the brink of economic and political disaster. A parliament stacked with old Communists and conservative nationalists has hobbled economic reform. Boris Yeltsin has lost his hold on public opinion. The country is sliding toward a chaos that would devastate the hopes for democracy there and elsewhere.
Other former Soviet republics are in a state of growing misery and instability. The most unfortunate is Armenia, beset by neighboring Azerbaijan, its fuel and power supplies cut.
Japan's relations with the United States are the tensest in 40 years. Mr. Clinton has been urged by fat cats of the U.S. auto industry to make up for their failures by putting punitive tariffs on Japanese vehicles. What the new President does will affect what is becoming this country's most crucial relationship.
Then there is Somalia. Everyone recognizes now that if the American military intervention ends abruptly, it will have done no good.
Somalia raises the larger question of how to handle political and humanitarian disasters in the third world. Americans would like the United Nations to do more, but that requires decisions on such questions as a standing U.N. military force -- decisions on which the world will be looking to Mr. Clinton to lead.
To list some of those problems is to understand how questions of foreign policy will press on the new President. It is also to understand something about President Bush.
Mr. Bush made his claim to achievement as a President in foreign affairs. He exulted in being on telephone terms with dozens of world leaders. His great moment in the White House was the victory over Saddam Hussein.
But as he leaves, his record looks thin. He responded too late to the menace of Saddam Hussein, feeding the tyrant until the moment of the Kuwait invasion, and then failed to finish off Iraqi forces. He did not have the vision to understand the stakes in Russia and Eastern Europe as they struggled for democracy and market economies. He turned away from the horror of Serbian aggression. He delayed acting in Somalia and gave the mission unrealistic limits.
The result is to have left a vacuum of leadership on issue after issue. And the world will not wait. If it is to avoid widening armed conflict, trade war and human misery, it must have leadership. And that can only come from Washington.
Mr. Clinton must do more than respond to the particular crises awaiting him. He has to give us a general sense of where we are going, and why. In short, he has to begin articulating a rationale for American foreign policy: a new vision to replace the cliches of the cold war.
Explaining is important not just for its own sake but to give American policy something it has too often lacked in recent years: political legitimacy. To be effective in the long run, a President has to persuade Congress and the public in foreign as in domestic affairs.

HEADLINE: Faltering Companies Seek Outsiders

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

 BODY:
When John F. Akers announced last month that the International Business Machines Corporation would cut 25,000 more jobs in 1993, he acknowledged what management experts say is the biggest conundrum for reviving any stumbling giant: speeding its response to changing markets and technology.
 But there is an emerging view among business scholars and management consultants suggesting that loyal "company men" like Mr. Akers, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive since 1986 and a 33-year I.B.M. employee, are ill-equipped to lead faltering corporations through painful recoveries. 
They say that such insiders are often too slow to disrupt the corporate cultures that brought them to power even in the face of mounting financial crises. Indeed, directors at a growing number of corporations are bringing in leaders with fewer ties to the companies and more urgent plans to correct festering troubles -- although there is such a thing as being too urgent, as shown by the recent turmoil at the Sunbeam-Oster Company. Though the chairman, Paul B. Kazarian, turned the company around after bankruptcy, his hard-driving style caused a mutiny among his managers that resulted in his ouster. "To really see the need for a major cultural change, and then to have the will to make it happen despite the pain, you need a kind of outsider's perspective," said John P. Kotter, a Harvard professor of leadership who studied 11 companies that successfully streamlined operations and gained market share in the 1980's.
 He found that none of the revivals were led by people who had climbed the traditional corporate ladders. Two of the brightest corporate success stories of the 1980's, General Electric and Xerox, were planned and executed by people outside the traditional corporate paths to power, Mr. Kotter said. And similar revivals appear to be under way at Compaq Computer and at Tenneco Inc., which recently replaced their chiefs.
 Stan Davis, an author and consultant in Boston, said company men often become too ensnarled in the politics of sustaining an oversized organization to react quickly to changing technologies and consumer demands.
 "It's a recipe for disaster," Mr. Davis said. "Whether it's General Motors, or I.B.M. or Sears, the only way that they will survive would be in a very radically transformed way that would take a lot of hardship, heartache, turmoil and pain."

 
Upheaval at Highest Levels
 Some of the biggest business stories in 1992 have been chronicles of huge financial losses accompanied by upheaval at the highest levels of troubled corporations. General Motors' directors picked the chief of the successful European operation, John F. Smith Jr., to replace Robert C. Stempel in October after just 27 months as G.M.'s chief executive. Directors at Digital Equipment forced Kenneth H. Olsen into retirement after the computer giant's founder had run the company for 35 years, and chose a relative newcomer, Robert B. Palmer, who joined Digital in 1985.
 One candidate to replace James D. Robinson 3d, who is being ushered out by the board after 15 years as chief at American Express, is Harvey Golub, a former management consultant who until a year ago headed the financial company's IDS Financial Services unit in Minneapolis.
 Mr. Akers has hardly been a passive chief executive at I.B.M. During his tenure, he has cut I.B.M.'s work force by 28 percent and a year ago set in motion a companywide reorganization to split I.B.M. into smaller, better-focused businesses.
 "You could make the case that the only effective agent of change is somebody who doesn't come with all the history and trappings of the enterprise," Mr. Akers said through a spokesman. "The critical issue is whether management is truly willing to make the changes that are necessary. I believe we are demonstrating our willingness to make the fundamental changes."
 Last year, he brought in John Kotter to address senior management about the need for change. "When he was finished, I asked him what we should be doing that we're not doing," Mr. Akers said. "His only advice was to do it with a real sense of urgency. That's exactly what we're doing."
 Yet I.B.M. directors clipped some of Mr. Akers's power in recent weeks, recalling two retired senior executives, including a former rival of Mr. Akers, to help run the company.
 The trouble is, the independent thinkers who are now in vogue are often the first to be stymied or driven out by the bureaucratic cultures that grow out of industry dominance. That may make it difficult for leaders like Mr. Smith at G.M. and Mr. Akers to find the types of managers needed to jolt their bloated, tradition-bound organizations into a crisis mode.

 
Pockets of Innovation
 But even within bureaucracies, there are pockets of innovation and success. In fact, many of the leaders now being tapped by boards come from star units within otherwise troubled corporations. John F. Welch, the head of G.E., made his mark as head of the company's plastics group, far afield from the traditional training grounds for a chief executive: light bulbs and washing machines.
 Dozens of factors have turned the tried-and-true management practices of the past into sure-fire formulas for failure. Among them are the accelerating pace of product design changes, shifting consumer tastes, the push for manufacturing efficiencies and competition on a global scale.
 Rest-on-your-laurels attitudes are why many huge organizations slip from their perches. Of the 500 companies that Fortune magazine included on its first list of the nation's largest industrial companies in 1955, only 35 percent remain on the list. And only 40 percent of the 500 industrial giants on the 1970 list were included in 1985.
 Even so, directors rarely challenge experienced chief executives until the damage has cut deeply into revenues and profits. That, critics say, stems in part from the tradition in most companies of having the chief executive also rule as chairman of the board -- a tradition that G.M., for one, finally broke recently by giving the job of chairman to John G. Smale, a retired head of Procter & Gamble.

 
Picking an Outsider
At Compaq, the jobs of chairman and chief executive have been separate since the company was founded 10 years ago. Ben Rosen, the investor whose firm helped Compaq get off the ground, has been chairman from the start.
 He and other nonmanagement directors concluded a year ago that Compaq was losing touch with customers, and took the first step to rectify the problem by replacing the popular chief and co-founder, Joseph (Rod) Canion, with Eckhard Pfeiffer, the German-born longtime head of Compaq's European operations.
 In picking an outsider, Compaq has followed a formula that worked at Xerox, Tenneco and First Chicago, among others. David Kearns, who awoke Xerox to the threat of Japanese copy-machine makers, went to the company from I.B.M. at age 41 and was named chief executive at 52. Barry Sullivan, chief executive at First Chicago, was recruited by directors in 1980 from Chase Manhattan.
 In May, Tenneco's directors replaced James L. Ketelsen, the company's leader since 1978, with Michael H. Walsh, 50, a former Government prosecutor who had never managed a business until he was 38. He came from the Union Pacific Railroad, where he won high marks for improving efficiency and profits while slashing both white- and blue-collar jobs as chief executive between 1985 and 1991.
 What is it about these rebels plucked from within the corporate hierarchy or recruited from other companies that makes them better prepared for administering the necessary tough medicine?

 
Fresh View of Problems Needed
 Professor Kotter said one answer was the intuitive ability to continually view problems in fresh ways and to identify ineffective operating practices and traditions.
 Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan whose new book on the Welch era at G.E., "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will" (Doubleday), said Mr. Welch of G.E. viewed business as a fast-moving, free-flowing sport like hockey, which he played at the University of Massachusetts, where he was captain of the team.
 "Hockey shaped Welch psychologically," Professor Tichy said. "He was a tough blue-collar kid who developed this informal, ad hoc, but disciplined style. And he wants to win, win, win. Performance means everything to him, with no compromises."
 General Electric's transformation under Mr. Welch is perhaps the classic contemporary case of a successful revolution led from within an aging corporate giant.
 Although G.E. was prosperous when Mr. Welch took command in 1981, at age 45, he created a crisis among senior managers with an edict that any business not ranking first or second in its global market would be overhauled or sold -- one reason he gave for recently merging its aerospace unit with Martin Marietta's. Previously, a G.E. division manager's job was regarded as safe if sales grew at least as fast as the United States economy. Mr. Welch decided that was a formula for failure in the global economy, since markets in Europe and Asia were growing more rapidly than in America.

 
Gain in Efficiency
 G.E.'s sales this year will exceed $65 billion, compared with $27 billion in 1981 -- a stunning gain in efficiency considering that it now employs far fewer people. It eliminated about 124,000 jobs during the 1980's. Another 37,000 jobs will be trimmed through the Martin Marietta deal, bringing total employment to 240,000 by year end.
 Mr. Welch gained attention after he was given control in 1968 of G.E.'s plastics department, with sales of less than $100 million. Today it has more than $5 billion in sales. "He would do radical stuff to trick the bureaucracy," Mr. Tichy said. "The only reason he survived is because his sales were growing at 30 percent a year and his unit was making a lot of money. People thought he was a wild man, but he became bulletproof because his performance won out."
 Mr. Walsh of Tenneco said Mr. Smith's initial moves at G.M. to promote younger executives into top positions was a sign that he understood the importance of finding talented allies within the vast G.M. organization.
 "In a hierarchical organization, bosses don't do much work," Mr. Walsh said. "They just preside and take all the credit. It's criminal. A lot of good young people are buried down there, and their bosses are happy to keep them buried."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 18, 1993, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Jan. 18 about corporations' looking outside for top executives omitted the name of an author of "Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will." Stratford Sherman wrote the book with Noel M. Tichy.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Turning Out the Insiders" Directors at several conpanies confronting losses and falling market share have replaced chief executives who either started the business or climbed the corporate ladder.

HEADLINE: King's Light, Malcolm's Shadow

BYLINE: By Michael Eric Dyson; Michael Eric Dyson is a professor of American civilization and Afro-American studies at Brown University.

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I.

 BODY:
The renewed attention paid to Malcolm X's life and career often trades on the assumption that he was the polar opposite of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm was open to armed black self-defense while King was nonviolent. True. Malcolm blessed black rage, while King preached the virtues of Christian love. True.
Most forcefully, Malcolm spoke the uncompromising truth about black America while King, in Malcolm's words, was a "20th-century Uncle Tom" -- the "best weapon that the white man" has ever had. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
 Though Malcolm revised his views of King -- he later confessed that King's movement was more "militant" than he initially believed -- some members of a young black generation who claim Malcolm as an inspiration have failed to heed his change of heart. In lecture halls across America, I encounter young blacks who believe King was at best a moderate front for white interests.
Their perception that King was a sellout is rooted in two factors. First, it reflects the continued influence of certain varieties of 60's black power and black nationalist rhetoric, which often cast the debate about race in narrow, dualistic terms. Either one was for black separatist racial strategies or one was a pawn of white America. Sadly, this Manichaean perspective persists in pockets of black America.
Second, the belief that King undermined black interests grows out of ignorance about his intellectual growth. Awareness of his evolving thought has been smothered beneath white attempts to make him a safe American hero (witness the softening of his image in commemorative ads) and by attempts of some blacks to portray him as a tool of an amorphous white power structure. Neither view is true.
King began his career optimistic about the possibilities of erasing America's racial problems. He believed that fundamental change would be achieved by appealing to the consciences of white Americans. He was only partially correct.
He and his cohorts were largely successful, especially in the South where their efforts were concentrated. Public accommodations and transportation were desegregated, the Civil Rights Act was passed, the Voting Rights Bill was signed, and Southern apartheid appeared banished.
But the golden era of King's hope quickly passed, especially after its peak in the summer of 1963 when he forever etched into public memory the eloquent words of his Washington "I have a dream" oration. After that summit of keen expectation, his dream dramatically receded, particularly with the Watts riots of 1965, when his doubts about the willingness of whites to work for a racially just society greatly increased.
As King grew more suspicious of our nation's ability to change, his language became more radical, his temperament less patient. Where before he spoke of nonviolent civil disobedience, he began during the planning of the Poor People's March on Washington to speak about "aggressive nonviolence," by which he meant disrupting government and blocking roads during protests. By 1968, King said America was a "sick, neurotic nation" in need of a "revolution of values." He also became more critical of economic inequities, pointing out that America practiced "socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor."
Ten days before his death, King argued before the convention of the Rabbinical Assembly that "temporary segregation" -- the maintenance of certain exclusively black schools and businesses, for example -- may be necessary to prevent the loss of economic power that could result from complete integration. And in the last year of his life, King planned the Poor People's March, uniting poor blacks, whites, Latinos and native Americans in a multiracial coalition that sought to challenge the unfair distribution of wealth, employment and education.
King's later moral and economic principles put him on the outs with journalists and officials, and he saw his popularity plummet before his assassination, at age 39, in Memphis on April 4, 1968. In a January 1967 Gallup poll, King was no longer regarded as one of America's 10 most admired men. Many whites disapproved of his changed views, and many blacks resented the broadening of his moral mission to include opposition to war.
The columnist Carl Rowan called King's stance on Vietnam a "tragic decision," while Whitney Young, then head of the National Urban League, rebuked King for his position. King's scorching retort to Young was uncharacteristically blunt: "Whitney, what you're saying may get you a foundation grant, but it won't get you into the Kingdom of Truth."
Martin Luther King Jr. was a complex and flawed human being, a trumpet for moral and social revolution whose own failures are by now well known. But no one who lived, fought and died as he did can ever be accused of selling out black people or compromising the principles of racial and economic justice. Like Malcolm X, King deserves a second look.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: A Lunch to Remember;
'Power Lunch' With Clinton: Faces and Food for Thought

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
It was billed as a gathering of ordinary people who impressed Bill Clinton and Al Gore and their wives on the way to the White House.
If the "Faces of Hope" luncheon showed anything, it was that ordinary people -- thanks to Oprah Winfrey and Phil Donahue -- are as hip and media savvy as the canniest political operative. It was not a question of who was exploiting whom, but rather how much mileage each could get out of the all-expense paid week of inaugural hoopla. 
 So from a couple of ex-gang members from South-Central Los Angeles to an Indian health worker from Billings, Mont., and a Catholic priest from Newark, the "Faces" -- as they were called by their inaugural staff handlers -- missed few opportunities to drum up support for their causes, concerns and commitments.
 
To Each His Angle
 "We're exploiting this for our purposes," said Msgr. William Linder, the priest who founded the New Communities Corporations, a job-training program for teen-age mothers in Newark. "But we need the President of the country to pull us together, to make us face these serious issues that are eroding the country, the anti-urban sentiment, the class separatism, the racism."
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore recalled the dramatic stories represented by many of their campaign-trail acquaintances, of overcoming homelessness or dealing with catastrophic health problems. Mary Poldruhi, on the other hand, was an entrepreneur who served the Clintons and Gores at her restaurant in Parma, Ohio, last August. After the lunch, Hillary Clinton asked Ms. Poldruhi if she would like to cater a party in the White House.
"This has been great for business," said Ms. Poldruhi. "You couldn't buy publicity like this."
When the Clintons entered the Old Reading Room of the Folger Shakespeare Library, the 53 guests, shy and tentative, stood and applauded. Bill Clinton, still unaccustomed to Presidential protocol, told the group several times to sit down. He elicited laughter when he chided, "You're messing up the program."
The guests continued to stand, and only after he had shaken hands with everyone at his table and assured everyone that he would circulate among the nine tables were they were seated. Only then did they sit down to a luncheon that began with silver-dollar Maryland crab cakes, proceeded through warm grilled winter vegetables and tenderloin of beef and ended with Yankee Doodle fruit cobbler.
The lunch, along with week of festivities for the group, will cost more than $500,000 and is being paid for by the inauguration committee.
Leon Gullette and Charles Rachal, former rival gang members who now run an anti-gang community group called South-Central Los Angeles Youth and Community Services, supplemented the official program of museum trips and concert outings with a formidable schedule of their own. Shepherded by Shy Jefferson, an actress and promoter from Los Angeles, the two spoke to the packed congregation of a Baptist church Sunday morning, did a local radio talk show and talked at several area high schools. Like that of many of the "Faces," their experiences here were being chronicled by television cameras. Selena Davis of the BBC was gathering film for a documentary on the two.
"I'm pleased to have been invited," said Mr. Gullette, a 27-year-old who once was in the Bloods, as he waited Sunday for events on the Mall to begin. "But this is not just about partying. This is about the contacts I can make and the resources I can take back to the neighborhood. This is more or less a business trip."
 
Dreaming of Change
 Mr. Rachal, a 28-year-old former Crips member who served three years in prison for manslaughter in the killing of a drug dealer, said: "I want to get to talk to as many people as possible. I want to let them understand that my life is no different than theirs."
Schmoozing with the most powerful man in America fosters an assumption that some of that power just might rub off. In his fellow guests, Mr. Rachal saw the potential for an activist organization.
"We could form a new foundation, one that would press for the social and economic changes, the awareness of each of problems that each of us represents," he said.
Marjorie Bear Don't Walk, who met Tipper Gore in October on the campaign trail, recognized the contrived nature of the gathering but had high hopes nevertheless.
"Am I here because I'm the only Native American?" said Mrs. Bear Don't Walk, who is a director of the Indian Health Board of Billings. "I don't know, but it's a tremendous opportunity here for me. Lots of people who have not wanted my opinion, all of a sudden all these people want my opinion. It gives me a chance to talk about what I'm interested in: Native American women and upgrading them to their rightful place, minority women who have been at the bottom."
 
A High-School Reunion
 This is not to say that there was not real excitement about being wined and dined by the next President of the United States, about getting to hear Linda Ronstadt and Aretha Franklin, about seeing the celebrity performances at the Lincoln Memorial an arm's length away, having priority seats at the inauguration itself -- not to mention the chance to eat some power lunch.
Ms. Poldruhi's fiance, Alan Fisher, said the experience was "fantastic, like a high school reunion from a school I don't remember going to."
There was an undeniable air of hope and good will toward the President-elect, particularly after Mr. Clinton addressed the group.
Standing in front of a huge fireplace, Mr. Clinton talked about the campaign trail, where he not only noticed the problems of the country but saw that people no longer believed they could make a difference.
 
'I'll Remember You'
 He said the diversity of the group and its experiences would inspire him in his future job.
"So I will make my mistakes, but I also want you to know that every day I'll remember you," he said. "The manipulations of power doesn't amount to a hill of beans unless we are spending all the money that you send us to help deal with your problems in an honest and forthright way."
Danny Kronenfeld, who sat next to Mr. Clinton at the luncheon, said it was "too early to be cynical." Mr. Kronenfeld, who is director of the Henry Street Settlement on Manhattan's Lower East Side, said Mr. Clinton's philosophy about government and people made the group different from President Bush's Points of Light volunteers.
J. E. Paisley, who had overcome the paralysis of a stroke, said: "The one thing I found about hope is that first you've got to feel good and believe. And if you understand that things can change, it's easy to start working to make them change. Bill makes people feel good about the possibility of changing. These people here are like 50 different books, and I can't wait to read every one."

HEADLINE: Hunting for Accord on Alaska Wolves

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINTO, Alaska, Jan. 17

 BODY:
The great wolf debate swarmed into this small Indian village aboard a squadron of state-chartered airplanes today as Alaska officials sought to convince conservationists and the American public that wolf killing has a beneficial side.
Greeted by putt-putting snowmobiles, barking sled dogs and the howling wind off the swampy Minto Flats, some 30 participants and reporters who had come from the Alaska Wolf Summit conference in Fairbanks were ushered to a school gymnasium. There, Athabascan Indian speakers, taking time from preparations for a traditional funeral feast and the Miami-Buffalo game on satellite television, told of how their ability to keep moose meat on their families' tables was being threatened by those people from far away who want to protect wolves. 
 "For them to live in the city of San Francisco, or New York, and to say things like that about the way we live here in Minto, Alaska, which they probably never even heard of, that's a bunch of crock," said Ken Charlie, an Athabascan leader in his 40's.
 
Debate, but No Agreement
 After two days of debate here and in Fairbanks, the two sides could not agree on what should be done, if anything, with Alaska's wolves. State officials still want to shoot more of them; conservationists still want to let nature take its course. But in the meantime the environmentalists, sport hunters, tourism officials, wildlife biologists and reporters who attended had a chance to cross a cultural chasm in their brief visit to Minto.
Their five-plane junket from Fairbanks, 50 air miles away, came on the second day of the weekend wolf conference. The three-day meeting there was an effort by Gov. Walter J. Hickel to recover from the criticism the state's plan to shoot wolves from helicopters.
 
Fewer Wolves, Better Hunting
 Backers of the plan do not argue that there is an overpopulation of wolves. Nor is there an underpopulation of the moose and caribou that wolves prey on. Rather, the idea is that by reducing the number of wolves, the numbers of sport animals can be increased, hunting will improve and the state will benefit from increased tourism. In the plan approved by the Alaska Board of Game in November, up to 400 wolves were to be killed this year and hundreds more in succeeding years.
Tens of thousands of letters, telephone calls and faxes poured into the state in protest. The Fund for Animals began pushing an international tourist boycott of Alaska. By December, Governor Hickel, himself a hotel owner, called off the wolf hunt and the Fund for Animals called off its boycott.
Tourism is the No. 3 industry in Alaska in economic impact (oil and natural gas are No. 1 and fishing is No. 2). Officials estimate that had the boycott gone on, it would have cost the Alaskan economy $85 million this year.
Mr. Hickel, who ran for governor on the Alaska Independence ticket, called the Wolf Summit meeting in the hope that some consensus on wolves would emerge if only the sides in the issue could sit down together and hear each other out.
Though many of the people who traveled to Minto, including the 73-year-old Mr. Hickel, joined villagers in a traditional dance before the planes departed, the divide between the sides remained, and the state's efforts to bring the Indians into the debate may have backfired.
Mr. Hickel had hoped that testimony from Indian elders on how they feed their families would convince some of the conservationists that shooting wolves could be appropriate. But while many of the wolf protectors agreed that killing wolves might be justified to help the villagers here, they noted the state's plan was not intended for that purpose.
 
'It's a Ruse'
 "They're being used," Paul Joslin, the research director of Wolf Haven International, a wolf protection group, said of the Indians after leaving Minto. "In the context of the wolf control program as proposed, it's a ruse. If the intent is to really help the people with subsistence needs, they wouldn't be doing it in the Anchorage-Fairbanks area."
Minto is far from any of the areas where the wolf shooting would have occurred. While villagers differed over how serious wolf predation is today, they generally agreed that a major wolf-reduction program in the 1970's allowed the return of a moose population that had declined and left subsistence hunters with empty meat pots.
About 100 residents, nearly half the population here, tramped through the deep snow blanketing the village to reach the school gym for the two-hour meeting. They brought smoked salmon and store-bought salami for their guests.
Peter John, the white-haired, 93-year-old traditional chief of Alaska's Athabascan Indians, was the first to speak. Slowly stepping up to the microphone, and dressed in mocassins and a beaded skin vest, he struggled to find the English words to express his feelings. When he couldn't, he spoke in his native language, which only a few of his own people speak fluently anymore.
"I don't know how to read and write, but the things I know, no one in this room would understand," said Mr. John, who has lived through famines and epidemics, and the days when his people practiced their own wolf control by attacking dens with axes.
"Something that really bothers the Minto people, a lot of people don't understand what the wolf is. They're nothing to play with. They're not something you want to pet, no way. They're there to kill. Killing two moose is like killing two rabbits."
In Fairbanks, conservationists were wildly outnumbered as they arrived for the conference. In the snowy parking lot, it looked like a casting call for a "Northern Exposure" episode: dozens of bearded men in brown canvas overalls, camouflage jackets and fur hats of all descriptions. Near a van, by a collection of signs sporting states' rights slogans, many of which could not be printed in a newspaper, a pregnant woman argued with a reporter. As she became animated, the nose of the slightly shrunken wolf head on her fur hat bobbed against her forehead.
Inside, the main event took place, appropriately enough, on an ice hockey rink, a carpet barely holding back the chill.
Several wildlife biologists said the state's wolf control plan was biologically sound, but the debate turned more on ethics and emotions.
"They did not accurately gauge the near reverence that many people feel for the wolf as a symbol of wilderness, perseverance and beauty," said George LaPointe of the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies in Baton Rouge, La.
But he added that while Americans had "a notion of Alaska as a vast wilderness with sled dogs and native people that should be managed as our theme park," they also had a "tendency to forget that Alaska's 585,000 people have an important and direct stake in what's going on in Alaska, particularly with fish and wildlife management."

HEADLINE: U.S. SECURITY TEAM STILL INCOMPLETE

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Two days before he inherits a series of foreign policy crises, President-elect Bill Clinton has assembled a team of foreign policy advisers but has yet to fill most of his senior defense positions, transition officials said today.
Unlike President Bush, whose only immediate foreign policy crisis upon assuming office in 1989 was how fast the Soviets would leave Afghanistan, Mr. Clinton must deal with full-blown crises in Iraq, Somalia, the Balkans, Haiti and Russia. 
 Although he has promised a foreign policy campaign of preventive diplomacy so crises will not engulf him, and thus distract from his domestic economic agenda, he has been slow to fill crucial positions at both the Pentagon and State Department.
 
The Official Explanations
 Secretary of State-designate Warren M. Christopher had told aides to expect announcements of key State Department decisions last week. The announcement was put off until this afternoon, and then put off again until Tuesday morning.
There were three official explanations: that security checks on some nominees had not been completed; that George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, had a scheduling problem, and that Mr. Christopher was absorbed in responding in writing to more than 400 questions posed by Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Committee votes Tuesday on Mr. Christopher's nomination.
Senior members of the transition team said that among the appointments the Clinton team will announce on Wednesday are Peter Tarnoff, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and Joan E. Spiro, a senior executive at American Express, as Under Secretary for Economic Affairs.
Also to be announced are Lynn Davis, a vice president and arms control expert at the Rand Corporation, as Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, and Tim Wirth, a former senator from Colorado, as Under Secretary for Global Affairs, a new post that will encompass human rights, narcotics, refugees and the environment.
Mr. Clinton is also expected to name Strobe Talbott, Time Magazine's editor at large and foreign policy columnist, as special representative to the former Soviet republics.
Frank G. Wisner, Under Secretary of State for International Security Affairs, will replace Paul D. Wolfowitz as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.
J. Brian Atwood, who currently heads the transition team at the State Department, is under consideration for one of two jobs: head of the Agency for International Development or Under Secretary for Mangement.
 
. . . And Later . . .
 A number of other appointees have been chosen, but they are not expected to be announced on Wednesday: Winston Lord, a Republican who was an Ambassador to China and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and George E. Moose, a career foreign service officer and former Ambassador to Senegal, as Assistant Secretary for African Affairs.
Edward P. Djerejian, Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, is to retain his position. Bernard Aronson will stay on as Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs for "some period of time," said one senior transition official, who added that Mario Baeza, a Cuban-American lawyer, is under consideration for the post.
Dennis Ross, currently the head of Policy Planning, will become a consultant to the State Department on the Middle East peace process. He will be aided by Martin Indyk, the head of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who will be responsible for Arab-Israeli issues at the National Security Council.
 
A Spokesman to Stay
 Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, has been asked to stay on.
Michael Mandelbaum, a professor of International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, was offered the position of Director of Policy Planning but turned it down, transition aides said.
In a television interview on Sunday, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney suggested that Mr. Clinton's slow progress on appointments could damage much-needed continuity in foreign policy. "In about 72 hours, the Clinton people will take control of the national security establishment," he said, "and as yet most of the key spots below the Cabinet level have not been filled." He noted that of 45 Defense posts that require confrimation, only one, Les Aspin, his successor, has been named.
On some issues, the departing and arriving Administrations have coordinated their strategies. Regarding Haiti, for example, both teams are working closely with a United Nations envoy, Dante Caputo, to conduct talks on a reconciliation between leaders of the military junta and the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
But the situation in the Balkans is another matter. Senior officials in the new Administration have said that they will not be comfortable with devising their policy until they take over the intelligence and military apparatus.

HEADLINE: Energy Nominee Plans Broad Agenda

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration plans to make the modernization of the Russian oil industry a priority of the Energy Department under a program to aid American industry, stabilize world oil markets and assist Russian democracy by providing hard currency.
That goal was one of a broad range of programs outlined by Hazel R. O'Leary, the nominee for Energy Secretary, in a written response to questions from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
 Mrs. O'Leary, who goes before the panel on Tuesday, also said that as Energy Secretary she was prepared to take these steps:
*Speed work on Federal nuclear waste repositories in New Mexico and Nevada.
*Oppose increasing taxes on coal, oil and gasoline.
*Assist Vice President-elect Al Gore in coordinating Federal research in order to quicken development of new environmental technologies.
*Expand a program established by President Bush to provide technical assistance, money and equipment so that Russia and other former Soviet republics operate their nuclear power reactors more safely.
*Press for changes in the Energy Department's research budget to support the development of more efficient buildings and appliances, as well as promote cleaner sources of energy like wind, solar and natural gas.
 
Dismay of Nuclear Foes
 Mrs. O'Leary's responses were made available by the Safe Energy Communication Council, an anti-nuclear group in Washington, which obtained them from a Senate staff member. Scott Denman, the group's director, said he was worried about Mrs. O'Leary's statements about radioactive waste.
"Rather than shifting into high gear to bury the waste," he said, "we believe a White House commission is necessary to re-evaluate these programs to restore public trust."
President-elect Bill Clinton has said little about solving the country's problems in locating new nuclear waste dumps. Nor has he said much about aiding the Russian oil and nuclear industries. But Mrs. O'Leary said that if she was confirmed as Energy Secretary the Clinton Administration would have "a great interest" in making Soviet-designed nuclear reactors safe. Helping Russian oil producers would be a priority, she said.
"Russian economic performance is declining, which threatens its transition to democracy, and less oil on world markets increases the chances for a tightening in the marketplace once the pace of world economic growth increases," she said. "These developments would have adverse impacts on our national security and our economy."
 
Glee of Nuclear Industry
 Mrs. O'Leary is a 55-year-old lawyer and executive vice president of the Northern States Power Company, an electric utility in Minneapolis. A former energy official in the Ford and Carter Administrations, she was chosen by Mr. Clinton after prominent Democratic and Republican Senators criticized the energy policies of their colleague, former Senator Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado, who for months had been the front-runner for the job. The selection of Mrs. O'Leary, a black woman, also helped to quieten criticism from groups that had been pressing Mr. Clinton to fulfill his pledge of diversity in his Cabinet.
Mrs. O'Leary's nomination has produced joy in the American nuclear and coal industries because of her work for Northern States, one of the utilities most dependent on these two conventional energy sources to generate power.
The Clinton Administration's proposal to help the Russian oil and nuclear industries is not new. Small programs in both areas were begun by James D. Watkins, the Energy Secretary whose aides led American oil industry executives to meet Russian oil industry leaders in Siberia last year. Mr. Watkins also assembled teams of Energy Department nuclear experts to help the Russians and several Baltic nations begin to improve the management of nuclear reactors. Two nuclear training centers are being established in Russia and Ukraine, said William Young, the Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy.
 
Aid Here, Aid There
 But Mrs. O'Leary's intention to make both projects a priority in the Administration would be an important shift in policy, and it received a mixed reception today.
Daniel H. Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and author of "The Prize," a Pulitzer Prize winning history of the oil industry, said it would help American oil companies, who will have the chance to sell equipment and services to revitalized Russian producers. "History will say that these were crucial years for the Russians and they will say whether the West was wise in dealing with the situation or we missed the boat," he said.
But Denise A. Bode, the president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a Washington-based lobby group for oil and gas producers, said her members would be unhappy. "What we're looking for as far as the Energy Department is concerned is for the Clinton Administration to try and revitalize the domestic industry," she said. "I'm not sure helping the Russians should be a priority at all, with 450,000 jobs lost in the last 10 years in the United States in this industry. That was what the Clinton energy folks said was a top priority."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION;
Americans Have High Hopes for Clinton, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Americans await Bill Clinton's Presidency with revived optimism about the nation and its economy and a pre-inaugural burst of confidence in him as an effective leader who cares about them, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
The public's high hopes for Mr. Clinton's term include one critical and difficult expectation: that he keep his campaign promise to change the nation's health-care system. While the poll suggests much indifference to campaign promises health care is the exception. 
 Generally, Mr. Clinton's high marks resemble those that new Presidents usually receive. For example, 7 Americans in 10 said they were optimistic "about the next four years with Bill Clinton," almost exactly as many as said so of Ronald Reagan and George Bush in polls just before they took the oath of office.
Three-fourths said they thought the President-elect cared "about the needs and problems" of people like themselves, a measure better than Mr. Bush's four years ago. And three-fifths of the 1,179 adults polled last Tuesday through Thursday said Mr. Clinton could deal with whatever they considered the nation's most urgent problem, from the economy to the deficit to health care.
 
Promises, Promises
 Skepticism over his campaign promises did not seem to matter. Mr. Clinton recorded these ratings although only 7 percent said he would try to keep all of his campaign promises and 36 percent predicted he would try to keep most of them. The poll, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, was conducted as news reports detailed retreats from campaign pledges on the deficit and a middle-class tax cut.
In an era when politicians and their promises raise eyebrows more often than confidence, the answers to the telephone poll did suggest that one vow matters most of all to his future. That is his pledge to reduce health-care costs and guarantee affordable health insurance to every American.
"The American health-care system costs too much and does not work," Mr. Clinton said in "Putting People First," a September campaign manifesto. "In the first year of a Clinton-Gore Administration, that will change. We will send a national health-care plan to Congress and we will fight to pass it. No American family should have to go from the doctor's office to the poorhouse."
The poll showed the political salience of health care. While only a quarter said Mr. Clinton would cut the deficit significantly or reduce taxes on the middle class, 66 percent said he would "make significant progress in getting health insurance for all Americans." That confidence extended even to majorities of conservatives and Bush voters.
That expectation immediately creates opportunity -- and risk. Throughout the poll, respondents ranked health care near the top of national problems. Unlike his performance on more general goals, like improving education or the environment, the new President's progress on this issue can be graded by passage of a bill on health insurance. And while Mr. Clinton's plan is at least three months off, Congressional divisions and powerful lobbying interests are sure to make passage difficult.
 
Feeling Better About Bush
 As Mr. Clinton enters amid high hopes, President Bush exits to softening judgments. Fifty-four percent of those polled said they approved of his four years' stewardship. It was the first time since late 1991 that a clear majority backed him.
Mr. Bush's stern policy toward Iraq clearly contributed to his standing, but the gains had begun in December after his decision to aid starving Somalis. And at the same time, 59 percent said they thought he was "hiding something the public ought to know" about the Iran-contra matter. The poll was completed before material from his diaries was made public on Friday.
But an overwhelming majority, 72 percent, still disapproved of his handling of the economy. That was recorded even though this poll confirmed that more Americans now think the economy is getting better than believe it worsening. That view, first detected in a Times/CBS News Poll in December, reverses at least six years of steady economic pessimism.
 
Optimism on Economy
 The economic hopes are clearly contributing to the general freshening of the national mood. While 26 percent said the economy was improving now (compared with 18 percent who said it was getting worse), 53 percent said it would be better after Mr. Clinton's term and only 13 percent said it would be worse. Even 31 percent of Bush voters said it would improve, while 24 percent said it would worsen.
To measure expectations about the future, the poll asked respondents to assign a number between 1 and 10 on "how things are going" in the nation today, and how they expect the situation will be five years from now. The average rating was 5.20 for today and 5.75 for five years hence.
The current ratings were neither the best nor the worst recorded in the 14 years the Times/CBS News Poll has used them. The best number for the present was a 6.05, measured when Mr. Bush took office, and a 4.63 last yearwas the worst. The best estimate for the future was a 6.48 as Mr. Reagan began his second term, while the worst was 4.30 in 1979, late in Jimmy Carter's Presidency.
In all, 48 percent of the respondents in this poll said the nation would be better off in five years and 30 percent said it would be worse. The last time that many foresaw improvement was in June 1983.
One sharply increased rating for Mr. Clinton came on the subject of change. Just before the election, 43 percent of those polled said he could "bring about the kind of changes the country needs." Now, 57 percent said he could. Blacks and people with less than a high school education or with family incomes under $15,000 were particularly confident of his leadership.
 
Perot Voters for Clinton
 Last year's most intense critic of failed government, Ross Perot, had just re-entered the news as the poll was begun, seeking money for his organization and promising to serve as watchdog over the Clinton Administration. Forty-five percent of the respondents said they had a favorable opinion of him while 26 percent said they had an unfavorable view. The best favorable rating he ever recorded before was 29 percent, in October, and even then 32 percent and negative view.
People who said they voted for Mr. Perot in November seemed ready to give the new President a chance. Seventy-three percent expected Mr. Clinton to make significant progress on health care, and majorities foresaw progress on education, jobs, the environment and government ethics. More Perot voters thought he would accomplish needed change than thought he would not, and more had a favorable view of him than a negative one.

HEADLINE: Suit Threatens Indigent-Care System

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
Every year, Jamaica Hospital in Queens treats thousands of patients like Elba Echevarria, who arrived at its emergency room last summer with a crushed finger and no health insurance.
"I was grateful to them because I didn't have anyplace else to go," said Mrs. Echevarria, 47, a nurse's aide whose $7.50-an-hour job did not include benefits. 
 Now out of work and a diabetic, Mrs. Echevarria has racked up $3,129 in medical bills, paid for by Jamaica as part of its state-mandated mission to treat anyone who comes in, regardless of ability to pay. But because of a pending lawsuit, care for Mrs. Echevarria and some two million New Yorkers like her -- too poor for health insurance, not poor enough for Medicaid -- is gravely threatened.
The lawsuit, brought by a group of New York City trade unions that are trying to reduce medical costs for their members, challenges the state system of assessing surcharges to finance a $1.1 billion-a-year fund set up to reimburse hospitals for treating people who cannot pay their bills. Officials are warning that if the state loses the case, as New Jersey lost a similar lawsuit last year, its complex financing mechanism might crumble, leaving the state without money to pay for indigent care and many inner-city hospitals facing bankruptcy.
 
'Necessary Services'
 "There are some hospitals that wouldn't be able to sustain the losses," said David P. Rosen, the president of Jamaica Hospital. "They would be crippled to the point where they could no longer provide necessary services."
That would force Mrs. Echevarria to look elsewhere for treatment. But Jamaica is the only hospital around, in an area where 25 percent of the people are considered too poor to pay their hospital bills. If it closed, not only would it place more strains on other hospitals in the city, but many patients would lose their only hope of getting treatment in their own neighborhood.
Further complicating matters is another lawsuit challenging other aspects of the financing system, including a 13 percent hospital bill surcharge on commercial insurers meant to shore up the state's nonprofit Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, and an 11 percent surcharge that is paid into the state's general fund. All told, the lawsuit by commercial insurers who do not want to pay the surcharges represents a serious threat to the state's entire health-care system.
"We have a financing system that would make Rube Goldberg blush, and essentially this would unplug the whole Rube Goldberg machine," said Dr. John Rugge, chairman of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Health Care Advisory Board, a panel that studies health care in the state. If the state loses the indigent-care lawsuit, he said, "there would be total chaos."
 
New Jersey Reorganizes
 The unions' suit challenges the state's system of paying for indigent care through a surcharge, averaging 5.6 percent, tacked onto hospital bills paid by insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or the state through its Medicaid program. The unions are arguing that the surcharge violates the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known commonly as Erisa, which holds that employee contributions to union benefit funds can be used only for the "sole and exclusive benefit" of workers and their families.
The unions are not arguing that indigent people should not receive care. But they say that with medical costs so high for their own members, it is unfair to raise costs any higher.
In New Jersey, a Federal judge ruled last year that the indigent-care system in that state violated the Erisa statute. In response, New Jersey passed a bill reorganizing the way its hospitals are financed. Under the new system, the state's unemployment insurance fund will help pay for indigent care for three years. The state will then set up a program providing insurance to about half of the uninsured population; the hospitals will be forced to take care of the rest on their own.
In New York, no one seems to know what will happen if the system is declared illegal, although there is talk of proposing new taxes, or of letting the hospitals return to the old system of charging any rate they want. "Most people don't want to face up to it," said Stephen J. Boese, associate director for policy development for the Medical Society of the State of New York.
The issue of people with no insurance is one of the thorniest facing health-care officials, and experts argue that it is society's problem, not just the affected people's.
 
A Change in '83
 "It's a question of humanity more than anything else," said Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, which represents hospitals in the metropolitan area. "What kind of responsibility do we have for these patients? For many years, the state has said that they shouldn't be left out in the street just because they don't have an insurance card."
Before 1983, New York State's hospitals had to absorb the cost of indigent care, raising hospital bills to make up the difference. But that year, the state set up a system regulating hospital rates. And after intense lobbying by inner-city hospitals who have the largest share of uninsured patients, the state established the Bad Debt and Charity Care pool.
The money is used to compensate hospitals for the cost of treating patients who cannot pay their bills and to help cover their losses for some of their clinic and emergency room costs. Most hospitals are reimbursed for about 30 percent of their bad debt costs; hospitals designated financially distressed, like Jamaica, get something closer to 100 percent.
 
Higher Hospital Fees
 The idea behind the fund is simple: people who can afford health care should subsidize people who cannot, through higher hospital fees. The method differs from a broad-based tax used to finance a program like Medicaid.
"It's a societal cost that in my opinion should be borne by all taxpayers, but as a fallback it's not unreasonable to add on costs to all health-care providers," Mr. Rosen said. "It's the same principle used in other industries when people don't pay. In the clothing business, if someone shoplifts, the price of shirts goes up for everybody else."
Steven C. Anderman, chief of the state Health Department's division of health-care financing, said that it made perfect sense to have some groups pay for others' care. "The question is, what are you going to do with health-care reform when a group can take themselves out and say, 'Well, we don't like it?' " he said. "What should we do if we say we want to do immunizations and an insurance plan says, 'I don't want to offer that?' "
In the case, which is to be heard by Judge Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the state's lawyers are arguing that New Jersey's experience does not apply here because New Jersey's courts are in a different Federal circuit from New York's. In addition, they say, they might have a better chance of winning because of a 1984 case called Rebaldo v. Cuomo, in which a Federal appellate panel in New York ruled that the state's method of setting rates at that time did not violate Erisa.
 
State vs. Federal Mandates
 But Edward J. Groarke, who is representing the unions, said that the New Jersey decision validates his arguments in this case. "In this case, the state regulation mandating these ad-ons is pre-empted by the Federal mandates," he said.
All this seems remote when Mrs. Echevarria speaks to administrators at Jamaica, asking for care and saying, again and again, that she cannot pay.
Her story seems a classic illustration of red tape, confusion and expense that points up the problems in a health-care system where some people have insurance and others do not.
For years, she said, she was healthy and it did not matter that she was uninsured. But since her finger injury last summer, she has been jumping through hoops to get some form of public assistance. She applied for Medicaid, but was told that she was not poor enough to qualify, a decision she is appealing. She could no longer work. And then she slipped and broke her leg.
Her situation is not at all uncommon, said Frederick Beekman, vice president of ambulatory care at Jamaica, who deals daily with people who cannot pay their bills, many of whom have jobs and families and simply cannot afford health insurance.
"If these people cannot pay, what are we supposed to do?" he asked. "Go down to their house and take their things?"

PRESIDENT-ELECT BILL CLINTON
In an address yesterday to diplomats at Georgetown University
"The foreign policy of my Administration will be built upon three pillars: 
 First, we will make the economic security of our own nation a primary goal of our foreign policy. Here in America we cannot sustain an active engagement abroad without a sound economy at home. And yet we cannot prosper at home unless we are engaged abroad. We will, therefore, seek economic strength at home through increased productivity, even as we seek to ensure that global commerce is rooted in principles of openness, fairness and reciprocity.
Second, our foreign policy will be based on a restructuring of our armed forces to meet new and continuing threats to our security interests and the international peace. We will continue to prudently reduce defense spending. But potential aggressors should be clear about American resolve. We do not relish the prospect of military force but, when necessary, we will not shrink from using it when all appropriate diplomatic measures have been exhausted.
Third, my Administrations foreign policy will be rooted in the democratic principles and institutions which unite our own county and to which so many now around the world aspire. The spread of democratic values has given the hope of freedome to millions all across the world, who have endured decades of oppression. Whenever possible we will support those who share our values because it is in the interests of American and the world at large for us to do so."

HEADLINE: And So to Bed, Thanks to Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The two little boys had a roof over their heads, but no beds to sleep in.
Their mother, Aneila Huff-Ford, who is unemployed and raising her sons by herself, found it increasingly difficult to provide for them. The city found them a subsidized apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, and gave them $205 to furnish it. But try as she would, Ms. Huff-Ford could hardly buy two mattresses for that amount, let alone two beds. 
 "It was a basic need, but I couldn't afford it," Ms. Huff-Ford, 24, said the other day.
"My older son slept on the living-room couch and my youngest son slept with me for about a year," she said, referring to Donovan, who is now 5, and Dimitrius, 3.
 
A Grant for Beds
 But with a grant from Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, Ms. Huff-Ford was able to buy her sons a bunk bed.
Catholic Charities is one of seven agencies aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. The fund helps thousands of children who lack food, clothing, shelter and health care. The New York Times pays the expenses of the campaign, so all contributions are given directly to the charities. This year's appeal, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
Until Catholic Charities came to her aid about a year ago, Ms. Huff-Ford had searched for help in vain. After she appealed to a number of city agencies without success, one charity offered to sell her some used beds, but she had reservations. "I'm an adult, so it's O.K. if I sleep on a used bed, but I don't want my children to," she said.
As a last resort, Ms. Huff-Ford consulted the phone book. There, in the "Social and Human Services" section, she saw a bold-face listing for Catholic Charities.
Sister Mary George, the director of the Catholic Charities office in Woodside, Queens, recommended an inexpensive furniture store in Long Island City. Ms. Huff-Ford went there with the $205 she had from public assistance, and Catholic Charities arranged to pay the balance of the cost of the beds, $231.35, with money from the Neediest Fund.
Now that the boys have their own beds, "they're happy, and mommy's happy, too, because I have a bed to myself," Ms. Huff-Ford said.
The top bunk, of course, is Donovan's. At night, he likes to pretend to read stories to his younger brother. "He looks at the pictures and he makes up the story," Ms. Huff-Ford said. Donovan's current favorite is "Pretzel," by Margaret and H. A. Rey. "I remember it from when I was little," she said.
When Dimitrius enters day-care, Ms. Huff-Ford plans to return to school herself; she now has a high-school diploma and graduated from a vocational school for typing. She had planned to study business administration, but now has become interested in social work. "I just want to give something back," she said.
Ms. Huff-Ford said she was inspired by the help she received from Catholic Charities. "I needed help, and Catholic Charities was there for me," she said. "Here, they listened to me."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: Generations of Transitions;
Former Torch Passers Reflect on Clinton's Daunting Task

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
To Herbert Brownell Jr., Bill Clinton's experience is renewed proof that no incoming President has anything approaching complete control of his agenda. Hamilton Jordan urges Mr. Clinton to fight the natural tendency to overreact to previous administrations' failings. Michael K. Deaver hopes the Clinton team understands that "what's in the package counts as much as the wrapping."
Since the end of World War II, eight new Presidents have moved into the White House. Two of them succeeded to power suddenly -- Lyndon B. Johnson on the death of John F. Kennedy and Gerald R. Ford on the resignation of Richard M. Nixon. The six others, accompanied by leading members of their administrations, went through what Mr. Clinton and his associates are experiencing now. 
 Today survivors of each of those transitions spent a few moments reflecting on what has changed in the intervening years and what has not.
Forty years ago, Mr. Brownell, Dwight D. Eisenhower's top strategist in his Presidential campaign, was preparing to take office as Attorney General. Now a New York lawyer, nearing his 89th birthday on Feb. 20, he has been watching events in Little Rock, Ark., and Washington, and he says he has been struck again by the power of events outside a President-elect's control to blow him off course, even when he is the repository of the hopes of much of the nation.
 
Ike Knew Every Leader
 "I think he was entirely genuine when he talked in the campaign about the urgency of the need to repair the economy, and his determination to rescue the country from depression," Mr. Brownell said, referring to Mr. Clinton. "But the rash of international problems will make it hard for him, and it's going to take him a while to establish relationships with people in London, Bonn, Tokyo.
"For Ike it was different. He had been through the war, and he knew every leader in the western world by his first name. His great priority was to cement the wartime alliance and turn his party away from isolationism. In that area he was the cock of the walk, but unlike Clinton he had a lot to learn about domestic policy, which posed significant problems for us."
Thirty-two years ago, Theodore C. Sorensen was putting the finishing touches on Kennedy's Inaugural Address, the most memorable of the modern era. On Jan. 21, 1961, he moved into the White House at Kennedy's right hand, as special counsel to the President. Now 64, he, too, has been a New York lawyer since leaving since leaving office in Washington.
"He had a bad week last week," said Mr. Sorensen about the President-elect, "but that's a very minor matter in the ultimate balance."
 
In Charge of the Henhouse
 Mr. Sorensen sees the crises in the Middle East, Bosnia and Somalia as parallels to the hot spots that faced the Kennedy Administration: Cuba, Berlin, the Congo, Laos, Vietnam.
"I think that it was Douglas MacArthur who came by and told the President, 'The chickens of the past eight years are coming home to roost and you're in charge of the henhouse,' " he recalled. "John Fischer wrote in Harper's sometime in 1961 that while Kennedy 'was still trying to move in the furniture, in effect, he found the roof falling in and the doors blowing off.'
"The same thing seems to be happening to Bill Clinton, before he can even get to know the senior career military and diplomatic and intelligence people, and figure out which ones are good and which ones just have reputations."
Twenty-four years ago, Gerald L. Warren went to work as an assistant press secretary in the Nixon White House. He survived the Watergate scandal without damage, and now, at 62, he is the editor of The San Diego Union-Tribune.
"The thing that bothers me," Mr. Warren said, "is that they seem to be trying to extend the campaign into the Presidency. I worry about the Clinton people being ready to go because I remember the frantic rush we were in to fill the sub-Cabinet. We had Nixon's big policy book to go by, and we had Kissinger and Moynihan working away in the basement -- Amazing! -- but the work is so much harder than you anticipate. You have to start so fast, with empty bookcases and no user's manual."
 
No Way to Prepare
 Sixteen years ago, Mr. Jordan was faced with the awesome prospect of taking over as White House chief of staff for Jimmy Carter, in fact if not in name, without ever having worked in Washington. Now, at 48, he is an official with Whittle Communications, a business and education venture in Knoxville, Tenn. He had a short, unhappy run last year as an official of Ross Perot's campaign.
"There's no way for anyone to prepare for this thing, if you think about it," he said. "If the new President is a governor, he doesn't know Washington. If he's a senator, he doesn't know the executive branch. And it's harder now than it once was.
"Every administration tends to be an overreaction to the last. We went in because of Watergate, and in that environment we wanted to be loose, informal, open, press conference every week, no White House perks, and it didn't work. You have to strike a balance. Clinton needs to. I hope the inaugural will get them off to a better start, give them a firebreak and a new beginning."
Having staged elaborate media carnivals during the 1980 Presidential campaign, Mr. Deaver was set 12 years ago to take over as deputy chief of staff in the Reagan White House. Later he went into big-time lobbying, and in 1987 he had to pay a $100,000 fine after conviction on charges of lying about his activities. But he remains one of Washington's keener and more pungent political figures.
 
'More Than He Can Deliver'
 "Mr. Clinton has promised more than he can deliver, and that could be a big problem," said Mr. Deaver, who is now 54 and back at work in public relations in the capital. "I got the sense during the campaign that it had more specifics than any I'd ever seen. People are fearful. They want answers and not just pageantry.
"We had our imagery and symbolism, sure. But there was never any question about what Ronald Reagan wanted to do when he came to town, and no question that he did what he said he was going to do. That's why he left office with a 70 percent approval rating. I'm not sure that they understand that."
Only four years ago, Peter B. Teeley was gripped in the hoopla of inaugural week as his old friend, George Bush, prepared to move up from the Vice Presidency to the Presidency. For a time he was a member of Mr. Bush's kitchen cabinet, an informal adviser. Now Ambassador to Canada, Mr. Teeley, at 52, anticipates staying on for several months under Mr. Clinton.
"This is significantly different from what happened to us," Mr. Teeter said by telephone from Ottawa. "You have thousands of people coming from every corner of the country who have never participated in government before. Naturally, they are tremendously exited. Frankly, we never had the energy, enthusiasm and creativity you get when you have a change of parties."

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 3.79 in Active Holiday Trading

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Investors took no holiday from buying cyclical stocks yesterday, as companies that would prosper the most in an accelerating recovery stood out in an otherwise mixed market.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.79, about a tenth of a percentage point, to 3,274.91, with the broader Standard & Poor's 500 off by a hair. 
 The Nasdaq Composite average finished with a narrow gain of nearly a point, to 698.13, another record.
The Dow Jones transportation average, however, jumped 13.90 points, to 1,520.11, the equivalent of about 30 points for the industrial list. Airlines and truckers stand to benefit from a stronger economy at home without suffering much from recessions abroad.
Many traders and money managers took off for the observance of the the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. birthday holiday yesterday. But what several strategists called a quiet session actually had nearly average volume of 204.1 million -- slow only in comparison with the hectic trading so far this year.
Stable market averages continued to belie some huge migrations of money. "Sector rotation is definitely the theme," said Thomas McManus, a stock market analyst at Morgan Stanley. "The shares of economically sensitive companies are leading the way here."
Since the market's low in October, he said, Morgan Stanley's index of cycical stocks has returned more than 18 percent, 10 percentage points more than the broader market and 12 more than the consumer products companies that have been so popular in past years.
 
Heavy-Duty Manufacturers Gain
 Heavy-duty manufacturers like Allied-Signal, up 1 5/8, to 59 1/2; I.B.M., 1 1/4, to 49 1/2 and International Paper, 7/8, to 62 5/8, paced the Dow stocks yesterday, despite the absence of much economic news. The auto makers also scored well. At the bottom of the Dow list stood Philip Morris, off 1 1/8, to 71 5/8.
Airline investors, recently governed by fears of renewed fare wars, returned to pondering the economic recovery yesterday, as UAL was up 2 points, to 130 1/4, Delta Air Lines 1 5/8, to 54 1/8, and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, 1, to 68 3/4. Roadway Services and the Xtra Corporation, both involved in trucking, each advanced 1 1/2.
Stable energy costs might also help these companies, as the renewed hostilities in Iraq have not disrupted supplies or raised prices. Oil drilling, equipment and refining were among yesterday's most consistent losers.
Banks also performed strongly, led by a 2 1/8-point advance in BankAmerica, to 49 1/2, on news of an agreement to sell off $2 billion in troubled real estate loans.
First Boston's strong recommendation of Lin Broadcasting raised its price 6 1/2, to 88 1/4, a 365-day high. McCaw Cellular Communications, Lin's majority owner, also hit a high by rising 2 1/2, to 39 1/8, as did A.T.&T., which has agreed to buy a third of McCaw, and in turn advanced a point, to 54 1/4.
Semiconductor makers, among the companies most likely to profit from renewed corporate investment, continued their gains yesterday, as Intel vaulted 4 7/8, to 116 5/8.
But biotechnology stocks finished with heavy losses, as Centocor plunged 11 1/8 points, to 6 5/8, on very heavy volume as it abandoned trials of a once-promising drug. Amgen, Synergen, Biogen and Genzyme each fell more than a point.
While most strategists heartily favor cyclical stocks these days, a few souls say that recent economic statistics are far from encouraging.
As for whether Bill Clinton will still ignite the economy, Hugh Johnson of First Albany notes that the President-elect's advisers have been more apt to stress deficit reduction than ardent stimulus.
Other than the technology sector -- "in a world of its own," he said -- he questions whether the cyclical rally holds much further promise.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Possible Interest-Rate Shifts Help to Push Dollar Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other leading currencies yesterday as international talk swirled around possible interest-rate changes.
Bob Ortiz, vice president for corporate sales at the Continental Bank of Chicago, said comments about interest rates in Germany, England and the United States seemed to be the only thing affecting the market yesterday. 
 A rate cut in Europe would make the dollar more attractive relative to European currencies.
 
Bundesbank Comments Lift Mark
 Officials of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, made comments indicating that Germany was not going to ease its rates soon because of a continuing concern about inflation. That sent the dollar lower, Mr. Ortiz said, as marks became the target of buyers.
In England, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Dennis Lamont, said that the country was being cautious because of worries about inflation and the British economy. "The market interpreted this by thinking that he would not cut base rates before he presents his budget in March," Mr. Ortiz said. As a result, Mr. Ortiz said, the pound profited.
Finally, reports that the incoming Clinton Administration would try to ease interest rates in the United States were also at play in the market, Mr. Ortiz said.
In New York, the British pound sold at $1.5510 yesterday, more expensive than it was Friday at $1.5305. In London, the British pound rose to $1.5520, from $1.5315 late Friday.
 
Dollar at 125.82 Yen in Japan
 In New York, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen to 125.55, down from 126.10 late Friday. In London the dollar closed at 125.70 yen yesterday.
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 125.82 yen, up 0.17 yen from last Thursday's close of 125.65 yen. Japan's financial markets were closed Friday for a national holiday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6145 German marks, down from 1.6360; 1.4785 Swiss francs, down from 1.4975; 5.4540 French francs, down from 5.5280; 1,486.5 Italian lire, down from 1,501, and 1.27645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.28205 .
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, were: 1.6128 German marks, down from 1.6338; 1.4775 Swiss francs, down from 1.4965; 5.4570 French francs, down from 5.5240; 1.8125 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8361; 1,482.00 Italian lire, down from 1,502.00, and 1.2764 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2821.

HEADLINE: Industries Seek Protection As Vital to U.S. Security

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18

 BODY:
Encouraged by President-elect Bill Clinton's emphasis on economic competitiveness as a critical part of post-cold-war national security, domestic industries are beginning to line up for Government protection against foreign competition, contending that their survival is vital to the nation's economic security.
Federal law gives the President broad powers to limit imports or help domestic industries for national-security reasons, but until now Government and industry trade experts have defined security almost exclusively in military terms. 
 In cases now being prepared, the domestic oil industry and makers of computer-chip housings are saying that their industries are crucial to the country's economy and thus entitled to protection on national security grounds. And trade lawyers are trying to organize cases in other industries, like commercial aircraft production.
The American manufacturers are seeking the protection now because of the economic views expressed by the President-elect and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, his choice to head the Council of Economic Advisers. In a recent book, she favors more Government assistance to economically strategic industries.
The computer devices at issue are ceramic packages with implanted metal circuitry that links crucial silicon chips inside to other less important chips. At present, a single Japanese company, the Kyocera Corporation, controls more than half the world market for these ceramic packages.
The computer case "will be the bellwether, and it will tell us what the Clinton Administration's attitude will be," said Patrick F. J. Macrory, a partner at Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, which is representing Kyocera.
The enthusiasm for Government intervention worries some economists, who fear that the long-ignored statute, Section 232 of the Trade Enhancement Act of 1962, could be used to undermine the free-trade principles that have guided American trade policy since the Roosevelt Administration.
"It's an open question whether this broad, strategic concept will open a Pandora's box of protection or whether it will be abstemiously applied," said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research group.
Mr. Clinton raised the possibility of an oil-import fee last month, without saying whether he might pursue it through legislation or his executive powers. Such a move would no doubt prompt strong opposition in the United States, amounting, as it would, to a back-door gasoline tax, and it would outrage Arab producers. The transition team has not yet studied how to handle the legislation in general, Democrats said.
 
What Law Allows
 The law allows manufacturers to file petitions seeking regulatory or tariff protection from imports, or direct subsidies. The statute requires the Commerce Department to issue a recommendation to the President within 270 days of the filing of any petition, and the President must decide within 90 days after that.
Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter invoked the law to impose temporary oil import taxes to encourage American self-sufficiency in oil production. The Reagan Administration pre-empted three cases by persuading foreign countries to limit their exports to the United States of factory tools, plastic molding machines and certain gears, and turned down a request by domestic oil drillers for another oil import fee.
The computer case, "raises the economic security angle, and has to be looked at from that angle as well as the more narrow national security perspective," said Gilbert B. Kaplan of Hale & Dorr, the law firm representing the two American producers, the Coors Electronic Package Company and the Ceramic Process Systems Corporation. Coors Electronic, based in Chattanooga, Tenn., is a subsidiary of ACX Technologies Inc., which is based in Golden, Colo. and is traded over the counter. The Adolph Coors Company, also of Golden, Colo., spun off ACX Technologies on Dec. 28 by giving one share of ACX stock to its shareholders for every three shares of Adolph Coors Company stock that they held. Ceramic Process is based in Milford, Mass., and is also traded over the counter.
The most important processing chips in personal computers, cellular telephones and weapons are housed in ceramic packages, while plastic packages are used for minor chips. Kyocera compares the American ceramic package producers to Detroit auto makers, and says that both are struggling because of quality problems. "If the U.S. producers could produce the same quality, the same delivery, give the customer the same service at an equal price then they would have all the customers and not Japan," said William L. Everitt, the vice president for communications at Kyocera International Inc., an American holding company of Kyocera, which is based in Kyoto, Japan.
 
Bad Quality Denied
 The Americans reject this argument. "Kyocera has the economies of scale, which are very, very difficult for any competitor to overcome," said W. Grover Coors, a vice president of ACX Technologies. "But the quality of what we produce at our plant in Chattanooga is every bit as good."
Coors Electronic contends that Kyocera and a couple of small Japanese rivals hold 70 to 75 percent of the world market for ceramic packages and supply up to 98 percent of them for some weapons, like torpedos. Mr. Everitt said that Kyocera had a majority of the world market, but he declined to be more specific or discuss the proportion in American weapons.
The National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic eavesdropping and communications security, depended on Kyocera ceramic packages for 171 of its 195 customized computer chips, according to the minutes of a 1986 meeting of a Defense Department study group. The agency had difficulties when Kyocera, without warning, stopped making the ceramic package for a key chip, according to the minutes.
The domestic semiconductor industry appears to be prospering now after losing a large chunk of its market to Japanese producers during the late 1980's. But the American ceramic packages industry argues that the United States economy needs more than successful semiconductors.
"What good is a semiconductor if we don't control the packaging and interconnect technology that makes the semiconductor work?" Mr. Coors asked.
 
Discord on Chips
 The Clinton Administration already faces a possible confrontation with Japan over trade in computer chips. An agreement with Japan in 1991 called for foreign chip makers to claim 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992, but the fourth-quarter figures, due for release on March 17, are considered unlikely to reach that level.
The computer case has alarmed several large Japanese corporations that in response are recruiting a phalanx of law and lobbying firms to represent them, including three firms retained just by Kyocera, according to Commerce Department documents and Washington trade experts.
The Japanese companies are being represented by firms with some of the best connections to the incoming Administration. Vernon Jordan, the head of the Clinton transition team, is a partner at Akin, Gump. Global USA, a small, privately held Washington lobbying firm that specializes in representing Japanese clients on controversial cases, is also representing Kyocera.
Global USA hired Michael Brown, the son of the Commerce Secretary-designate, Ronald H. Brown, in May of last year. Michael Brown started work there last autumn but is not involved in representing any Japanese companies, aides to his fatherand Mr. Clinton said.

Awaiting the Bentsen Treasury

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
With the inauguration of the Clinton Presidency tomorrow, the bond market should find out soon if the Treasury Department under Lloyd Bentsen will fiddle with its debt-management levers to stimulate the economy and cut the record Federal budget deficit.
By simply shifting billions of dollars of long-term Treasury borrowing to shorter maturities with lower interest rates, the Government could lower its borrowing costs by billions of dollars a year, some analysts argue. And by doing so, according to some theories, the Treasury could also bring down the level of long-term interest rates, which economists agree are still restraining the economy's recovery. 
 No decision has been made yet, said Jack R. DeVore, who is press secretary to Mr. Bentsen, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. But there is talk about such a shift in the mix of borrowing.
The idea was discussed at the economic conference that President-elect Clinton held in Little Rock, Ark., in December. And Mr. Clinton's own campaign program outline, "Putting People First," includes savings of $2 billion a year in the fiscal years 1994, 1995 and 1996 from reform of debt financing.
Such reform is an attractive option for a new Administration struggling to get a sluggish economy moving enough to create millions of new jobs and to find any way -- especially if it is painless -- to drain off some red ink.
 
Wall Street Is Divided
 But it is not all that easy, as is made clear by the division over the plan on Wall Street, the home of the biggest participants in the $2.3 trillion government securities market.
If Mr. Bentsen does shift the mix of Treasury borrowing, traders of 30-year bonds will be happy. They believe that a reduction in the supply of these long-term bonds will help push up the price, bringing a little more profit to Wall Street. Traders say that the price of the 30-year bond has already moved higher in anticipation of such a move.
But a lot of their colleagues are going to be asking if the promise of lower borrowing costs as a way to cut the deficit is just more smoke and mirrors from Washington and wondering how effective the new Administration will be in reining in the deficit.
Economists on and off of Wall Street will be debating how much long-term interest rates are likely to come down and what kind of impact that will have on the economy. And everyone will be wondering if this kind of manipulation of the government securities market is worth it.
"I'd rather have a steady stream of maturities here," said James S. Fralick, principal senior economist at Morgan Stanley & company. And, he added, "If short-term interest rates go up, it could add to the cost of borrowing."
The reluctance on Wall Street is not merely based on analyses. Change is not popular there. What would help long-term debt traders would hurt others. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which have studied this issue a lot, acknowledge that there could be some small benefits in shifting the mix of borrowing toward shorter-term rates. But they are reluctant to tamper with markets, especially with the kinds of shifts that some argue would mean big savings in borrowing costs.
"With the Treasury as market timers and market players, you would introduce an element of uncertainty, and uncertainty costs money," said Jerome H. Powell, the Treasury's outgoing Under Secretary for finance.
Of the two reasons for the change, the claims for savings to cut the deficit is the most seductive -- especially when the difference, or spread, between short-term and long-term interest rates approaches record levels.
 
The Assumptions
 According to analysis by the Democratic Study Group of the House of Representatives, the Treasury could save as much as $5.3 billion in borrowing costs in 12 months by issuing less long-term debt.
But those savings assumed a complete shift of all Treasury borrowing between August 1991 and July 1992 to three-month Treasury bills. This is a shift of $44 billion in 30-year bonds, $47 billion in 10-year notes, $41 billion in 7-year notes and about $390 billion in 2-, 3- and 5-year notes. Even shifting half of that amount would save $2.7 billion.
These savings also assume that such a shift to borrowing at shorter-term rates would not result in higher short-term interest rates across the board, which could cut into or even erase the savings. Yet the study assumes that the decrease in borrowing in longer-term bonds would bring down long-term interest rates.
Randall Dodd, who worked on the analyses of the study for the Democratic Study Group, acknowledged that without an effort by the Federal Reserve to resist any rise in short-term interest rates, the savings could evaporate. But he argued that "at least it will stimulate the economy without raising the deficit."
Mr. Powell and others agree that there could be some "marginal" effect on long-term interest rates if the issuance of long-term borrowing is shifted to shorter term. But the question is how much and how the shift is done.
At the heart of this debate is the question of whether supply-and-demand factors or inflationary expectations affect long-term interest rates more. If it is supply, then shifting to shorter-term rates will bring down long-term interest rates. But if it is inflationary expectations, then the change will have a much smaller effect.
The Democratic Study Group report, which could not estimate how much current interest rates would be reduced if the shift were made, cites a study done by Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard professor, using data from the 1970's. If about a quarter of long-term Treasury borrowing (10 years and longer) is shifted to shorter-term Treasury bills, Mr. Friedman estimated that the interest rate on Treasury securities with maturities of 10 years or longer would fall by about half a percentage point.
 
'Which Is More Important?'
 But how the shift is done is very important. If just the sale of 30-year bonds is curtailed, the result could be higher 7- and 10-year interest rates if the sales are shifted to these maturities. These rates have a major effect on the mortgage market and the housing market, which means the shift could have a negative effect.
And if inflationary expectations are a more important determinant of long-term rates, then getting the Federal budget deficit down would be a much more effective and lasting step.
"Which is more important?" Mr. Friedman asked during an interview. "Making progress on the deficit is my first priority."
 
 
 
TREASURY MARKET
 Trading in the Treasury market was closed yesterday in observance of the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The regular Monday auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills will be held today. There was some trading in the cash market abroad yesterday, and a shortened day of trading of Treasury futures contracts in Chicago. Trading in the cash market resumes today.

HEADLINE: Market Place

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE stock market verdict could yet change. But right now it looks as if Buffalo can confound the football forecasters and finally win the Super Bowl on its third try.
That prediction is based on a theory of forecasting football's biggest game by looking at the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average during the final weeks of the football season. 
 The indicator, first disclosed in this column four years ago, had correctly forecast 12 of the 14 previous Super Bowls up till then. Since then, it has been correct in three out of four years, raising its long-term record to 15 of the last 18 years -- an 83 percent success rate.
The indicator predicts that if the Dow is higher at the time of the Super Bowl than it was at the end of November, then the team from the city whose name is later in the alphabet will win. This year, Dallas would be that team.
But the Dow ended November at 3,305.16, or 30.25 points higher than it closed yesterday, when it rose 3.79 points, to 3,274.91. Unless it rallies by the end of next week, Buffalo would seem likely to win the game, since a lower Dow indicates a victory by the team whose name appears first, alphabetically.
Despite its impressive record, and perhaps because of its total implausibility, the theory does not seem to have developed many followers among those who bet on football games. That is in contrast to the other Super Bowl indicator, which uses the game's result to forecast the stock market for the next year.
This indicator, one of the most widely cited on Wall Street, has an even more impressive record, thanks in part to judicious changing of the rules when needed. It forecasts that if the Super Bowl is won by a team from the old American Football League, like Buffalo, the stock market will decline over the following year. But if the victor is a team that was part of the National Football League before the merger, then share prices will rise.
Last year's victory by the Washington Redskins, itself correctly forecast by a rising stock market coming into the game, was in turn interpreted as a sign of a rising stock market. It looks as if that indicator will work again, although it is not a sure thing. At the time of last year's Super Bowl, the Dow stood at 3,232.78, or 42.13 points below the current level. If the Dow stays above that level through the end of next week, the game will have correctly forecast the market every year except 1970, 1987 and 1990.
Some compilers of the Super Bowl theory dispute that 1987 was a failure. By using full-year numbers, they say, the Giants' victory forecast a rising year for the Dow, and it was indeed up for the year. The trouble with this interpretation is that all of the year's stock market gain came in January before the game was played. The minimum rule for any indicator is that it should forecast the future, not the past, which is why this column looks at market performance between Super Bowl games.
The other theory, using the stock market to forecast the game, has worked in each of the last 18 years except in 1982, 1986 and 1990. As it happens, each of those upset games was followed, in the next 12 months, by at least one quarter in which the economy did not grow. No other year since 1982 has had that unfortunate distinction.
Does this mean that the stock market, combined with the football game, can forecast the economy?
Or is all of this going far too far?

HEADLINE: Recriminations Follow Debacle of Short First Flight of Earthwinds

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

DATELINE: RENO

 BODY:
BITTER recriminations and a far-reaching post-mortem followed the crash last week of Earthwinds, probably the most expensive and ambitious ballooning project in history. But participants believe the crash offers a painful object lesson not only for balloonists but for planners of such complex systems as future space missions.
Earthwinds, a 300-foot-high assemblage resembling a gigantic hourglass, was designed to fly nonstop around the world to achieve the last major landmark in lighter-than-air aviation. The craft and its three-member crew rose majestically above a snow-covered Nevada airfield last Tuesday to the cheers of a crowd that included former astronauts, champion balloonists, actors, business executives, airplane pilots, aeronautical engineers, systems analysts and other experts. But the shimmering, translucent balloon scarcely covered five miles before scraping a ridge line on the California-Nevada border and crash-landing on its farther slope. 
 Seeing the ridge just ahead, the crew members began a frantic effort to rise, throwing out half a ton of lead shot, as well as part of the mission's three-week supply of drinking water. They tried pumping more gas into the huge lifting balloon from tanks of ultra-cold liquid helium strapped to the sides of the pressurized crew capsule, a large and comfortable cabin crammed with electronic equipment, food, water and survival equipment, including three magnum pistols.
But the balloon had bumped up against an invisible ceiling of warm air and would not rise an inch. Bad luck, which dogged Earthwinds throughout the $5 million project's three-year history, struck again. "At the last moment we hit an updraft that nearly saved us, and if we had headed 50 feet either to the right or left, we would have gotten through the pass safely," said Don Moses, a crew member. "But instead we hit the ridge, just where the rocks were sharpest."
The lower balloon in the configuration, designed to hold heavy compressed air and therefore called the "anchor," was ripped as it dragged across the rocks, and the crew realized instantly that the flight was doomed. The captain, Larry Newman, brought the crew capsule to a safe and gentle landing on a steep slope, despite the nearly catastrophic failure of an explosive cable-cutter to detach the helium balloon from the capsule.
But any hope that the crew might stay together for another attempt at a round-the-world flight was dashed by the bitter accusations that ensued.
Each of the three had a somewhat different account of what happened.
Mr. Newman, a senior pilot for America West airlines, said the emergency landing was letter perfect, cushioned and stabilized by the 100-foot-diameter anchor balloon, which provided ballast. Mr. Newman was a crew member on the first balloon flights across both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
But he was critical of both Mr. Moses and, to a lesser extent, the other Earthwinds crew member, Maj. Gen. Vladimir A. Dzhanibekov, saying that neither had provided enough help or support at critical times during the preparation of the balloon and in its brief flight.
General Dzhanibekov, who will leave Earthwinds to resume his position as chief of Russia's astronaut training program, said he felt the operation had been poorly managed. As the last man to leave the crew capsule after the crash, he said he thought Mr. Newman had abandoned him in a dangerous situation, although the general continued to carry out his assigned job of photographing the final moments of the flight.
Associates said the Russian felt he had been slighted by not having been allowed to share equal command responsibilities with Mr. Newman.
 
Crew Member's Complaints
 Mr. Moses, the other crew member, said he no longer felt he could work with Mr. Newman, for both personal and professional reasons. Among many complaints, he said that just before the crash Mr. Newman had refused his request to "declare Mayday" -- to radio a distress signal -- and that in the construction phase, Mr. Newman had ignored requests by the general and himself to make the crew capsule safer. Mr. Moses said he considered the capsule to be badly designed and too heavily loaded with complicated and unnecessary equipment.
Many of the engineers and construction experts who worked on the project, including volunteers from aerospace companies, said Earthwinds had been built on a trial-and-error basis without adequate engineering and planning, particularly in the integration of its labyrinthine electronic and plumbing systems.
What Earthwinds needed from the start, said an aerospace engineer who asked not to be named, was a master plan. Without one, the engineer said, one cannot fly to Mars nor get around the world in a balloon.
Mr. Newman, who believes there was no other way to build a balloon as radically new in concept as Earthwinds, intends to make another attempt to circumnavigate the world next Nov. 15.
"Throughout the project, I had nowhere to turn for help in many of the technical problems, and I had to work them out by myself," he said. "In just a seemingly simple matter, like picking the right color paint for a vital heat exchanger mounted outside the capsule, even the aerospace companies gave me conflicting advice, and I had to solve things on my own."
Baron Hilton, president of the Hilton Hotels chain and a major financial backer of Earthwinds, expressed his confidence in Mr. Newman after the accident, and said he planned to continue his support.
Besides Mr. Moses, a Hawaii-based builder and entrepreneur, and General Dzhanibekov, a veteran of several trailblazing Soviet space missions, some key members of the engineering and technical sections of the huge Earthwinds team said they were leaving the project. Several said they might try to design and build a new balloon of their own to try to beat Earthwinds in a round-the-world attempt this year.
 
Too Heavy to Clear Ridge
 Although hundreds of measurements and calculations will be needed to make a formal assessment of what went wrong with Earthwinds, it is obvious that the balloon was simply too heavy to clear the ridge.
Mr. Newman, in consultation with a team of meteorologists headed by Leonard W. Snellman, had decided to move the Earthwinds launching site from Akron, Ohio, where a launching attempt last February was aborted because of high winds, to Reno Stead Airfield, Nev., because of the generally low winds there.
Mr. Newman had hoped to prepare Earthwinds for flight by setting it up in a specially built inflatable hangar, but two such hangars broke open and collapsed, once because of flawed fittings and once because of high winds. So Mr. Newman decided to set up the balloon in the open air.
This meant that dead calm was essential during the difficult and risky process of inflating and rigging a fragile plastic balloon the height of a 20-story building. The weather experts could promise calm air only on the condition that there be an inversion of the air, in which a layer of warm air overlies cold air at ground level. Such an inversion, Mr. Snellman explained, acts as a cap over the ground layer, and blocks wind.
A suitable inversion was forecast for last Monday night, but Mr. Snellman warned that only a few hours would be favorable for a launching, before a storm front from the Pacific moved in. Moisture from the storm could have frozen on the balloon and weighed it down, and the accompanying winds could easily have destroyed the balloon on its vulnerable pad. Another source of anxiety was the fact that there is no turning back once a $150,000 heavy-lift helium balloon is unpacked and inflation begins; if an ascension must be aborted, the balloon cannot be re-used, and it must simply be discarded.
As the ground crews and experts rushed to complete preparations, the temperature fell to minus 19 degrees Fahrenheit, and a thick layer of hoarfrost accumulated on beards and eyebrows as well as the Earthwinds capsule. Fingers were frostbitten as their owners tried to adjust valves and fasten cable couplings.
Midway in the proceedings, both of the main plastic fill tubes through which helium was being pumped into the balloon split apart, and precious time was lost as crews rigged a secondary fill tube, through which helium flowed at a much reduced rate.
Then, as compressed air was being pumped into the anchor balloon, a small gash in its outer cover was noticed, a flaw that would have meant catastrophe for the mission if it had not been spotted. Tim Lachenmeier, whose company, Raven Industries Inc., built both the helium and anchor balloons, remembered that he had brought a spool of special thread and a package of sail-maker's needles. His fingers numbed by the polar cold, he carefully sewed a patch in place, as the clock ticked and the snow and winds of day approached.
At 10:07 A.M., far behind schedule and with the sky already threatening, the balloon was ready, the crew members were aboard the capsule, and winches paid out the lines that raised the helium balloon, the capsule and the anchor balloon. The flight began.
Although the gauges showed that the balloon supposedly had 1,000 pounds more lift than was necessary to keep it afloat, Mr. Newman and his colleagues had not counted on a serious pitfall. The helium in their balloon was bitterly cold, having just been released from high-pressure storage tanks and allowed to expand in an already frigid environment. The gas was therefore much denser and heavier than it would have been at a higher temperature, and it consequently exerted much less lift. By contrast, the relatively thin air in the inversion layer 500 feet above the launching pad was 20 degrees warmer than the surface air.
For a cold balloon filled with dense gas to rise into warm, thin air, veteran balloonists observed, is like a cork trying to rise through a solid plug; unless the balloon has much more lifting power than it would need under normal conditions, it cannot punch through the inversion layer.
The accident itself was fairly harmless. The helium and anchor balloons were destroyed, but the expensive capsule was scarcely damaged, and it was flown back to its hangar.
In the hours and days that followed, however, accusations and recriminations flew. Many of Mr. Newman's colleagues accused him of exerting too much direct control of even the smallest details. Others faulted him for not having completed a sound engineering plan before building the balloon. Mr. Newman replied that if some of his colleagues had shown "more initiative, dedication and energy," he would not have had to intervene in details so often.
One way or another, future round-the-world balloon attempts seem certain. Although these projects are always extremely expensive and unprofitable for their backers, the yearning for romantic adventure, however vicarious it may be, is a powerful impetus. The astronauts Eugene A. Cernan and Walter M. Schirra Jr. watched spellbound as Earthwinds rose, and both saw similarities between the adventure of ballooning and that of space travel.
"We'll do it, as long as I have breath in my body and friends to help," Mr. Newman said.

HEADLINE: The Halfway Man

 BODY:
What we know is that in two days, the Presidency of George Herbert Walker Bush will be, as they say, history. What we do not know is whether history will judge him more kindly than the voters did in November.
He came to politics with every advantage of birth and education. He is unlikely to be remembered as a great President, but rather more as an amiable transition figure. The lesson of George Bush? Beliefs count for something. They animate policy; without them, leadership falters. 
 Mr. Bush is almost certainly the last of the World War II Presidents, as well as the last chief executive to reach voting age at the outset of the cold war. These historical circumstances shaped his enthusiasms, his career and his Presidency.
In one sense, they worked to his advantage. Fate dealt him probably the strongest hand in foreign affairs ever awarded a new President, and for the most part he played it prudently although not always imaginatively.
They also worked to his disadvantage. The end of the cold war undermined the organizing principle of Republican campaigns since Dwight Eisenhower: the notion that the G.O.P. could best tame the Soviet bear. And after the menace evaporated, Mr. Bush, with no domestic policy to speak of, came up empty when an America in spiritual disarray asked him to deal with drift.
That is what brought him low. The 1992 campaign was the first since 1936 in which foreign policy was not a salient issue; Mr. Bush had nothing to replace it.
George Bush carried admirable credentials. He had a goofy way of speaking but the resume was dandy: U.N. representative, chief envoy to China, Director of Central Intelligence, President Reagan's emissary to all the little places Vice Presidents go.
His experience yielded diplomatic progress on at least four fronts. He cut a deal with Congress to end military assistance to Nicaragua's contras, removing in one stroke an issue that had paralyzed President Reagan's relationship with Capitol Hill. His ability to orchestrate a global response to Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf was a greater achievement still.
He deserves, with Secretary of State James Baker, much credit for nurturing peace talks between Arabs and Israelis. And, despite a grudging early response to the monumental opening presented by Mikhail Gorbachev, he eventually threw his weight behind mutual disengagement in Europe and, in time, Boris Yeltsin.
But on matters closer to home, Mr. Bush vacated the bully pulpit. He subcontracted the management of domestic policy to indifferent subordinates and created the disquieting and ultimately fatal impression that he didn't know what to do, and worse, didn't much care.
The public was hardly blind to these discontinuities. A month after the gulf war in early 1991, it gave him an 83 percent approval rating in foreign policy. Yet only a bare majority detected any genuine interest in the economy or health care.
In response, Mr. Bush mustered words without meaning. His special gift was the Churchillian flourish followed by a blinding banality. After the gulf war he strode masterfully into a Senate chamber full of pliant lawmakers and said the time had come to convert triumph abroad into renewal at home. Of what did that consist? A transportation bill.
In his 1992 State of the Union address -- his last chance to chart a convincing domestic course -- he resurrected the stirring summons of the gulf war: "I look at hard times and make this vow: This will not stand." "This will not fly" was more like it. What followed were timid little programs.
The one domestic cause to which Mr. Bush devoted serious energy was in fact a political cause: the cultivation of his party's right wing, especially on abortion, civil rights and Supreme Court appointments.
These supplicatory gestures were of a piece with his earlier conversion to the policies of Ronald Reagan, whom he had once accused of "voodoo economics." They reached their apotheosis at the Republican Convention, where he ceded the stage to the attack dogs of the far right, and in the campaign, where he flailed hysterically about family values.
That courtship gained him little and cost him heavily. The right never fully accepted him, and his Brahmin friends -- economic conservatives with a social conscience -- felt betrayed by his shabby bargains with the cultural yahoos.
Mr. Bush leaves his successor with much unfinished business -- Iraq, Bosnia, peace in the Middle East. But at least he believed in America's world mission, in expanding democracy and ending aggression. He reveled in it, much as F.D.R. had reveled in national reconstruction and Lyndon Johnson in the Great Society.
But on the matter of America's obligation to itself, there was neither clarity nor conviction. That would have required of George Bush a consistent political character. And that was what he did not bring to office, having scattered bits and pieces along the road to power.

HEADLINE: An Invisible Generation Looks in the Mirror

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Boomlet Generation" (Op-Ed, Jan. 4), Alexander Abrams and David Lipsky make a case for defining generations by decade of college graduation. They then go on to characterize the generation that completed college in the 1980's, people who are now between 24 and 32. As a member of that generation, I am dismayed by how foreign the people described by the authors seem. 
 No, we are not the Grunge Kids; but neither are we baby boomers (read yuppies) cheated by a recession out of investment banking jobs, houses on the beach, and Volvos and Saab convertibles.
Yes, we are being passed over, like the middle child, as the authors aptly put it. Going unnoticed is a hallmark of our generation.
We came of age at a bad time. The monumental social upheavals and the profound tragedies of the 1960's left the country wounded and emotionally exhausted. Vietnam continued to drain the nation's energies until many of us were in our early teens. And the betrayal of Watergate further weakened the country's spirit.
Finally, there was the stagflation of the 70's. Growing up in that time was like being raised by a depressive mother: the country was consumed by its own pain and did not have the emotional resources to cope with, or pay attention to, our needs.
Left unattended, our generation developed a peculiar sense of meaninglessness. Our nihilism is very personal -- it is a profound sense that we have no weight or value. It is the desperation expressed by people turning 30 who are adrift professionally, spiritually or emotionally.
This sense of emptiness was poignantly evoked for me not long ago by a woman friend in a conversation we had about children and families. Saying that she did not want to have kids, she explained, somewhat apologetically: "I feel so bereft. What is there to pass on?"
We have been overlooked, and we continue to overlook ourselves. If our special quality is that we listen to 10,000 Maniacs, rather than Pearl Jam, then we are truly bereft.
Moreover, to continue defining ourselves in prefabricated, consumer terms is to accept generational meaninglessness.
We have more value than our purchasing power. It's not enough to say, "We are here"; it's time to say who we are.

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: The Overview;
Clinton, Awaiting Oath, Asks for Help

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Jan. 20

 BODY:
On the day before he raises his right hand to assume the Presidency, Bill Clinton on Tuesday filled out his national security team, placed white roses on the graves of two of his political idols and appealed for help in enacting the domestic agenda he hopes to make his legacy.
But even as he spent the day polishing his Inaugural Address and making the official rounds of celebrations, Mr. Clinton and his aides were grappling with the challenges that would be waiting on his desk at the White House: searching for a way to respond to an unexpected overture from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
 Throughout the third consecutive day of pre-inaugural celebration that clogged city streets and filled its banquet halls to capacity, Mr. Clinton's advisers sought to signal that they were prepared for another provocation by Mr. Hussein and that the Iraqi's peace overtures would not influence their determination to force Iraq to comply with United Nations sanctions.
 
A Warning Is Sounded
 In a CBS News interview broadcast tonight, Mr. Clinton said he was encouraged by the support from Britain and France. Asked if it was his position that Mr. Hussein must leave power, he issued the same firm warning that his staff members did Tuesday.
"My view is that it is almost inconceivable that we can have good relations with Iraq with him there because he has given no indication that he is capable of being a reliable member of the community of nations," Mr. Clinton said.
Earlier Tuesday, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, said Mr. Hussein "should not take comfort in our election" and added, "Don't underestimate Bill Clinton."
As his advisers worked nervously behind the scenes to convey consistency and firmness toward Iraq, Mr. Clinton spent his day focusing on domestic matters, pleading for support for immediate action on health-care initiatives and pledging to keep an open door to the Oval Office.
 
Waiting to Inherit
 Mr. Clinton becomes President at noon today, Minutes later, when he takes the oath of office, he formally inherits the powers of the commander-in-chief, as specified in the Constitution.
The demands of the office are certain to crowd in immediately afterward, and Mr. Clinton and his aides spent the day appointing senior personnel in the State Department and the Department of Education.
Mr. Clinton began his day kneeling at the grave of President John F. Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery. He also visited the grave of Senator Robert F. Kennedy with members of the Kennedy family, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Ethel Kennedy, Representative Joseph Kennedy of Massachusetts and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, joined the Kennedys in laying white roses on the graves. The President-elect has often said it was a White House handshake with President Kennedy in the summer of 1963 that persuaded him to enter politics, and he made much of the connection during the election campaign.
Early today, 11 hours before his swearing-in Mr. Clinton was attending an inaugural prayer meeting at the First Baptist Church, along with Mrs. Clinton and the Gores. Former President Jimmy Carter, who attended the church while he was in office, told the crowd, filled with political dignitaries, that Mr. Clinton would be " "the first Democratic President I shall meet in my life."
"Our hearts are with you," Mr. Carter said just before the meeting broke up about 1:15 A.M. "You are part of our family."
As he toured the capital Tuesday in ceremonial stops that included a visit with schoolchildren at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, transition officials worked busily to prepare the Clinton White House foreign policy and domestic operation.
Transition officials announced the appointment of more than a dozen of Warren M. Christopher's top State Department deputies. They also named Madeleine M. Kunin, the former Governor of Vermont, to be Deputy Secretary of Education.
The announcements were part of a critical effort to get enough Administration officials in place before Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore take office. Today, the Senate is preparing to confirm three of Mr. Clinton's top appointees: Mr. Christopher as Secretary of State, Representative Les Aspin as Secretary of Defense and Senator Lloyd Bentsen as Secretary of the Treasury.
 
Asks for States' Help
 Mr. Clinton had said he wanted to speak to the governors and former governors of both parties whom he knew while he was Governor of Arkansas. In his address to the group, which included Michael S. Dukakis, the 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee, and John H. Sununu, who was President Bush's chief of staff, Mr. Clinton emphasized a domestic agenda that had become overshadowed by foreign crises. Underscoring the immediacy of the task, he asked for help from the states in passing health-care legislation.
"I'm telling you, if you look at these deficit numbers, there's no way in the wide world you can either cut discretionary spending or raise taxes enough to put a long-term dent in this deficit," said Mr. Clinton, who has always stressed controlling health-care costs as a key to reducing the deficit. "If we don't do something about health care, the rest of it's just whistling Dixie."
"I did not run for this job just to warm the seat," Mr. Clinton said. "I desperately want to make a difference."
"Whether you walked with me in the snows of New Hampshire or did your best to deny me your electoral votes, it is over," Mr. Clinton told the gathering at the Library of Congress. "You know what we have shared together. Please, please know that the door is open, and when you think we're veering wrong, walk through it and say so."
 
Taking Care of Business
 Aides to the President-elect said Tuesday that his first few days are likely to be spent responding to foreign policy concerns, but that they would like to go to work immediately preparing a budget plan, signing executive orders expanding abortion rights and addressing some political demands.
Some Clinton aides said foreign policy could dominate the first days' agenda in any case.
"I think obviously it doesn't matter if a foreign policy event is on-message or off-message," said Stan Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker and adviser. "If it's a crisis, you take care of business."
But Mr. Greenberg and other Clinton aides indicated that there were a number of domestic issues Mr. Clinton planned to address immediately if foreign policy considerations let him.
 
Focus on Abortion Issues
 Officials of women's groups speculated for most of the day about indications that Mr. Clinton on Friday would use the 20th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that established a woman's constitutional right to choose abortion, to sign an executive order lifting the abortion counseling ban in federally financed clinics.
Mr. Clinton has other executive orders before him that could reverse more than a decade of Republican policymaking, including a ban on the importation of RU-486, a drug that induces abortions, establishment of a family-leave policy for Federal employees and a reversal of the ban on abortion at military hospitals.
Mr. Clinton and his aides are also working to produce a budget plan that would balance Mr. Clinton's need to cut the deficit with his desire to spur the economy. Gene Sperling, a Clinton economics aide, said the new Administration plans to produce a plan in its first three weeks that will be laid out in a State of the Union Message.
"If anything, the foreign policy initiatives establish his authority as President immediately, and, if anything, gives him the room as President to address the domestic issues immediately," Mr. Sperling said.
 
No More Fixed Ceilings
 On his first full day as President, Mr. Clinton will be required by law to make his first official decision on controlling the budget deficit. Transition officials said he would announce that he had made the largely technical determination not to return to the system of fixed deficit ceilings like those set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings laws that caused political havoc.
Under the 1980's laws, unless specific deficit levels were projected each year, across-the-board spending cuts were required in most Government programs. The levels usually proved to be unrealistic, largely because they did not take account of changed economic circumstances. Rather than meet those ceilings, the White House and Congress generally turned to budget gimmicks and political devices that did not really lower the deficit but met the requirements of the law.
The 1990 budget law abolished the fixed ceilings for fiscal years 1991 through 1993 but reinstated them for fiscal year 1994, which begins Oct. 1, and fiscal year 1995. But the law specified that the new President could waive them for 1994 and 1995, provided he did so on Jan. 21, 1993.
Transition officials said Mr. Clinton's decision not to apply the limits did not signal a retreat from his commitment to deficit reduction.
Mr. and Mrs. Clinton were able to adopt a lighter tone later at a Salute to Children at the Kennedy Center in which Kermit the Frog perched on Hillary Clinton's shoulder while they sang "This Little Light of Mine."
Chelsea, the Clintons' 12-year-old daughter, also joined in, speaking to her old classmates in Little Rock over a television video conference.
At one point, Mr. Clinton sat on a bench with Fred Rogers, host of the television show "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood," and fielded questions from children.
"When you were a boy, did you ever get angry?" asked one questioner.
"Yes, when I was a boy I got angry, and sometimes I would do stupid things," answered Mr. Clinton, noting that he'd even put his fist through a wall. But his parents taught him to "take a deep breath and count to 10," he said, and he had learned to cope.
"I still get angry," he added. "Even grown-ups get angry. It's not bad to be angry, and some things are worth getting angry about. What's bad is if your anger gets control of you."

HEADLINE: THE NEW PRESIDENCY: Attorney General;
BAIRD APOLOGIZES TO SENATE PANEL FOR ILLEGAL HIRING

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Zoe Baird apologized today for hiring two illegal aliens to work in her house, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is holding hearings on her nomination as Attorney General, that she had known she was violating the law.
Her apology seemed to satisfy some Senators, but most expressed cautious support or remained noncommittal, although that did not appear to undermine the likelihood of her eventual confirmation. 
 The hearing offered a striking set of tableaux, including the confessions of an ambitious woman trying to balance career and motherhood and the political high-wire acts of lawmakers weighing Ms. Baird's credentials against calls and letters questioning her ethics. The hearing also showcased the debut of the first two women to serve on the committee, which had infuriated many women with its heated questioning of Anita F. Hill.
 
'Forced Into This Dilemma'
 Disclosures that Ms. Baird, a 40-year-old corporate lawyer, had knowingly broken the immigration laws she will have to enforce have placed the judiciary panel in its most awkward and public position since it held confirmation hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in October 1991. Widely criticized for their treatment of Ms. Hill, the law professor who accused Judge Thomas of sexual harassment, Republican and Democratic committee members treated Ms. Baird with courtesy even as they criticized her conduct.
For her part, Ms. Baird said she accepted full responsibility for deliberately breaking the law by hiring a Peruvian couple living in the United States illegally to care for her 3-year-old son, Julian. She said that despite the advice of a lawyer, she did not pay Social Security taxes until after her selection by President-elect Bill Clinton.
"I was forced into this dilemma to care for my child," she said. But she also declared: "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not."
Oddly, the most persistent questioning of Ms. Baird came from Democrats, while Republicans rushed to her defense.
Public interest groups have criticized positions she took while a corporate lawyer, most recently senior vice president for Aetna Life and Casualty . In particular, some Democrats are uncomfortable with her activities on behalf of Vice President Dan Quayle's efforts to limit civil damage suits and her efforts to weaken Federal protection for whistle blowers.
But these same positions make her attractive to Republicans, and Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the committee, was profuse in his compliments. "You are indeed a very competent and qualified candidate," he said, dismissing her hiring of the Peruvian couple as "an honest mistake."
That was too much for Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat who is the committee chairman. He interrupted Mr. Hatch to insist that the violation was no mere technicality.
"Everybody does not do it," Mr. Biden said. He even said he would have opposed Ms. Baird's confirmation had she not taken full responsibility, admitted to a deliberate violation of the law, and promised to work to regain public trust.
Some Senators and aides said their offices had been deluged with calls and letters criticizing Ms. Baird. They said the criticism came from both men and women, especially working class women who noted that they had had to pursue their jobs without the opportunity to hire illegal labor that Ms. Baird's much higher income had given her.
 
Consuming Half the Time
 Ms. Baird's employment practices consumed about half the five-hour hearing, with the rest devoted to more conventional Justice Department matters like law-enforcement and civil rights.
Ms. Baird said she favored the death penalty and pledged to reinvigorate the efforts of the Justice Department to enforce civil rights laws.
"While there will be partisan issues," Ms. Baird said, the Justice Department "should not be a partisan department. The department's purpose is to use law to protect the American people and to use law to enforce the rights of the American people -- their civil rights, their rights to economic fairness, their rights to a cleaner environment, their rights to security from crime."
Ms. Baird promised to coordinate her work closely with the Environmental Protection Agency, to enforce regulations on corporate misconduct tightly and to restrict appeals in capital cases without jeopardizing the rights of inmates. She also said, "I want the single urban mother who fears for her children in school every day because of violent gangs and the elderly widow who is afraid to go to the supermarket after dark to know that they will have a friend in the Attorney General."
 
Scolding by Thurmond
 But the defining moments of the hearing came in the pointed questioning of Senators of Ms. Baird's illegal employment of the Peruvian driver and baby-sitter.
At one point, Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, admonished Ms. Baird like a scolding father.
"You admit you did wrong?" he asked.
"Yes," she replied sheepishly.
"You're sorry you did wrong?"
"Absolutely."
"You're repentant for doing wrong?"
"Yes, sir."
 
Contrast With Earlier Efforts
 Ms. Baird's confession today contrasted with earlier efforts by Clinton aides to sidestep the issue. When Ms. Baird's infraction was first disclosed in news reports last week, Clinton transition officials said Ms. Baird had believed she was acting within the law since she was sponsoring the Peruvian couple's application for citizenship.
"In my hope to find appropriate child care for my son," she said today, "I gave too little emphasis to what was described to me as a technical violation of law." Explaining that she and her husband had hoped to make their employment of the couple legal by sponsoring them for eventual naturalization, she added, "I allowed myself to think that the processes set up by the Labor Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service gave tacit approval to this sort of situation."
Under the immigration law, applicants for citizenship cannot be legally employed until they receive a visa and work permit, which the Peruvian couple did not have. Federal law requires employers must verify the citizenship status of people before hiring them. For disobeying this statute, Ms. Baird and her husband, Paul D. Gewirtz, have paid a fine of $2,900 plus $8,000 in Social Security taxes and interest. Mr. Gewirtz is a constitutional law scholar who teaches at Yale University.
At various times in the hearing, senior members sought to highlight the arrival on the committee of Senators Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois and Dianne Feinstein of California, in the hope that the two new members will help the committee overcome assertion that it had not displayed sensitivity to the concerns of women. While introducing them, Mr. Biden said, "You have no idea how happy I am."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: The Confirmation Hearings;
Trade and Commerce Nominees Discuss Conflict of Interest Issues

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Mickey Kantor, President-elect Bill Clinton's nominee to become the United States trade representative, announced today that he would remove himself from a broad range of issues to avoid conflicts of interest. And the nominee for Commerce Secretary, Ronald H. Brown, broadened slightly his own policy on conflicts of interest.
The Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously this morning to recommend approval of Mr. Kantor's nomination to the full Senate. But a vote on Mr. Brown by the Commerce Committee was not scheduled even though he submitted written answers today to questions from committee members. 
 The Senate Finance Committee also recommended today that the full Senate approve the nominations of Donna E. Shalala to become Secretary of Health and Human Services and of Roger C. Altman to become Deputy Treasury Secretary, while members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs agreed to pass the nomination of Henry G. Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development on to the full Senate.
And in other confirmation hearings, two of Mr. Clinton's nominees, Hazel R. O'Leary for the Energy Department, and Bruce Babbitt for the Interior Department, promised to discard the hats they wore as heads of interest groups when they take up their new posts.
 
Not Satisfied With Brown
 In the Commerce Committee deliberations on Mr. Brown, the Republicans have assigned Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi to review the nominee's background. Senator Lott said in an interview this evening that he was not satisfied with extra information supplied by Mr. Brown on possible conflicts of interest, particularly those associated with his severance agreement from his law firm.
Mr. Lott said he would accept a Commerce Committee vote as early as Thursday, provided that three conditions were met. Those were that Mr. Brown provide more information; that another hearing be held, if Senator Lott requests it, on Mr. Brown's policy of removing himself from decisions, and that the full Senate not vote on Mr. Brown's nomination until Tuesday at the earliest.
The delay in Mr. Brown's confirmation could leave an important Commerce Department decision in the hands of civil servants. Under Federal law, the Commerce Department must decide by midnight Tuesday whether to impose preliminary taxes on steel imports from 20 countries.
Mr. Brown told the Senators today that he would not take part in decisions involving two pension-management companies for which he has worked, or decisions involving close relatives. He also said for the first time that while in office he would not have any professional contact with anyone from his former law firm on issues before the department.
When the committee held a hearing 13 days ago, Mr. Brown said that he hoped that he would not have to remove himself from decisions involving the two companies. He did not discuss how he would handle cases involving relatives, but Federal ethics rules automatically bar him from ruling on matters in which his family is involved.
 
Kantor's Stand
 The law firm where Mr. Brown has been a partner for the last decade, Patton, Boggs & Blow, also provided more information today about his severance agreement. Timothy J. May, the firm's managing partner, wrote committee members that Mr. Brown's compensation, which is reportedly worth $1 million or more, was equivalent to that given to any partner who retired or the estate of a partner who died.
In his hearing before the Finance Committee, Mr. Kantor followed the precedent set by Carla A. Hills, the current United States trade representative, in saying he would remove himself for one year from trade issues handled by his former law firm, Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor. Mr. Kantor also said he would remove himself throughout his tenure from decisions affecting his former clients on issues he had advised them about.
Mr. Brown's decision to cut off contact with his former law firm makes comparison of the two men's policies difficult.
Mr. Kantor also said that he would seek to open foreign markets to American products, but gave little indication of his views on trade policy.
Asked whether the United States should reclassify Japanese minivans as trucks, which would subject them to higher import taxes, Mr. Kantor replied that an executive committee of Mr. Clinton's National Economic Council would tackle the issue at its first meeting. Mr. Clinton has named trade experts to many positions in his Administration, and Mr. Kantor's comment today was the first time that an incoming official had identified a specific issue to be settled by the new, interagency group.
 
Before the Energy Committee
 Mr. Kantor repeatedly voiced skepticism today about the Bush Administration's farm subsidy agreement on Nov. 19 with the European Community, and said he would have to review it closely to determine whether the United States had made too many concessions. But he stopped short of saying whether he would try to renegotiate the pact.
In the Senate Energy Committee's hearing, Mrs. O'Leary, executive vice president of one of the Middle West's largest utility companies, said she the public's business would be paramount in her new job. Mrs. O'Leary said her career as a lawyer, Federal energy administrator, consultant and utility executive had prepared her for the new assignment.
The Energy Committee's members indicated they would probably approve her nomination unanimously.
Mr. Babbitt told members of the Natural Resources Committee that as Interior Secretary, he would remove his hat as president of the League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental group, to take on the work of managing the nation's natural resources.
Mr. Babbitt, a former Attorney General, Governor of Arizona and Democratic Presidential candidate in 1988 was questioned today by Republican senators from the West, particularly Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, over whether his sympathies lay with environmentalists or with ranchers and mining companies who have long depended on Federal land and resources for their livelihoods.
Mr. Babbitt assured the Senators that he was ready to listen to all sides when considering new policies and he even implicitly criticized one of the League's most publicized activities: the annual ranking of the environmental voting records of members of Congress.
In other Senate action today, members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs agreed to a full Senate vote on the nomination of Henry G. Cisneros as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, even though the panel had not taken a formal vote on the nomination.
The committee had planned to vote today on the nomination, but with Democrats tied up with inaugural matters and some Republicans not available for the meeting, members agreed that an informal poll of members that showed bipartisan support for the nominee would suffice.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Proposes Spartan Budget With Cutbacks

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today proposed a Spartan state budget that avoids general tax increases by squeezing aid to schools, closing three state mental hospitals, paring the state work force and increasing taxes on hospitals while cutting health benefits for the poor.
In presenting his plan for the fiscal year that begins on April 1, Mr. Cuomo declared that the state was "not out of the woods yet," proposing that the general fund, which contains most of the state's spending, be allowed to grow only 1.6 percent, to $31.5 billion. 
 Mr. Cuomo's plan set the stage for legislative battles on several of the state's thorniest political issues. He proposed to redistribute state aid for education, to make drastic cuts in the state's Medicaid and mental-health programs and to spend most of a fund pledged for highway and transit improvements to balance the budget.
The education component, in which the Governor proposes giving more aid to poor districts, including New York City's, at the expense of rich ones, is sure to be tricky. The Republican-controlled State Senate has rejected changes in the formula for years and is likely to be leery of this one.
There are three ways to measure how much the Governor is proposing to increase the state budget in the next fiscal year. One is through the $31.5 billion general fund, which is financed mostly with state revenues that flow directly from the state's general treasury. Another way is through the total budget, which includes Federal money and which would reach $59.1 billion, an increase of 6.5 percent. The third way is through the state funds budget, which includes state spending financed by things like park fees that are earmarked for a specific purpose. That budget would reach $40.5 billion, a rise of 5.2 percent.
In designing the budget, Mr. Cuomo had to close a $3.7 billion gap between projected revenues and projecting spending. To do that, he proposed to save the state $1.02 billion by deferring, once again, scheduled cuts in the state's corporate tax surcharge and personal income taxes, and to save $275 million by not allowing a tax on health-care providers to be phased out as scheduled.
He called for $1.6 billion in spending cuts, including $794 million in the state's Medicaid program. He also proposed a combination of increases in existing taxes on health-care providers, a new 1 percent tax on pharmacies and $428 million in service cuts for Medicaid recipients. For example, home care would be limited, patients would no longer be reimbursed for purchasing walkers and they would have to pay more of their costs of transportation to hospitals and doctors.
 
Rise in Cigarette Tax
 To raise $180 million, the Governor proposed increasing the state's cigarette tax to 60 cents a pack from 39 cents. Most of the money would go to the state general fund for budget-balancing, with about $20 million set aside for health programs, including $10 million for AIDS programs.
Mr. Cuomo also proposed $87 million in new fees, including a new $3 charge on car-emission tests; a $5 increase, to $15, in the annual registration fee for rent-stabilized apartments in New York City, and a $2 increase, to $12, in the greens fee at state golf courses. And he resurrected a proposal to raise a $258 million-a-year environment fund, financed in part by a new $5 fee on tires that would take effect next year.
The budget includes a previously negotiated 4 percent raise for most of the state's unionized workers, at a cost to the state of $300 million. But the Governor is also seeking to cut the state's work force, which in the last two years has already been reduced by 24,700 workers through layoffs and attrition.
The cuts would total 4,700 workers, with about 2,495 through layoffs. The brunt of the reductions would be borne by the State Office of Mental Health, which would have to lay off 1,174 workers as the state moved to consolidate and close its crumbling mental hospitals and move patients into community treatment centers.
The Governor proposes to shut down the hulking Gowanda psychiatric center in western New York, to close the Central Islip psychiatric center on Long Island and send its patients to the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center, and to close the Harlem Valley psychiatric center and send its patients to the Hudson River mentak center. All told, the moves would save the state $18.2 million.
The budget includes $233 million in "one shot" revenue proposals, including a plan to roll over a $115 million Medicaid payment to hospitals into the 1994 fiscal year, an accounting trick that means the bill would simply come due a few days later.
The Governor's budget would not raise tuition at the State University of New York or the City University of New York, nor would it cut the current Tuition Assistance Program for students. But Mr. Cuomo called for a $130 million decrease in state aid to local school districts, pairing that proposal with his plan to reconfigure the school aid formula to benefit poorer school districts. About 60 percent of the state's school districts would receive less state aid, he said.
 
'Especially Troublesome'
 Mr. Cuomo's plan for the new fiscal year has yet to be considered by the Legislature, but the budget usually touches off the most vicious fights of the legislative session. Mr. Cuomo is likely to meet resistance both from the Democratic-run Assembly, which will argue for more money for downstate social-service programs that tend to be centered in New York City, and from the Republican-led Senate, which is already bracing for a fight on the mental hospitals, the highway fund and the education formulas.
"The Governor's use of a dedicated highway fund is especially troublesome," said Senator Ronald B. Stafford, the Plattsburgh Republican who heads the Senate Finance Committee.
And the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Oyster Bay, L.I., criticized the new Medicaid plan, complaining that even with all the cuts in the program, Medicaid spending increased.
Some of Mr. Cuomo's budget plans were a repackaging of old proposals, like a program to have the state gradually take over local Medicaid costs and a proposal to change the state's sentencing laws so that felons would not automatically be sentenced to state prison after second offenses.
But some of the programs were new, including one for a new state lottery game, keno, which is expected to generate $25 million a year. The Governor also proposed allowing parole violators to be sentenced to local jails rather than to state prisons. That would free the state of the cost to house those prisoners.
The Governor could have spent the day in Washington, eating lunch with President-elect Bill Clinton and the country's other Governors, but today was the last day he was legally allowed to present his budget. He said he based his budget on modest projections for the future.
Mr. Cuomo exhorted the Legislature, as he does every year, to pass the budget by the April 1 statutory deadline. The state has not passed a budget on time since 1984, a record that has led to lower bond ratings and has wreaked havoc with cities and towns that depend on state aid. The current year's budget was a day late.

HEADLINE: Mayors Vote to Move Meeting to New York This Summer

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Heeding an appeal by Mayor David N. Dinkins, the executive committee of the United States Conference of Mayors decided today to hold its annual meeting in New York City this summer.
Playing host to the meeting is more a bragging right than an economic boon -- only 1,000 people are expected to attend. But the meeting, to be held June 18 to 23, will give Mr. Dinkins a chance to polish the city's image while adding luster to his own amid what is expected to be a tough re-election campaign. The New York City primary is Sept. 14. 
 "This is not on the magnitude of the Grammy Awards or the Goodwill Games," Mr. Dinkins said. "But it's one more vote of confidence for New York City."
 
$35 Billion Wish List
 The mayors originally had planned to meet in Colorado Springs, but the executive committee voted last month to change the location because of Colorado's passage of a constitutional amendment that banned special protection under civil rights laws for lesbians and gay men.
Also at today's meeting, the mayors, led by Mr. Dinkins, concluded their session here by taking a final swipe at President Bush for his policies on the nation's cities and by greeting the new administration with a $35 billion wish list.
"The legacy of 12 years of Republican rule is the destruction of our urban centers," Mr. Dinkins said at the conference. "But for the first time in a long time after a dozen years of urban centers being neglected by Washington, we will now be in a position to get our foot in the door to be able to get audiences with those who can affect policy and affect it for the better."
The mayors presented a resolution drafted by Mr. Dinkins that calls for a $35 billion emergency jobs spending program.
 
519 New York Projects
 They outlined broader needs in an urban policy paper and specific needs in a list of 7,250 "ready to go" capital improvement projects in more than 500 cities.
Mr. Dinkins said New York City accounted for 519 of those projects -- ranging from improvements at city-run libraries to upgrading dozens of municipal buildings and roadways -- with a total projected cost of nearly $1.7 billion.
In addition to the jobs program, the mayors called for a shift of Federal budget priorities from military spending to domestic projects and the creation of a project known as the "Local Partnership Act," which would help cities pay for public safety, public works and infrastructure projects.
They also urged the Clinton Administration to support the extension of certain tax credits for low-income housing and certain jobs, and for a tax deduction for charitable donations of property to local governments and nonprofit institutions. Those and other tax provisions expired last summer, and President Bush vetoed a tax bill that would have extended the credits.
The vote to change the site of next year's meeting came after Mr. Dinkins wrote to his 17 fellow members of the executive committee advising them that he would boycott a meeting in Colorado and urging them to do the same. He also asked them to consider New York City as an alternative site.
 
90-Minute Meeting
 Sixteen cities, including New York, submitted bids to have this summer's meeting. A site selection committee recommended Reno, Nev., but after a private 90-minute meeting this morning, the committee announced that New York City would be the site of the annual meeting. Mr. Dinkins said the vote was unanimously in favor of New York City, which was the site of the conference most recently in 1964.
A mayoral aide said Mr. Dinkins showed up for today's meeting with a plan that included discount hotel rooms to lure the meeting to New York City. Mr. Dinkins also used to his advantage the good responses he and the city received after the Democratic National Convention was held in New York last summer.
"Mayor Dinkins is a key and a strong member of the conference," said Tom Cochran, the executive director of the mayors' conference. "The strength of his commitment and having the local government behind us was very key to the decision. "The good job he had done with the Democratic Convention also worked in New York City's favor."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Moving Reluctantly to Accept Peace Proposal

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jan. 19

 BODY:
Alarmed by the possibility of Western military intervention aimed at halting or containing the war here, the Serbian nationalists whose forces have seized two-thirds of this republic appeared to be moving today toward approving the outlines of an international peace plan that would keep Bosnia and Herzegovina intact as a sovereign state.
Delegates to the Serbian nationalist Parliament met to debate the plan in a disgruntled and sometimes angry mood, with many claiming that Western nations were blackmailing Serbia and Serbian nationalists in Bosnia into acceptance of conditions that would amount to a betrayal of their cause. But the nationalists' principal leader, Radovan Karadzic, backed the plan, and its passage, when the meeting resumes on Wednesday, seemed assured. 
 Dr. Karadzic, a 46-year-old psychiatrist, called the session after first rejecting, then reluctantly accepting, a set of principles for a peace accord that were drawn up in Geneva by the co-chairmen of an international mediation effort led by Cyrus R. Vance, representing the United Nations, and Lord Owen of Britain, representing the European Community.
After months of delays, Mr. Vance and Lord Owen set a deadline last week for acceptance of the peace plan. They warned Dr. Karadzic that failure to accept the plan would force the issue back to the United Nations Security Council, where the United States, Britain and France have led the way in placing gradually increasing pressure on Serbia and its allies in Bosnia. The Western powers have been poised to take new action, this time in enforcing a no-flights zone over Bosnia that is said to have been repeatedly violated by Serbian and Croatian aircraft.
Serbian leaders have repeatedly signed undertakings at conferences on the Bosnian war and subsequently broken them. The difference this time is that they are being asked to commit themselves to something, the maintenance of Bosnia as a sovereign state, that is alien to their purpose in the war. Hard-liners here opposed this bitterly, arguing for continuation of the war, and even those who supported the Vance-Owen plan, like Dr. Karadzic, implied that ways might be found in the future of uniting the Serbian-held regions of Bosnia with Serbia.
"We went through hell," Dr. Karadzic said, speaking against a backdrop of Serbian nationalist flags. Under the Vance-Owen plan, Dr. Karadzic said, "we will be forced to live together with our greatest enemies, people who attacked our homes, our innocent children, even our cradles."
 
Union With Serbia
 The war began 10 months ago when the Serbian nationalists, opposed to Bosnia's secession from Yugoslavia, began military offensives aimed at making much of the republic into an exclusive Serbian domain. Although seldom proclaimed, the nationalists' ultimate aim has been the annexation of the occupied regions, with a population of 1.3 million Bosnian Serbs, to Serbia, which borders this republic.
The 81 delegates to the Bosnian Serbs' parliament met in the cafeteria of a diesel-engine factory outside this small mountain town 12 miles east of Sarajevo, which has served as the Serbian nationalists' headquarters since their leaders, and the formidable army they command, abandoned Sarajevo last April and began the war against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government. The factory, idled like almost all industries and businesses in Bosnia, is one of the few buildings in Pale that have electrical power, drawn from a generator, after Serbian forces destroyed key power lines outside Sarajevo.
The delegates showed little readiness to examine the Serbian role in launching the war, or to acknowledge the pattern of brutality that Western governments and international human rights groups have ascribed to the Serbian forces and the irregular paramilitary units from Serbia that have been in the forefront of much of the fighting. Instead, there was an insistence that Serbs, not Muslims, have been the main victims of the war.
Dr. Karadzic set the tone by accusing Muslims of starting the war. He said that the Serbs had endured "nine months during which the truth about us has been totally distorted, in which the Serbian side was accused of everything that our enemy has been doing."
Along with Muslims, he said, Western nations were responsible for the war, by recognizing Bosnia as an independent state without obtaining assurances that the rights of minorities would be protected.
 
'Rattling Their Sabers'
 "Their responsibility for the hell we are going through is complete," he said. "By brutal diplomacy and pressure, and by their support of unilateral secessionist acts, in defiance of international law, they caused the break-up of Yugoslavia. Now they have resorted to threats, rattling their sabers and crucifying the Serbian people with their biased media, on the one hand, and with their so-called political solution on the other."
Nonetheless, the Serbian nationalist leader urged the parliament to accept the Vance-Owen plan, saying that despite its bias against Serbs it "leaves enough possibilities for connections and links with other states," meaning Serbia. He noted that the plan provides for 10 autonomous regions, at least four of which would have strong Serbian majorities unless refugee populations return, and that a weak central government, with power only over foreign affairs, international trade citizenship and taxation for national purposes, "does not offer many possibilities to the central authorities to dominate us."
Among the 1.9 million Bosnian Muslims, who accounted for 44 percent of the population before the war, opposition to the Vance-Owen plan is deep, partly because it would have the effect of dividing the country on an ethnic basis and partly because it lacks any enforceable measures for returning Muslims to their homes or compensating them for their losses in the war.
In Pale, some delegates made it clear that they would approve the plan, if at all, only to avoid Western military intervention and a tightening of economic sanctions against Serbia. One of the leaders of Dr. Karadzic's Serbian Democratic Party, Biljana Plavsic, urged the defeat of the plan.
"If we approve this it will be a capitulation and a repudiation of everything we have fought for," she said. "Our people will flee Bosnia in an exodus, the economy will be permanently impoverished, our army will be disarmed, we will be occupied by foreign troops and the Serbs who remain will be isolated and surrounded by enemies."

Mediators Going to Sarajevo
 GENEVA, Jan. 19 (Special to The New York Times) -- The co-chairmen of the team that is trying to negotiate an end to the wars in Bosnia and Herzegovina said today that they are flying to Sarajevo early Wednesday to try to stop fighting between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims.
Mr. Vance and Lord Owen are to mediate between Croatian and Muslim leaders in Sarajevo in the morning and in Zagreb in the late afternoon.
Clashes between Muslim and Croatian forces broke out anew and with increasing intensity after the killing of Josip Gogala, the revenue chief of the Bosnian Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and four other ethnic Croats in Sarajevo on Jan. 6. The killers were Muslim militiamen.
Combat between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims has erupted around Travnik and Gornji Vakuf in the center of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
U.N. Report on Killing
 UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Jan. 19 (Reuters) -- Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said today that the assassination of Bosnia's deputy prime minister was the work of a single Serb assailant "acting unilaterally" and said United Nations authorities did not know the identity of the minister until shortly before he was killed.
The Secretary General gave a preview of an investigation into the Jan. 8 killing of Deputy Prime Minister Hakija Turajlic, who was returning from Sarajevo airport in a United Nations armored personnel carrier. The report is expected to be released on Friday.
In a letter to the Security Council, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not follow proper procedures and that United Nations forces did not know the identity of Mr. Turajlic until Serb gunmen stopped the vehicle and he was forced to show his papers.

Governor Cuomo proposed a Spartan state budget that avoids general tax increases by squeezing aid to local schools, closing three state mental hospitals, paring the state work force and increasing taxes on hospitals while cutting health benefits for the poor. In presenting his plan for the fiscal year that begins on April 1, Mr. Cuomo declared that the state's economy was "not out of the woods yet," the central reason he proposed to allow the budget to grow only 1.6 percent from last year, to $31.5 billion.

 CUOMO'S LEDGER LEGACY
Nelson A. Rockefeller spread miles of asphalt, built modern campuses and raised skyscrapers for state workers. Hugh L. Carey helped save New York City from bankruptcy. Now Governor Cuomo, less than 22 months from the end of his third term, is hoping to construct a different kind of legacy, an invisible one built by balancing budgets and improving fiscal practices during a relentless recession.

HEADLINE: Reginald F. Lewis, 50, Is Dead; Financier Led Beatrice Takeover

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Reginald F. Lewis, a Wall Street lawyer and financier who was one of the nation's richest businessmen and a prominent corporate takeover dealer, died yesterday in Manhattan, one day after his company announced he was suffering from brain cancer. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan and Paris.
Mr. Lewis died from a cerebral hemorrhage related to the cancer, his company said. 
 Mr. Lewis, whose $1 billion acquisition in 1987 of the Beatrice Companies, a foods concern, led to the formation of his own company, TLC Beatrice International, had amassed personal assets of $400 million, according to estimates by Fortune magazine. By acquiring the Beatrice operations, TLC, which stands for The Lewis Company, became the largest company in the country run by a black person. But Mr. Lewis rejected notions that he should be viewed as an important figure because of his race.
"I'm very proud of the accomplishments of African-Americans," Mr. Lewis said in an interview shortly after the acquisition of Beatrice. "And I'm delighted that people feel this accomplishment adds to that list. But to dwell on race -- to see that as something that becomes part of my persona -- is a mistake, and I do everything I can to discourage it."
In the last few years, Mr. Lewis became deeply involved in philanthropy, donating millions of dollars each year to a number of institutions, from homeless shelters and neighborhood churches. Last year, his $3 million donation to the Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1968, made him the school's largest individual donor ever.
 
Building on Success
 Mr. Lewis's business career was highlighted by two major deals. The first, in 1983, involved the purchase of the McCall Pattern Company. With $1 million he had saved from his dealings as a corporate lawyer, he led a $23 million buyout of the small dress-pattern maker. Four years later, after restoring the ailing company to financial health, Mr. Lewis sold McCall to the John Crowther Group of Britain for $63 million in cash, which brought him a personal profit of $50 million.
What followed was the deal that cemented his place as a major Wall Street financier. The Beatrice Companies placed for sale its international operations, which included an amalgam of 64 companies operating in 31 countries, ranging from a sausage producer in Spain to an ice cream maker in Germany. Mr. Lewis, with the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert, put together the financing to buy the operations for $985 million in 1987.
Mr. Lewis worked rapidly to sell less profitable operations to reduce debt, including former Beatrice businesses in Canada, Australia and many in Asia. Many expected that he would use his new-found leverage in the investment and financial community to pull off yet another giant acquisition. But Mr. Lewis settled comfortably into the role of manager, while keeping his eye open for potential deals.
While he had considerable success operating his company profitably despite the recession in Europe, he had a few disappointments. The most notable was an attempt to take the company public in a stock offering in 1991. That effort was aborted as much by the skittishness the market at the time as by the perception of Mr. Lewis as a profiteer with little interest in running the company.
 
Working Hard and Saving
 That was a reputation he worked to dispel by spending more time managing the operations of the largely European company, rather than leaving the details to subordinates.
Mr. Lewis was born into a middle-class family in Baltimore in 1942. His father was a postal worker and his mother a teacher. He once said that he began selling newspapers when he was 9 years old, earning about $20 a week and saving $18.
He graduated from Virginia State University before entering Harvard Law School. After graduating in 1968, he joined the New York law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkin Wharton & Garrison. In the early 1970's, he opened his own law firm, Lewis & Clarkson, which specialized in venture capital projects.
A former high school and college quarterback, Mr. Lewis was athletically built and was an avid tennis player. His trademark was an imported cigar that always seemed perched in his mouth.
In 1988, he moved with his wife and two daughters to Paris to manage Beatrice operations in Europe, buying an 18th century townhouse near the National Assembly building. After studying the language, he occasionally conducted business meetings in French. He was an avid patron of the arts, having acquired a sizable collection of paintings by Picasso, Matisse and others.
Mr. Lewis was said by associates and friends to have been in good health until two months ago, when he was diagnosed as having brain cancer. Since then, Mr. Lewis worked feverishly to complete plans for passing on executive responsibility for his company to others and spending time with his wife and two daughters.
"He knew he had this tumor for about two months," said the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a friend of Mr. Lewis's. "He spent the last two months preparing for treatment and getting his whole house in order, in terms of the company and his family."
 
Transition Plan Developed
 TLC said on Monday that Mr. Lewis had structured a transition plan that would transfer the responsibility of running the company to his half-brother, Jean S. Fugett, a 41-year-old former professional football player who is now practicing law in Baltimore.
Mr. Lewis considered his contributions to educational institutions to be his most important legacy. In the last few years, he gave vast sums to several schools, including Virginia State and Howard universities. In New York, he gave large contributions to Abyssinian Baptist Church and the scholarship foundation of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, of which he was a member.
Mr. Lewis was a member of the boards of WNET in New York and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. He was also a member of the Business Roundtable and the Economic Advisory Committee of New York City. Mayor David N. Dinkins had nominated him to be a member of the city's Municipal Assistance Corporation.
In addition to his half-brother Jean, of Baltimore, Mr. Lewis is survived by his wife, the former Loida Nicolas, two daughters, Leslie and Christina; his mother, Carolyn C. Fugett, and stepfather, Jean S. Fugett, both of Baltimore; two other half-brothers, Joseph M. Fugett of New York City and Anthony S. Fugett of Baltimore, and two half-sisters, Rosalyn Fugett Wiley and Sharon M. Fugett, both of Baltimore.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Posts $5.46 Billion Loss for 4th Quarter;
1992's Deficit Is Biggest in U.S. Business

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation reported a record $5.46 billion loss for the fourth quarter yesterday and offered little optimism that its business would improve anytime soon.
The size of the computer giant's losses were striking, with the deficit of $4.97 billion for all of 1992 the biggest annual loss in American corporate history. But bad as the numbers were, they were in line with analysts' expectations, after I.B.M. announced last month plans to take the huge fourth-quarter charge against earnings to trim its work force and streamline operations. 
 Even excluding the special charges, I.B.M. lost $45 million in the fourth quarter on revenues of $19.56 billion. In the past, I.B.M. has made as much as 40 percent of its profits in the fourth quarter.
 
Share Price Drops
 I.B.M.'s share price, which rose above $100 last summer, dropped $1.125 yesterday to close at $48.375.
"Our financial results are not acceptable to us or our shareholders," John F. Akers, the I.B.M. chairman, said.
More than the overall results, analysts focused on the continuing decline in sales not only of I.B.M.'s big mainframe computers but also of its middle-range machines, so-called minicomputers, which are also sold to corporate customers. The fourth-quarter fall in hardware sales, down 20 percent, reflects not only the technological shift to small but powerful computers, but also the weakness of economies like Europe and Japan, where demand for I.B.M.'s large machines has traditionally been strong.
Held back by lagging hardware sales, analysts expect that I.B.M.'s profit margins will continue to suffer. The lowered expectations for earnings this year could influence the decision I.B.M.'s board must make on Tuesday, about the company's quarterly dividend payment.
Given the company's losses and uncertain business outlook, most analysts have figured the board would cut the $1.21 quarterly payout by about half. But if the profit outlook seems more in doubt, the board may decide the financially prudent thing to do is slice the dividend by more than half, analysts said.
 
'Aggressive Actions' Planned
 Mr. Akers emphasized that the company was taking "aggressive actions" to increase its competitiveness and profitability by "reallocating resources to growth businesses, increasing the autonomy of our businesses, and reducing costs."
Still, Mr. Akers warned that "difficult problems remain ahead."
In a conference call with analysts yesterday, James Clippard, I.B.M.'s director of investor relations, outlined the company's plans for continued cost-cutting in 1993 with sales, general and administrative expenses likely to be trimmed by $1 billion and research and development spending reduced by more than $600 million. The payroll, Mr. Clippard added, was cut to 301,500 employees by the end of 1992, down some 42,900 people from the year before. An additional 25,000 people will go this year.
Most analysts are impressed by I.B.M.'s cost-cutting efforts. And there are other areas of strength for the company. Its computer services business grew by 17 percent in the fourth quarter. Its work station computers are selling briskly and, after losing its hold on the personal computers market for years, sales of those machines rebounded in the fourth quarter.
 
Software Revenues Decline
 But those strengths were not enough to offset the company's weaknesses. Even revenues from software, a business I.B.M. is counting on for growth, declined by 2 percent, presumably because much of those sales are linked to its hardware sales.
For the quarter, the company reported a loss of $5.46 billion on revenues of $19.56 billion. In the quarter a year ago, I.B.M. posted a loss of $1.46 billion on revenues of $21.97 billion.
For the year, the company reported a loss of $4.97 billion on revenues of $64.5 billion. In 1991, I.B.M. posted a loss of $2.86 billion on revenues of $64.8 billion.
The full-year loss of $4.97 billion by I.B.M. is the largest in American corporate history. The General Motors Corporation recorded a 1991 loss of $4.45 billion, after huge charges for cutbacks and plant closings.
The Ford Motor Company reported last month that it planned to take a one-time charge of $7.5 billion, bringing a net loss of more than $6 billion in 1992. But that is a noncash charge to account for the future costs for retiree benefits all at once instead of spreading them out over years.

HEADLINE: Abuses by Serbs the Worst Since Nazi Era, Report Says

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In its final global human rights report, the Bush Administration said today that Serbian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina were conducting a campaign of "cruelty, brutality and killing" unrivaled since Nazi times.
The survey of 189 countries issued by the State Department described a Serbian policy of terror against civilians that made "a mockery" of the Geneva Convention. The Serbs' "ethnic cleansing" campaign includes widespread and systematic rape and murder and the systematic shelling and starvation by siege of large cities, the report said. 
 Non-Serbs were subjected to "almost every conceivable form of torture, humiliation and killing," it said, including the deliberate disfigurement and the excision of body parts of prisoners in Serb-run camps.
By the end of 1992, the war in the Balkans had displaced more than 1.5 million people, including an estimated one-half of the Muslim population, according to the report, which must be issued annually by law.
 
Iraq and Israel Is Criticized
 "The policy of driving out innocent civilians of a different ethnic or religious group from their homes, so-called ethnic cleansing, was practiced by Serbian forces in Bosnia on a scale that dwarfs anything seen in Europe since Nazi times," the report said.
All sides in the former Yugoslav republic have committed atrocities, but "the atrocities of the Croats and Bosnian Muslims pale in comparison to the sheer scale and calculated cruelty of the killings and other abuses committed by Serbian and Bosnian Serbian forces against Bosnian Muslims," the report said.
As in past years, the report called the human rights situation in Iraq "abysmal," and was critical of Israel's treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories. The report also concluded that conditions in China were still poor despite signs of improvement and that political violence in Haiti declined last year.
On Bosnia, the strongly worded report, which includes 16 new countries this year, points up the failure of the Europeans and the Bush Administration to end or even curb the atrocities and will heighten pressure on the Clinton Administration to make good on campaign and post-election promises to take a tougher line against Serbia.
 
'Defining Moment' in Somalia
 President-elect Bill Clinton has also vowed to be tougher than Mr. Bush was in promoting human rights and democracy around the world. Senior aides to Mr. Clinton acknowledge, however, that despite the relentless Serbian campaign, they are not close to agreement on a comprehensive strategy to deal with the Balkan crisis.
The report also described abuses by the Serbian police in the Serbian-controlled, formerly autonomous region of Kosovo, whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. Serbian authorities maintain "complete control over all aspects of political, economic, social and cultural life," the report said, and routinely and systematically carry out arbitrary arrests of Albanians, who are subjected to torture and beatings during interrogations.
In announcing the report's conclusions today, Assistant Secretary of State Patricia Diaz Dennis called the American-led military mission in Somalia to deliver relief to famine victims a "defining moment in the role that human rights and humanitarian concerns play in world affairs."
 
Mass Executions Reported
 The report, which was prepared before the recent American-led military attacks against Baghdad, said of Iraq, "There were mass executions of political opponents, widespread use of torture, extreme repression of ethnic groups, disappearances, denial of due process and arbitrary detention." In both the largely Kurdish north, and the largely Shiite south, where there were uprisings against Mr. Hussein after the 1991 gulf war, the Government has imposed complete internal embargoes of food, medicine and fuel.
Far from suggesting that President Saddam Hussein's grip on power is weakening because of the pressure of international isolation and United Nations-imposed sanctions, the report concluded that he "continues to wield decisive power over all instruments of government." The report noted that "almost all of Iraq's most powerful officials are either members of the President's family or longtime family allies from his hometown of Tikrit."
On Israel, the report noted a 62 percent increase in Israeli killings of Palestinians despite a decrease in violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Of the 158 Palestinians killed by Israeli security forces last year, at least 45 were killed by undercover commandos disguised as Palestinians, the report said, adding that according to witnesses about two-thirds of those killed were unarmed.
 
Political Violence in Haiti
 The report also concluded that political violence in Haiti declined last year, in contrast to the period after the military coup in September 1991 that ousted the first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
But the report included a curious reference to a political killing that suggested the involvement of Mr. Aristide. It noted that a Haitian Army commander had told United States Government officials last year that President Aristide ordered him by telephone to kill one of his political opponents in 1991. The officer who carried out the killing also told American officials that he was aware of the order from President Aristide.
Father Aristide has denied the charges, and the report drew no conclusions about the accuracy of the accusation. State Department officials said that there was a deep division in the department over whether to include the incident in the report, but that it was done on the insistence of officials in the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs.
Its inclusion is likely to set off a review of Father Aristide's human rights record by the Clinton Administration, which is promoting United Nations-sponsored negotiations for a political settlement. During his confirmation hearings last week, Warren M. Christopher, Mr. Clinton's choice for Secretary of State, said Father Aristide must be part of a future Haitian Government, although he declined to say that he would have to return as President.
 
Abuses in China
 China's human rights practices still fall "far short of accepted norms," the report said. It cited sham trials of dissidents, arbitrary arrests and torture and mistreatment of prisoners. But the report also cited a "more positive" turn in 1992, reflected in Beijing's release of 80 percent of the pro-democracy advocates imprisoned after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square.
The report also noted that in several countries of the former Soviet Union moves toward democracy had been stalled, in part because of what Ms. Diaz called "the residual influence of old regime elites."
The report will be available in about two weeks through the Government Printing Office, State Department officials said. The price has not yet been determined.

Former Hermes Executive Will Head Oxxford Clothes

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Oxxford Clothes Inc., the Chicago-based maker of pricey hand-sewn men's suits, named Chrys Fisher president and chief executive yesterday, less than a month after Mr. Fisher resigned as head of the American operations of Hermes, the Paris-based luxury-goods company known for its ties and scarves.
Mr. Fisher, 47, replaces Jack McDonald, who is retiring. He said at the time of his resignation from Hermes late last month that he was seeking a management position with an equity stake, which Oxxford offered him. 
 The new company chief said yesterday that Oxxford was not likely to lower the price of its suits, which are sold off the rack for more than $1,200, but would expand by selling products like dress shirts and ties. He added that Oxxford would increasingly look abroad for new business, in countries like Japan. The company will also establish an office in Manhattan, Mr. Fisher said.
Oxxford, which is privately held, declined to give sales figures. But Alan G. Millstein, a retail consultant in New York, said its sales had probably softened in recent years with the sluggish economy and the decline in popularity of overt status symbols.
Mr. Millstein said it was likely that Mr. Fisher would introduce a line of less expensive suits, even if this meant more tailoring done by machine. Mr. Fisher's challenge thus becomes expanding the Oxxford brand without diluting its handmade image.
"Oxxford suits will be museum pieces unless he makes the price points more accessible," Mr. Millstein said, adding that he expected the company to establish its own stores and introduce more women's clothing. Oxxford distributors include Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Mr. Fisher is credited with protecting the value of the Hermes brand while the company expanded to new locations, sold increasingly to wholesalers, and started a direct-mail subsidiary.
Before joining Hermes in 1984, he managed the Neiman Marcus branch in Bal Harbour, Fla., and was also responsible for the corporation's computer systems.

Offer Made For Bank in Westchester

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
A group of high-profile investors, including a corporate takeover specialist and the owner of the Minnesota Twins baseball club, has offered to buy Peoples Westchester Savings Bank, the bank announced yesterday.
The friendly offer, for $30 a share, would amount to $160 million. The bank has weathered the economic downturn in the Northeast with few problems, and its presence in the affluent New York City suburbs makes it an attractive franchise. 
 Partnership 77 Group, which has been the bank's largest shareholder, with a 9.5 percent stake, is part of the investor group, said Ilene A. Angarola, a spokeswoman for the Hawthorne, N.Y., bank.
 
Takeover Expertise
 The partnership includes Carl Pohlad, owner of the Twins, president of Marquette Bank Minneapolis and chairman of M.E.I. Diversified Inc.; Irwin Jacobs, a financier who has specialized in takeovers, including hostile bids for the Walt Disney Company, Avon Products Inc., and the ITT Corporation, and Gerald Schwalbach, a Minneapolis investor.
Also participating in the offer are William Nicholson, the former chief operating officer of the Amway Corporation, and Chartwell Associates L.P., a company owned by Gordon Getty and the Fisher brothers, Lawrence and Zachary, whose family has long been active in New York real estate.
 
Stock Climbs
 The bank's stock closed yesterday at $30.75, up 32.3 percent from Monday's close of $23.25, in Nasdaq trading. With the stock trading close to the investors' offering price, Wall Street appears to believe that the deal will be concluded at a price near the initial bid.
But some analysts said they considered the bid low.
"The offer is essentially book value, and that's not a lot of money to be offering," said Mary P. Quinn, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., which specializes in bank stocks. She added that her company's report on the bank from mid-September suggested that the institution could fetch a price of $35 to $40 a share.
Peoples Westchester may be hard pressed to reject the investors' offer. The bid represents the highest price for the stock in more than five years. But a bidding war is not out of the question, especially among financial institutions eager to establish a presence north of New York City.
 
 
In Good Health
 Samuel J. Beebe, an analyst with Robert W. Baird & Company in Tampa, Fla., said that Peoples Westchester, a community bank with total assets of about $1.8 billion and 32 Westchester County offices, has only 2.73 percent of assets classified as nonperforming. By comparison, nonperforming asset levels of 5 percent or even 10 percent are common, particularly among financial institutions in the Northeast, he said.
He also said that the bank is in "a very upscale market" and that it "is a decent, well-managed savings bank that has come though the terrible asset problems in the New York area relatively unscathed."
Peoples Westchester quoted the investors as saying they wanted "to pursue a friendly transaction and are only interested in going forward if our proposed transaction is approved by the company's board of directors."
The bank said it was reviewing the proposal with its legal advisers and its financial adviser, the First Boston Corporation.

HEADLINE: Late Selling Pushes the Dow Down 18.92

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
A late round of selling swept blue-chip stocks lower as the benefits of a bond rally were confined largely to those companies most sensitive to interest rates.
Although Big Board advances led declines slightly, a continuing selloff in medical, food, beverage and other consumer growth stocks knocked the major market averages down. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.92 points, to 3,255.99. Big Board trading remained hectic, at 289.4 million shares, with investors continuing to flee from sector to sector. Strategists saw the press of selling as evidence of uneasiness about the Clinton Presidency, which begins today.
 
'Honeymoon Before the Wedding'
 "The honeymoon occurred before the wedding," said Richard J. Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company. "As they said in the Wizard of Oz, this isn't Arkansas. He's going to have to run the Government."
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.71 points, to 435.13, and 9 of the 10 stocks that dragged it down the most were in the supposedly stable consumer and drug area. Among them were Coca-Cola, down 1 1/8, to 42; American Home Products, 3, to 63; Johnson & Johnson, 1 3/8, to 45 3/8, and Pfizer, 2 1/4, to 61. The other was I.B.M., down 1 1/8, to 48 3/8, after reporting record losses.
A bond rally such as yesterday's, though concentrated at the longer end, would normally win a warm response from investors in stocks. But only buyers of banking and utility shares seemed to notice, and even bank investors may have been warmed mostly by sunny earnings reports.
Wells Fargo led the banking advance, gaining 13 points, or 15 percent, to 99, on strong earnings and signs that losses from California real estate may be abating.
BankAmerica, set to sell $2 billion in troubled loans, extended its run by adding 3 7/8 yesterday, to 53 3/8. First Chicago, Bank of Boston and First Interstate also rose a point or more, and Chemical and Nationsbank had smaller gains. Citicorp gained 7/8, to 24 1/2, after reporting that it reversed its loss of a year earlier.
The latest round of earnings reports told David Dreman, whose money management firm bears his name, that the huge write-offs of 1990 and 1991 have covered the banks' real estate losses.
Now even the West Coast shows signs of improving, he said, adding, "Two weeks ago you couldn't give away a California savings and loan or bank."
The Dow Jones utilities average rose 0.44 point, to 222.90, as lower interest rates made the relatively high yields on utility stocks that much more attractive.
Such cyclical issues as auto stocks continued to improve, as Chrysler added a point and General Motors 1 1/8. But the the Dow transportation average, a star of late, pulled back, with rail issues especially hurt by lower ratings from NatWest Securities.
The Nasdaq composite average slipped 1.32 points, to 696.81, a loss narrower than that of the Dow. Top computer and biotechnology stocks had an especially rough day, while the small stocks in the Russell 2000 index actually managed a slight gain.
Even Intel's nearly vertical advance halted yesterday on a 1 7/8 decline, to 114 3/4. Among biotechs, Amgen fell 2 5/8, to 65; Chiron 2 5/8, to 52 1/2, and Synergen 2 3/4, to 56 3/4.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: The Supreme Court;
Supreme Court Asks U.S. if Rackets Law Applies to Anti-Abortion Protests

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The Supreme Court asked today for the Government's views on whether abortion clinics can invoke a Federal racketeering law against groups that organize demonstrations and blockades aimed at shutting the clinics down.
On the eve of the inauguration, the request will give the Clinton Administration an early occasion to put its views before the Court in an important abortion-related case. 
 The lower Federal courts are split over whether the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, commonly known as the RICO law, applies in the context of abortion clinic blockades. Last week the Court rejected another avenue of attack against the clinic blockades, ruling that a 19th-century Federal civil rights law known as the Ku Klux Klan Act does not apply.
The Court turned down a case involving the RICO question three years ago. The later case, which the Justices have yet to decide whether to accept, is an appeal of a ruling last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago.
In the appeal, the National Organization for Women is trying to use the RICO law on behalf of two abortion clinics to sue several anti-abortion groups and leaders, including Operation Rescue and the Pro-Life Action League. The suit contends that the anti-abortion organizations were engaged in harassing and intimidating the clinics' staff and patients and that these tactics amounted to extortion, a Federal crime, and turned the organizations into "racketeering enterprises" in the service of a nationwide conspiracy aimed at eliminating access to abortion.
The RICO law provides for triple damages and other heavy penalties for running an enterprise through a "pattern of racketeering activity."
The Seventh Circuit, calling the anti-abortion demonstrators "reprehensible," said it was nonetheless obliged to dismiss the lawsuit. The appeals court said that in its view the RICO law applied only to an "economically motivated enterprise" or to illegal actions that are motivated by a search for economic gain, a description that the court said did not apply to the anti-abortion demonstrators.
It is this question of whether the RICO law is limited to economically motivated actions that has split the lower courts, and it is what the Court is asking the Clinton Administration to address. Presumably the Administration will advise the Court not only on whether to take the case, National Organization for Women v. Scheidler, No. 92-780, but also on what impact an economic motivation test might have for other applications of the RICO law.
In the past, the Court has expressed concern about the breadth of the RICO law but has been reluctant to take the initiative away from Congress in writing new limits into the law.
There is no time limit for the Administration to respond to the Court's request, and such responses usually take two months or more. The Court directs such requests, which are fairly common, to the Solicitor General, the Justice Department official in charge of arguing for the Government before the Court. The Clinton transition has not yet named a new Solicitor General to replace Kenneth W. Starr, who argued his last case as President Bush's Solicitor General last week.
The Court also took these actions today:
 
State Regulation
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear a constitutional challenge by a group of insurance companies to a New Jersey law regulating withdrawal from the insurance business in the state.
The law, enacted in 1990 and upheld last year by the State Supreme Court, prohibits insurance companies from withdrawing from the automobile insurance business in New Jersey unless they also withdraw from selling other, more profitable types of insurance. The goal of the law was to make it unattractive for the insurers simply to drop their automobile business as a way of avoiding the surcharges imposed by New Jersey to bail out a state-sponsored high-risk insurance plan.
Eight companies, all subsidiaries of the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, argued that the law had violated their constitutional right to due process and also amounted to an unconstitutional taking of their property without due process of law. The case was Twin City Fire Insurance Co. v. Fortunato, No. 92-728.
 
School's Duty
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear an appeal by two teen-aged girls who were the victims of months of sexual assaults by seven male high school classmates. The abuse, for which the male students later faced charges in juvenile court, occurred on school grounds during school hours. The lawsuit by the girls charged that their teachers and school administrators had violated their constitutional right to due process of law by failing to protect them.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, dismissed the suit on a 7-to-5 vote, finding that Supreme Court precedents foreclosed a Federal constitutional lawsuit of this sort. The case was D. R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational School, No. 92-816.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: Screen Play;
Hollywood Crowd Gives Capital Two Thumbs Up

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The current wisdom in Hollywood dismisses movies with political themes and Washington backdrops. Too somber. Too boring. Not enough action. But the inauguration of Bill Clinton, a real-life drama with plenty of music and parties, has virtually turned Pennsylvania Avenue into Sunset Boulevard.
"I had work to do, and the only place I could actually see my friends from L.A. is here," quipped David Zucker, one of the creators of the "Airplane!" spoofs, as he rushed off to a tour of the Capitol building. 
 Never have so many stars and executives come to Washington for a single event as the inauguration on Wednesday of President-elect Bill Clinton. And never have so many Hollywood folks, who are rich, powerful, and accustomed to getting what they want, been so awed by a town that was only a movie backdrop for most of them.
"I mean, this is power here," said Mark Gill, senior vice president of publicity at Columbia Studios. "In Hollywood, power means you can green-light a movie. That kind of power looks trivial compared to Washington."
 
'Power Attracts Power'
 To the Hollywood crowd, which often views events and people in movie terms, Mr. Clinton's popularity may either prove enduring, like Clint Eastwood's, or slippery, like Sylvester Stallone's.
There are pointed comparisons between Hollywood and Washington. Both towns focus on image and deal, often cruelly, with the ephemera of power and success and failure.
"Power is as elusive here as it is in Hollywood," said John F. Cooke, president of the Disney Channel and one of the many Hollywood executives here. "Power attracts power. Last night, when Clinton came to the inaugural ball, the most powerful people in Hollywood were lined up against the railing waiting to shake his hand. No matter how long it took."
It's been that way for years.
There has been a relationship between Hollywood and Washington since the days of Franklin D. Roosevelt, when Orson Welles, Bette Davis, Eddie Cantor, Frank Sinatra, Humphrey Bogart and Judy Garland supported him, often against the wishes of their studio chiefs.
 
The Kennedy Connection
 With the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, the Washington-Hollywood connection proved especially strong. Kennedy enjoyed his friendship with stars like Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Marilyn Monroe and Peter Lawford, who was his brother-in-law. Years later, President Ronald Reagan, a former actor, was fond of reminiscing with supporters like Charlton Heston, Bob Hope and Jimmy Stewart. And President Bush's show business support included perhaps the most bankable actor in Hollywood, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
But if the ties between these administrations and Hollywood seemed friendly, the links between the Clinton Administration and largely Democratic Hollywood are, for the moment, like a love affair.
"It's the first time in 16 years that people who believe in Democratic politics can celebrate legitimately," Dawn Steel, a Hollywood producer, said. But Marge Tabankin, executive director of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, a liberal group with numerous stars and executives, said the influx of stars reached even beyond Mr. Clinton's appeal.
"There's this almost chemical attraction between political power and cultural power," she said. "What's been interesting over the last few days is that you see, among people who are very powerful in Hollywood, an extraordinary reverence for Washington. They're really awed by the town."
 
'Amazing' Preoccupation
 Certainly not everyone in town is awed by the celebrities. William Kristol, who is Vice President Dan Quayle's chief of staff, said the Hollywood influx only made Mr. Quayle's campaign comments about the cultural elite even more relevant.
"Having watched Hollywood descend upon Washington in the last couple of days makes me more convinced than ever that the Vice President was right," he said. "Hollywood's utter preoccupation with image, and their disdain for real problems and real issues, is amazing even to those of us who have been around Washington for a while -- and Washington, in itself, is not exactly focused on reality."
What lends some irony to the influx of movie stars and executives, who have crammed into the Mayflower, Four Seasons and Ritz-Carlton Hotels, is that Hollywood is not really too fond of making Washington-based political movies. The current Eddie Murphy comedy, "The Distinguished Gentleman," about a con-man who becomes a Congressman, has proved disappointing at the box office, despite generally good reviews.
Such political films as "The Candidate" (1972), starring Robert Redford, and "Power" (1986), starring Richard Gere, were also financial disappointments. "All the President's Men" (1976) proved highly successful, but the film, although set in Washington, was made as a virtual whodunit about the Watergate scandal.
 
The Rites and Rituals
 Despite their aloofness about making political movies, the Hollywood crowd is plainly entranced by Washington -- and its peculiar rites and rituals. And the Washington crowd of politicians, lobbyists and journalists, who often disdain Hollywood, appear to be just a little too eager to show how important they are, both to the movie crowd and in general.
Snapshots abound of Hollywood meeting Washington. One minute, it's Barbra Streisand and Donna Mills at a Democratic Party luncheon listening intently to some Very Serious journalists talk about how the press covers the Presidency. Another moment it's a private party at a fancy Georgetown home where politicians and reporters talk about economic and social policy with Ted Danson, Harry Belafonte, Kim Basinger and other performers. Still another moment it's Geena Davis eating a salad in a Capitol Hill dining room with Congressional aides.
The odd inaugural mix of show business and politics, of entertainment and somber issues, was summed up by Judith A. McGrath, executive vice president and creative director of the MTV network. Ms. McGrath was busy juggling phone calls about the hottest ticket in town, the MTV ball on Wednesday night with numerous rock stars such as Don Henley, 10,000 Maniacs and En Vogue.
"Everybody from Nelson Mandela to Doctor Ruth wants a ticket," she exclaimed. Ms. McGrath added: "They'll get it. Rock-and-roll has nothing to do with age. It's an attitude."
Perhaps the attitude of performer toward Washington was summed up by Lauren Bacall, a longtime Democrat, who said she has been entranced for years by the city. Ms. Bacall, who is staying at the home of Ben Bradlee, the former Washington Post executive editor and a top Washington insider, said:
"It's a dramatic city, a stimulating city, it feeds the senses. There is this mutual attraction between Washington and the entertainment world. We're doing what they can't do -- we can sing and dance and act. They're doing what we can't do -- they have access to power, real power. They're dealing in real things. I guess we all have fantasies about the other."

HEADLINE: An Invisible Legacy

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Nelson A. Rockefeller spread miles of asphalt, built modern campuses and raised skyscrapers for state workers. Hugh L. Carey saved New York City from bankruptcy. Now Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, less than 22 months from the 1994 gubernatorial election, is hoping to construct a different kind of legacy, an invisible legacy built by balancing budgets and improving fiscal practices during a relentless recession.
In proposing his 1993-94 budget today, Mr. Cuomo declared his first significant victory in the form of a $184 million surplus in the 1992-93 budget. He urged the Legislature not to interpret the surplus as a harbinger of recovery, noting that it resulted largely from decisions by New York investors to take capital gains in December rather than risking higher Federal tax rates under President-elect Bill Clinton. 
 But given that the state had to borrow a total of $1.8 billion in the last four years simply to balance its budget, surpluses in Albany are greeted like the arrival of spring. And even in the judgment of some of Mr. Cuomo's most consistent critics, the 1993-94 budget he proposed today would continue his self-declared mission of holding the line on broad-based taxes, reducing the state's reliance on fiscal gimmicks and taking a balanced approach to restraining state spending.
 
A Convert's Zeal
 Mr. Cuomo embraces that approach with a convert's zeal. Over the last few years, he has received a significant share of the blame for fiscal practices that have become a national embarrassment.
The Governor and the Legislature have not passed a budget by the start of the fiscal year since 1984, although they were only a day late last year. They have built up taxpayer-supported debt of $24.3 billion. In both 1991 and 1992, Wall Street bond raters lowered the state's credit rating so that it is now the second lowest in the country, surpassed only by Louisiana's.
Whether Mr. Cuomo is succeeding in reversing that course remains in dispute. And whether he succeeds in political terms may not be known until Nov. 8, 1994 --
 Election Day if he choses to run for a fourth four-year term. Mr. Cuomo made clear today that if he runs for a fourth four-year term, he will stake his political future on his fiscal record. And in defending this year's proposal, he often sounded as much like a candidate as a governor.
"Because of changes we were forced to make and wise investments we were able to continue, we have come out of the decade stronger in some ways than we were," Mr. Cuomo said. "We reduced our broad-based tax rates while other states raised theirs. We began serious reform of our fiscal practices. This year we will finish with a surplus. We preserved our extensive education and social-service systems even while keeping our growth in spending beneath the national average."
"This," he added, "has been a tough trek for a while and we're not out of the woods yet. But from here I can see glimpses of the fertile land lying just ahead if only we can keep going."
Some of Mr. Cuomo's boasting is little more than playing with numbers. By selecting the state's general fund as his gauge, long the state's mechanism for budgeting, he could maintain that spending would grow by only 1.6 percent. Using a measure preferred by many political scientists -- known as state funds, which includes some spending outside the general fund -- the number is 5.2 percent.
Mr. Cuomo also contended that his budget includes only $233 million in nonrecurring revenues, a significant decrease from the level of the last two years. But he pointedly excluded from his calculation the $516 million that he wants to seize from a dedicated transportation projects.
Governing, of course, consists of more than just proposing. The harder part is enacting, particularly in a state where one house of the Legislature is controlled by Democrats and one by Republicans.
 
Wrestling Concessions
 Ultimately Mr. Cuomo's success may be judged by his ability to wrestle concessions from the Legislature in areas where he has never succeeded before.
Today, he proposed a major revision of the state's formula for distributing aid to schools and he outlined a new plan to rein in the state's borrowing practices. He also reissued old proposals to repeal the state law mandating jail time for second-time drug offenders and to have the state assume local Medicaid costs in exchange for local tax revenues.
Together, those plans could save the state large sums of money and bring new equity to the way state aid is distributed to local governments. But they are also politically unpopular in the Republican-led Senate. And Mr. Cuomo, who governs largely by news conference, has never excelled at the arm-twisting and horse-trading needed to push such initiatives through the Legislature.
When asked today why he believed he might persuade the Republicans to change the school aid formula this year when similar efforts failed in the past, Mr. Cuomo responded almost self-mockingly.
"What makes me think I'll get it?" he asked. "Because I have confidence in the truth emerging eventually."
Even without such changes, Mr. Cuomo could feasibly succeed in producing another balanced budget this year. But he is not likely to achieve the larger goal of restoring the state to permanent financial health, as illustrated by the $3.7 billion shortfall in next year's budget, the fifth shortfall in five years.
"As a fiscal manager, the Governor's certainly doing better in recent times than he did previously," said Cynthia Green, an analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a private watchdog organization. "But if the goal is structural balance, then he's not close."

HEADLINE: Outer Banks Journal;
Is the Human Tide More of a Peril Than the Sea?

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALVO, N.C.

 BODY:
The news is not so good these days from the Outer Banks unless you happen to be standing in bundled solitude on a high dune, waist deep in waving sea oats, watching the winter wind whip the gray Atlantic.
The problem is the isolation. It is disappearing. 
 So many people have discovered the Outer Banks, a finger of sand 25 miles out to sea, that in places the 120-mile-long strand now resembles Anytown, U.S.A., replete with stoplights, junk food strips, golf courses, zoning disputes and mall shoppers in the shadow of the monument to the Wright brothers' first flight.
This loss of isolation is true even in the dead of winter. No longer after Labor Day do all the sun lovers abandon the beach cottages and hotels of Nags Head and Salvo and Hatteras and gloriously distant Ocracoke down at the end of the line. Now the Outer Banks is a year-round place for thousands of retired refugees from New York and Washington and Richmond and Atlanta.
They came here seeking isolation.
"It's still better out here than just about any other place I can think of, but it's changing, changing fast, and not always for the better," says 63-year-old Gaskill Austin.
A native son of the surf-side village of Salvo, where Gaskills and Austins have taken a living from the sea for more than two centuries, he fled the Banks' splendid isolation when he was young and filled with dreams. But after a 20-year hitch as a police officer in Suffolk County, L.I., the dreams were fulfilled and he fled home in search of the simple solitude he knew as a boy.
"It's all relative," he says, "but life has begun to get a little crowded out here."
There are 17,000 permanent residents on the Outer Banks now, three times as many as there were 15 winters back, with about a hundred living in Salvo. And if the weather is anywhere close to mild this weekend, there may be 40,000 people out here, perhaps 200 of them in Salvo, all trying to get away from it all.
In fairness, they'll have a better chance of pulling that off on the Outer Banks than just about any other place on the East Coast.
The National Park Service owns more than half of the strand, and there are places still where in January you can walk the beach in Robinson Crusoe solitude for an hour, maybe even two hours, before having to deal with another human. But in the end, you'll have to leave the beach to the winter gulls and go back and face the junk food and the mall shoppers and the construction crews putting up new $350,000 cottages -- more tasteful cottages than are going up on most Atlantic beaches, but nevertheless more cottages.
All this growth is causing the usual problems with water and sewage and zoning and policing. Just before Christmas, an arsonist and burned up the Fishin' Hole tackle shop in Salvo and the 20-box post office, one of the tiniest in the country.
In summer, when more than two million people crowd onto the Banks from June to September, creating a $100 million economy, there are frustrating traffic jams on the long bridges that connect the strand to the mainland, and on some beaches fistfights break out when too many swimmers and sport fishermen and surfers and commercial netters come together in a critical mass.
The residents of Ocracoke say their mother county, Hyde, does not give them the services they deserve for the taxes they pay. They're threatening to secede and join up with Dare County, to the north.
"Our problems are not so serious that they're out of control yet," says Marc Basnight, who represents the Banks in the State Senate. "But we've got to guide change more carefully -- change is inevitable -- or we're going to get overwhelmed."
Just about the only thing that isn't changing is the sea.
It continues to roll in, snatching at cottages and roads and anything else built foolishly close to its edge. The ancient Cape Hatteras lighthouse, with its familiar candy-striped shaft, is the latest big target.
There is endless talk of throwing up jetties and pushing around sand to save threatened structures and maintain beaches, harbors, bridges and ship channels. But first, developers and environmentalists must work out some compromises.
And even then, man may lose.
"Life on the Outer Banks is a constant struggle with the sea," says Whit Patterson, a local construction superintendent who is trying to shore up the spindly foundations of a cottage that is tumbling into the ocean.
As he speaks, a wintry east wind is rising and the sea is licking in to challenge the new pilings. It is an angry sea, frothing, and it seems bent on returning the Outer Banks to isolation.

HEADLINE: Georgia Architecture College Survives 2 Inquiries

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 19

 BODY:
A Georgia art and architecture college that was the scene of student and faculty unrest last year has withstood two inquiries into the status of its accreditation.
The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, which accredits colleges in the South, and the National Architectural Accrediting Board, which accredits the nation's schools of architecture, have both decided to continue the accreditation of the Savannah College of Art and Design. 
 The architecture group had put the school on probation and the association had scheduled an investigation after a tumultuous year, one that saw faculty turnover of almost 25 percent, student protests and a bomb blast that led to the cancellation of graduation exercises. The probationary status was removed in December, and the association ended its investigation without taking action to change the school's accreditation.
The American Association of University Professors, which has no formal supervisory role over the Savannah college, is also completing an investigation of the school.
 
School Revitalizes Downtown
 Since its opening in 1979, the school has grown to become one of the nation's largest art colleges. The school says it now has 2,500 students. Its rapid growth has helped revitalize downtown Savannah and led to the restoration of much of the city's historic downtown.
But the school has been the subject of frequent turmoil. In October, four of its former trustees called for the school's president and provost, Richard and Paula Rowan respectively, to step down until an independent fact-finding team could be put together to evaluate financial and academic conditions at the school. Critics had said that faculty members were dismissed arbitrarily and that the school was unduly controlled by a single family.
Beth Eckerd, a school spokeswoman, called the accreditation decisions an important vote of confidence. "We were totally exonerated," she said.
But she declined to release the letter that the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools sent the school announcing its findings. Association officials declined to comment, citing litigation in which the college had challenged various aspects of the inspection.
Critics of the school said the fact that accrediting bodies had not taken the rare step of imposing sanctions was hardly a clean bill of health.
"SCAD has made a mockery of all the tenets of higher education," said the author Joyce Maynard, a former trustee.
But teachers loyal to the school said last year's problems reflected growing pains rather than fundamental problems. "I've found SCAD to be a really supportive and sound instructional environment," said Prof. Lloyd B. Lewis, who teaches American studies at the college. "It's really a good place for a classroom teacher who wants to devote himself to undergraduate education."
And Ms. Eckerd said that despite the turmoil in 1992, applications and enrollment were up. "It didn't do any damage at all," she said, "There are more people than ever who are interested in coming to the college."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Surge on Hopes For an Untested President

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Bond prices were propelled higher yesterday, the day before the inauguration of Bill Clinton as President, on rising confidence in the chances for deficit reduction and visions of nothing more than moderate economic growth.
But the mood in the market remains volatile, which means that if the confidence of investors and traders is not rewarded, the gains of yesterday and the last week could be lost just as quickly. But if long-term bond rates remain this low or move lower, the economy could get a lift, bringing another rush of homeowners refinancing their mortgages. 
 The price of the 30-year bond jumped more than half a point, or 18/32 , yesterday, as the yield fell to 7.30 percent, the lowest of the year and just nine basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the 7.21 percent, six-year low reached in early September. The yield has come down from 7.47 in just a week as the positive themes of deficit reduction and slower growth have taken hold in the market.
The prices of Treasury notes were down or little changed and the discount rates on Treasury bills rose as the recent rally in shorter-term Treasury securities fell prey to profit taking and declining hope for another easing of credit by the Federal Reserve, traders said. The prices of Treasury notes with maturities from two years to seven years were down. The price of the 10-year note was up just 3/32 .
"The confidence level in the long end is much higher than it was a week ago because the deficit has been stressed by everyone," said Dan Callahan, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, referring to top economic appointees in the Clinton Administration.
Shorter-term maturities, Mr. Callahan said, had hit their highs after a rally last week, helped in part by new speculation that the Fed could cut short-term interest rates again if the ecnomy does slow. But Mr. Callahan does not expect such a Fed move, which he said meant that it was a good time to sell and collect profits.
 
Growth Rate Seen to Lag
 One of the other reasons for the strength in the long end is that forecasters are saying that the 3 percent growth rate of the economy in the last half of 1992 cannot continue in the first half of this year. They note that job growth is too slow, major companies are still laying off workers, companies and consumers are still burdened by debt and consumers have already depleted their savings to fuel growth during the last six months.
In a forecast outlined yesterday, Robert A. Brusca, the chief economist at Nikko Securities, said he expected the economy, as measured by the gross domestic product, to slow to a annual growth rate of 1 percent in the first quarter and nine-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. This slowdown, he said, would bring the yield on the 30-year bond down to 7 percent in the spring.
But Mr. Brusca saw yields rising by the end of the year because, he said, the economy would begin to grow faster in response to the stimulus program of tax cuts and spending increases that President-elect Clinton is expected to propose. By the end of 1993, Mr. Brusca forecasts a 30-year bond yield of 7.75 percent, above the 7.39 percent at the end of 1992.
 
U-Shaped Forecast
 This is the U-shaped forecast of rates, with yields falling in the beginning of the year but rising later. The opposite forecast is the arch, with rates rising now and falling later, being pulled down in part by continued low inflation. But, as in the U forecast, they end up little changed.
One scenario that could invert Mr. Brusca's U plays out this way: The slowing of the economy in the first two quarters of the year, which could be signaled by unemployment data as early as February, could spur a move by the Administration and Congress to approve more fiscal stimuli.
Since the election, the bond market has responded positively to rising economic growth, although traders would normally respond negatively. The positive reaction, traders said, came as they concluded that more growth meant that Mr. Clinton would propose a smaller fiscal stimulus package. And that meant there would be less of a chance of overstimulating the economy and pushing inflation higher.
 
A 'Perverse' Reaction
 Mr. Brusca called this market behavior "perverse," but the opposite could happen now. Slower growth might become a threat to the bond market because it would result in more fiscal stimuli.
In addition, Mr. Brusca said he did not have much confidence yet in the new Administration's ability to reduce the record Federal budget deficit. He said there was little reason for any confidence after Mr. Clinton dumped his campaign promise to cut the White House staff by 25 percent.
 
Corporate Bonds
 Heavy sales continued in the corporate bond market as companies sought to take advantage of low interest rates. About $2.4 billion of new bonds were sold yesterday in what may become a record month of issuance.
Time Warner Inc., which sold $1 billion of 20-year bonds earlier this month, sold another $1 billion yesterday. The $500 million of five year bonds were priced to yield 7.45 percent, 163 basis points higher than the yield on the comparable Treasury note. The $500 million of seven-year bonds were priced to yield 7.95 percent, 170 basis points above the yield on the comparable Treasury note.
 
New York in Japan
 Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman of New York City, who has just returned from a trip to Japan, said yesterday that the Japanese were very receptive to the city's plan to sell $100 million to $150 million in city bonds denominated in yen. The conditions were good for a sale now, she said, and if they are similar at the end of February or early March, the city would make the sale.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Hartford Gives Money to Help Convert Boat Company

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 19

 BODY:
The State of Connecticut today gave $1 million in taxpayer money to the giant Electric Boat submarine shipyard in Groton to help the company develop nonmilitary products.
The grant was among the largest given by the state in its yearlong effort to help companies dependent on the military adjust to the drop in military expenditures in the post-cold war economy. 
 In contrast to other grants and loans issued to military companies, the award, announced at the division's headquarters in Groton, had few strings attached as to how the money would be spent, and no possibility of a payback to the state if a blockbuster commercial product emerged as a result.
"The million is a grant to explore potential products," said Joseph Cohen, a spokesman for the State Department of Economic Development.
 
Keeping Up With Neighbors
 Industry analysts said the grant also underlined the degree to which states like Connecticut are being forced to keep up with their neighbors to stay in the good graces of companies like Electric Boat, one of Connecticut's largest employers, with 13,200 workers in southeastern Connecticut.
Rhode Island, where Electric Boat also has extensive operations, gave the company $1 million in October to help it develop new commercial lines, and Connecticut officials have been under pressure since then to do the same.
"They're both trying to send a message that they've changed their stripes and they now care about businesses," said Mark A. Bobbi, a senior aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International, a private research and consulting concern that follows the military industry.
And while Mr. Bobbi conceded that good relations with companies could ultimately help retain and even expand jobs in the state, he said that the short-term benefit of the grant was questionable.
 
Four Areas Identified
 "They're giving money for something that the company would do anyway," he said.
State officials and executives at Electric Boat, a division of the General Dynamics Corporation, said the $1 million was to be matched by $1 million from the company. They said the money would be spent exploring commercial products that require similar technologies and skills to the ones used in submarine production.
Specifically they identified four areas -- marine power, marine transportation, industrial fabrication and emerging technologies, which Mr. Cohen described as anything not covered under the first three categories.
The state also held out the offer of additional matching funds, totaling up to $3 million through 1995. But that money would conform more to the pattern established in other deals with military companies -- giving the state a payback if the products succeed in the marketplace.
 
Links to Other Products
 The Connecticut legislature established a $22.5 million fund last year to help companies like Electric Boat diversify and to keep jobs in the state, but there were few guidelines as to how awards should be distributed.
Of the major grants or investments made using the fund, all except Electric Boat's were directly linked to a specific product that was already in development or production. Textron Lycoming, the Stratford-based tank engine maker, received $3 million, for example, to help it pursue markets for its engines in commercial aviation. Pratt & Whitney, the East Hartford-based jet engine maker, received $3 million to help it transform an existing aircraft engine into a turbine to generate electricity. The Kaman Corporation, a Bloomfield company, received $3 million to help market a finished product, the K-MAX heavy payload helicopter.
Electric Boat's president, Roger E. Tetrault, said in a statement that today's grant, beyond any specific results in marketing and engineering, would "send a strong signal to E.B. workers, the Southeastern Connecticut region and the Federal Government."
"This grant signifies the State of Connecticut's commitment to the company," he added.

HEADLINE: Donors Send Spare Change to Neediest

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
They are inescapable, jiggling and jangling and accumulating in unstable little piles that inevitably topple onto the floor and roll under the furniture. It has long been one of the more annoying problems in a commercial culture where the 99-cent suffix reigns: What is to be done with all the change?
Andrew D. Lenney of Manhattan believes he has found the answer. After years of emptying his pockets at the end of the day onto dressers and tables, he decided last year to take up a new habit. He now drops his spare change into a jar and every so often donates the collection to charity. The other day he sent $118 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 In a letter to the fund, Mr. Lenney wrote that he often felt frustrated when homeless people asked him for change. He said he wondered: "Who is this person? Will the money go into his belly? His lungs? His veins? And does it matter? A person who resorts to the human indignity of begging should not have to have a reason." He added that he was more comfortable making contributions to established charities that help the homeless.
 
Tripling Take From Streets
 Dr. Arline M. Rubin of Manhattan is another person who delights in searching for discarded money. "I am writing this," she said, "hoping that others will be inspired to start 1993 as I have during the last five years, picking up coins and bills that I find in the streets, subways, supermarkets and theaters in New York with the intent of donating what I find to the Neediest Cases fund."
Dr. Rubin said that because of an illness, her take for 1992 declined from previous years: 206 pennies, 3 nickels, 15 dimes, 3 quarters, 2 tokens and 2 dollar bills. She tripled that amount and sent a check for $26.88 to the fund.
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund uses contributions from people like Mr. Lenney and Dr. Rubin to help others who are struggling with homelessness, illnesses, hunger and emotional traumas. The fund aids seven charities that are facing tight budgets because of the recession and a decline in donations.
The New York Times pays the expenses for the Neediest Cases drive, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's appeal, the 81st, ends on Feb. 28.
Rhoda Selvin of Stony Brook, L.I., also collected money for the fund in an unorthodox way. A few months ago, she received a card that entitled her to reduced prices for the elderly at movies. But because she is still working, she says she does not need the discount. So she decided to donate her savings to the fund, sending that $27 plus an extra $250.
Like Mr. Lenney, Adam Schwartz of Manhattan painstakingly amassed his donation to the Neediest Cases, setting aside 25 cents at most meals. He sent $12.60. "I find giving to others takes me out of self-pity," he wrote, "and helps me to be grateful for all the abundance I have."

HEADLINE: C.D. Yields To Decline This Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit will be lower in the week beginning today.
In the New York market, banks posted lower yields on both money market accounts and C.D.'s, while outside the local area, the decline was evident primarily in certificates of deposit.
 
Auction as Portent
 At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, average discount rates slipped for the third consecutive week. Many traders and investors regard the Treasury's auction as a harbinger of deposit rate changes that banks put into effect in the weeks ahead. 
 The average rate at auction yesterday was 3.03 percent for a three-month Treasury bill, down 4 basis points, and 3.13 percent for a six-month bill, down 6 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth percentage point.
According to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor, New York area money market account yields are down 2 basis points, to an average 2.7 percent. The slide in money market account yields is now a month and a half long.
The average New York yield for a three-month certificate dropped 3 basis points, to 2.79 percent, while the average yield on a six-month was unchanged at 2.98 percent.
For the most part, commercial banks cut three-month C.D.'s the most, paring the average yield 3 basis points, to 2.71 percent. Savings banks cut money market accounts the most, 3 basis points, to 2.85 percent.
New York banks posting the sharpest changes in the week included First Nationwide, which dropped 17 basis points from its money market account, to 2.43 percent, and Midlantic Banks in New Jersey, cutting 20 basis points from its three-month C.D., to 2.75 percent. Bank of Tokyo in New York cut the yield on its six-month C.D. to 2.44 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks remained fairly steady, with the average money market account unchanged at 2.68 percent and a six-month C.D. off a basis point, to 3.01 percent.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, noted that interest rates were tied to the economy and that traders and investors were uncertain about how strong the recovery would be.
"With that in mind, you have banks holding savings rates close to the vest," Mr. Heady said. "The conditions currently keeping deposit rates down include weak loan demand, which continues to stunt a recovery; a surplus of cash on hand at banks, which eliminates any urgency to bring in new cash, and a spread between loan interest rates and deposit rates, which many banks show no interest in adjusting.

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo.

 BODY:
MARION MERRELL DOW INC. is moving forward with a $276 million project for its new headquarters here that is expected to transform the deteriorating section of southern Kansas City. The giant pharmaceutical company plans to consolidate its offices and expand its laboratories on a 325-acre site.
Marion already owns about 160 acres there, which it purchased in the 1960's. The company built five buildings there, the first in 1965. It will spend $15 million to $20 million to buy 160 more acres. 
 The company now leases more than 600,000 square feet in several buildings throughout the Kansas City metropolitan area, said Jon R. Plaas, Marion's vice president for global facilities engineering.
"The underlying reason for the project is that Marion expanded so rapidly in the 1980's that we couldn't keep up with our needs," he said. "We're living in some temporary quarters and we're interested in consolidating and increasing research facilities."
Marion now has about 2,400 employees in Kansas City and 9,700 worldwide. Its sales grew from $102 million in 1980 to almost $1 billion in 1989, before Marion Laboratories Inc. merged with Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. Sales in 1992 were more than $3 billion, said Richard M. Johnson, a company spokesman.
Marion hired the Hillier Group, of Princeton, N.J., to design the master plan for its project. The plan calls for the construction of one million square feet of office space, 200,000 square feet of laboratory space and 274,000 square feet of office and warehouse space, some of which will be available to other companies.
Mr. Plaas, Marion's project manager, said the plan would enable Marion to consolidate its operations and possibly decrease product development time. The company also wants to build a "world class science and technology campus" to attract top scientists, he said.
The master plan is expected to be completed this spring, and the first phase begun in late fall or early winter. The headquarters, now in leased space, are scheduled to move in the mid-1990's. The final construction phase of the project will begin in about 2005.
The land surrounding the project has a hodgepodge of service companies, motels, bars and a few homes.
In December, the Kansas City Council approved a 50 percent tax abatement for the project through a tax increment financing plan. Under that plan, Marion uses some of the new taxes created by the project to pay for its improvements.
"The taxes basically go to improve the site instead of into the city's general fund," said Laura Whitener, a senior planner for the Kansas City Economic Development Corporation, which oversees tax increment financing plans. "I do believe the project will help reactivate the area," she said. "This is one of the largest projects in Kansas City."
Many officials hope the project will turn around the southern Kansas City area in the same way that Hallmark Card Inc.'s Crown Center changed downtown with its new offices, hotels and apartments.
Mark M. Bunnell, vice president of the Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City, said the Marion project was significant to the entire Kansas City metropolitan area. "We had a major corporation that was a tenant here," he said. "It just leased space."
After the merger, Marion could have decided to relocate, but now it is making a permanent commitment to stay in Kansas City.
In the first half of last year, less than 100,000 square feet of new office property was built in the metropolitan area, said G. Reid Teaney, senior vice president of CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc. The vacancy rate for the entire metropolitan area is 16 percent, he said. Downtown, it is 24.6 percent, he said, much of it in a single building, A.T.& T. Town Pavilion, a new building partly occupied by A.T.& T.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
When President Clinton is toasted today in Washington at the luncheon of the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, it will be with sparkling wine from Korbel Champagne Cellars of Sonoma County, Calif. The table wines at the lunch will be from another California winery, Jekel Vineyards, in Monterey County.
Korbel is marketed by the Brown-Forman Corporation in Louisville, Ky. Jekel is owned by Brown-Forman. And who is chairman of the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee? Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky. 
 Wine has been part of Washington festivities since the first President took office, but with the exception of Thomas Jefferson, few chief executives have indicated any particular enthusiasm for it. Jefferson's fascination with wine, including his efforts to grow wine grapes in Virginia, have been well documented.
During his tenure as Ambassador to France, from 1785-90, he took great care to develop a good cellar, and when his diplomatic posting ended, he arranged to have wine shipped back to the United States, both for himself and for his boss, George Washington. Once in the White House, Jefferson left the ordering of whisky, beer and cider to the staff but attended to wine purchases himself, occasionally consulting with his French major-domo, Joseph Rapin.
When he move to the White House, in the spring of 1801, Jefferson brought Rapin with him. But Rapin only came to fill in until someone else could be found. Later that year, Jefferson engaged Etienne Lemaire who was to run his household through two administrations.
Lemaire barely spoke English; he kept all his accounts in French, and when it came time to write his memoirs of his White House years, he wrote them in French, too. He was paid directly by Jefferson -- there was no budget for servants or, indeed, for any household expenses.
Lemaire notes that one of his most important duties was holding expenses down, including keeping an eye on wine consumption. Jefferson bought some bottled wine by the case, but more often it arrived in barrels. They were stored under lock and key, first in the White House basement and later in a wine cellar which Jefferson dug on the grounds.
The first Presidential wine cellar also served as an icehouse and was usually referred to by that more democratic name. A contemporary report described it as round, about 16 feet deep, lined with bricks and topped with a wooden shed.
Though he had a French major-domo and, for a time at least, a French chef, Honore Julien, Jefferson had no separate wine steward. Nor did he permit servants to remain in his dining room, except at major functions. In keeping with his egalitarian principles, guests served themselves at his table. Servants brought in the food and wine, placed them in covered dumbwaiters by the table, then left. Guests helped themselves and one another.
The most famous inaugural celebration in the early history of the White House was Andrew Jackson's, on March 4, 1829, when a horde of boisterous Jackson supporters descended on the mansion.
The impression that has come down through history is that the mob was unexpected. In fact, the White House staff had been preparing for a big crowd for days, working quietly, because John Quincy Adams and his family were staying in the house until the day before the inauguration.
The task fell to the Adamses' steward, Antoine Michel Giusta, another Frenchman. His work was complicated by the fact that Jackson, who was staying nearby at Gadsby's Hotel, refused to communicate with the outgoing President. Jackson believed that the bitter election campaign had contributed to his wife's death, and he blamed Adams.
Huge quantities of lemonade and orange punch, liberally laced with whisky, were prepared in advance and stored in the icehouse. After the swearing-in at the Capitol, Jackson rode his horse to the White House, followed by the crowd. The staff expected large numbers of people to pass through the house and stop briefly to shake hands with the President. But they didn't leave.
Seeing the President being crushed against a wall and gasping for air, several aides dragged him from the room and out of the building.
To draw the crowds -- described by one reporter as "a rabble, a mob, scrambling, fighting, romping" -- out of the house, Giusta had the servants drag washtubs of whisky punch out onto the White House lawn. At what time the punch ran out is not recorded.
Jackson has come to be associated with the raw-boned whisky-drinking men of the frontier. But he observed the amenities at the White House. When Giusta quit, in 1834, to open an oyster bar in Washington, he was replaced by Joseph Boulanger, a Belgian. Hired as a chef, he took over most of a steward's duties and brought back good cooking and wine.
By then, the wine cellar had been brought into the White House. It was just beneath the State Dining Room. According to one report, racks for bottles and barrels were built along the walls behind heavy wooden bars and there was room not only for wine but also for hard liquor and beer. An account of a small dinner for five in 1834 indicated that sherry, Madeira and Champagne were poured constantly thoughout the meal and for a considerable time thereafter.
James Polk's wife, Sarah, has often been accused of banning alcohol in the White House -- but she did not. A dour woman, she did ban dancing and most other forms of innocent enjoyment. But while she hated drinking, she did not forbid it, even though the temperance movement was strong in the 1840's.
She banned whisky but increased the use of table wine. As William Seale noted in his book "The President's House," (White House Historical Association), this was no economy measure. In the mid-19th century, whisky was an inexpensive commodity, much cheaper than wine.
 
 
 
TASTINGS
Chateau Pichon Baron, Pauillac, 1988; about $26.
 The story of the multimillion-dollar renovation of this famous but neglected old Bordeaux estate is one of the important wine stories of recent years. Less well known, perhaps, is the remarkable improvement in its wines. Jean-Michel Cazes, the owner of the Chateau Lynch-Bages nearby, directed the immense building project; he has also upgraded its wine production. This 1988 is from the old cellars and mostly from the old vines. But great care in wine making has produced an astonishingly good result. The material was there all along, just waiting for someone to work with it in the right way. This is a classic Pauillac. While it may lack some of the refinements of a Lafite, all the other qualities of the appellation -- subtlety, elegance, intensity -- are there. The unspoken rivalry with Pichon Lalande, the other Pichon, across the road, is fervid. Its wines through the 1980's gained immense respect. The competition should be fun to watch.

HEADLINE: Clinton Must Keep Health Care Promises

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The health care crisis has become one of the most critical issues facing the incoming Administration in Washington. It affects all Americans. But with President-elect Bill Clinton's health plan fast taking shape, there are many worrisome signs. 
 The private health insurers, the medical associations, hospitals, drug companies and the political right in both parties want to derail Mr. Clinton's sincere desire to come to grips with the health crisis. They are waging an offensive in the news media and in Congress over the nebulous phrase "managed competition," including, for example, taxation of employee health benefits. These special interests posing as "reformers" want to make such false "solutions" seem sensible and inevitable to Americans.
Organized labor supports the evolving Clinton plan. Millions of working people voted for Bill Clinton because he promised to deal with the health care crisis. They have confidence in him because he promised to put people first. But the plan must contain the following elements to be acceptable to working people: universal access to care; strong cost containment; preservation of health care benefits of the retired, and no taxation of employee health benefits.
Labor favors national health care reform that guarantees access for all Americans and requires all employers to contribute fairly to the cost of care. A Federal program should be established for those not in the work force, including the unemployed and workers on strike.
Global budgeting is a way to achieve real cost containment. Labor seeks a cap on the annual rate of increase in health care spending and a capital budgeting system to encourage efficient distribution of capital.
Labor insists on no takeaways of health care benefits of the retired. A health care reform plan worthy of the name must preserve their benefits.
And lastly, labor opposes any taxation of employee health care benefits. Workers have been giving up wage increases for years to hold health care benefits at some decent level. Studies have shown that taxing health care benefits will not yield anywhere near enough money to pay for extension of coverage to all, as its proponents claim. Reform must be progressively financed. If new revenue is needed, let corporations and the rich pay, not hard-pressed working people.

HEADLINE: A Splash of Vitriol in the Inaugural Champagne

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19

 BODY:
In a city where intrigue and gossip are the coin of the realm, the Presidential Inaugural Committee has been the juiciest target for weeks. Caterers and party planners, who never criticize clients, can't wait to tell their latest horror stories.
The Inaugural Committee has surrounded its calendar of events with the cloak of secrecy generally reserved for covert operations. A result is a cauldron of anger that reflects on the man who wanted his inauguration to be inclusive. 
 Deborah Allen, a saleswoman with Maynard & David, an up-and-coming caterer, embodies the anger.
"The people we have dealt with at the Inaugural Committee are incredibly stupid," she said. "They are 22-year-old brats. One even screamed at the Secret Service. They don't know how to treat people, how to negotiate. They are rude and as arrogant as hell. The meetings we have had have been grueling. They talk about food like it's a state secret, like we are bombing Kuwait."
"I don't remember this kind of attitude in the past," said Ms. Allen, who said she had helped cater three inaugurations. "I don't know anyone who does." Then came the clincher that might make Bill Clinton's image-polishers suicidal: "I'm sorry I voted for the guy."
But Richard Mintz, the director of communications for the Inaugural Committee, said: "I think the scale of this event leads to inevitable misunderstanding. We did the best we could, accommodating more people at more events, both free and ticketed, than ever before."
Even so, Ms. Allen's sentiments were echoed by Carol Bloom, an owner of Windows, another caterer. "It was supposed to be different," she said, "but it's politics as usual. I voted for Clinton. I wouldn't now."
Ms. Bloom asserted that another group, the Joint Congressional Inaugural Committee, which is putting on the lunch for the President after the swearing-in, had chosen her company for the job and then changed its mind. She said that after Windows was notified that it would cater the lunch, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union complained and the Congressional committee reconsidered and gave the job to B & B, a unionized caterer.
"My folks finally got in," she said, "and I got kicked. It's a matter of prestige, and we were awarded the bipartisan lunch. You feel you haven't been included as a small, woman-owned business." Ms. Bloom has threatened a suit. She said the Congressional Inaugural Committee told her that the deal could be canceled because no contract had been signed.
The Presidential Inaugural Committee has insisted on using unionized caterers wherever possible. In this town, that is difficult. B & B is the only one of any size, and it could not possibly cater all of the functions.
"I can't complain about the unions," said Bill Holman, a partner in the catering firm of Design Cuisine. "We have more business than the last inaugural. But we had the Governors' lunch, and that plum was picked by the union." Mr. Holman was referring to a lunch that Mr. Clinton held for other governors who held office while he was Governor of Arkansas.
To the Inaugural Committee, using union caterers makes sense: labor supported Mr. Clinton. "Bill Clinton believes that working people are entitled to participate in unions, where possible," Mr. Mintz said.
To most party planners and caterers it makes no sense, because, they say, the best caterers in town are not union.
The union, of course, differs. "I think it's great that the union shops are getting the work," said Jack Lavin, director of public relations for the union. He said that even if unionized concerns are more expensive, "you can't measure the cost factor in this kind of thing, because of the publicity the caterers get."
Union or not, many caterers and restaurants were disturbed by the Inaugural Committee's refusal to let them release menus of committee-sanctioned events. "Everything at the Presidential Inaugural Committee is secret," said Renee Subrin, public relations director of the Washington Hilton and the Capital Hilton. "It's like Watergate. In our contract with the Inaugural Committee, it says we are not to release any information."
One longtime events planner, Barbara Boggs, said the secrecy indicated that the Inaugural Committee was "paranoid about this business."
The committee closed to the press all events in honor of the biggest contributors to the Democratic Party. After this reporter attended one of them, at the Sequoia restaurant, as the guest of a guest, it seemed that the secrecy might have nothing to do with politics. Instead, it might arise from the crowded conditions, the eardrum-shattering music and the paltry offering of food, which might have come out of cans and boxes.
The guests would have eaten better at "America's Reunion on the Mall," a two-day festival of food, crafts and music open to the public. There, some of Washington's best restaurants joined the hot-dog vendors to provide tastings of their wonderful food: shrimp cakes with tomato chutney from Jean-Louis; fried calamari and ricotta gnocchi from Galileo; barbecue from Red Sage.
It's not simple pleasure that draws people to the enormous, invitation-only events, where more than 1,000 people are served, though the food at the dinner catered by Design Cuisine, including duck breast and stuffed pheasant, was splendid. Many guests said they found the events boring.
"No, it's not fun," said Natalie Lipman of New York City, who attended the Design Cuisine dinner. "But we wouldn't be anywhere else. Fun is for other occasions."
The places to have fun, see the most interesting people and eat the best food are the private parties given by corporations and individuals. The blowout late Sunday night for James Carville, the Clinton politicial strategist, will be hard to top. It had stars: Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger. It had Clinton campaign heavyweights like Mandy Grunwald, Paul Greenberg and Eli Segal. It had a good location: the Presidential Suite in Union Station. It had the right noise level: music that was loud, but still allowed conversation.
It had Nippy Carville, James Carville's mother, and pretty good food, including some of her recipes: chicken and sausage gumbo and beef and pork boulettes. And it had wretched excess: praline cheesecake topped with bananas Foster.
Mr. Carville, who cooks Cajun and Italian food, was comparing cooking with political campaigns, saying some steps were more important than others, and that not everything was equal.
"Sometime, I want to write a cookbook and tell people which the critical points are in cooking," he said. "There are two or three critical points. Politics is the same. People don't understand that."
The best place to see the fireworks on Sunday night was the General Motors-United Auto Workers party held for politicians, Congressional staff members, lobbyists and G.M. and union officials. Carolyn Peachey, an events planner, had only a week to organize it. The Kennedy Center's Roof Terrace Restaurant was available and provided copious quantities of some fairly good food along with a spectacular view of the fireworks.
Debbie Dingell, a G.M. lobbyist, was not in favor of having a party during inaugural week. "I advised against it, given G.M.'s economic situation," she said. "But the union wanted to do it to show support of Clinton."
The gossip at such parties revolved around the new Administration, including its Inaugural Committee.
"There are a lot of disgruntled people because of the Inaugural Committee," said Julian Epstein, staff director of the House Government Operations Committee. Speaking of Emanuel Rahm, a co-executive director of the Inaugural Committee, Mr. Epstein said: "Rahm shoots from the hip. He's a space cadet. He's never done anything like this, and he doesn't know what he's doing."
Mr. Mintz of the Inaugural Committee responded: "Everyone from the President-elect to the volunteer from Indiana felt that under Rahm's direction, this inauguration has operated absolutely flawlessly."
Even so, the disgruntled include not only the caterers and events planners, but also hundreds of people who bought and paid for tickets to inaugural events and came to town with canceled checks only to find that there were no tickets.
"The ticket business had to do with the issuance of 175,000 tickets in a short period of time," Mr. Mintz said. "Inevitably, some people are going to be unhappy."
While large, wealthy corporations often use inaugurations to entertain politicians who are important to them, there was an unusual mix of rich and poor this time: the Natural Gas Supply Association invited the National Association of Neighborhoods, made up primarily of organizations of poor tenants, to join in putting on a brunch at the Woodrow Wilson House on Sunday.
"This party is very beneficial to us," said Deborah Crain, the neighborhood association's acting director. "Quite a few Congressmen and Senators and people from the transition came. We are taking the grass roots from the streets to the suites."
For good food, the Decatur House took the prize on Sunday afternoon at a party given by Workman, the publisher of "Dairy Hollow House Soup and Bread: A Country Inn Cookbook" by Crescent Dragonwagon, an Arkansas acquaintance of the Clintons. Ms. Dragonwagon and her husband run the Dairy Hollow House, an inn in Eureka Springs.
Her party attracted real F.O.B.'s -- Friends of Bill -- including Frances and Wayne Cranford of Little Rock and Morris and Ann Henry of Fayetteville, who gave the reception for the Clintons when they were married. "When Hillary came to town," Mrs. Henry said, "the charge from Bill was that we professional people had to make it nice for Hillary or 'She won't marry me.' "
Every Democratic Party gathering has at least one nostalgia event. This week it was a party for Joseph Duffey, who ran for Senate from Connecticut in 1970. Mr. Duffey, who is the president of American University, and his wife, Anne Wexler, the chairwoman of the Wexler Group, a lobbying concern, invited guests to celebrate the inauguration of Mr. Clinton, "the first Duffey campaign worker to be elected President of the United States."
"I've lost seven times at the Presidential level," said Eli Segal, who met Mr. Clinton in the Duffey campaign, went on to become chief of staff for the Clinton campaign and has been appointed Presidential Assistant for National Service. "All I ever got out of this until Bill Clinton made it was warm friendships. This is a little overwhelming."
Even Mr. Clinton must find it overwhelming. He is about to become President of the most powerful nation in the world. He doesn't need to be kept waiting by a 22-year-old Inaugural Committee worker, as he was at the Faces of Hope lunch on Monday.
As the caterer, Gary David, of Maynard & David, recounted the incident, the Clintons arrived early for the lunch, which honored "ordinary Americans" they had met on the campaign. They waited in a room for 10 minutes at the Folger Shakespeare Library, because the worker, an events coordinator, insisted that the guests be seated before Mr. Clinton went in.
"The President-elect was fuming," Mr. David said. "She wanted to have everyone quiet, but he wanted to be in there. She thinks she knows everything and she doesn't know anything."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
A Surge in Earnings Helps Large Banks Breathe a Bit Easier

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Five of the nation's 10 largest banks, including several New York institutions, reported higher-than-expected earnings yesterday, leading banking specialists to say that the end is in sight for the industry's troubles with real estate loans.
 The billions of dollars of loans, mostly made in the late 1980's for office buildings and other projects in big cities, had seemed so shaky just two years ago that Government officials, bank executives and industry analysts issued dire warnings. They said the banking industry might be in danger of a rash of failures similar to those that had plagued savings and loans, forcing a costly Federal bailout. 
Raphael Soifer, a banking analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, said the banking industry had grown healthier in the fourth quarter of 1992. "It's a direct function of the improving economy," he said.
 The earnings reports released yesterday -- for Citicorp, Chemical Banking, Chase Manhattan, Banc One and Wells Fargo & Company -- were significant because they showed that the banks were reducing their troubled real estate loans faster than analysts had expected.
 Particularly surprising was the announcement by Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, which said its provision for bad loans was $300 million, down sharply from $700 million a year earlier. Wells is a leading real estate lender in California, a state troubled for more than a year by a deeply depressed real estate market, particularly in the south.
 Wells Fargo earned $58 million, compared with a loss of $231 million a year earlier. Investors responded to the news by rushing to buy Wells Fargo stock, driving the price up $13 a share, or 15 percent, to $99 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Fewer shaky loans mean that banks need to put less money into their reserves to cover potential losses on bad loans in the future. The less money that banks add to reserves, the more they earn.
 Describing the quality of the loans the banks now carry, John D. Leonard, an analyst for Salomon Brothers, said the situation had been "improving steadily since the early part of last year, but the magnitude of the improvement now surprised us."
 Also contributing to improved earnings in recent months has been the low interest rates that banks now pay on deposits and other sources of money, while still charging considerably higher interest rates for loans. In addition, many banks have significantly cut costs by merging with other banks, closing branches and laying off employees. Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover merged in 1991. Citicorp said it had cut costs $1.3 billion and reduced its staff by 14,000 people in the last two years.
 Citicorp said its earnings in the fourth quarter were $280 million, compared with a loss of $133 million in the quarter a year ago. Illustrating the trend at all of the banks, Citicorp said its total portfolio of distressed real estate and commercial loans fell to $7.58 billion from $7.91 billion a year earlier and from $8.13 billion at the end of the third quarter.
 The decline in Citicorp's bad loans was "a much larger drop than anyone had thought," said Thomas H. Hanley, a banking analyst for the First Boston Corporation.
 Citicorp set aside $294 million for potential losses on its North American real estate portfolio, down from $562 million a year earlier.
 Citicorp's profits from its global consumer business rose 72 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while earnings from its global finance business tripled.
 Chemical said its earnings in the fourth quarter totaled $304 million, compared with a loss of $420 million a year earlier. The 1991 loss resulted from a restructuring charge of $625 million when it merged with Manufacturers Hanover. Chase's earnings increased 25 percent, to $169 million, from $135 million a year earlier.
 Banc One, based in Columbus, Ohio, said its fourth-quarter earnings increased 28 percent, to $193 million, from $151 million a year earlier. The bank said its troubled loans were also down, to $629 million, from $770 million a year earlier.
 But the fact that Citicorp, like the other banks, must still put aside hundreds of millions of dollars for expected problems suggests that banks will continue to cope with troubled real estate loans for years to come.
 "Real estate would be scary if the economy ticks down again," Mr. Soifer said. Despite the positive Wells Fargo earnings report, he said, "California hasn't bottomed out, but we can see the bottom now."
 At the end of the year, Wells Fargo had $2.1 billion in troubled loans, 5.8 percent of all loans. That is up from $2.0 billion at the end of 1991, but down from $2.4 billion at the end of the 1992 third quarter. Analysts had expected bad loans to increase sharply in this quarter.
 
Last of Many Crises
 Troubled real estate loans represent the last in a series of difficulties that banks experienced in the 1980's and beginning of the 90's, problems that arose even as they searched for new sources of earnings after their traditional customers left them to raise capital through Wall Street. These problems included defaults or late payments on loans by third-world countries, energy companies, and real estate developers' building housing, hotels, office buildings and shopping centers, as well as those to finance leveraged buyouts of companies.
 As these ventures turned sour, the banks, under pressure from regulators, shifted from such adventurous lending and put their money into Government bonds. Their earnings from the bonds rose as the Federal Reserve, trying to stimulate the economy, drove down interest rates in the last two years, driving up bond prices. As a result, the rates on bank deposits fell more than Government bond rates did, providing a larger spread between the banks' cost of money and the rate of return they received on the Government bonds. These growing earnings provided much of the money the banks needed to survive and to build up their cushions of capital.
 Now, analysts say, the banks' portfolios are in better shape and the industry's worst problems appear to be behind.
 "I don't think there are too many banana peels for the industry in the near term," Mr. Leonard said.

HEADLINE: Steep Tariffs on Steel Expected Next Week

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
The Commerce Department is likely to impose broad steel-import tariffs averaging up to 25 percent next Wednesday, American steel industry officials and trade experts said today. The move would follow action by the department late Tuesday imposing tariffs up to 167 percent on a narrow category of imported steel products.
A dozen American steelmakers are seeking steep tariffs on $2.5 billion worth of annual steel imports from 19 countries. They contend that foreign rivals are violating American antidumping law by routinely charging less for steel in the United States than in their home markets. The latest dispute involves flat-rolled steel used in auto-body panels and plate steel used in construction. 
 Federal law requires the Commerce Department to reach a preliminary decision by midnight Tuesday, setting temporary taxes that may be paid in cash or by posting a substantial bond until a final decision is reached this spring. The Clinton Administration could then raise, lower or cancel the tariffs, confirm them or replace them with annual tonnage limits on imports.
Commerce Secretary-designate Ronald H. Brown will technically have the ability to force a change in the tariff-calculation process, producing different figures next week. But Washington trade experts said this was unlikely because Mr. Brown had not yet named subordinates with the detailed knowledge of steel issues necessary to make such changes.
West European, East Asian and Latin American nations have protested the Commerce Department's investigation of their steel pricing and subsidy policies, and are expected to complain vigorously if the new tariffs are imposed.
 
Europeans' Response
 When the department imposed anti-subsidy tariffs averaging 12.5 percent on steel from a dozen countries on Nov. 30, the European Community accused the American industry of harassment, "unduly blaming imports for what are primarily domestic problems."
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative-designate, told the Senate Finance Committee at his confirmation hearing on Tuesday that the tariff decision next week would stimulate efforts to conclude an international agreement on steel trade. The Bush Administration unsuccessfully sought a pact that would limit government subsidies around the world while eliminating tariffs and other curbs on steel imports.
Clinton Administration officials have not indicated whether it will seek the same kind of agreement or pursue a deal allowing some American subsidies, as unions have urged.
The Commerce Department made a final ruling Tuesday that certain steel-alloy bars from Brazil, France, Germany and Britain are sold at unfairly low prices and with subsidies. It assessed preliminary tariffs ranging from 25.82 percent for a British company to 167.31 percent for a Brazilian company.
The alloy bars are mainly used to make nuts, bolts and screws. For duties to be collected, the International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, must rule that steel imports are a significant cause of the domestic industry's troubles.
The United States imported only $89.8 million worth of the steel bars from the four countries in 1991, the most recent year for which figures are available. Still, the decision is a rough and imperfect indicator of next week's probable results, because the comparison of domestic and foreign steel prices was performed over roughly the same period early last year as with the much broader cases scheduled for decisions next week.
The dollar was relatively weak early last year. So foreign prices stated in local currencies were more likely, after conversion into dollars, to exceed American prices and violate American dumping laws.
Pierre F. de Ravel d'Esclapon, a New York lawyer who represents several European steelmakers on whom tariffs were imposed, said that the dollar's weakness only partly explained the size of the tariffs, and complained that the Commerce Department had also calculated the tariffs in ways that made the percentages especially high. "They gave absolutely no quarter," he said.
He and other trade experts also cautioned that because the steel-bar decisions involved only four countries and an obscure product, they were an imperfect indicator of next week's rulings. Many economists have criticized these laws as unfairly biased in favor of domestic industries.
Nicholas C. Tolerico, a former Commerce Department administrator who is director of Federal relations at the LTV Corporation, predicted that the average tariff imposed next week would be nearly 25 percent. Other experts familiar with the case also predicted large tariffs.
The Commerce Department was closed today for the Inauguration and so there was no comment.

 BODY:
THERE may be a way for the United States Treasury to put a bit more zing in the recovery while still reducing the budget deficit. And Bill Clinton's advisers know it.
Skeptical? Join the throng. Economic free lunches have been viewed with a jaundiced eye ever since the more zealous supply-siders promised that the big tax cuts of the early 1980's would pay for themselves in an orgy of revenue growth. But Washington is not above sampling a low-cost hors d'ouevre or two. And the latest to be added to the menu is almost certain to prove a tempting morsel: a proposal to stimulate private investment and save on Federal interest outlays by shortening the average maturity of Government securities sold to the public. 
 This time, moreover, there is little worry that the initiative will backfire. Benjamin Friedman, a very sober Harvard economist, describes the idea as "a win-win situation," one that would reduce the Federal deficit by a few billion dollars even if it did not provide much kick to the economy. And it could prove a political godsend for the new President, who must somehow show that he is on top of the economy's immediate problems without abandoning his emphasis on long-term solutions to lagging productivity growth.
The idea, as outlined last week by the Democratic Study Group, the House Democrats' advisory panel, is simple. Washington currently covers its deficit spending by borrowing money for terms ranging from 3 months to 30 years. Interest rates vary, of course, according to market conditions when the debt is issued. But Uncle Sam's borrowing costs are also related to the debt's average maturity: investors generally demand higher yields on longer-term securities, at least in part to compensate for the greater risk of the debt's fluctuating in resale value.
At the end of World War II, the average maturity of Government debt was close to 10 years. It slipped in subsequent decades as the Treasury worked to pare interest costs by rolling over old debt at ever shorter terms. By 1975, the figure had fallen to a mere 2 years, 8 months.
Since then, though, the Treasury has allowed the average maturity of its publicly held debt to climb to about six years. That simplified the problems of redeeming and reselling trillions of dollars of maturing securities. And for some years the longer maturities cost little or nothing extra because interest rates did not vary much across terms.
But the situation did lock Washington into hundreds of billions of dollars in long-term obligations paying more than 10 percent interest in the early 1980's -- a time when it was virtually certain that inflation was on the way out and that interest rates would fall. Moreover, when the Federal Reserve drove down short-term interest rates in the recent recession, the Treasury continued to sell long-term notes and bonds at premium rates.
Today, an investor can reap about three percentage points more interest on a seven-year Treasury security than on a three-month one -- a difference that by almost everyone's calculation adds billions annually to the Government's borrowing costs. More important, in Mr. Friedman's view, that forces private borrowers -- everyone from auto makers to home buyers -- to pay more for credit. And this, in turn, is slowing the recovery by dampening private investment.
Mr. Friedman estimates that shifting just one-quarter of sales of new longer-term debt to short-term securities would cut long-term interest rates by a half percentage point. Barry Nalebuff of the School of Organization and Management at Yale estimates a potential budget savings of about $10 billion annually from refinancing of the Government's $2.2 trillion publicly held debt.
Robert Giordano of Goldman, Sachs doubts the savings could be that large. But he does think there could be some economies if Washington stopped selling seven-year notes, the Government security, incidentally, that competes most directly with private mortgage and business equipment finance.
If shortening the average debt maturity is really the greatest idea since microwave popcorn, why didn't the Bush Administration take it and run? One possible explanation is that the technical questions of debt management were simply left to civil servants, who were reluctant to rock the boat. A more plausible one is that Mr. Bush's advisers were happy to see ailing banks profiting on the fat spread between the rates they paid depositors and the higher yields on their investments in Treasury securities -- and never reckoned with the urgency of beating back the recession.
But this White House is not likely to miss a chance to pick up a few billion dollars in budgetary savings. Nor is it likely to pass by the opportunity to trim mortgage rates and, in the process, emphasize the point that Democrats are committed to keeping overall Government interest costs down by containing inflation. After all, a President dealt as weak a hand as Mr. Clinton's must scrounge for every possible economic advantage.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION;
'We Force the Spring': Transcript of Address By President Clinton

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's Inaugural Address yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
My fellow citizens, today we celebrate the mystery of American renewal. This ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world, we force the spring. A spring reborn in the world's oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent America. 
 When our founders boldly declared America's independence to the world and our purposes to the Almighty, they knew that America to endure would have to change. Not change for change sake but change to preserve America's ideals -- life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Though we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. Each generation of Americans must define what it means to be an American.
 
Assuming the Mantle
 On behalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his half-century of service to America.
And I thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression, fascism and communism. Today, a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.
Raised in unrivaled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's strongest but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages, increasing inequality and deep divisions among our own people.
When George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold, news traveled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat. Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously to billions around the world. Communications and commerce are global, investment is mobile, technology is almost magical, and ambition for a better life is now universal. We earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with people all across the earth. Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world. And the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy.
 
A Time for Vision, and Will
 This new world has already enriched the lives of millions of Americans who are able to compete and win in it. But when most people are working harder for less, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises great and small, when the fear of crime robs law-abiding citizens of their freedom, and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend. We know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have not done so. Instead, we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our resources, fractured our economy and shaken our confidence.
Though our challenges are fearsome, so are our strengths. Americans have ever been a restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us. From our Revolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history.
Thomas Jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time. Well my fellow Americans, this is our time. Let us embrace it.
Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America. And so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a new season of American renewal has begun.
 
'In the Light of Posterity'
 To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before. We must invest more in our own people -- in their jobs and in their future -- and at the same time cut our massive debt. And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy. It will require sacrifice. But it can be done and done fairly. Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake. We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children.
Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can do no less. Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is. Posterity is the world to come. The world for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our planet and to whom we bear sacred responsibility. We must do what America does best: offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all.
It is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our Government or from each other. Let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country.
To renew America we must revitalize our democracy. This beautiful capital, like every capital since the dawn of civilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out, who is up and who is down, forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and pays our way.
Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who want to do better. And so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America. Let us resolve to make our Government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, a Government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays. Let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs.
 
'This New World'

To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race -- they affect us all.
Today, as an old order passes, the new world is more free but less stable. Communism's collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers. Clearly, America must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.
While America rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world. Together with our friends and allies we will work to shape change lest it engulf us. When our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied, we will act, with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.
The brave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf and Somalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve.
But our greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in many lands. Across the world we see them embraced and we rejoice. Our hopes, our hearts, our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause.
The American people have summoned the change we celebrate today. You have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes in historic numbers, and you have changed the face of Congress, the Presidency and the political process itself. Yes, you, my fellow Americans, have forced the spring.
Now we must do the work the season demands. To that work I now turn with all the authority of my office. I ask the Congress to join with me. But no President, no Congress, no government can undertake this mission alone. My fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal.
 
The Trumpets' Call
 I challenge a new generation of young Americans to a season of service; to act on your idealism by helping troubled children, keeping company with those in need, reconnecting our torn communities. There is so much to be done. Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service, too.
In serving, we recognize a simple but powerful truth: We need each other and we must care for one another. Today we do more than celebrate America, we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of America: An idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge; an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate we, the fortunate and the unfortunate, might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's long, heroic journey must go forever upward.
And so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st century, let us begin anew with energy and hope, with faith and discipline. And let us work until our work is done. The Scripture says, "And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not."
From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley. We have heard the trumpets, we have changed the guard. And now each in our own way, and with God's help, we must answer the call.
Thank you, and God bless you all.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION;
Infant Administration Tackles Full-Grown Workload

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20

 BODY:
Two hours after Bill Clinton took the oath of office, before the new boss had arrived and before the parade had even begun, his senior economic aides met at the White House for the first time. Shortly after that, his communications staff did the same.
In many ways, the official ceremonies were almost an interruption to the work the new Clinton Administration faces. Within his first three weeks, Mr. Clinton has determined to forward a budget to Congress, deliver a major economic address, act to expand abortion and gay rights and cope with international hostilities on several fronts. 
Today, the President signed an ethics code for his appointees, using a newly formal signature, William J. Clinton, that marked his transformation from a small-state Governor to Commander in Chief.
The changes were less momentous for his staff members but just as full of portent as they stepped into the jobs they had been angling for throughout a long campaign year.
 
Preparing for Early Start
 "The key thing is we've got a lot of momentum going," said Gene Sperling, the deputy assistant to the President for economic policy. "We can't let the logistics of moving in slow it down."
The moving trucks that arrived at 1600 Pennsylvania today from Little Rock, Ark., had a little trouble fitting in the front gates and were directed to another entrance. But their appearance signaled the pace of the change in Washington today.
In the White House offices, Democrats replaced computer hard disks and assembled new files. Mr. Clinton's cadre of aides, many young enough to have spent the bulk of their political lives pining after Republican-held power, got to work right away.
"We start tomorrow at 7:15," said David Dreyer, a 36-year-old, habitually ponytailed Capitol Hill aide who will be deputy assistant to the President for communications.
 
Briefing From Scowcroft
 As he walked to his new office in the Old Executive Office Building, next to the White House, Mr. Dreyer said, "I'm starting to think, 'When am I going to see my children when they're not asleep?' "
Other members of the Clinton staff also felt the weeks of anticipation give way to the enormity of the task ahead. W. Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, and Samuel R. Berger, his deputy, started setting up shop at the White House early this morning, long before the President was sworn in.
"Our watch begins at 12:01," Mr. Berger said.
The pressures of impending world crisis receded somewhat today. But Mr. Clinton and his national security aides nevertheless received a morning briefing from the outgoing national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. And later in the day, Mr. Clinton could be seen conferring earnestly with his newly confirmed Secretary of State, Warren G. Christopher, in the parade reviewing stand for several minutes. Another nominee with a critical national security role, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, also won swift Senate confirmation today, as did Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
 
Finding the Facilities
 But the first day of work presented more basic problems for the members of Mr. Clinton's staff. Many did not know what offices they would occupy.
"We're kind of bumping into each other in the halls trying to figure out where the ladies' room is," said Dee Dee Myers, the new press secretary. "I did get lost, and walked by the Oval Office and saw the new drapes."
For the record, the drapes are gold, she said, but she could not say whether the blue Oval Office carpet had been replaced.
"I don't know," she said. "I'd never been invited there before."
At the Defense Secretary's office in the Pentagon, the brass plate on the door that read Dick Cheney was removed and replaced with one saying Les Aspin. With the clerical staff not yet in place, volunteers answered the busy phones at the White House press office throughout the afternoon.
 
Cheering the Television
 Mark Gearan, Mr. Clinton's deputy chief of staff, said he made several visits to the White House in the days leading to the inauguration to assign office space and phone lines. "Phones, space, budgets, that's my world," Mr. Gearan said.
One sign of the new order of power at the White House: the spacious West Wing office with the ornate L-shaped desk that belonged to President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, goes to the new communications director, George Stephanopoulos, rather than the new press secretary. Ms. Myers will do business in lesser quarters nearby.
The anxiety that had been building within the transition staff since the election suddenly matured into the immediacy of hard work today. Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, met with his predecessor, James A. Baker 3d, this morning.
But there was room for celebration as well. Staff members who had moved in early watched the swearing-in on television and cheered when the President-elect became the President. Many others planned to attend the evening's inaugural balls.
 
'Too Tired for Parties'
 "We are some of the most rag-tag partyers you can ever imagine, because we have been working too hard," said Avis LaVelle, a campaign and transition aide who will take a job at the Department of Health and Human Services. "I am too tired for parties. Most of the people in government want to get the inaugural activities over so that we can get down to business."
At the White House, Ms. Myers got into a mini-battle of wills with some journalists over reports that they would be evicted from their West Wing quarters to the relatively remote Old Executive Office Building.
"You guys come in and close the door on us right off the bat," Helen Thomas, the veteran correspondent for United Press International, groused to Ms. Myers. Ms. Myers assured her that the final decision had yet to be made.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS -- ADVERTISING

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
WHO makes the media choices for advertisers is beginning to be scrutinized as closely as the choices themselves.
The reason, of course, is the growth of independent services outside traditional advertising agencies that handle tasks like media planning and buying. These services thrive by promoting themselves as specialists, offering a Gerber-esque promise that because media are their business, their only business, clients gain far more in efficiency and savings than might be lost by unbundling, or separating, media from other account functions. 
 By one estimate, outside services will be handling media for accounts representing 10 to 12 percent of all domestic billings by 2000, up from 5 to 7 percent last year. According to data compiled by the SFM Media Corporation, a leading independent media-services firm in New York, 17 advertisers -- including Benetton, G. Heileman and Mastercard -- with accounts billing more than $255 million left agencies for services in 1992.
"The recession certainly started it going," said Walter Staab, a former agency principal who is now chairman and president of SFM, "because advertisers felt they had to take a really close look at what they were getting for their money."
Even top executives are beginning to go with the flow. Carl H. Kot heimer, who was executive vice president and corporate director of media and marketing services at the former Della Femina, McNamee Inc. agency, said earlier this week that he would join Horizon Media Inc. in New York as executive vice president and director of marketing services.
Mr. Kotheimer follows several other recent fence-jumpers; among the most notable are Steven J. Farella, who worked at agencies like Young & Rubicam and Wells Rich Greene BDDP before becoming president of Farella Media That Works in New York, and Richard J. Kostyra, who left J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., where he was executive vice president and United States director of media services, to found Media First International in New York.
"The desire for a la carte media services has escalated to a point where a good number of major national advertisers, heretofore at full-service agencies, are looking at it," said Mr. Kostyra, who departed from Thompson with media responsibilities on the Northwest Airlines account, now his initial client.
"The media department of an advertising agency, while fully integrated, cannot be as flexible and as entrepreneurial as it would like," he added, speaking as if he had not spent three decades at a traditional agency. "As an independent media service, I have no obligation other than to provide my clients with innovative and efficient media servicing."
John E. O'Toole, chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, offered a contrasting perspective. Hiring services, he said, "contributes to the very dangerous trend of commoditization, buying advertising by the pound."
"The input from creative, from account planners, from everybody else, should be contributing to the media," he added, "so the media program is based on more than what the computer tells you."
The increasing influence that independent services exert was acknowledged by the agency trade association last May, in a survey saying that more dollars moved to member agencies from services than vice versa. The survey came under attack from the services, which questioned its findings and methodology.
Mr. O'Toole, in a wry reference to himself, remarked: "We really goofed on that. That's what happens when you have a copywriter running an association." He blamed "dumb research procedures" for flaws in the survey. Still, he said, the shift in media responsibilities between agencies, particularly when giant clients consolidate media services at a single shop, "has far exceeded in volume the movement out of agencies into media services."
Ed Ronk, a media consultant in New York who has worked at agencies and media services, said there "is no doubt that some significant inroads are being made by the independent services," particularly on accounts with billings under $300 million.
"But the reality of it is that 90 percent or more of all media dollars are still being placed by agencies," he said. Efforts by independent services to accelerate their growth by forming consortiums to handle the media needs of small- to-mid-sized agencies, he said, are likely to confront a crucial problem. "If I'm one of four agencies in an independent consortium, who does it help if two of us are in a pitch for the same account?"
Whatever the outcome of the tussle between agencies and services, Mr. Ronk said, "the major beneficiary is the client, because all this creates a very healthy, competitive marketplace."
