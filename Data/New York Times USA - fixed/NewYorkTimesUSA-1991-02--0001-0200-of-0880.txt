HEADLINE: Robert W. Ponte, 46, Urban Planner, Dies

 BODY:
Robert W. Ponte, an urban planner who helped design major developments in New York City and Tehran, Iran, died on Jan. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
He died of heart failure, his brother, Joseph, of Falls Church, Va., said.
Dr. Ponte was an expert on zoning regulations and the economic consequences of urban development projects. While with the planning firm of Cooper, Eckstut Associates in Manhattan he helped prepare master plans for Battery Park City and the 42d Street Redevelopment Project.
In the early 1970's he served in the Mayor's Office of Midtown Planning and Development. Later, he was part of a four-person team that created a master plan for the Shah of Iran for the redevelopment of the center of Tehran.
From 1984 until his death, he directed real-estate and market analysis for Buckhurst Fish Hutton Katz Inc., a Manhattan architectural firm. He also lectured on urban planning at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1971.
In addition to his brother, he is survived by his parents, Joseph and Grace Ponte of Cornwall, Pa., and a sister, Arlene Clanton of West Lynn, Ore.

HEADLINE: Lag Found in Kidney Transplants for Blacks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Blacks receive fewer kidney transplants than whites, are less likely to donate kidneys and do not do as well as whites after transplants, a study by transplant doctors says.
At the same time, blacks are more likely than whites to suffer from serious kidney disease requiring either a lifetime of kidney dialysis or a transplant, said the study, which is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
 The relative lack of kidney donors who are black may be one reason blacks receive fewer kidneys, said Dr. Martin G. White, who directed the study for the American Society of Transplant Physicians. The society consists of kidney specialists and others who care for patients who have received organ transplants.
"Most of the organs are going to be coming from the white population, and fewer of them are going to be well matched for the black population," Dr. White said.
That may also be the reason that the survival of transplanted organs is about 10 percent lower in blacks than in whites, the study said.
 
Social and Economic Factors
 Dr. White and his colleagues speculated that social and economic factors also had a role in the transplant inequities between blacks and whites. For example, blacks who are poor may be less likely than whites to carry insurance that will cover the costs of transplants, Dr. White said.
Many of the problems noted in the study have been known for some time, but "this is the first time that a comprehensive review looking at all of the issues has been put together in one piece," Dr. White said.
Dr. David Sutherland, president of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, said the inequities were not because of bad intentions on the part of surgeons involved in transplants.
"I don't know of any surgeon who would bypass a black to do a white," said Dr. Sutherland, who practices at the University of Minnesota Hospital. He attributed the problem to the difficulty of matching white donors' organs to blacks.
Dr. Clive Callender, director of the transplant center at Howard University Hospital in Washington, said his research found several reasons for the shortage of donations.
Among them, he said, are a lack of awareness of transplants among blacks, religious misgivings about donating organs and distrust of the medical system.
An experimental community education project has sharply increased knowledge of transplantation and organ donation among blacks in Washington, he said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Investors Bid Up Retailing Stocks

BYLINE: By Isadore Barmash

 BODY:
IN an odd offshoot of the Persian Gulf conflict, investors have been bidding up the stocks of retail companies, even though consumers seem so caught up in the war news that they are not doing much shopping.
Some analysts conclude that investors have already written off the fact that department stores and specialty clothing stores will fare badly in the first half of this year. They say these investors are counting on a surge in consumer confidence and retail sales in the second half and so are buying up these stocks now at what they consider to bargain prices. 
 Since the war started Jan. 16, the stocks of several leading American retailers rose fairly steadily. The Dayton Hudson Corporation rose to $61,50, from $56.50; the K Mart Corporation to $31, from $27; Wal-Mart Stores to $33, from $29.75; the J. C. Penney Company to $51.125, from $44.625; the May Department Stores Company to $46.25, from $40.50, and the Limited to $22.25, from $20.25.
An exception was Dillard Department Stores, which was about flat at $90, from $89.75.
Some of the reasons given for a possible recovery are expectations that interest rates will go lower; that inflation will be stablized at moderate levels, and that the Federal Reserve will take more agressive action to control credit costs. These moves, combined with an end to the war later this year, would inspire consumer buying, especially of big-ticket products.
Janet Mangano, vice president for research atJesup, Josephthal & Company, New York, added that large institutional investors were buying names to invest in, like Nordstrom Inc., the Limited and Tiffany. "Their short-term fundamentals may not be glowing, but their long-term fundamentals are," she said.
Other analysts remain skeptical.
"January has been a very slow month in retail business but it worsened after Jan. 16," said Robert F. Buchanan, retail analyst at Alex Brown & Sons, Baltimore. Meanwhile, he said: "Retail stocks largely are going the opposite way as though their investors anticipate a rise in the second half. But I, for one, still remain negative for a number of reasons."
He cited the seven-tenths of 1 percent decline in real disposable income in November, the last month reported. "It's not a big drop," he said, "but the trend is significant." He said real disposable income grew 4.6 percent in 1988 and 2.4 percent in 1989, "but the numbers in 1990 have steadily declined."
In other negative indicators, he cited high consumer debt levels and slippage in the savings rate. "As a result of these and other factors, we are not recommending the retail group," he said. "But the second half does have something tangible going for it. It will be up against a bad Christmas in 1990 so that the 1991 holiday period can be better and that would help the second half."
Since so many analysts and investors have virtually written off the first half, the only surprise that may emerge will be "the degree of the downward results," said Wayne Hood, retail analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York. Since October, retail stocks have rallied in expectation of a second-half improvement, he said. The growth companies like Wal-Mart and Home Depot that do not have high debts have done among the best, Mr. Hood said.
Retail business is not good "and the war certainly hasn't helped, but the real problem is the economic uncertainty that so many people feel," said Ms. Mangano of Jesup, Josephthal. "Unemployment is rising in several fields, and this builds job insecurity."
Some experts say consumers are responding cautiously to the cautious stance of retailers.
"We have entered a year when most retailers are keeping tight control of their inventories and looking for opportunistic purchases to stimulate the apathetic consumers," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a New York consulting company.
Sensing an even greater public caution because of the Middle East war than before, he said, retail companies are not taking any flyers on new styling but are offering the public primarily basics or classic clothes. "Yet, it's likely that a good fashion message is just what is needed to get the customers in," he said.
Thomas Rauh, regional director of retail services for Ernst and Young, the accounting company, said: "There's an enormous amount of uncertainty today among consumers over the Mideast crisis. I don't see a return of consumer confidence for awhile. There are economic concerns, too. For the first time in the lives of many consumers, real estate values, particularly in the East, are going down. That has a chilling effect."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mostly Lower; Gold Is Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened yesterday against most major currencies, particularly the German mark, after an unexpected increase in interest rates by Germany's central bank.
Gold prices continued to weaken in worldwide trading. On the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery settled at $365.80 a troy ounce, down $3 from Wednesday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted at late bid for gold of $365.80 an ounce, off $1.95. 
 Gold had fallen sharply on Wednesday largely on technical factors and amid rising hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf, analysts said.
Currency dealers attributed the dollar's decline yesterday mainly to the German Bundesbank's surprise decision to raise its key official lending rates by half a percentage point.
The German discount rate rose to 6.5 percent, while the Lombard rate was lifted to 9 percent.
"I think it generally was a surprise, given the slowing down of economies globally," said Ronald H. Holzer, a vice president and dealer at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago.
Higher interest rates in a foreign country make the country's currency more attractive, and the dollar less attractive, to investors.
Economists said higher German rates could force a realignment of the European Monetary System, which regulates currency exchange rates within the community.
In New York, the dollar fell to 1.47695 German marks, from 1.4880 marks on Wednesday. Earlier, in Europe, it traded at 1.4785 marks, down from 1.4920.
The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.9665 in New York, up from $1.9630 on Wednesday, and $1.9650 in London, up from $1.9600.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell to 131.40 yen, from 131.70 yen on Wednesday. It traded at 131.45 yen late in London, and at 131.26 yen in New York, up from 131.10 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes on Wednesday, included: 1.2578 Swiss francs, down from 1.2625; 5.0245 French francs, down from 5.0490; 1,111.25 Italian lire, down from 1,115.50, and 1.16325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16035.
Gold dealers said prices were volatile largely because of thin activity.
"The thinness makes the market too dangerous to get into any big exposure," one Zurich trader said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Securities Up; Trading Slow

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
As it had promised on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve yesterday added huge reserves to the banking system as a way of offsetting its rising cash balances. But that did little to excite participants in the credit market, who were more interested in the employment numbers for January that the Labor Department will release this morning.
Prices of Treasury securities inched higher in slow trading, as participants placed a modest bet that the unemployment numbers would show the economy remained weak. 
 Despite the optimism, analysts said today's Labor Department report would be difficult to decipher, largely because of seasonal adjustment factors that might overstate the number of workers employed in the retail sector.
As a result of the potential distortions, estimates vary widely on what the data will show, from a decline of 200,000 in non-farm payroll employment to a rise of 300,000. In December payroll employment fell by 76,000.
"Most observers will go to the retail trade category first, and try to determine what sort of influence it had on the overall number," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "But most of the other employment categories are likely to show some weakness, and there is a general sense in the market that the report will be weak."
 
Market Participants Wary
 Most market participants were not willing to step in and buy securities, however.
"The day before employment numbers come out everybody usually stays pretty close to home," one government bond trader said. "This is no exception."
The Fed did not disclose how much it had added to the system. Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg & Company, estimated that the central bank added between $10 billion and $12 billion to the system.
The action was taken to try and prevent the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds rate from skyrocketing. Mr. Liro said that without the reserve addition yesterday the funds rate would have soared beyond 100 percent.
As it was, funds traded in a very wide range, and well above the Fed's perceived target rate of 6.75 percent. By late in the day, the funds rate was trading at around 11 percent, after being as low as 7 percent early in the session.
"Some of the pressures on funds are clearly due to tax flows into the Treasury that were of unexpectedly large dimensions," Mr. Sullivan said. "Beginning in February the pressures on the funds rate should ease as Treasury balances decline sharply. That should take a lot of volatility out of the funds rate, and allow us to see whether or not the Fed is of a mind to ease monetary policy."
Members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet in Washington for two days next week to consider any possible policy moves.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 106 5/32 late yesterday, up 7/32, to yield 8.19 percent, down from 8.22 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 103 9/ 32, up 3/32, to yield 7.86 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 30/32, up 1/32, to yield 7.03 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.18 percent, up a basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.18 percent.
A number of new deals were priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market, including a $250 million offering of twelve-year notes for the Unocal Corporation.
The 9 1/4 percent notes, which mature Feb. 1, 2003, were priced at $99.214, to yield 9.36 percent, 1.33 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
Merrill Lynch & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager on an offering of $150 million worth of securities for the Limited Inc.
The 9 1/8 percent notes, which mature Feb. 1, 2002, were priced at $99.20, to yield 9.235 percent, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by Standard & Poor's.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply posted strong gains in the week ended Jan. 22.
Most Wall Street analysts had been anticipating large increases in the aggregates. Consequently, the money report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 3/8 point in fairly active trading.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues improved by about 1/4 point, dealers said.

Xerox's Earnings Rise 11% On Strong Sales for Copiers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that stronger-than-expected copier sales lifted fourth-quarter earnings 11 percent, overcoming a sharp decline in earnings from financial services.
Xerox shares rose sharply, gaining $5.375 yesterday, or more than 12 percent, to $48.75, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 The company said it earned $235 million, or $2.27 a share, up from $212 million, or $2.01 a share, in the 1989 period, Revenues rose 10 percent, to $5.01 billion, from $4.55 billion in the last quarter of 1989.
 
Office Equipment Gains
 Xerox said that document processing income, which includes copiers, printers and related office equipment and supplies, jumped 36 percent, to $230 million, from the quarter a year earlier on a 15 percent revenue gain, to $3.91 billion. By contrast, income for the last three months of 1990 from the Stamford, Conn.-based company's Crum & Forster insurance subsidiary and its other financial businesses fell 37 percent, to $17 million, as revenues fell 6 percent, to $10.9 billion.
The earnings picture was complicated by a number of one-time charges and gains. The company gained $50 million, or 53 cents a share, after taxes from the sale of South Pacific copier operations to Fuji Xerox Company, its joint venture with Fuji of Japan. Xerox's financial arm had a $145 million pretax gain from the sale of Navco, an auto insurance subsidiary. That gain was partly offset by a $100 million addition to reserves to cover potential losses from policies that financially pressed reinsurance concerns may fail to honor. The company recorded a $12 million loss on discontinued operations in the quarter.
"I'm not sure why they had such strong copier sales in a recession or whether it's sustainable, but there's no way to look at the quarter as a negative one," said B. Alex Henderson, who follows Xerox for Prudential-Bache.
 
Yearly Net Off 65%
 For the year, Xerox's net income fell more than 65 percent, to $243 million, or $1.66 a share, from $704 million, or 6.56 a share, in 1989, largely because of $375 million writedown in the first quarter of 1990 of the company's investment in VMS Realty Partners and the steep fall in capital gains in Crum & Forster's investment portfolio to $53 million in 1990 from $379 million in 1989. Net income from Furman Selz, the company's investment banking subsidiary, fell to $12 million last year from $23 million in 1989.
Net income from all financial services plummeted to $6 million, from $165 million in 1989. Xerox's total revenues for the year rose more than 4 percent, to $17.97 billion from $17.23 billion.
"I am encouraged with our progress, recognizing that 1990 was a very challenging year, with deterioration of economic conditions in the United States, slow economic growth in much of Europe and economic disruptions in Latin America," said Paul A. Allaire, the company's president and chief executive since last August. "We are cautiously optimistic about our prospects in 1991."

HEADLINE: Home Sales Fall in Month; 1990 Total at 8-Year Low

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Sales of new homes plunged in December, ending 1990 on a sour note as total sales for the year fell to their lowest level since the recession of 1982, the Commerce Department said today.
Industry analysts said consumers were so shaken in the final weeks before the Persian Gulf war by concerns about the impending conflict and fears for their jobs that they stopped looking for new homes. 
 As a result, sales dropped by 6.7 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 463,000 in December, the lowest since a 407,000-unit rate was recorded in August 1982 during the 1981-82 recession.
 
Weak Showing for Year
 For all of last year, actual sales of new homes fell by 17.5 percent, to 536,000, from 650,000 in 1989. The showing was also the weakest sales performance in eight years. Only 412,000 homes were sold in 1982.
Home sales have been falling since 1986, when they peaked at 750,000 at the midpoint of an eight-year boom that began in November 1982 and lasted until recession set in again late last year.
"These sales drops are not interest-rate or finance-driven because rates were lower in December," said David G. Seiders, the chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, a Washington trade group.
"Nor is the credit crunch affecting the home buyers," he added. "So, we can pin this heavily, if not entirely, on a collapse in consumer confidence."
The Conference Board, a business research organization based in New York, said this week that its surveys showed that consumers were now more pessimistic about the future than they had been in a decade.
Since consumers fuel two-thirds of economic activity by buying goods and services, their low confidence suggests little likelihood the economy will be rescued soon from recession by a spending spree.
Mr. Seiders said he hoped the first quarter of this year would be the low point for new-home sales, but said he was forecasting sales for the year at only about 500,000.
 
Interest Rates Lower
 Tom Holloway, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, also in Washington, noted that interest rates for 30-year mortgages dropped to an average 9.67 percent in December, from 10.01 percent in November, and fell even further in January, to around 9.5 percent.
Since the gulf conflict began on Jan. 17, oil prices have fallen and stock market prices have risen, which might encourage potential home buyers, Mr. Holloway said.
"It may be that December was the bottom or very close to the bottom of the home-sales market," he said. But he too forecast that 1991 sales would only be around 530,000, below last year's total.
Despite the weak sales last year, the average sale price of a new home for the year rose modestly, to $150,000 from $148,800. In December alone, the average was up significantly, to $163,500, from $145,700, a figure analysts said was affected by more sales of expensive homes in California.
In addition, the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based group representing sales agents, said that based on its monthly National Housing Affordability Index, homes were more affordable in December for the average American family than they had been since early 1977.
The index takes into account income, prices and interest rates and measures whether an average family can carry the monthly mortgage payments on a new home.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Barriers to Ending The Credit Crunch

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
IN his State of the Union Message, President Bush jawboned the banks and the Federal Reserve. "Sound banks should be making more sound loans," he said. "And interest rates should be lower, now."
And the stock market surged on expectations that the Administration would use its weight to break the credit crunch and bring rates down. 
 Indeed, in an interview, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, appeared to follow the President's line in saying the credit crunch had been "as severe as any supply-induced constraint ever, other than from policy actions."
In fact, the United States now seems to have two monetary policies: one conducted by the Fed, the other by private banks. The Fed's policy is loosening, the banks tightening.
The Fed did hang tight until after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. Mr. Greenspan blames the Persian Gulf crisis for causing the recession. Critics of the Fed blame him.
Despite earlier efforts to coax the banks to lend more money to fight the recession, the banks worry about their own survival and will not. Their complaint is that the regulators are making it too tough for them, marking many of their real estate loans down to zero and squeezing them for capital they do not have and cannot raise.
A result of the private monetary policy has been the credit crunch, which has cut money supply growth below the bottom of the Fed's target range. An increase in bank lending is the mechanism by which business and consumer spending would increase and the money supply and its velocity would grow, thereby ending the recession.
Mr. Greenspan said a "necessary condition" of recovery would be for banks to get over their own crisis of confidence. Action by the Fed to cut rates, though one means of lifting banks' profits, may notbe enough to break the credit crunch.
There are international forces, in any case, that could bar the way to a sharp fall in American rates now. "Investors may not have noticed that U.S. short-term interest rates have been the world's lowest since August," said Morris Offit, president of Offitbank, an investment management bank based in New York.
On Aug. 31, three-month Euro-deposits were yielding 8 percent for the dollar, 8.38 percent for the German mark and 8.13 percent for the Japanese yen. Since then, the yield on the dollar has fallen to 6.88 percent, while the yield on the mark has risen to 9.13 percent and the yen has held firm at 8.13 percent.
In fact, the spread between American and foreign rates still appears to be widening. Yesterday,, the German Bundesbank raised the rate at which it offers funds to the money market to 9 percent from 8.5 percent.
This is the first time that such an interest-rate environment, with foreign rates so far above American rates, has existed since 1973, when the dollar began to float -- and floated downward.
A basic cause for the current spread in interest rates is that the United States economy has slid into a recession while the economies of Germany,Japan and other countries are expanding. Germany and Japan are now facing internal capital requirements that will cause government spending to balloon, widening deficits and raising inflationary pressures that their central banks are seeking to check by tightening money and raising rates.
The widening spread in rates could cause billions of dollars in American assets to move overseas. That might worsen recessionary pressures at home and, at the same time, weaken the dollar.
Actions by Germany and Japan and other industrial countries to reduce their budget deficits, ease monetary policy and bring rates down -- the prescription that foreign governments have long urged on the United States -- would serve common interests and the global economy by promoting investment, more vigorous economic growth and international trade. The United States Treasury might push harder for coordinated economic policies within the Group of Seven industrial nations, consisting of the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
The war has made it more difficult to stay on the course toward a lower Federal budget deficit and easier money; that may be one reason why Mr. Greenspan warned that if the war lasted through April, the nation could face a long and deep recession. Another is that a prolonged war would be damaging to business, consumer and banking confidence, delaying any solution to the credit crunch.
Mr. Bush did not disclose any specifics of his proposals for shoring up the banking system this year. With the President preoccupied with the war and with the White House, Treasury, Fed and others tangled in controversy over banking changes, economic policy is being largely neglected.
The President turned to Mr. Greenspan, like a totemic figure, to head a commission that might help him in getting a cut in the capital gains tax through Congress. In itself, the call for such a commission is of scant interest. But it may signal Mr. Bush's decision to reappoint Mr. Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. That move will also depend on whether Mr. Greenspan's Fed can extricate the President and the nation from a deepening recession if the war drags on.

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Budget Numbers Are Cut and People Bleed

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Easily obscured by the New York State budget's antiseptic ledger of numbers -- the $6 billion gap, the $4.5 billion in cuts -- were flesh-and-blood New Yorkers who felt real anguish today.
Loud wails could be heard from the public employees, up to 7,500 of whom may be laid off, and from the legion of lobbyists who are paid to denounce every threatened offense. But there also were quieter protests from people far from Albany, where a thick book of numbers can have a deeply personal effect. 
 They came from people like Dolores A. Mitcham of Chautauqua County, whose husband, Walter, is waging a recurring battle against mental illness.
In late 1989, Mr. Mitcham was hospitalized at Gowanda Psychiatric Center, a 300-bed hospital that serves a four-county area in the rural Southern Tier. His stay lasted only 30 days, but his condition, which is diagnosed as manic depression, makes a return trip possible at any time.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget would close Gowanda by phasing it out over two or three years. The hospital has a $27 million operating budget that comes entirely from the state. If it closes, the nearest psychiatric hospital would be in Buffalo, nearly a two-hour drive from the Mitchams' home in Frewsburg.
"It's very disturbing to me," Mrs. Mitcham said. "Nobody likes to be hospitalized, but if they are they like to be as close to home as possible."
When her husband was hospitalized at Gowanda, it took Mrs. Mitcham almost an hour to drive there. She and other family members made two trips a week, and she said she thought that the visits had sped her husband's recovery. If he was hospitalized in Buffalo, she said, she would have to limit her visits to one a week at the most.
"I couldn't afford it, especially with the Governor talking about raising the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon," she said.
Frustration was also in the voice of Mark W. Jones, the planning and development director of the Glimmerglass Opera in Springfield Center, near Cooperstown. Because Mr. Cuomo proposed a 56 percent reduction in grants awarded by the state's Council on the Arts, Mr. Jones fears that one of his company's three summer productions could be imperiled.
Glimmerglass has already been promised a $35,000 state grant for the coming year. If much of it is cancelled, Mr. Jones said, it may be difficult to produce Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" or Beethoven's "Fidelio."
"Imagine the "Mikado" being done with a piano rather than an orchestra," he said.
Glimmerglass, which has a $1.8 million budget, is one of thousands of arts agencies around the state that divided $56.4 million in grants last year from the Council on the Arts. For many of the smaller groups the grants are considered life's blood.
"I know that there are constantly new estimates of what the budget gap is going to be every month," Mr. Jones said. "But these things are devastating to the small nonprofit organizations."
 
Cuts Close to Home
While Mr. Cuomo did not formally unveil his budget until today, he has been laying the political groundwork for months. He spent much of the fall and winter warning of the hard times to come, thus lowering expectations. He allowed many of the most painful announcements to trickle out in advance, thus softening their impact over time.
And he carefully insulated himself from any accusation that he was not personally sharing in the pain. First he canceled his inauguration celebration, saving a symbolic $70,000. Then he formed a commission to study the possibility, among other things, of selling portions of the grounds of the Governor's Mansion.
Next he canceled a dinner that is traditionally given for news executives on budget day, replacing it with an afternoon briefing where coffee and cookies were served. And when the document was published today, it included a 10 percent cut of $873,800 in the Governor's office budget and the postponement of the Liberty Scholarship program, a centerpiece of the Governor's social agenda.
 
Lining Up for Bad News
Most people are not willing to pay for bad news.
But shortly after Mr. Cuomo proposed his budget today, hundreds of lobbyists lined up outside Room 117 of the State Capitol to await their chance to pay $10 for five pounds and four ounces of fiscal gloom.
The budget is always a hot-selling item in Albany, but it was easier to rationalize spending money on it back in the days of wine and roses.
The director of the New York State Motor Truck Association, Martin G. Carson, shook his head as he looked over his shoulder at the line snaking out of Room 117 and into the lobby of the Capitol. "It's amazing that anybody wants to read this thing this year," said Mr. Carson, whose organization quickly denounced the Governor's proposal to raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel by 10 cents a gallon. "It's nothing but bad news."
The thick budget books, which ran 618 pages this year, were distributed free until 1988. "Because they were free, everybody wanted them, and then we'd walk around and find them in trash cans," said Claudia Hutton, the spokeswoman for the state's Budget Division.
It was then that a $10 fee was imposed, recovering most of the cost of producing the book.
Many lobbyists standing in line today said they did not mind paying for the book, believing that they were making a small contribution toward reducing the state's $6 billion budget gap.
And the recession did not seem to have a chilling effect on sales. The state sold 429 copies of the budget book today, compared with 332 on budget day last year, perhaps showing that bad news travels faster than good.

HEADLINE: Bundesbank Lifts 2 Key Interest Rates

BYLINE: By FERDINAND PROTZMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Germany's central bank raised two leading interest rates today in a surprise move that is likely to slow global economic growth and further strain the country's relations with its main European trading partners.
While higher interest rates were expected soon, no action was foreseen today. Karl Otto Pohl, the president of the central bank, the Bundesbank, said earlier this week that international political conditions were not right for such a move. 
 Economists said today that the higher German rates created a less favorable climate for the United States to lower interest rates in the face of its recession, but added that the war in the Persian Gulf clouded the situation so much that it was hard to predict the long-term effect of the Bundesbank's move.
 
Dollar to Remain Weak
 The higher German rates, however, do mean that the dollar is likely to remain relatively weak against the mark until at least the middle of the year, despite the support the American currency has received from investors seeking a safe harbor for their money because of the war.
More broadly, the economists said the move would aggravate the cool relations between Germany and some of its main trading partners. At the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in New York earlier in the month, Germany was strongly criticized by the other nations for maintaining restrictive monetary policies while many countries were facing the prospect of economic recession.
While Germany's economy is growing robustly, thanks largely to pent-up consumer demand in eastern Germany, growth elsewhere in Europe has been slowing. French, Spanish and Italian officials had hoped to lower interest rates to improve their flagging economies, but the Bundesbank's move will put pressure on them to raise interest rates or accept an adjustment of currency exchange-rate parities to keep their economies somewhat competitive.
 
Dollar Declines
 The announcement that the Bundesbank's benchmark discount rate and its short-term Lombard rate would each be raised by a half a percentage point, to 6.50 percent and 9 percent, respectively, pushed the dollar lower in foreign-exchange trading and sent stock and bond prices on European exchanges slightly lower before recovering as trading closed.
The discount rate had been at 6 percent since October 1989. The Lombard rate was lifted by half a percentage point in November. The discount rate is what is paid on commercial banks' borrowing from the central bank against bills as collateral. The Lombard is the rate paid by the banks on short-term borrowing, using securities as collateral.
 
Others Follow Suit
 The rate increases were rapidly followed by similar rises by the Dutch and Austrian central banks.
At a news conference in Frankfurt today, Mr. Pohl defended the Bundesbank's actions, saying the central bank was obliged to prevent inflationary trends rather than react to them.
"I am concerned this decision will not be completely understood, especially abroad," he said. "But this is a technical move needed to adjust to money market rates. We are in a difficult period."
The interest rate rise was approved at today's regularly scheduled meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-setting body, the central bank council. It consists of the seven Bundesbank directors and the heads of the 11 western German state central banks.
 
Technical Problem Cited
 Economists agreed that a genuine technical problem had existed on the German money market. Eckhard Cornehl, the chief economist with Bank Julius Bear in Frankfurt, said the fact that some short-term money market rates had risen above the Lombard rate encouraged banks to borrow at the cheaper Lombard rate, which is intended for emergency lending. This shift made some action inevitable, he said.
"But I think Mr. Pohl was not for this increase," Mr. Cornehl said. "It looks like the state central bank governors pushed this through against the wishes of the Bundesbank directors. What they have done is created a big problem for other nations in the European Monetary System. If they don't follow the increase, then eventually the exchange rates will have to be realigned, with possibly a devaluation of the franc."
He added "No one really wants that, given all the turmoil in the world at the moment."
 
U.S. Has No Comment
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 -- Bush Administration officials declined to comment for the record today on the German increase in its two leading interest rates. But a senior Administration official who spoke on condition that he not be identified said the increase was "obviously a concern because already high interest rates are starting to be a drag on growth around the world."
The official said that "it would be better if central banks were promoting growth rather than dealing with a transitory increase in inflation."
But a Treasury Department official played down the action, noting that it "reflects internal economic and financial considerations" and "appears to have been largely discounted by the markets."

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes More Anti-Drug Spending

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Bush declared today that while the nation was making unmistakeable progress against illegal drugs, much more remained to be done, and he called for an 11 percent increase in Federal spending to expand the drug war.
Responding to criticism that his anti-drug program has emphasized law enforcement to the detriment of treatment and prevention, Mr. Bush said several new health initiatives were included in the new $11.65 billion spending proposal, up $1.13 billion from the current fiscal year. 
 But independent drug experts and Congressional critics asserted that while spending for treatment would rise by $260 million in the President's plan, the proportion of the total budget designated for health-related programs would decline, to 30.3 percent from 31.2 in the current fiscal year.
"Despite it's rhetoric to the contrary, the Administration continues to shortchange treatment and prevention programs that reduce the demand for drugs," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.
Mathea Falco, an Assistant Secretary of State for international narcotic matters in the Carter Administration and now a visiting fellow at the Cornell Medical Center in New York City, said Mr. Bush's drug strategy was "more of the same."
Ms. Falco said in a telephone interview from New York: "Its dominant focus is on keeping supplies from coming into the country and keeping them off the streets. It still does not recognize that reducing demand must be the first priority. We know that sealing the border is impossible, but the strategy continues to try to do it."
David Tell, deputy chief of staff of the Administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy, said the increased funds sought by Mr. Bush would be used "across the board in all the major functional areas." But the largest increase would go to domestic law enforcement, which would receive $5.2 billion, or 14 percent more than in the current fiscal year.
Speaking to a group of Administration officials and reporters at the Old Executive Office Building today, Mr. Bush drew attention to recently published studies financed by the Federal Government that indicated declining drug use around the country, most sharply among the middle class.
"The clear message of available data is that drug use is on the way down," he said. "Since I've come into office we've seen an important and encouraging shift in drug use trends."
 
Cyclical Patterns of Use
 Drug experts acknowledge the decrease but attribute the change as much to cyclical patterns of drug use and reports of public condemnation of cocaine as to Government programs.
"How many people have stopped using drugs in the last 18 months because of Federal dollars spent is hard to say," said John P. Walters, the acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. "But I don't think there's any doubt that expanded Federal spending has contributed significantly."
With signs that the tide is turning, Mr. Bush said, "you might ask, 'Can we lessen our commitment to stopping the scourge of drugs, can we afford to look elsewhere, lose interest? Can we declare victory?'
"And of course, the answer is an emphatic 'no.' "
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the the Manhattan Democrat who heads the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said the President's strategy was "so full of holes that it does not allow me to say that we are tackling the drug problem where it is most severe in our inner cities."
The drug strategy was the third presented by Mr. Bush since his appearance on television on Sept. 5, 1989, to declare war on what he said was "the toughest domestic challenge we've faced in decades." Cocaine and crack use were climbing and the people who refine and export cocaine from South America were threatening the governments in Colombia and Peru.
Now, while drug use appears to be falling, murder and robbery rates are soaring. The price of cocaine has sharply risen in most cities, but officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration say the drug is widely available. Some of the price fluctuation, they say, appears to be the result of manipulation by traffickers.
 
Change of Schedule
 The Colombian Government, driven by a desire to end a wave of violence, has embarked on informal negotiations with the traffickers, offering leniency in exchange for surrender. The fear in Washington is that drug violence in Colombia may end, while trafficking continues unabated.
Peru has refused more than $35 million in United States aid to help its military fight guerrillas who are encouraging small farmers to keep growing coca, the basic ingredient of cocaine. But Peru has proposed an economic plan to induce farmers to shift production to fruits and vegetables, a move it hopes the United States will endorse.
Officials in the Office of Drug Control Policy had intended to make public the Administration's strategy next Monday. But they hastily called reporters today because of a change in the President's schedule. He took the unusual step of personally announcing the results of a drug-use survey in December. Both moves were seen as an attempt to head off criticism that Mr. Bush was neglecting domestic issues because he was busy dealing with the war in the Persian Gulf.
"I expect some wonder whether I am totally preoccupied with events half way around the world," Mr. Bush said today.
The change in release date sent many members of Congress scrambling for copies of the report.
Mr. Bush said he was "particularly proud" that his proposal included $100 million to expand drug treatment.
He said the money would enable 200,000 more people to be treated; two million are now being aided in various centers. But Administration officials said that the $100 million would actually pay for treatment for an additional 40,000 people and that the remaining 160,000 treatment spaces would be created only if there were matching money from states, cities and private insurance companies.
Some Administration officials expressed anger at critics in Congress who say more should be spent on treatment and prevention. "We asked for this same amount for other treatment programs last year," said Mr. Tell, of the Drug Policy Office, "and they slashed us down to a third of the request."
The plan would increase spending for international drug programs by $132 million to a total of $779 million, with $499 million designated for Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, where most of the world's cocaine is grown and processed. Economic aid to those countries would rise from $202 million to $285 million. But Bolivia alone argues that it needs at least $500 million to reorder the farming habits of a peasant population that has grown dependent on the income from coca plants.

HEADLINE: Bailout Money Is Threatened

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Members of New England's Congressional delegation threatened today to block new spending for the savings and loan bailout until the Bush Administration comes forward with a plan to ease the credit crunch.
Massachusetts and other New England states were hit early and particularly hard by the recession, and the failure of Bank of New England and two associated banks this month has further shaken the region's already weak banking system.
The threat to link the credit issue to the bailout could further delay the new financing the Administration has said it will need by the end of February to continue seizing ailing savings and loans.
The Administrations wants $77 billion this year to dispose of 225 institutions.

HEADLINE: Atlanta Papers To Cut 255 Jobs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, the state's largest newspapers, said on Wednesday that they were laying off 133 people and leaving 122 other jobs unfilled, primarily because of a decline in advertising revenues.
The cuts were spread through every department, said Jay A. Smith, the publisher for both newspapers.
The reduction includes 17 of the 480 newsroom jobs, he said. Reductions were also made in the circulation, advertising, production, marketing and data-processing departments.
The Constitution publishes weekday mornings and The Journal weekday evenings. They jointly publish The Journal-Constitution on Saturdays and Sundays.
The economic slump has tightened ad revenues, although the newspapers' circulation has been increasing, Mr. Smith said. He would not release revenue figures.

HEADLINE: Two New Governors Offer Plans to Trim Deficits

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The new Governors of Massachusetts and Rhode Island presented their first budgets to the states' lawmakers today, taking painful steps that they said would eliminate projected deficits that are among the worst in the country.
Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts called for widespread cuts in state services, and Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun of Rhode Island urged a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. 
 Presenting a budget plan for the last six months of the 1991 fiscal year, which ends in June, and for the entire next fiscal year, Mr. Weld offered a complex program that included unpaid furloughs for state employees, tightened eligibility for Medicaid and the sale of state property, including recreational sites like zoos and skating rinks. He would also close a number of state hospitals and delay a state contribution to a public employees' pension plan.
Mr. Weld, the state's first Republican Governor in two decades, stood by a campaign pledge not to seek a tax increase to resolve Massachusetts's longstanding fiscal crisis. He also said he would not go to Wall Street to borrow money to cover the deficit, a step that had been taken by his predecessor, Michael S. Dukakis.
But the new Governor did seem to depart from two parts of his campaign platform, which proposed closing the deficit by decreasing the size of state government, when he called today for reducing state aid to cities and towns while increasing fees for a wide variety of state services.
 
Deficits of About 12 Percent
 Speaking serenely, almost casually, at a Statehouse news conference, Mr. Weld said that without his proposed cuts, the deficit for the last six months of the current fiscal year would be $850 million, in an annual budget that totals $13.9 billion. For the entire next fiscal year, the deficit will be $1.82 billion, in a budget of $15.1 billion, if his cuts are not made, he said.
On an annual basis, the deficit for each of those years would equal about 12 percent of the budget, one of the highest such proportions for any state budget in the nation.
In Rhode Island, which is facing a $200 million deficit, also equal to 12 percent, for the fiscal year that ends in June, Governor Sundlun proposed steps that included a 20 percent increase in the personal income tax, an 11 percent surcharge on corporate income taxes and a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax.
Mr. Sundlun, a Democrat, also called for a sharp cut in state aid to education, the layoff of 1,000 state employees and requiring state employees to take one unpaid holiday every two weeks.
Both Massachusetts and Rhode Island are suffering from a severe recession that began in New England more than a year ago and has led to a continuing decline in state income and sales tax revenue. But residents in both states have blamed their governors for the trouble, heaping scorn on Mr. Dukakis, who chose not to run for re-election, and giving Mr. Sundlun a resounding victory in November over the incumbent Republican in Rhode Island, Edward D. DiPrete.
 
Laying Blame for Taxes
 Mr. Sundlun had pledged for months not to raise taxes, except as a last resort. In making his tax-increase proposals today, he blamed Mr. DiPrete, saying the earlier administration had overestimated revenue and consistently underestimated spending.
"We're paying for DiPrete mismanagement, pure and simple," Mr. Sundlun said at a news conference in Providence. Reminded by a reporter that he had once said that a governor who raises taxes never gets re-elected, Mr. Sundlun said, "There comes a time when you have to shift positions, and we've done that."
Mr. DiPrete did not return telephone calls to his home and office.
In Massachusetts, the early reaction to Mr. Weld's budget-cutting proposals from Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature, was guarded but conciliatory. "Something has to pass -- we obviously have a deficit," said Speaker of the House Charles F. Flaherty of Cambridge.
"If we find any cuts in there we can't live with, we will have to find other cuts," Mr. Flaherty said. "We have to meet the bottom line."
Mr. Flaherty did suggest that Mr. Weld might be trying to achieve too much of his savings at the expense of state employees. Mr. Weld's budget calls for a reduction of 6,000 state workers, making them take 10 unpaid work days by June and requiring them to pay for a much larger share of their health insurance. The large sacrifices asked of state workers raises a question of fairness, Mr. Flaherty said.
 
Campaign Attacks on 'Hacks'
 In his campaign, one of Mr. Weld's major and most popular themes was constant attacks on state employees as "hacks" or "walruses" who were living high at the expense of the public.
By contrast with his treatment of state employees, Mr. Weld, a lawyer, today called for a repeal of a sales tax on services like lawyers and accountants, passed last year as part of Mr. Dukakis's budget-cutting effort.
Asked at his news conference whether it was fair to put a burden on state employees while repealing the sales tax on lawyers, Mr. Weld said, "My answer is jobs, jobs, jobs." The sales tax would lead to a loss of jobs in the state, he said.
Michael Widmer, senior vice president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a private, non-partisan group, said Mr. Weld deserved credit for formulating a plan that could balance the budget in 1992 without new taxes or borrowing in the bond market.
"The only way to reach some kind of stability here is to take some unprecedented steps," Mr. Widmer said. In particular, he pointed to the cuts being asked of state employees, the closing of state hospitals and mental hospitals and the shutdown of half of the offices of the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
"Given the dimensions of the problem, those are sound ideas," Mr. Widmer said. "But they are very difficult politically."
 
'Fees Are Not Taxes'
 Mr. Weld's proposal also calls for raising the fare on Boston's subway to $1 from 75 cents, to lessen the deficit of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, much of which is picked up by the state. Asked today how he reconciled this and other new proposed state fees with his pledge not to raise taxes, Mr. Weld said, "Fees are not taxes."
In the campaign, Mr. Weld supported a ballot measure that would have greatly raised state aid to financially strapped towns and cities. But today he said state aid for programs like education, police and firefighters would have to be cut by $271 million next year, or 10 percent. He acknowledged this was "a violation of my intention," but dismissed it as being "less serious" than sticking to his promise not to raise taxes.
As part of what he has taken to calling "entrepreneurial government," Mr. Weld proposed to sell to private business Boston's two zoos, a series of state operated skating rinks, the state's largest reservoir and 26 other properties he declined to identify.

HEADLINE: UAL Posts Big Deficit In Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The UAL Corporation, the parent company of United Airlines, today reported a fourth-quarter loss of $123.5 million and a record quarterly operating loss of $296.6 million.
"The alarming increase in the price of fuel and a significant softening in the economy took its toll," said Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman. 
 United is one of the nation's strongest airlines, but like the rest of the industry, it was hit hard late last year by high fuel costs brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis, just as the economy was slipping into a recession.
The year-ago fourth-quarter had earnings of $6.8 million, or 31 cents a share, UAL said.
For the full year, UAL reported net earnings of $94.5 million, or $4.33 a share, down 70.9 percent, compared to net earnings of $324.2 million, or $14.96 a share, for 1989. The company reported an operating loss of $36.3 million in 1990, compared to an operating profit of $464.5 million in 1989.
Revenues in the 1990 fourth quarter were $2.8 billion, up from $2.37 billion for the same 1989 period. The fourth quarter's results included a one-time gain of $68.1 million in sales of property, including nine airplanes.
Annual revenues were $11.04 billion in 1990, up from $9.79 billion in 1989.
Sara Dornacker, United spokeswoman, said the fourth-quarter loss exceeded a previous record loss of $192 million in the second quarter of 1985, which came just after the carrier's pilots began a strike.
During 1990, the entire airline industry posted record losses, largely because of the high cost of jet fuel.
"For United, the average price per gallon of jet fuel in the fourth quarter rose to $1.12, versus 69.5 cents and 52.3 cents in the same quarters of 1989 and 1988 respectively," Mr. Wolf said in the statement.
On the New York Stock Exchange today, UAL's shares slipped 62.5 cents, to $128.75.

HEADLINE: CUOMO PROPOSING STEEP BUDGET CUTS AND TAX INCREASES

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 31

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today proposed the largest package of spending cuts in New York State's history and a third consecutive year of sharp increases in taxes and fees.
Trying to fill a $6 billion hole in the budget for the next fiscal year, the Governor proposed slashing 10 percent -- or nearly $1 billion -- from aid to local school districts and halving the unrestricted aid the state shares with local governments. He also proposed abolishing dozens of state agencies and commissions and eliminating up to 18,000 jobs -- roughly a tenth of the state work force. 
 In Massachusetts and Rhode Island, two other states hit hard by the economic decline, new Governors presented their first budgets, taking painful steps they said would eliminate large projected deficits. [Page A12.]
 
Bad News for New York City
 For New York City, struggling with severe fiscal problems of its own, Mr. Cuomo's plan appears to offer not relief but even greater burdens. Over all, Cuomo administration officials projected, the city would lose about $400 million in state aid. It would absorb other cuts, including ones in Medicaid.
"These proposals will cripple our ability to provide even the most basic of services," Mayor David N. Dinkins said at a news conference.
City and state officials said they have been negotiating over how to offset some of the cuts, perhaps with funds from state authorities, including the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which issues bonds for the city and watches over its finances. But those talks have not yet produced an agreement, they said.
 
'Fiscal Anorexia'
 Seeking to prevent what he termed the "fiscal anorexia" that would result if he closed the gap through spending cuts alone, Mr. Cuomo proposed new taxes on gasoline, interstate telephone calls, tires, and other goods and services, and suggested deferring income-tax reductions again, which he said would save the state about $400 million.
He also called for a $500 tuition increase at the state's public universities. That would come on top of last month's increases of $200 to $300 and result in tuition increases of more than 50 percent at both the City University and State University of New York.
The Governor's $29.15 billion state spending plan drew cries of protest from educators, health officials and advocates for the poor. It also provoked a sharp rebuke from the state's Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, who took issue with a recent comment by the Governor that his budget would generate "a lot of complaining and a lot of screaming," but would leave the state's basic strength intact.
"What you recommend will not leave this state strong -- it will leave it weakened and vulnerable in a very fundamental way," said Judge Wachtler, who presides over a judiciary that would take a cut of 10 percent.
Of the 18,000 jobs, up to 7,500 will be eliminated through layoffs, and the rest through attrition. Mr. Cuomo's proposal did not spell out which jobs would be lost, but indicated that prisons and mental health services would be the hardest hit.
Some Republicans, including the powerful Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, suggested that Mr. Cuomo ought to have proposed greater cuts in welfare programs.
Mr. Marino, of Oyster Bay, L.I., said he found it "troubling" that Mr. Cuomo had sought to "balance his budget on the backs of property tax-payers by making schools and local governments bear most of the cost."
In addition to the cuts and the new taxes, Mr. Cuomo's budget includes hundreds of other measures intended to close the $6 billion gap.
Among them is revision of the state law that requires prison sentences for all second-time felony offenders. Mr. Cuomo said that non-violent criminals should be eligible for alternatives less expensive than imprisonment.
Also, in contrast to New York City, Mr. Cuomo's budget includes no money for any wage increases.
 
Pistols and Nuclear Plants
 "I'm not going to lay off 7,500 people and then turn around and let everybody else get raises," Mr. Cuomo said. Public-employee unions denounced him for using both layoffs and salary freezes.
The new and higher state fees would cover a wide range of people, including pistol owners, drunken drivers, pesticide manufacturers and the operators of nuclear power plants.
While the Governor's austere approach to the budget drew immediate denunciations from many quarters, some who have frequently criticized his fiscal management said he had steered the right course today.
"The spending cuts are extremely painful and unfortunate, but from a fiscal perspective the Governor's approach is responsible," said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission.
The budget offered by the Governor today set off what has become a perennial ritual in Albany when he and lawmakers quarreled over just how large it was, and whether it represented any increase from the current year's plan.
Whatever number was used, there was wide agreement that the state Legislature would come under enormous pressure to restore at least some of the cuts sought by Mr. Cuomo.
But the Governor, constantly portraying himself as a fiscal pessimist during a nearly three-hour briefing on the budget today, warned that the state could not "wish away" cuts by increasing revenue estimates and thereby spending more. For the last three years, revenue projections sanctioned by both Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature turned out to be too high, and the state has wound up borrowing money to close the deficits.
If similar manipulations are not used to allow more spending in this budget, it may leave the lawmakers with a less palatable alternative: even higher taxes than Mr. Cuomo proposed.
Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, said the state would have to ask itself to "unclog the arteries without removing the heart of government."
Meanwhile, even some of Mr. Cuomo's harshest critics seemed to agree that there was no painless way to rescue the state from fiscal distress.
"We know the days of wine and roses are long gone," said the Republican leader of the Assembly, C. D. Rappleyea, of Chenango County. "Now we must act decisively on this budget to stop New York from entering the days of bread and water."

HEADLINE: The 22% Rise in Postal Costs Upsets Magazine Publishers

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Already suffering from a pervasive advertising recession, magazine publishers are now facing the more formidable problem of a 22 percent increase in second-class mail, which will go into effect Sunday.
"Coupled with the 18 percent increase that we had in 1988, our costs have gone up 40 percent in a three-year period," said D. Claeys Bahrenburg, the president and chief executive of Hearst Magazines, which publishes Good Housekeeping and Cosmopolitan. "We are basically appalled by it." 
 The increases have driven publishers to look for ways to defray or avoid the postal increases. In doing so, they are increasingly turning to private alternative delivery methods and banding with other publishers to ship magazines and share the mailing costs. Some even accelerated subscription mailings in the latter part of last year to beat the higher rates.
Thomas O. Ryder, the president of American Express Publishing, which publishes Travel & Leisure and Food & Wine magazines, called the increases a "gigantic hit, a shock to the system."
"The kind of cost increases that we are getting from the Postal Service are simply not sustainable," Mr. Ryder said. "Either we have to find an alternative to the Postal Service, they have to change their cost structure or we are going to close down our business."
Second-class mail includes magazines and newspapers. Hitting magazine publishers with almost as hard as the second-class increase is the 25 percent rise in third-class mail rates. Magazines use third-class mail, commonly known as junk mail, to solicit subscriptions and to conduct direct-mail tests before starting magazines. This category makes up 42 percent of the United States Postal Service's volume.
The new rates include a 4-cent rise in the price of a first-class stamp, to 29 cents. Initially, a 5-cent increase had been considered.
The rate increases follow 10 months of hearings by the Postal Rate Commission, the group that regulates postal rates and classifications while the Postal Service manages the system. The new rates have been anticipated since Jan. 4, when the commission unanimously recommended that they be put into effect. On Jan. 22 the Postal Service's board of governors gave approval "under protest" for the rates to go into effect Sunday at 12:01 A.M.
" 'Under protest' means that we aren't certain that the rates as recommended by the Postal Rate Commission are going to cover our costs," said Art Shealey, a spokesman for the Postal Service.
 
'Really Crazy' Move
 To magazine executives, the phrase simply means another probable increase next year.
"What was done with the 29-cent stamp is really crazy on its impact on other classes," said Reginald K. Brack Jr., the president of the Time Inc. Magazine Company, which publishes People and Sports Illustrated, along with Time and other magazines. "It put yet more burden on second and third class."
Some magazines are hit harder than others by the postal increase because their costs are based on differing factors like the discounts for presorting them by ZIP codes and the ratio of advertising to articles.
Mr. Brack, who is also the chairman of the Magazine Publishers of America, the industry's chief lobbying group, said the rate increases would bring the total postal costs for his parent company, Time Warner Inc., to almost $400 million a year, an increase of about 20 percent over current mailing costs.
 
Impact on a Small Magazine
 Jeffrey Dearth, the president of the New Republic, an opinion magazine with a relatively small circulation, said its costs would rise 25 percent.
"We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars just to stand still," he said. "They are making it hard for us to stay in business."
Magazine publishers, as well as newspaper publishers, have been using more alternate private delivery services to circumvent the Postal Service.
Phillip Miller, president of Alternate Postal Delivery, and his partner, Stan Henry, drew up a business plan last year that foresaw expansion to 95 markets in five years. He said, however, that new clients were joining Alternate Postal Delivery, which is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., at such a rate that he thought the goal would be reached in four years.
Mr. Miller estimated that publishers could save an average of 15 to 18 percent in the costs of delivering their magazines.
"We probably have increased our interest in alternate delivery testing, but the jury will be out for several years at least," said William T. Kerr, president of The New York Times Magazine Group, which publishes Family Circle, McCall's, Golf Digest and other magazines.
 
'Cavalier Approach' Assailed
 The increase for third class, or junk mail, is also being greeted with outrage because publishers say this category is the engine that drives mail volume -- and revenue -- for the Postal Service.
When the new postal rates were announced, Robert Setrakian, the outgoing chairman of the Postal Service's board of governors, issued a dissent. He said that he was "incensed by the cavalier approach" of the Postal Rate Commission to third-class mail and that the commission was "attempting to kill off a whole industry, the third-class mail industry, by an exorbitant rate increase."
The publishers are also indignant over the Postal Service's refusal to give them a discount for stacking thousands of magazines on a board or pallet, somewhat like bales of hay, and placing them on trucks. This saves postal workers the job of lifting heavy sacks of mail filled with magazines, untying them and sorting through the magazines.
In 1985, the Postal Service asked publishers to use this process to stack magazines and promised them a discount. But earlier this month, the Postal Service's board of governors rejected the discount because it applied only to second-class mail and not to third-class mail. Since the current technology is not feasible for third-class mail, the discount was deferred.
Many magazine publishers who had made substantial capital investments in the stacking process felt they had been double-crossed. In the past, the Postal Service had given discounts to mailers who made the post office's work easier.

HEADLINE: Bleak Forecasts For the F.D.I.C. Are Challenged

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, today flatly contradicted forecasts that the bank insurance fund he manages would be insolvent within two years.
On the defensive against a growing chorus of criticism on Capitol Hill and mounting concern among Administration officials, Mr. Seidman disputed suggestions that a taxpayer bailout would be required to keep the fund that protects bank deposits afloat. 
 The bank insurance fund would be "weak but solvent" under the "most widely held view on expected economic conditions," Mr. Seidman said at a news conference this morning. "There is no crisis here. What we have is sufficient to handle what we foresee now."
 
Prediction Is Hedged
 But Mr. Seidman, who has been highly regarded in Congress both for his skill as a banking regulator and his candor about the size of the savings industry crisis, did hedge his prediction, saying that if the recession lasted longer than a year, a prospect he called unlikely, then the bank insurance fund might be insolvent by the end of the year.
As chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the agency that insures accounts up to $100,000 in the nation's 12,399 banks, he is also chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the body created by Congress in August 1989 to oversee the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
Within the last few days, the White House's Office of Management and Budget has predicted that the F.D.I.C.'s bank insurance fund, which now has a balance of about $8.5 billion, will have a deficit by 1992. And the Congressional Budget Office has predicted a deficit can develop by the end of this year, even if the recession is mild and recovery begins by summer.
If the fund does show a deficit at any point, depositors of up to $100,000 will continue to be protected fully in the event their bank collapses, but they may have to be paid from taxpayer funds.
Mr. Seidman also acknowledged, as he has before, that the fund, which is supported by premiums from member banks, would likely need some additional short-term funds for what he called liquidity purposes. While in the past he has not provided a precise figure on how much would be needed, he said today that at a minimum, the F.D.I.C. would need an additional $10 billion over two years.
He said the $10 billion could be borrowed from the Treasury Department, with the interest on such a loan paid through an increase in the bank premiums. The funds could also come from some form of increased contributions by the industry, he said.
 
Bigger Industry Contribution
 The forecasts by the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional Budget Office on the health of the bank fund were based on historical trends in the industry, and each assumed a specific increase in the size of the industry's contributions to the fund.
Mr. Seidman said that unlike those agencies, the F.D.I.C. based its conclusions on information provided by bank examiners. He said his short-term forecasts, using this method, had been highly reliable. He conceded that if the recession was more severe than currently expected and lasted for more than a year, then the fund would be insolvent by the end of this year.
Some members of Congress have criticized him this year for his frequent downward revisions of those forecasts. And the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., said earlier this week he was concerned that even the gloomier projections by the Congressional Budget Office might be understating the problem.
 
Count of Expected Failures
 Mr. Seidman predicted that if the recession is mild and lasts only six months, as he and many economists expect, then 180 banks with assets of $65 billion would fail this year and 160 banks with assets of $30 billion would collapse in 1992.
These failures would bring the bank insurance fund down to $3.9 billion by the end of this year and $2.4 billion in 1992.
If the recession is more severe, he said, then 230 banks with assets of $90 billion could fail this year and 210 banks with assets of $70 billion could require assistance in 1992. If that occurs, then the fund will be insolvent by the end of this year, he said, and be in the red next year by $5.8 billion.
 
Drain on the Fund So Far
 By comparison, the preliminary figures for 1990 show that 169 banks with $16.3 billion failed, costing the fund $4.7 billion.
The F.D.I.C. presented its latest forecasts minutes before a group of bankers from five banking associations met in Washington with senior Treasury officials and regulators to explore ways to reorganize the fund.
The group included Mr. Seidman; Treasury Under Secretary Robert R. Glauber; Thomas G. Labrecque, chairman and chief executive of Chase Manhattan Bank, and Walter V. Shipley, chairman of Chemical Bank. Administration officials have said they are prepared to go along with an industry solution to the fund's problems, provided it is a long-term solution and does not rely on taxpayers.
 
No Specific Plan
 The bankers emerged from the meeting late this afternoon without a specific plan, although participants at the meeting said the bankers and officials agreed that a private sector solution could be reached to bolster the fund. They also agreed to additional meetings in February.
No plan to reorganize the fund is expected before next week, when the Treasury Department has said it may present its report on overhauling the banking industry.
"This isn't something that has to be done today or tomorrow to prevent a calamity," Mr. Seidman said before the meeting. "But clearly something should be done by midyear."
The plans being considered involve either some form of lending by the banks to the fund, or increased contributions to the fund that would be offset by an ownership interest taken by the banks.
 
One Idea Lapses
 One idea now considered dead is a suggestion made in December by Mr. Seidman that the fund be financed through a onetime assessment on the industry of 1 percent of its deposits, a move he had said could raise $25 billion. Banking groups in Washington strongly opposed the suggestion, saying their members could not afford to pay it without leading to many more failures, and today Mr. Seidman dropped the idea.
The F.D.I.C. has the authority to borrow $5 billion from the Treasury. In addition, it may also borrow money based on a formula that relies on the net worth of the fund. Under the formula, and based on the present condition of the fund, the F.D.I.C. can now borrow $65 billion.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: The Bombers
SAUDIS RECAPTURE GHOST TOWN; ALLIES BOMB NEW IRAQI COLUMN;
NEW BASES FOR U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
To increase the number of B-52 bombing raids against Iraqi ground forces, the United States has been secretly basing some of the bombers in Spain and has obtained permission to use a British airfield as well, Western officials said today.
The use of the base in Spain, which was disclosed by Administration officials, has been considered politically delicate because the Spanish Government, under public pressure, has been trying in recent years to reduce the presence of American forces. In addition, Spain pays close attention to Arab sentiment, particularly in the Muslim countries of North Africa, American analysts said. 
 The British Defense Secretary, Tom King, announced the agreement to base B-52's in Britain. In an operation that recalled long-distance bombing missions against North Vietnamese targets from Guam two decades ago, over about the same distance, the United States will reactivate a B-52 base at Fairford in Gloucestershire, Mr. King told the House of Commons today.
 
Expanded Use of B-52's
 In another unpublicized example of cooperation by Western European nations with the American war effort against Iraq, Germany has provided German-made shells for American M1-A1 tanks in Saudi Arabia as well as artillery shells for British forces there, Pentagon officials said. Germany's public contribution to the war effort, which has drawn large protest marches in Germany, has consisted primarily of economic assistance, some military equipment and the deployment of 18 Alpha jet fighters to Turkey as part of a NATO force to defend that nation.
Access to the European airfields allows the United States to expand the use of the giant bombers by providing additional bases for fueling, arming and maintaining the planes, which before the start of the war were permanently based only in North America and Guam.
In the days before the war started, some B-52's were flown to Diego Garcia, an Indian Ocean island about 3,000 miles south of the Persian Gulf. Since combat began on Jan. 17, B-52 attacks have been launched from Diego Garcia and Spain, and an airfield in the western part of Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon has refused to disclose the precise number of B-52's being used in the war, but an American official who declined to be identified estimated that more than 50 of the planes would be part of the American arsenal. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, said that on Wednesday, 28 B-52's dropped 470 tons of explosives on Iraqi ground forces in southern Iraq and Kuwait.
Mr. King explained the American request by saying "it was necessary to increase the capacity," but did not say how many of the conventionally armed planes would be based at Fairford, which is not now being used by the Royal Air Force.
Officials in London said that other countries had agreed to provide support for B-52's, but declined to identify them, saying they would leave it to them to make their own announcements. Spain has sought to keep the basing of the B-52 bombers secret. But it has given limited support for the American military operation, such as allowing Washington bases for refueling stops and dispatching several ships to the Persian Gulf region.
The B-52 has been one of the most formidable weapons in the Air Force and has been used to launch punishing raids against Iraqi forces. Pentagon officials said the B-52s carrying conventional bombs were at first based only in Diego Garcia, where they were dispatched after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
But because the United States wanted to increased the number of bombers that could be used to attack Iraqi forces and because there is limited room at Diego Garcia for basing the planes, the United States has sought to expand the network of B-52 bases.
 
Egypt Declined to Base Bombers
 One reason the American military may have been forced to seek bases in Europe is that Egypt has opposed the stationing of the bombers on its territory. Saudi Arabia also showed an early reluctance to base the bombers, a senior military official said.
The hesitation of both countries might stem from the image of the B-52 as a weapon of indiscriminate bombing associated with its use in carpet-bombing North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, a reputation that the Air Force considers inaccurate and unfair. The B-52 is also associated by some with nuclear weapons. Although the planes being used against Iraq carry only conventional explosives, the bulk of the B-52 force based in the United States is armed with nuclear weapons to deter a once-feared Soviet nuclear attack.
In announcing Britain's decision to allow the stationing of B-52's on its soil, Mr. King emphasized that London had received "an absolute assurance that they will only use conventional munitions operating from that base."
Germany, which has been criticized by some lawmakers for not providing enough assistance, announced recently that it would provide an additional $5.5 billion. But some of Germany's contributions to the American and allied war effort have not been publicly discussed by German officials, who have been worried about criticism at home.
 
German Shells for U.S. Tanks
 A Pentagon official said the United States Army had quietly obtained 120-millimeter artillery shells from Germany for use in American M1-A1 tanks in Saudi Arabia. Germany made the shells for use in its Leopard tank.
The United States wants to have 60 days' worth of ammunition and other supplies on hand for its war with Iraq, and 25,000 of the German shells have been provided, according to a military expert, who suggested the the shells were being donated to the United States.
Germany is also said to have provided 155-millimeter artillery shells and Tornado spare parts to British forces there.
A Pentagon official also said Germany had been able to provide useful intelligence to the United States about the Soviet-made equipment in Iraq's arsenal. That is because the Government of the newly reunified Germany has obtained Soviet equipment made for the former East Germany military.
Prime Minister John Major's decision to let the B-52's operate from British soil is reminiscent of the agreement of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, to permit American FB-111 planes based in Britain to attack targets in Libya in 1986, to retaliate for a terrorist bombing in Berlin in 1986.

HEADLINE: Freed Rapist Seized in 5 Rapes

 BODY:
A man who was paroled four months ago after serving 10 years for rape and robbery has been arrested and charged with raping a 12-year-old girl and four women in a Bronx housing project, the housing police said yesterday.
They said the first attack occurred in October, shortly after the man was released from prison. The victims, who ranged from 12 to 71 years of age, lived at Patterson Houses on Morris Avenue at 143d Street in the South Bronx.
Detectives said the man, Larry Jones, 30, of 42 East 126th Street in East Harlem, approached his victims in the afternoons. He would strike up a conversation inside the building and either talk or force his way inside their apartments, the detectives said. Once inside, he threatened them with a knife, forced them into a bedroom and raped and sodomized them.
In two instances, he is said to have tied up his victims. He would also rob them of money and jewelry, said Chief Vincent Pizzo of the Housing Authority Police.
Mr. Jones, who is unemployed, was arrested by housing detectives Wednesday evening as he was walking at 140th Street and Morris Avenue, Chief Pizzo said. He was wearing a bracelet belonging to one of the victims and did not put up a struggle, detectives said.
The detectives said they had traced him from descriptions supplied by the victims and his record as a rapist. All five victims have identified him in police line-ups, the detectives said.
Mr. Jones was arrested in the Bronx in 1980 and convicted of rape, sodomy and robbery, Chief Pizzo said. He was paroled in September. He has been charged with rape, sodomy and robbery again, Chief Pizzo said.

HEADLINE: If Times Are Tough, It's A Job For The Funnies!

BYLINE: By STEVEN HELLER

 BODY:
IF you missed the "High and Low" show at the Museum of Modern Art, there is still time to catch Hi and Lois at the World Financial Center. These well-known comic marrieds are just 2 of more than 100 characters appearing in almost 50 original drawings and vintage printed pages representing some of America's greatest newspaper comic strips from 1896 to the present. They are on loan through Feb. 15 from the Museum of Cartoon Art in Rye, N.Y.
At first, the World Financial Center might seem an unlikely place for an exhibition of comic strips. But traditionally, in good times and bad -- bad, especially, like right now, in the widespread recession -- America's most popular native form of graphic humor has functioned as a kind of unrecognized economic indicator, reflecting, specifically, how much the nation needs a laugh. Remember how popular the funny pages were during the Great Depression, when they and their offshoots on the radio and in the movies helped keep people's spirits up. And then, of course, there was the celebrated newspaper strike in which the children of New York were suffering such miseries of comic-strip deprivation that Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia stepped in and read the funnies on his weekly radio show. 
 In recent years, the classic newspaper comics, acknowledged by historians as an indigenous American popular art form, have been included in exhibitions at the Modern, the Whitney Museum of American Art and other citadels of high art, and they have been the subjects of scholarly papers and books. Though "The Masters of Cartoon Art" is hardly a definitive exhibition -- it includes only some comic strips and no single-panel cartoonists -- it is nevertheless a worthwhile assortment of some superbly drawn original artwork and rare printed pages.
Displayed in chronological order are works representing the comics' nascent period, the late 1890's, through its golden age during the 1930's to the present. The range: from humor, to myth, to adventure, to suspense, to the wonderfully absurd.
 
Beginnings Amid Rivalry
 The newspaper comic strip was born in New York City. Its format -- a sequence of panels with speech in balloons -- evolved from the humorous single and serial drawings published in the early New York satiric weeklies, Puck and Judge, which between the 1870's and late 1890's served as a proving ground for many comic-strip pioneers.
The comics developed just before the turn of the century as a result of the intense rivalry between two competing newspaper czars, Joseph Pulitzer (owner of The New York World) and William Randolph Hearst (who had bought the failing New York Morning Journal). The first strips were an accidental offspring of both commerce and technology. Pulitzer believed he could increase circulation by publishing a Sunday color supplement. One of the earliest published features in his supplement was Richard Outcault's "Down Hogan's Alley," a tableau (not yet a strip) reporting on the fictional goings-on of the not-so-savory denizens of a New York slum, which featured as its signature character a bald, funny-looking imp who wore a nightshirt, named Mickey Dugan.
In 1896, Pulitzer decided to conduct an experiment with the strip by adding yellow, a color that had only recently been perfected on the press, to Dugan's night shirt. From this humble beginning was born "The Yellow Kid," which a year later moved in a different form to Hearst's New York Journal to become not only the first real comic strip in America, but also the basis for the term "yellow journalism" applied to Hearst's brand of muckraking.
New comics were developed to garner circulation, yet out of this commercial imperative came a remarkable diversity of styles and stories. Among the most successful were Rudolph Dirks's "Katzenjammer Kids," James Swinnerton's "Little Tiger," Bud Fisher's "Mr. A. Mutt" and Fredric Burr Opper's brilliant adventures of a sad clown, "Happy Holligan," prefiguring Emmett Kelly's woeful circus persona. The comics quickly took over a significant role in a growing American mass culture. The language in some of the most popular strips became part of the American vernacular.
 
Introducing 'Buster Brown'
 "Masters of Cartoon Art" offers visitors a chance to see many of these rare comics, including the first "Yellow Kid" in page form, and next to it an original drawing of a "Buster Brown" strip, also by Outcault. Though esthetically inferior to "The Yellow Kid," "Buster Brown" was decidedly more successful as an advertising and marketing tool because the public became fascinated with Buster's clothing.
Also on view is a printed page of "Little Nemo in Slumberland," by the prodigious Winsor McCay, whose adventures of a little boy experiencing the most phantasmagoric dreams (only to wake up breathless at the end of each strip) pushed the limits of content and design in the comic strip. Panels were elongated and compressed, depending on the flow of the surrealistic dream sequences. Unfortunately, another pioneer, George Herriman, is represented only by a lesser, later work from 1941. Mr. Herriman, whose minimalist drawings prefigured modernist tendencies, created "Krazy Kat and Ignatz" in 1911.
While "Masters of Cartoon Art" has one example each of most major newspaper strips (yes, "Dick Tracy," "Prince Valiant," "Beetle Bailey," "Dennis the Menace" and "Doonesbury" are there, too), it does have a few frustrating omissions. There is, for instance, no Lyonel Feininger, the Bauhaus master whose 1906 "Kin-der-Kids" and "Wee Winnie Winkie's World" were masterpieces of draftsmanship and storytelling. Nor is there an example by Jules Feiffer, who, more than 30 years ago, dismantled the traditional comic strip by eliminating balloons and panels, and added a psychological perspective ignored in comics created before him.
There is, however, one pleasant surprise in the form of Bill Griffith's "Zippy," a strip that began as "underground comix" in the 1970's and has earned a cult status in the mainstream press.
"Masters of Cartoon Art" is not the didactic or even critical history of newspaper comics that the subject ultimately deserves, but seeing this sampling of memorable and forgotten strips does whet the appetite for more.
 
When and Where
 "The Masters of Cartoon Art," an exhibition on the history of comic strips from the late 1800's to the present, will be on view through Feb. 15 at the World Financial Center, Courtyard Gallery, the Hudson River and West Street, between Vesey and Liberty Streets, in Manhattan. Hours are noon to 7 P.M. weekdays and noon to 6 P.M. weekends. Free admission. Information: (212) 945-0505.

HEADLINE: Revitalized Millrose Games Seek to Rescue Sport's Image

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
A candy bar, of all things, is now the title sponsor of North America's most prestigious indoor track and field meet.
While that makes for quite a mouthful, the Snickers Millrose Games, the infusion of new energy and interest for their 84th running tonight in Madison Square Garden can only help so much as track and field struggles to return to a more healthy state. 
 The sport's decline is the hardest issue to avoid whenever American athletes gather for a competition, as an impressive array of them have for this one. So few of the indoor meets on the North American Grand Prix circuit retain a semblance of prestige. This year alone, 2 of the 12 meets were canceled, and the principal attraction in two others was the return of Ben Johnson, the sport's most celebrated cheater. Through yesterday, Millrose organizers still had tickets to sell.
 
A Call for More Heroes
 "We need more heroes and heroines," Howard Schmertz, the meet director, said yesterday, ruing some of the problems of the recent past -- athletes using drugs, a slumping economy and poor marketing -- that have dulled the attractiveness of the sport.
Other factors have hurt the sport, as well, like warming political relations, which have removed the drama of East-West showdowns; the reluctance of top athletes to race against each other, and increasing demands of athletes for higher appearance fees.
"We've had a lot of negative press the last few years, and I know there isn't as much interest now as there was in years past," Schmertz said. "But I think the sport will come back. Next year is an Olympic year, and that always means renewed interest. I think we can be healthy again."
 
Some Good Competition
 Tonight's meet could be a step in the right direction. With more foreign athletes than ever before and many of the better Americans, there are enough quality athletes in most events for good competition. Records are less likely. It's still early in the season, with most American athletes hoping to peak three weeks from now in the national indoor championships, the qualifying meet for the world indoor championships March 8-10 in Seville, Spain.
Among the foreigners competing are several from the Soviet Union, Cuba and what was once East Germany. Notable among them are Tatyana Samolenko of the Soviet Union, the world and Olympic champion at 1,500 meters and 3,000 meters who is running in the mile; Javier Sotomayor of Cuba, the world indoor and outdoor high jump record-holder; Christine Wachtel of Germany, the indoor world-record holder and Olympic silver medalist at 800 meters; and her teammate Thomas Schoenlebe, the world champion at 400 meters and the indoor world-record holder.
Samolenko may find most difficulty winning. Her race is virtually without a weak entry in a field that is strong and crowded with 10 runners. The others include Doina Melinte of Romania, the indoor world-recordholder; the two leading Americans, PattiSue Plumer and Suzy Favor; another impressive Soviet runner, Svetlana Kitova, and Yvonne Mai of Germany.
The men's 60-meter dash is equally unpredictable, with Lee McRae, the indoor world-record holder; two sprinters who have defeated Johnson over 55 meters this season, Daron Council and Andre Cason, and Cuba's best, Andres Simon.

HEADLINE: Auctions

BYLINE: By Rita Reif

The Wrists Have It
While Grandpa's pocket watch may still find its way to the auction house today, wristwatches have been dominating sales of timepieces in recent years. "Wristwatches eclipsed the sales of pocket watches in our auctions about 1984," said Daryn Schnipper, who heads the sales of timepieces at Sotheby's in New York. "In 1980, wristwatches represented about 1 percent of our sales. Today they account for 75 percent of our watch sales."
The popularity of all types of watches will be tested again next Friday at 10:15 A.M. and 2 P.M. in New York at Sotheby's first sale this year of watches and clocks. Ms. Schnipper said there was no indication of trouble in sales of watches last year. On the contrary, she said, many people claim watches fare well during recessions and in wartime "because they have intrinsic value and are small and portable." Last year, when the weakened economy resulted in lower prices and higher numbers of unsold offerings at auctions in other fields, Ms. Schnipper said, watches continued to sell for strong prices.
Usually, she said, watch sales attract bids from collectors and dealers in Europe, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States. Sotheby's estimates that next week's sale will bring $3.8 million to $4.5 million, about the same as its October auction, which totaled $4.4 million. 
 The most important watches in Sotheby's sale are by several of the most prestigious makers: Vacheron & Constantin, Patek Philippe, and Cartier. The offering with the highest presale estimate -- a Vacheron platinum wristwatch with diamond embellishments from 1955 -- is estimated to sell for $300,000 to $350,000. A round gold Cartier wristwatch from 1925 is expected to bring $125,000 to $150,000.
"Wristwatches -- Pateks, Rolexes, Cartiers -- are a form of male jewelry," Ms. Schnipper said. "Collecting has definitely changed in this field. The pocket-watch market did not recover until about two years ago, and then only on the most important pocket watches."
William Scolnik, a pocket-watch expert and consultant of Hawthorne, N.J., refuses to think of watches as fashion, and therefore continues to focus mostly on pocket watches, he said.
"Wristwatches have become very important in the business," Mr. Scolnik said. "They are bought and sold not because of technical precision but for the styling."
 
12-City Tour Planned
 What may be the most ambitious promotion ever devised for a watch auction is now under way to publicize the sale by Habsburg of Geneva of 204 Breguet timepieces on April 14. Describing the Geneva sale as "the most important horological sale in recent times," Habsburg is exhibiting in 12 cities the watches it estimates will sell for $11 million to $13 million. The tour, which began on Jan. 17 in Paris, is currently in Munich. After a viewing next week in London, the Breguets are to be flown to New York, to be shown from Feb. 12 to 16 at Tiffany & Company. The exhibition is also to visit Los Angeles, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore, Doha in Qatar, Zurich and Geneva.
The most important of the Breguet offerings is a new gold wristwatch that doubles as a pocket watch and is automatically wound and set to the exact time when placed inside its master clock. The device to wind and reset the watch, developed 200 years ago by Abraham Louis Breguet, was employed in about 25 pocket watches. Completed three weeks ago at Breguet's workshops in Le Brassus, Switzerland, this is the first wristwatch incorporating the feature. Habsburg estimates it will sell for $680,000 to $850,000.
Breguet timepieces in the auction date from 1780 and include Breguet's first carriage clock from 1796, which Napoleon bought in 1798 and used as a traveling clock. "He took it with him to the Egyptian campaign," said Geza von Habsburg, chairman of the auction house, by telephone this week from Geneva. The presale estimate is $320,000 to $396,000.
Technically sophisticated pocket watches and wristwatches continued to bring high, even record prices, in auctions held during the last two years. The highest figure realized for any auctioned timepiece -- $2.97 million -- was paid in April 1989 at a sale in Geneva of a new watch by Patek Philippe: called the "Calibre '89," it tells what time it is in detail, giving the second, minute, hour, month, year, decade and century. The syndicate that bought the watch was not identified.
Organized by Habsburg, Feldman -- the name of the auction house changed when a co-founder, David Feldman, left last year -- the sale also comprised watches by one manufacturer, Patek Philippe. The watches in that sale, described then as the most valuable watch sale ever, were also widely exhibited, including at Tiffany's in New York. The total paid in the sale of 301 Patek Philippe timepieces was $15.2 million, a record for a watch sale.
Prices for Patek Philippe watches have held firm since that sale, and one watch brought a record price in an auction at Sotheby's in New York in October. At that sale, a massive gold 1920 pocket watch, equipped with bells, an alarm, minute repeater, split-second chronograph and perpetual calendar, brought $660,000, the highest price ever paid for a watch sold at auction in the United States. The buyer was the Patek Philippe Museum of Geneva.
 
A Table Sets a Record
 Last Saturday, Peter G. Terian, president of Rally Motors of Roslyn, L.I., bought a marble-topped, partly gilded Classical Revival pier table from 1815 for $704,000 at Christie's in New York. The price was a record for American 19th-century furniture, eclipsing the $594,000 Stuart P. Feld of Hirschl & Adler Galleries paid for its mate in a sale at Sotheby's in New York two years ago.
Both tables were made by Charles Honore Lannuier, and both were found in Europe in the collections of ancestors of the original New York owner.
"They are two of the finest pieces of Neo-Classical furniture in existence," Mr. Terian said. When his table is delivered to his apartment at the Dakota in Manhattan, it will be placed among other American classics in the Chippendale and Classical Revival styles, including four other pieces of furniture by Lannuier.
Two other records were rewritten last Saturday in Christie's Americana sale: a set of two gold-inlaid Colt revolvers from 1853 brought $352,000, a record at auction for an offering of American guns. An 1866 lithograph, "The American National Game of Baseball," was sold for $44,000, the highest price ever for a Currier & Ives print.
 SOTHEBY'S, York Avenue at 72d Street in Manhattan, (212) 606-7245. Viewing hours for watches: 1 to 5 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday; 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Monday to Wednesday; 10 A.M. to 3 P.M. Thursday.

HEADLINE: Hard Times, Faced Squarely

 BODY:
Gov. Mario Cuomo always says his budgets are lean, but this year he's done more than say it. Faced with a deficit that could reach $6 billion, and an economy that has yet to hit bottom, he has put together a tough-minded spending plan. However painful, it could help New York through its worst economic trauma in decades, and in the process give Mr. Cuomo's national image a harder edge.
The $29 billion budget proposal calls for $4.5 billion in cuts and $1.5 billion in taxes and other revenues, and imposes a pay freeze on the state work force. It's too soon to say whether the Governor's plan will, as he contends, preserve New York's "mission" to help those most in need. It could prove so harsh that the Legislature would instead seek higher taxes to fulfill that mission. 
 But this much is clear: In a state with no money, the Cuomo budget is a responsible starting point, and a most welcome departure from the bloated spending and grandiose rhetoric of the past.
Washington's dwindling support for cities and states, and the weakened economy, bear most of the responsibility for New York's fiscal problems. The Governor and lawmakers did their share too, spending lavishly in good times.
Those days are over, as the Governor's budget starkly demonstrates. Its reductions are dramatic and deep. They include significant cuts in Medicaid, a 10 percent reduction in school aid, a deferral of a scheduled cut in personal income taxes, a 10-cent-a-gallon gas tax increase, the elimination of 18,000 state jobs and a 50 percent cut in revenue sharing.
After suggesting but then quickly withdrawing an unpopular proposal for a higher gas tax last year, the Governor now seems ready to fight for it. Compared with earlier years, there are far fewer one-shot revenue gimmicks. There's also a commitment to continuing the budget reforms enacted last spring, and a willingness to take heat from the state unions by insisting on a wage freeze.
Even as he proposed cuts, the Governor tried to preserve programs important to the poor -- including nutritional programs for babies, children and pregnant women. He has also asked the Legislature once again to help local governments save money by releasing them from costly and unduly restrictive mandates, like those governing the size and makeup of special education classes.
Still, Mayor David Dinkins of New York City and other elected officials are already complaining about the harshness of the proposed budget. Mr. Dinkins argues that despite the Governor's pledge to help the city as much as he can, the proposed cut of $400 million in direct state aid, on top of other reductions, would be crippling.
The cuts are harsh, and they are radical. What the next few months of budget negotiations will resolve is whether, in this weak economic climate, there is a better choice.

HEADLINE: Trials -- and Error -- in China

 BODY:
Nei jin, wai song, says China's Communist leadership, meaning that its policy of fierce domestic political repression can coexist with harmonious relations with the outside world. Not so is the outside world's only decent response.
Last week, Beijing convicted and sentenced eight student and intellectual leaders of the 1989 democracy movement, after trials that excluded family, journalists and independent observers. Government-appointed defense counsels readily conceded the defendants' guilt. 
 Wang Dan, one of the best-known student leaders, received a four-year prison sentence. Ren Wanding, a veteran of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement, drew seven years because of his continued intransigence.
Further political trials are expected soon, including those of Wang Juntao, editor of the reform journal Economic Studies Weekly, and Chen Zi ming, its publisher. Both risk death sentences on charges of plotting to overthrow the Government.
In 1991, flagrant abuse of human rights can no longer be treated as a purely domestic issue. International conventions require conformity with agreed minimal standards. Indeed, the laws of many democratic countries require more. And hard-headed statesmen and investors are recognizing the links between today's state violence and tomorrow's stability.
The State Department rightly expresses American outrage at China's latest imprisonment of people for "nonviolent expression of political views," and questions the fairness of the trials. It suggests that the convictions may violate the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
That's a welcome surprise. The Bush Administration recently renewed its courtship of China's leaders to avoid open Chinese opposition to its Persian Gulf policies. For Washington now to insist on upholding U.N. human rights principles, even against a permanent member of the Security Council, demonstrates the evenhandedness required for a new world order based on law.
Remarkably, Beijing seems to believe that in these trials it has gone out of its way to be lenient. Workers involved in the 1989 democracy movement were shot in the back of the head. Wei Jingsheng, a young worker who wrote articles 12 years ago insisting that political democracy was essential to economic modernization, has been held in solitary confinement ever since.
Beijing's more modulated repression this time comes after Chinese officials were shocked at the human rights criticism they continue to draw in public in the West. China's response must be considered progress of a sort, encouragement to keep up the dialogue and the criticism; Beijing's behavior falls far short of what the world expects.

HEADLINE: Calendar Tricks Won't Fix N.Y. Budget

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If New York Assembly Speaker Mel Miller wants to avoid fiscal surprises ("Albany's Budget Timing Is Way Off," Op-Ed, Jan. 5), changing the start of the fiscal year from April to July in the name of access to more complete information on tax collections is not the way to do it.
The fiscal surprises Mr. Miller professes to fear are avoided by setting realistic budgetary limits based on known revenue sources. By doing so, you avoid springing a fiscal surprise on New York's citizens in the form of more and higher taxes.
A politician as savvy as Mr. Miller knows that taxes raised to fill budget gaps are regressive, discriminatory and ultimately insufficient. Unless spending is reduced, the money hemorrhage soon soaks through the Band-Aid of a tax increase. The accurate forecasting of budgets is an admirable goal that is best achieved by containing costs, not by changing the calendar.

HEADLINE: America's Purpose in Gulf Is to Fight Evil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am a proud 14-year-old American. The last couple of weeks have turned my life into a whirlwind of confusion as I watched my country go to war for the first time in my life. Endless nights watching CNN, hours spent reading the newspaper, and lectures in school did not help me to understand exactly why our world had fallen into the pits of war. Maybe I don't know much about politics or the price of oil, but I do know how I feel inside. 
 I feel that the American population is touching only the surface of the meaning of this war. Watching protesters burn our flag confuses me. Do these people, who claim to be "moral," think that waiting until the sanctions work is a peaceful solution? Is it really maintaining peace by starving Iraqi civilians? Is it more righteous to inflict hunger on a small child than to destroy Saddam Hussein's growing military monster? Will these protesters be content when Mr. Hussein threatens the lives of millions with nuclear weapons? When Americans shout "peace," do they think about what they're saying?
Amid all the rallies and protests, the real conflict at hand is lost. It is a moral conflict of how to deal with human aggression and evil. So instead of shouting "peace" when there is no realistic way to achieve it, we should deal with humanity. Everyone should reach out to someone in need. We should relate to each other on the basis of human kindness and love.
America is not in the Persian Gulf to serve economic interests. Our brave soldiers are on the Saudi border to show that America refuses to tolerate naked aggression. If we had only stood up for our beliefs 50 years ago, millions of people would have been saved. So let's consider the more profound aspect of this war. This war is not a matter of bombs or sanctions. It is a universal struggle against the evil of mankind. Let us not forget that we are together in this struggle. We must stand as a strong, united nation behind our troops, behind our President and behind our sacred human values.

HEADLINE: Richer, and Poorer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Census Bureau's recently reported study of changes in household wealth from 1984 to 1988 (front page, Jan. 11) shows a much more shocking picture than your account of this study indicates. Your headline read "Rich Got Richer in 80's; Others Held Even." In fact the data show that while the wealth of the top one-fifth of households rose by 14 percent, the wealth of the "rest," the bottom four-fifths, actually fell by 23 percent.
As you report, the average wealth for all households (corrected for inflation) fell from $37,012 in 1984 to $35,752 in 1988 (a difference that was not statistically significant, but that nonetheless reflected the full data collected by the Census Bureau). But if the wealth of the top one-fifth rose in this period from $98,411 to $111,770, this means that the average household wealth of the remaining four-fifths fell from $21,662 to $16,748. This represents a decline of 23 percent, and this is significant, statistically and for what it tells us about the dramatic changes in the United States over a four-year period that did not even include a recession. It is time to stop viewing the 80's as a period of prosperity and recognize it for what it was, a period of Robin Hood in reverse.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Falls

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Japan's surplus in the current account, the widest measure of trade in goods and services, narrowed to $3.71 billion, from $4.01 billion a year earlier, but widened from $1.75 billion in November, the Japanese Finance Ministry said today.
For the whole year, the ministry said, the surplus shrank to $35.79 billion in 1990, from $57.16 billion the previous year. The annual decline in 1990 was the third in a row. 
 "Japan has become another Germany, in that spending by tourists going abroad is eroding gains in exports," said Yukihiko Shimada, an economist at the Wako Research Institute.
Japan's invisible trade account posted a record deficit of $22.59 billion in 1990 because transport costs rose and more than 10 million Japanese went abroad, the official said.
But in contrast to the exodus of people, huge flows of Japanese money surged home in 1990. The Persian Gulf crisis and falling interest rates in the United States slashed Japan's deficit in long-term capital flows to $43.46 billion in 1990, from $89.25 billion a year before, the official said.
Exports in 1990 recorded their eighth straight year of growth, rising to $280 billion, from $269 billion in 1989, because of higher exports of automobiles, auto parts and audio visual equipment, ministry data show.

HEADLINE: Naivasha Journal;
Dutch Flowers? In Name Only. Ask the Kenyans.

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIVASHA, Kenya, Jan. 27

 BODY:
In a cavernous hall set in a 4,500-acre flower farm here, an almost militarily precise work force grades, ties in bunches, packs in boxes and refrigerates a million carnations a day.
After a rocky three-hour ride on trailer trucks from this lakeside area in the Rift Valley of East Africa, the flowers are loaded in Nairobi on jets bound for Europe, where Kenyan flowers are harvesting a name for quality and durability. 
 Last year, Kenya, better known for its tourism and coffee, exported 400 million flowers, ranking it sixth or seventh in the world after traditional flower producers like the Netherlands, Israel and Colombia, flower growers here say.
One company, Sulmac, the biggest Kenyan flower producer and the owner of what the company says is the largest carnation farm in the world, exported 214 million stems: carnations, roses, lilies, larkspur and a long-lasting, crisply textured flower called statice that often lends a splash of purple to supermarket bouquets in the United States.
 
Tourism Drops Off
 Delicate flowers from Africa gracing European salons? Sounds improbable. But in a country where coffee, tea and tourism have been mainstays of relatively scarce foreign-exchange earnings, flower exports are now the fastest-growing source of foreign exchange and have suddenly gained a special importance.
Not only have hard times come to Kenyan coffee, coveted although it accounts for just 2.4 percent of world coffee exports; tourism is hurting as well. The Kenyan game parks are nearly empty of visitors these days as vacationers cancel because of nervousness over the Persian Gulf war.
The Kenyan equatorial highland climate -- refreshingly cool at night, brilliant but not bruising sunlight during the day -- turns out to be ideal for flower growing, just as it has been well suited to coffee-growing since the early days of colonial settlement. As worldwide coffee prices remain at depressing lows, Brooke Bond, the largest coffee company in Kenya and parent to Sulmac, has received special permission from the Government to pull up coffee plants, traditionally considered almost sacred, and replace them with roses.
"The light is good, the water is available," said David Gray, the managing director of Sulmac, as he inspected field upon field of jade green carnation plants, their buds just bursting. "The soil is not good -- basically volcanic dust -- but we can put a lot on it to improve it."
While the large-scale flower business has been mostly dominated by Europeans since it was started a decade ago, many Kenyans, among them the governor of the Central Bank, Eric Kotut, have found ventures like rose growing to be profitable side-businesses. Some Kenyan university students are specializing in horticulture, which they see as a growth industry. And all around the mile-high Lake Naivasha, flower specialists are experimenting with hybrids to produce attractive yet long-lasting specimens that can survive the rigors of overseas travel.
On the rim of the lake, German and Dutch technical experts have perfected the art of growing carnations outdoors. In most places in the world, carnations are cultivated under cover, a method that makes the enterprise more costly.
In addition to the favorable environment, growers here enjoy the benefits of a cheap labor force, a factor that gives Kenya an advantage against more traditional flower-growing countries.
At most of the flower farms that encircle Lake Naivasha, workers are paid the equivalent of about $40 a month, plus free schooling for their children and medical services. Despite the huge volume of flowers processed every day, cheap labor means there is little automation in the Sulmac packing hall -- only a conveyor belt a few yards long.
"We can do it better by hand," said Joseph Kinyanjui, senior supervisor of the 680 workers, whose hands weave and flash through the air as they grade and pack. "Each grader moves at least 2,600 stems a day, some do 6,000 a day."
Since the freshness of the flowers is essential, speed is emphasized. Pickers in the fields collect stems with buds that are just about to open. The stems are left in bins at the end of the long rows of plants and collected by trucks that constantly patrol the fields. In the grading hall, the flowers are rejuvenated for up to 24 hours in buckets of water infused with preservatives, then graded, packed and cooled in a refrigeration room. A fleet of insulated trucks makes the arduous route to the Nairobi airport in three to four hours.
 
Cheating on the Labels
 "From field to plane is normally 36 hours," Mr. Gray said. "It can be 24 hours. From field to retail market, four to five days."
While trade barriers do not seem to pose a major challenge to Kenyan flower exporters, transportation does. Sulmac destroyed 10 tons of flowers a day before Christmas because there was not enough space on jets.
The bulk of Sulmac's flowers are sold through a company based in Nuremburg, Germany, which then distributes them to various parts of the world, including the United States.
Some are sold directly at auctions in the Netherlands and markets in England. At Heathrow Airport, bouquets of flowers with labels from the Netherlands are actually Kenyan. They are retagged, said Mr. Gray with a shrug, to add the aura of prestige that Kenyan flower growers are striving for but have yet to achieve.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Heavy Sales Depress Dollar After Fed Acts to Cut Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar took a pounding overseas yesterday and continued to lose ground in domestic dealings after a surprise interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a worse-than-expected unemployment report.
Gold prices were mostly lower. 
 The announcement that the Fed was cutting the discount rate half a point, to 6 percent, set off strong selling in European markets and pushed the dollar lower in trading in the United States.
The move, which came a day after Germany's central bank raised two important interest rates, was compounded by a subsequent Labor Department report showing the United States' unemployment rate had inched up to 6.2 percent in January, the highest level since 1987.
The report was taken as a sign that "the economic slowdown is probably deeper and longer lasting" than previously thought, said John McCarthy, chief dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York. "As a consequence, interest rates can come down" further to stimulate growth.
Low interest rates undermine the American currency by making dollar-denominated securities less valuable to foreign investors.
Traders shunned the dollar in favor of the mark, a move that also put pressure on the British pound. There were reports that both the Bank of England and the Bundesbank of Germany had stepped in to buy pounds against the mark to shore up the British currency.
The dollar lost more than a cent against the pound and more than a pfennig against the mark. But it still settled above its postwar low of 1.4625 marks, which some traders said might be a sign the currency was "approaching a major bottom," said Robert Hatcher, chief dealer at Barclays Bank P.L.C. in New York.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a close of 131.25 Japanese yen, from 131.40 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it was quoted higher at 131.43 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 131.50 yen, up from 131.26 yen on Thursday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.9765, from $1.9645 late Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9760 to buy one pound, more expensive than the $1.9665 on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Thursday rates, included: 1.4680 German marks, down from 1.4770; 1.2525 Swiss francs, down from 1.2579; 4.9960 French francs, down from 5.0245; 1,105.00 Italian lire, down from 1,111.25, and 1.1598 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1633.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery gained 30 cents to settle at $366.10 an ounce. But the Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for gold of $365.50, off 30 cents an ounce.
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $366.55 an ounce, from $366.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $365.50 from $366.40. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold lost $2 to close at a bid of $369.80.
Silver prices were mixed. On the Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $3.852 an ounce, up from $3.830 on Thursday. In London, silver fell to a late bid price of $3.83 an ounce, down from $3.84.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Japan;
Japan's Premier Backs a Compromise on Aid for the Gulf War

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, struggling to gain legislative approval of $9 billion in aid for the war against Iraq, has agreed in principle to a compromise that would prevent the money from being spent on arms, ammunition or anything else intended for lethal purposes, Japanese officials said today.
The officials said the money would be given to the United States and the allies fighting in the Persian Gulf, but only for "logistical" purposes. As a practical matter, the officials said, the contribution would free other money to be spent for weapons and arms. 
 Mr. Kaifu's decision was seen as a setback for the United States, which had asked that no strings be attached to the new contribution by Japan. On the other hand, American officials said, they are happy with the $9 billion and could easily live with the restrictions.
"There are plenty of things we can use the money for without having to spend it on lethal materials," an American official said.
 
Compromise Needs Approval

The compromise embraced by Mr. Kaifu, which officials said had not been approved in every detail, is to be announced next week as the debate in the Parliament heats up. Japan has already pledged $4 billion in economic and quasi-military aid, a little more than half of which has been spent.
The major opposition parties, which together control the upper house of Parliament, have announced their opposition to the measures proposed earlier by Mr. Kaifu, including $9 billion in aid with no strings attached and a plan to send military planes to evacuate refugees from Jordan.
Government officials said Mr. Kaifu had reluctantly agreed to the limits preventing the money from being spent on lethal materials because he needs the swing votes of the Clean Government Party, or Komeito, in the upper house of Parliament.
On Thursday Mr. Kaifu and his Cabinet agreed to put the entire $9 billion package in one bill that would appropriate the money, authorize taxes on cigarettes, gasoline and corporations to pay for it and issue Treasury bonds to cover the aid until the Government is reimbursed from the new tax revenue.
 
Parliament's Vote Uncertain
 His decision means that, contrary to earlier reports, the entire package will now have to be approved in the Parliament before it can proceed. Such approval is far from guaranteed, according to Government officials.
The Komeito party objects to the taxes and to the widespread impression that Japan is aiding the gulf effort out of deference to the United States. The party takes those positions in part because it will be competing for votes against the left-leaning Japan Socialist Party this year. The Socialist leader, Takako Doi, has denounced Mr. Kaifu's plans.
Polls vary, but it appears that the public is divided over how deeply Japan should be involved in aiding the gulf effort. Some surveys show more than 50 percent of Japanese objecting.
The Komeito party also objects to the Prime Minister's plan to send military planes to the gulf, saying that even a humanitarian mission to airlift refugees violates laws and policies banning the Japanese military from any role in a combat zone.
 
Defeat of Bill Feared
 At first, Washington denied it had pressed Japan for the money. But later Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d embarrassed Tokyo by saying the Bush Administration had indeed asked for the $9 billion and would receive it.
It was not clear whether Mr. Kaifu's gesture to the Komeito Party would secure enough votes for approval of the bill. One official said some were worried about a "nightmare scenario" in which the bill would go down in defeat, echoing the collapse of a plan last year to send military personnel to the gulf.
Defeat of the $9 billion aid package could bring a crisis in relations between the United States and Japan and topple Mr. Kaifu's Government.
For this reason, politicians say, the United States will have to accept the restrictions on the aid sought by Mr. Kaifu, since Washington, too, does not want to jeopardize the entire aid package.
 
$9 Billion Can Be Spent Easily
 Japanese officials say the allied forces in the Middle East can easily spend the $9 billion on "logistical" support. Up to now, the United States has been asked to spend the initial contribution only on transportation of nonlethal materials.
The Komeito party is a splinter group allied with a Buddhist sect and thus has pacifist leanings. Many of its volunteers are women, who, according to surveys, are mostly opposed to Japan's involvement in the war.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is so eager to placate the Komeito party on the gulf aid issue that Mr. Kaifu's aides are reportedly moving to deny renomination to the Governor of the Tokyo prefecture in his re-election effort this year because the Komeito objects to his continuing in office.

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Slid 0.5% in December

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Construction spending slid for a ninth straight month in December, falling five-tenths of a percent and helping to trim building growth for the year to just six-tenths of a percent, the Government said today.
Many analysts forecast a rebound in residential building later this year but no significant improvement on the nonresidential side. And government outlays are uncertain because of the questions on the effects of the recession on revenues. 
 Over all, said Daryl Delano, an economist at Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., "I believe it will be a down year."
The Commerce Department said spending on residential, nonresidential and government projects in December totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $415.1 billion, the lowest level since a $410.5 billion rate in January 1988.
Spending during the previous two months was even weaker than first reported. November expenditures were revised to show a 1.5 percent decline, down from the six-tenths of a percent drop originally reported, while October spending fell one-tenth of a percent rather than rose three-tenths of a percent, as first thought.
For the year, spending totaled $434.9 billion, up from $432.1 billion in 1989.
But construction has been sliding each month since posting a four-tenths of a percent gain in March because of tight credit, high vacancy rates and faltering consumer and business confidence linked to the Persian Gulf crisis and a recessionary economy.
And a Labor Department report today suggested further declines in the months ahead. It said construction payrolls in January fell 155,000, after seasonal adjustment, following a 28,000 drop in December.
The report said 450,000 construction jobs have been lost since last May.
Residential spending continued to decline, falling 2.3 percent in December to an annual rate of $167.5 billion after a 3.2 percent decline a month earlier.
Spending on single-family housing dropped 3.2 percent, to $96.5 billion, after falling 2.8 percent in November. Apartment building edged up five-tenths of a percent, to $17.7 billion, but failed to erase a 6.4 percent drop a month earlier.
In December, nonresidential spending rose a eight-tenths of a percent, to $97 billion, attributed in part to a 7.1 percent increase in industrial building. Most other categories fell. Spending on the nonresidential sector had dropped 3 percent the previous month.
Government spending rose for the second straight month, up 1.1 percent, to $115.2 billion, after a 1.8 percent advance in November.

HEADLINE: New York State Unemployment Up to 6.5%

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Unemployment in New York State rose a full percentage point in January, to 6.5 percent. And the jobless rate in New Jersey also jumped, to 6.4 percent from 5.7 percent.
The rates in both states were higher than the 6.2 percent reported yesterday for the nation as a whole. 
 The unemployment rate in New York City increased to 7.4 percent, from 6.3 percent in December, but was down from a recent peak of 7.9 percent in September.
Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that the numbers for New York State were especially troubling, with the state's unemployment rate at its highest level in four and a half years.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said New York had seen a sharp decline in employment in recent months, losing 100,000 jobs from August to December.
"Basically, unemployment is up, employment down and labor force participation is down," he said. "It's construction; it's trade; it's finance; it's manufacturing -- it's everything. It really adds up to the most serious deterioration in our economy since the 1970's."
In New Jersey, the 6.4 percent rate was a substantial increase from 4.9 percent in August and 4.5 percent a year ago.
In New York City, Mr. Ehrenhalt said research indicated there had been a worrisome shift in the composition of unemployment. Two-thirds of those who say they are unemployed are people who have been dismissed, he said. Three months ago, more than half of the city's unemployed were people who were searching for their first job or who had voluntarily left their jobs.
The city's unemployment rate, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, now reflects "a lot less churning" in the labor market and more of the impact of the slump that cost the city nearly 50,000 jobs in 1990.

HEADLINE: Yields Plunge As Fed Cuts Discount Rate

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Interest rates plunged yesterday after the Federal Reserve, responding to a surge in unemployment and other negative economic data, cut its discount rate by a half-point, to 6 percent. The Fed also moved to lower the key interbank lending rate.
Because the bond market thrives on any negative economic news that will keep inflation in check and cause lower rates on newer issues, prices of Treasury securities exploded in the morning within minutes after the report that unemployment in January rose to its highest level since the summer of 1987. 
 Corporations also seized on the rise in bond prices and the drop in yields to offer $2.7 billion of new issues for sale yesterday. This surge compared with total corporate offerings of $5.7 billion for the current week.
 
A Bit of a Surprise
 While the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, had indicated this week that a rate cut was needed to stimulate the economy, the central bank was not expected to act until after its policy-making Open Market Committee convenes next week.
But an hour after the job report was released, the Fed cut its discount rate to 6 percent from 6 1/2 percent, the second cut since Dec. 18. Within minutes, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, jumped well over a point, or $10 for each $1,000 of face value.
Despite repeated bouts of profit taking during the session, the long bonds were still offered at 107 14/32, up 1 9/32, while the yield fell to 8.08 percent, from 8.19 percent the day before and 8.22 percent a week ago.
"The Fed's action was too little and too late to adequately deal with the worsening recession," said Philip Braverman, senior vice president and chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Tokyo, the world's largest private bank. "The Fed is behind the learning curve as we will see when the G.N.P. for the fourth quarter of 1990 is revised sharply downward. This quarter's G.N.P. will be far more dismal."
 
 Downward Revision Expected
 Mr. Braverman expects the 1990 fourth-quarter gross national product to be revised downward from the 2.1 percent decline reported last week to minus 3.5 to 4 percent. "We know the Fed will have to take stronger action to lower rates," he said, "and the longer it procrastinates the longer the recession will last."
William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: "Some market participants were troubled by the fact that the initial advance of the long bond wasn't extended. But the long bond did resist some heavy profit taking during the day."
Bill rates fell yesterday to their lowest levels since April 1988.
While bill rates are always the most immediately affected by any change in Fed policy, Mr. Sullivan attributed the steepening yield curve "basically to lack of investor follow-through at the long end of the market after the initial advance."
The discount rate on the 90-day Treasury bills plummeted 21 basis points, to 5.99 percent; six-month bills fell 22 basis points, to 5.98 percent, and one-year bills lost 22 basis points, at 5.91 percent. The Treasury announced it plans to auction $11.75 billion of one-year bills on Feb. 12.
 
 Shift Seen in Fed Funds Rate
 Meanwhile, the actions by the Fed led the market to believe that its new target for the vital Federal funds rate was being cut to 6.25 percent, from 6.75 percent. The funds rate is considered the bedrock cost of credit because that is what banks charge one another for temporary loans. The funds rate is also the basic rate most easily controlled by the Fed.
After the Fed's discount rate cut and infusion of reserves into the banking system, the funds traded at 5.5 percent at the close, after opening at 7 percent and briefly moving to 7.5 percent.
Because the market also expected the Fed to reduce interest rates further, dealers and traders are expected to be eager bidders at next week's record $34.5 billion Treasury quarterly refunding auctions.
 
 Next Week's Treasury Issues
 On Tuesday, the Treasury will offer $12.5 billion of three-year notes, which traded on a when-issued basis to yield 7.02 percent, down from 7.24 percent the day before. On Wednesday, $11 billion of 10-year notes will be sold and these traded to yield 7.88 percent, against 8 percent the day before.
The auctions will end Thursday, with the sale of $11 billion of new 30-year long bonds. The bonds also traded on a when-issued basis, to yield 8.06 percent, down from 8.18 percent the day before.
The refunding issues must be "settled," or paid for, by Feb. 15, which is common for such sales. What is no longer common is for the Fed to adopt an "even keel" posture on interest rates before a refunding. Mr. Braverman noted that the Treasury and Fed usually sounded out market sentiment about interest rates and other factors before refunding terms were announced and when-issued trading started, usually after the terms were announced.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE CUTS LOAN RATES TO PROD ECONOMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In the face of stark new evidence of the nation's economic weakness, the Federal Reserve moved today with unusual force to stimulate the economy by sharply reducing the interest rates it controls.
Large banks across the country responded immediately by reducing their prime rate, the benchmark rate for many mortgages and other commercial and consumer loans. 
 But many economists predicted that today's steps would not be enough to bring the country out of recession. "I think the war has to end," said Jerry L. Jordan, chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "I don't think you're going to get people borrowing and spending again until they are confident that the war is not going to spread."
 
Shift to Pessimism
 The pessimistic view of the economy, based largely on the Government's release today of new, disappointing data about employment and manufacturers' purchases, is quite a contrast to the judgment that prevailed only a week or two ago when economists were saying the worst of the recession might be over.
"These numbers are so devastating that they suggest the worst is ahead of us and not behind us," said David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street bond firm. They show that "the recession could carry through to next year," he added.
The Labor Department reported today that unemployment rose to 6.2 percent in January, the highest level since 1987; that payrolls, not counting farm workers, fell by 232,000 jobs, and that the average workweek shrank by half an hour. [Page 29.]
 
No Influence on Stocks
 The combination of bad economic news and the Federal Reserve's actions caused interest rates in the credit markets to plunge, but the stock market appeared to focus more on corporate profits and fell slightly.
Within minutes of the Labor Department's release of the employment figures this morning, the Federal Reserve announced that it had cut the discount rate to 6 percent, from 6 1/2 percent. This is the rate the central bank charges on loans to commercial banks. Since banks rarely borrow from the Federal Reserve these days unless they are in serious trouble, the discount rate is important mainly as a signal of policy intentions.
Later in the morning, the Federal Reserve bought large quantities of Government securities to indicate to the financial markets that it wanted to lower its target for the crucial Federal funds rate, apparently to 6 1/4 percent, from 6 3/4 percent. This is the rate commercial banks charge one another for overnight loans and is often a determining factor in the rates they offer customers. It was the second half-point cut in the rate in six weeks.
In Alan Greenspan's three and a half years as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve has almost always limited changes in the funds rate target to one-quarter of a percentage point at a time. This was the first time the Federal Reserve changed the discount rate and the Federal funds rate target on the same day.
Large commercial banks, including Citibank and J. P. Morgan in New York, the First National Bank of Chicago and BankAmerica Corporation in San Francisco, immediately reduced their prime rate to 9 percent, from 9 1/2 percent, and other large and small banks will surely follow suit.
"The employment numbers were so dreadful that the Fed had no choice but to respond immediately with decisive, unambiguous action," said Robert H. Chandross, chief economist in the New York office of Lloyds Bank.
The Federal Reserve's actions also reflected a report this morning by a private group, the National Association of Purchasing Management, showing that its purchasing managers' index had fallen to its lowest level since May 1982, in the midst of the last recession.
 
Attention to Manufacturers
 Mr. Jones, who has just completed a book on the Federal Reserve under Mr. Greenspan, says the chairman pays especially close attention to the monthly purchasing index, which measures what manufacturers are buying.
The Federal Reserve announced the discount rate cut shortly after 9 this morning instead of waiting, as it usually does, until after the financial markets closed. Economists who follow the Federal Reserve closely said it might have moved immediately on the heels of bad economic news so it would not appear to be succumbing to pressure from the White House. In a blast at the Federal Reserve in his State of the Union Message Tuesday night, President Bush said, "Interest rates should be lower, now."
In the statement accompanying its announcement of the cut in the discount rate, the Federal Reserve Board said, "Action was taken in light of further declines in economic activity, continued sluggish growth trends in money and credit and evidence of abating inflationary pressures, including weakness in commodity prices."
The vote to reduce the discount rate was 5 to 0 with one governor, Wayne D. Angell, absent. The board has one vacancy.
Because of the huge budget deficit, President Bush and Congress would find it almost impossible to take the standard steps during a recession of reducing taxes or increasing Government spending to stimulate the economy. That means the fate of the economy is almost entirely in the hands of the Federal Reserve.
 
Theory Behind the Cut
 By cutting interest rates, the Federal Reserve in theory has the power to make borrowing more attractive and thus generate economic growth through more spending by companies and individuals.
But this recession is unlike any before, apparently a result of two forces operating outside the normal business cycle. The first is the war with Iraq, which has made consumers and businesses uneasy about the future and thus unwilling to commit themselves to purchases. The second is the fragility of the banking system, which has made many banks unwilling to lend even to their regular, credit-worthy customers.
This is the first recession since World War II to take hold at a time when the Federal Reserve was already driving interest rates down. And even though the Federal funds rate has been reduced by almost two full percentage points in the last three months, that has had little effect on bank lending.
Mr. Greenspan studies economic statistics carefully, perhaps more rigorously than any of his predecessors did, and in an interview this week, he seemed clearly concerned about the state of the economy and his capacity to turn it around.
 
 Confidence Is Eroding
 He said that the "credit crunch," as he repeatedly called the lack of money to borrow, was proving more intractable than he had expected and that the country could face a long and deep recession because of the erosion of consumer confidence if the war was not over by the middle of April.
Mr. Greenspan said he was paying much closer attention than usual to the nation's money supply, basically the sum of all currency, bank deposits and money market accounts, because he thought that was the best gauge of credit conditions.
The money supply rose hardly at all in the last quarter of 1990. When the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, meets here on Tuesday, it will have access to the latest figures showing what happened to the money supply in January. That could determine whether the committee decides to reduce rates further.
Some economists say the Federal Reserve will now stand pat for a while to judge the effect of today's actions. "I think they'll pause at this point because they still have to be a little concerned about a bounce-back effect," said Mr. Jordan of First Interstate.
But Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Project at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said further easing of rates was probably in the offing. "You can't move the economy along until you get more money in the system," he said.

HEADLINE: Job Losses Up Sharply Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
In a sharp setback to hopes that the sliding economy had begun to stabilize, the Government today reported a heavy new wave of job losses in January and an unusually large contraction in the length of the average workweek.
The unemployment rate rose just one-tenth of a point, to 6.2 percent, but there was wide agreement among analysts that this understated the deterioration of the economy last month. One reason was that many of the newly jobless were thought to have not yet begun the search for other work and thus were not counted in the current data. 
 "There's a lot of dismal news here," said Janet L. Norwood, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics. She cited, among other things, the losses of 155,000 jobs in construction and 70,000 in manufacturing.
 
 Cuts in Interest Rates
 The job data, combined with a weak report from corporate purchasing managers, led to a half-point cut today in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, to 6 percent. This, in turn, caused commercial banks to cut their prime lending rates by the same amount, to 9 percent.
The Fed usually tries to avoid seeming to respond to any particular set of figures, but economists said the central bank was clearly worried by the job report, the first comprehensive gauge of economic performance for January. The fact that the Fed acted so promptly in the face of an increase in German interest rates on Thursday reinforced this view, economists said.
"They're much worse than the one-tenth increase in the unemployment rate would imply," said Rudy Oswald, director of economic research for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., referring to the Labor Department figures. "There are no signs of the recession ending. It's worsening."
 
 Outlook for the G.N.P.
 The rate move by the Fed is aimed at stimulating economic activity, which, as measured by the gross national product, fell at a 2.1 percent annual rate during the October-December period. Some analysts now think the G.N.P. could fall as much as twice that rate in the current quarter.
The job figures, based on a survey of businesses, showed payroll employment tumbling 232,000 last month, all but 3,000 of this in the goods-producing sector. This brought the decline since last June to more than one million jobs.
Analysts also noted that the decline in payroll jobs in December had been revised to 148,000, instead of the 76,000 initially reported.
Both the jobless rate and number of those out of work in January were at their highest points in more than three and a half years.
Officials said bad weather contributed to the drop of 155,000 in construction jobs, but, based on comments from the businesses surveyed, the dominant reason for the decline was the slumping economy. The construction figures, as are most other numbers in the report, are adjusted for normal seasonal variation.
The weakness in the building trades was borne out by a Commerce Department report today showing that construction spending fell five-tenths of 1 percent in December, the ninth straight month of decline.
 
 Weakness in Manufacturing
 The Labor Department said the loss of 70,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector included big drops in lumber, furniture and other construction-related industries and in the automobile industry and its suppliers.
Payroll employment would have fallen even further had it not been for what analysts called an artificial increase of 85,000 in retail jobs. In an effort to hold down costs, stores added relatively few temporary workers for the Christmas season and thus the January cutbacks were smaller than assumed by the seasonal adjustment factor.
Service jobs, which have shown steady growth for years, have now failed to grow for two straight months. Losses in government and in business services were partly offset by gains in the still-robust health-care field, which added another 40,000. The finance, insurance and real estate category contracted by 8,000, the report showed.
The workweek shrank by a full half-hour in the private sector as a whole and in manufacturing. It was an unusually severe drop in both categories, which had shown increases of about one-quarter of an hour in December. The January drop helped slash the index of aggregate weekly hours to 121.7, from 124 in December.
Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon Bank, described the decline in employment over the last seven months as similar to the pattern established during the first seven months of the 1981-82 recession, the most severe of the eight recessions since World War II. It is not certain precisely when this recession began, but most analysts believe it began during the summer.
 
 Calculating the Rate
 The unemployment rate is based on a Labor Department survey of households and the picture from that survey was as bleak as that from the business survey. The department calculated that jobs plunged by 652,000 and the labor force shrank by 536,000. The resulting rise of 116,000 in the number of jobless people pushed the unemployment rate up by one-tenth of a point.
At 6.2 percent, the jobless rate is nearly a full point higher than it was in June, but that jump is just half the increase posted during the first seven months of the 1981-82 recession.
Even though the job-loss situation now is in some ways similar to that in the early 1980's, various social and demographic factors have produced a slowdown in the growth of the labor force, and that has limited the rise in the unemployment rate. Among those factors are the relatively low population of young people, which has cut down on the number of people seeking their first jobs, and recent signs that women are reducing their participation in the work force.
Statistically, teen-agers accounted for the entire rise in joblessness last month, with their unemployment rate jumping to 18.2 percent, from 16.6.
 
 Varieties of Unemployment
 Among the ranks of the jobless, the number of those who had lost their jobs rose by almost 300,000 last month, increasing this portion of all jobless to 53 percent, from just under half in December. At the same time, the number of people who voluntarily left their job fell by about 100,000, to 11.7 percent of the unemployed.
"Such hesitation of workers to leave a job and look for a new one is typical during an economic downturn," Dr. Norwood said.
Job losses were concentrated among adult men last month, reversing an unusual pattern for a recession that had seen women bearing the brunt of the decline in employment.
The number of people working part time because they could not find full-time work was virtually unchanged last month, at about 5.5 million, the report showed.
 
Texas Bucks the Trend
 Eight of the 11 biggest states showed increases in their jobless rate last month, with Massachusetts posting an increase of 1.3 percentage points, to 8.6 percent. The rate for New York was up one point, to 6.5 percent, while the New Jersey rate rose to 6.4 percent, from 5.7 percent. But Texas posted a decline of six-tenths of a percentage point, to 6.4 percent.
By region, seasonally unadjusted data showed the rates rose in the Northeast by 1.7 points, to 7.4 percent; in the Midwest, by 1.2 points, to 6.8 percent; in the South, by seven-tenths of a point, to 6.9 percent, and in the West by eight-tenths, to 6.8 percent.
Officials said today's figures were not appreciably affected by the call-up of military reserves after the war began in the Persian Gulf.
Average hourly earnings, the report showed, were essentially unchanged last month, but average weekly earnings fell 1.5 percent, to $347.14.

HEADLINE: Lines of Jobless Grow as Benefits Staff Shrinks

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STERLING HEIGHTS, Mich., Jan. 31

 BODY:
At 7 A.M. a full moon was shining down on Tim Peck as he stood outside an unemployment office trying to ward off the bitter cold and his rising anger.
Seven weeks after he was laid off from his job as a truck driver, Mr. Peck had yet to receive his first unemployment benefits. Several calls to the unemployment office went unanswered or brought a busy signal. So, despite an early morning snow, he waited with 30 others, knowing that if he arrived later in the day as many as 300 people would be in line and he would wait four hours to be seen. 
 "I'm going to grab someone by the throat," Mr. Peck said as he stomped his feet and clapped his hands to keep warm.
Mr. Peck's frustrations are being repeated in thousands of unemployment offices around the country as the unemployment rate climbs.
The problem is not with paying the unemployment benefits; they are financed by the states and have not been cut. But the benefits checks have been delayed because the Federal Government, which pays the costs of running the unemployment offices, has been cutting back on its payments in recent years.
As a result of the declining Federal aid, state officials have reduced the staffs at the unemployment offices. But now, as the recession has taken hold, the offices are being overwhelmed with claims, causing delays of up to six weeks in processing applications and mailing benefit checks. Those in line complain not only of the inconvenience but also of unpaid bills.
Nor is the situation expected to improve soon. Last fall, the Labor Department informed the states that contingency money that was supposed to be set aside to help in times of high unemployment would be cut by 25 percent, or $180 million to $200 million in the current fiscal year. As a result, state officials said they do not have the money to hire enough temporary workers to handle the crush of new applicants.
The length of the delays varies from state to state. Florida, for instance, is still making payments on time, even though the number of claims were 50 percent higher for the last three months of 1990 than in the same period in 1989. New Hampshire officials, on the other hand, say some of the unemployed have had to wait four to six weeks just to receive word that their applications for benefits have been approved.
"Here we are in what is officially been labeled a recession, and for the Government's No. 1 program to combat a recession, the funding necessary to administer this program isn't there," said Isaac Shapiro, a senior research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research organization in Washington.
The program's troubles stem in part from the economic transition from recovery to recession. Labor Department figures show that nearly four million people claimed unemployment insurance benefits for the week ending Jan. 12, a 38 percent increase from a year ago. But the amount of money appropriated to run the jobless program was based on forecasts of unemployment made more than a year ago.
"We fund states for what we expect their workload to be and that is related to the unemployment rate," said Mary Ann Wyrsch, director of the Unemployment Insurance Service in the Labor Department. "The economy has changed dramatically in the last six to nine months from what the projections thought the economy would be."
 
Should Be Enough, Some Argue
 Yet state officials contend that despite erroneous projections, there should still be enough money to pay for adequate staff. They note that the unemployment offices' administrative costs are financed by a special tax, the Federal Unemployment Tax, that companies pay on the first $7,000 in wages earned by each employee.
The Labor Department estimates that $4.3 billion will be raised through that unemployment tax to run the jobless program in the current fiscal year. Of that, Congress has appropriated only $1.98 billion. The rest of the money has been used to lower the size of the Federal budget deficit.
Several states, including Ohio, New Hampshire, Colorado and Iowa are using state funds to make up for the Federal money. In essence, this means businesses in these states are being taxed twice to provide the same government service.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, the Suffolk Democrat who is acting chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, which oversees the unemployment compensation system, has scheduled hearings for Wednesday on all aspects of the jobless program.
The National Governors Association is expected to pass a resolution early next week at its meeting in Washington calling on President Bush to declare a national employment emergency. Such a declaration would allow Congress to appropriate additional money to run the unemployment program without having to cut other domestic programs or raise taxes.
 
Detroit Area Is Hit Hard
 The unemployment office run by the Michigan Employment Security Commission in Sterling Heights, a community just north of Detroit, is among the worst hit. Seven automobile plants are situated in the region served by the Sterling Heights office, and all of them have laid off some workers or announced their intention to do so.
[General Dynamics Corporation said Friday that it would lay off 1,200 workers in the next seven months as a contract to build Army tanks is completed, Reuters reported. About 600 of the workers are in the Detroit area, 500 are in Lima, Ohio, and 100 in Scranton, Pa.]
When claims for unemployment benefits began to rise in November, Jeanette Sancricca, the director of the Sterling Heights office, did not have the money to hire the 10 temporary workers she needed to supplement her 22 permanent employees. By the time she got more money in January, her office was hopelessly behind.
Staff members at the office say it is not unusual for 300 or 400 people to be waiting in line for service. Each week, the office falls behind by another 1,000 applicants. Applications and other paperwork are stacked on the tops of cabinets and desks and in boxes on the floor.
Some changes that were supposed to cut down on the long lines have actually made the problem worse. Like many other states, Michigan allows the jobless to mail in their applications, and, if the applications are approved, checks are mailed back. But because of delays of six weeks in processing claims and mailing checks, people are left to wonder what has happened. They then call the office, tying up the switchboard. Unable to get through on the telephone, many people come to the office, creating long lines and defeating the whole purpose of mail-in claims.
 
Behind on Electric and Gas Bills
 Several of those waiting on line complained about the financial stresses caused by the delays in getting their checks. "I'm behind on my electric and gas bills," said Kim Killingbeck, 29 years old, who was laid off from a gardening job in November. He got one check in early December, but has gotten nothing since. His wife works part time and, he said, "If it wasn't for her, we'd be starving."
Mr. Peck said he had been unable to keep up with his mortgage payments and utility bills. "I've already gotten a note that 100 percent of my claim has been approved," he said. "But you can't take that to the bank."
Others complained about the inconvenience of having to wait all day in line. Pam Jackson, 29, looked dazed as she waited holding an infant seat in which her 4-month-old daughter slept soundly. Mrs. Jackson, who was dismissed after Christmas from her job as a home health care worker, said she breast-feeds her daughter and could not leave her with anyone.
"They could have some chairs out here and some numbers," she said, scanning the bare waiting area where the line snaked back and forth. "This is ridiculous."
After about 45 minutes, a security guard spotted Mrs. Jackson and showed her to a chair on one side of the room. He promised her that she would not lose her place in line.
 
'All This Paperwork'
 The backlog in the workload has also had its effect on the staff at the Sterling Hights office.
"I like to have a feeling of accomplishment, that I've worked all day and gotten something done," said Carrie Bobo, as she said at her desk sorting through a stack of gray-colored applications. "But I finish an application and I look up and there is all this paperwork. It makes you feel like you haven't done anything."
And the staff has to deal constantly with irate people. When Tim Peck sat down to talk with Nancy Lesperance, a claims examiner, he was angry. Ms. Lesperance listened to his complaints and then did a computer search of his records. It showed that two checks had been mailed to him, but he had moved and the office did not have his new address. He left with a promise that he would be getting some payments soon.
Santina Piazza, 49, who has been laid off several times from her job at a plant making furnace filters, is a veteran of long lines at the unemployment office. She never shows up without a book or crossword puzzles.
"I concentrate on that and try not to listen to other people complain about the wait and get caught up in that," she said. "And I don't look at the clock."

HEADLINE: Payments Are Missed By T.W.A.

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Trans World Airlines said yesterday that it had defaulted on $75.5 million in payments on various notes. The airline said it wanted to conserve cash in the face of a severe drop in bookings that could last into the summer.
Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of the company, said the action was "imperative for the survival of T.W.A." 
 "It is now apparent that due to the war, summer vacation travel will be at its worst level in decades," Mr. Icahn said. "This further compounds the deleterious effects of high fuel costs, a falloff in leisure and business travel resulting from the recession, and fare wars that have affected the entire industry."
 
 Drop in Business Travel
 Many companies have told employees not to make overseas trips or to hold travel to a minimum. Since business travelers often pay full fares, the loss of these passengers has seriously hurt international airlines like T.W.A.
Mr. Icahn said the airline had $200 million in cash at the end of January, which included a payment of $110 million from American Airlines for the purchase of T.W.A.'s Chicago-to-London route.
T.W.A. said it would continue to pay its regular bills from suppliers and other obligations. Mark Buckstein, the airline's legal counsel, said, "T.W.A. has absolutely no intention of seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court under Chapter 11" of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
Mr. Icahn gained control of T.W.A. in 1985 and took the company private in a leveraged buyout in October 1988.
 
 Rating at 'Junk Bond' Level
 After the announcement of the missed payments, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on T.W.A.'s senior debt to Caa, from B-2, putting it in the "junk bond" class.
Mr. Icahn said another worry was a warning this week by Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner. Mr. Skinner said an agreed-upon sale of all of T.W.A.'s London routes could be delayed by a deadlock between Britain and the United States. The two nations are in negotiations to alter their bilateral agreement so that American Airlines could take over T.W.A.'s right to land at Heathrow Airport near London, and United could take over routes there from Pan Am.
T.W.A. will get $445 million for its London routes if the sale goes through. In a filing with the Transportation Department, T.W.A. warned this week that if the deal was not approved it could be forced, like Pan Am, to seek bankruptcy protection.
Pan Am filed for Chapter 11 protection on Jan. 8. Its fate also hangs on the approval of a sale of London routes, in its case to United Airlines. Unless it receives a payment of $290 million for the sale, Pan Am will quickly run out of cash and be forced to liquidate.
 
 Shifts in Service
 T.W.A. has already made deep cuts in its flights to Europe and has shifted some resources to domestic service. It has increased flights between New York and Florida, for example.
It has put smaller Boeing 767's on some international routes to replace its larger Boeing 747's.
The airline has also laid off 2,500 workers, or 8 percent of its work force, in a move to cut costs.
Mr. Icahn said he would immediately contact creditors to find ways to change the terms of T.W.A.'s debt. "If we are to survive the losses we will almost certainly sustain during 1991 if the gulf war continues, we will need to use our cash reserves," he said.
He said the airline was witholding payment of $18 million in interest on 15 percent senior secured notes due in 1994; $48.4 million in principal and $3.3 million in interest on senior secured trust notes due in 1991, and $5.8 million in interest on senior secured trust notes due in 1996.
Raymond E. Neidl, an airline analyst for Dillon, Read & Company, said Mr. Icahn had a good chance of renegotiating the debt.
 
 'Time to Work Something Out'
 "He'll be negotiating with a small number of people," Mr. Neidl said. "There will be time to work something out." The analyst said T.W.A. had grace periods of about 30 days on some payments.
He said that if the negotiations failed, the holders of the notes could push the airline to seek bankruptcy protection. That might not be good for the noteholders, he said, since the collateral for some notes are older aircraft that would be unlikely to bring good prices on the market. Therefore, even if the creditors gain possession of the collateral through a bankruptcy proceeding, they may get only part of their money back.
That may make the creditors somewhat willing to change the terms of their notes by accepting equity in lieu of payments or putting off payments to see if the airline can ride out its problems.
"This is a prudent move to preserve capital," Mr. Neidl added. "They don't know what will happen to travel in the North Atlantic. If you're looking down the road, it's the best move to make."

HEADLINE: American and Pilots Brace for Strike

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Pilots at American Airlines started passing the hat a year ago to build a strike fund. The dollar count has swelled into the millions and, with contract talks bogged down, cockpit crews at the nation's largest airline are bracing for a walkout as early as March.
"Nobody wants it for personal reasons and financial reasons," said Steve Roach, a co-pilot based in San Francisco. "But all the past promises from management have been broken. The company is accusing us of everything except causing holes in the ozone layer, and we're just fed up." 
 This high-level feud over money, power and pride has pitted the aggressive management of Robert L. Crandall, American's chairman and chief executive, against a pilots' union whose ranks have surged with the airline's growth but whose pay and benefit levels lag behind some rivals.
Directors of the Allied Pilots Association, the in-house union for the company's 8,900 pilots, rejected a third contract offer late Wednesday, this time after a Federal mediator supervised bargaining in Washington that began Jan. 7.
American executives concede that just the threat of a strike will cost bookings, but the airline is banking on customer loyalty inspired by the frequent-flier discounts it pioneered. Some travel agents have said that if a strike deadline drew near, they would back up American reservations by booking a second seat on another carrier.
 
Two-Level Pay Scale
 The pilots are taking aim at another American innovation: the pay system that gives lower wages for the same work to pilots with fewer years at the airline. This "two-tier" wage scale played an important part in American's growth and its success against upstart low-fare rivals like People Express. One measure of the company's success was its adding 5,000 pilots since 1983; it also more than doubled the number of highly paid captains, to more than 3,400.
The lower pay scale applies to two-thirds of American's pilots and it has inflamed many of them. "The system is grossly unfair," said Wally Pitts, a first officer on American's international flights who is in the lower-paid group. "We feel that as an industry leader in profits and executive compensation, that all of the employees at American should directly benefit in a like manner, and therefore be compensated at the top of the industry," said Mr. Pitts, 33 years old, who was hired six years ago.
In addition to wanting higher pay, union members oppose the airline's demand that pilots begin paying an average of about $1,000 a year as their share of medical insurance costs. Most other company employees make such payments.
More than a year of talks in Fort Worth, where American is based, collapsed at the end of December with harsh accusations from both sides. Before the talks broke down, a period of abnormally high pilot absences had snarled American's schedules and disrupted 60,000 passengers during the Christmas holiday.
Within days, American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said it would eliminate 250 of its 2,300 daily flights, including the intensely competitive Los Angeles-San Francisco route. The airline said it could not risk another episode like the December "sick-out," but union members said the pilots were being made scapegoats for cuts that American was forced into because of overly aggressive expansion. The route cuts became completely effective today.
 
More Talks Scheduled
 The Federal negotiators from the National Mediation Board decided Thursday to resume the bargaining in Washington on Monday. If the renewed talks break off, the board declares an impasse and both sides reject binding arbitration, a 30-day cooling off period would begin, and American's pilots could be on strike sometime in March.
In the event of a strike, the airline's strategy is to hire replacements. American has hired and trained 700 to 900 pilots a year since 1983 and company officials say any new pilots could be flying within five weeks of the day they are hired.
"There are plenty of pilot candidates in the marketplace who would love to fly for American Airlines," said Robert W. Baker, American's executive vice president for operations. "For every pilot we hire, there are 16 applications. When you consider the Eastern pilots who suddenly find themselves on the park bench, that puts another 3,000 pilots into the pool of potential candidates." Eastern Airlines Inc., in bankruptcy and out of cash, stopped flying on Jan. 18.
While American would suffer from a strike, its survival would not be threatened. The expansion that Mr. Crandall set in motion in 1983, at an estimated cost of $20 billion through 1995, has catapulted American ahead of all of its major competitors in passengers and, until last year's fuel cost increases, in profits.
In addition, People Express and other low-cost competitors have failed, merged or changed strategies, and many major carriers like Continental Airlines, Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines are in financial trouble.
 
Effects of Recession and War
 Still, the pilots say circumstances are on their side. They say recession, slack winter travel and fears of terrorism brought on by the war in the Persian Gulf have combined to reduce airline passenger loads by 20 percent from a year ago. Moreover, American's operations have been strained since the Pentagon last year called up 400 of the 1,700 American pilots who are active in the military reserves.
The American pilots want the airline to match the industry-leading pay levels that Delta Airlines granted its pilots last summer. If that scale were approved, the salary for a captain who had flown 15 years on a mid-sized Super 80 class of aircraft would rise to $135,954 from $118,557.
The highest paid pilots, the captains of the wide-bodied jumbo jets, would make $176,130 after 12 years, as against their current $145,368 after 15 years. The pay of a flight officer, the junior crew member, on a Boeing 727-200, would rise to a range of $58,482 to $96,525, depending on experience, from the current $31,995 to $75,519.
American's management has been holding out for a pay package that would essentially match the scale pilots at Northwest Airlines accepted last year. That scale is next highest after Delta's.
But American also is offering a bonus formula that would be tied to the airline's profit. In good years, the base pay and bonus would exceed the pay of Delta's pilots, the company said. But some pilots oppose such profit sharing because the amount is unpredictable and vulnerable to manipulation.
Mr. Baker, the company vice president, said he still hoped for a solution. "In an industry in the midst of turmoil, American has made our pilots a very rich offer." he said. "We think we have done everything possible to avoid confrontation and are astounded that the A.P.A. is unwilling to reach a reasonable agreement."
Mr. Pitts of the union said: "There is not one pilot on the property of American Airlines that wants to see the airline fail. We are tied directly to American's success and we truly believe the contract we are seeking allows American an adequate rate of return."

HEADLINE: About New York;
He's in Arabia; She, in the Bronx, In Her Own Fight

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Carmen Valentin hasn't heard from her husband, Andy, since the war began. He is an Army private somewhere in Saudi Arabia.
If they could talk, she said, it would go like this: "He would just tell me, 'Listen, Carmen. Don't worry.' And then we would start talking, and then we would break out in tears." 
 Mrs. Valentin spoke in a room at North Central Bronx Hospital, where she is being treated for an intestinal infection. She looked tiny in a hospital gown. A tube connected a vein in her arm to a bottle.
Like many children of the South Bronx, Mrs. Valentin, who is 20 years old, has lived a long life in very few years. She suspects her illness resulted from too much time in too many unhealthy places.
She has been homeless and knows the grim, dangerous interiors of shelters and welfare hotels. She knows the reality of cold nights in the streets. Lately she has lived in someone else's three-room apartment in the Soundview housing project. Four adults live there doubled-up illegally with 12 children, including 17-month-old Andy Jr.
That Mrs. Valentin's experience is common makes it no less awful. Her father vanished early. Her mother died of AIDS. Her sister is in jail. The family grew up surrounded by drugs, garbage and gunfire.
The brightest spot of her life was meeting Andy. In a snapshot, he looks proud and crisp in his uniform.
His hope was that by joining the Army he could be something other than a security guard and work for something more than the minimum wage. His wife said that he had always wanted to be a policeman or a fireman and that he now gets that satisfaction from the service. "He's 100 percent dedicated."
But this young couple never got on their feet. They couldn't find affordable housing where they could live as an unmarried couple.
Then, on Aug. 27, 1989, Andy Jr. was born. Mrs. Valentin moved into a welfare hotel to at least have a roof over their head. The father, then unemployed, would some times sneak in to see them. In November of that year, Mr. Valentin joined up.
 Mrs. Valentin remembers telling him: "I told you to get a job. I didn't tell you to go away."
 The reply she remembers: "I want to get straightened out. I want more babies."
Mr. Valentin headed for Oklahoma, Texas and Korea -- his stops before the Arabian desert. The two were married last Feb. 20.
Mrs. Valentin is being helped by the Soundview Health Center, which provides medical care and social services to families in the southeast Bronx, particularly those living in the Soundview project. The center runs support groups for people anxious about family in the military, and a participant had told the center about Mrs. Valentin's plight.
The center has helped her with medical matters, as well as enrolling her in its computer-training course. The center is also trying to enroll her in Medicaid, but this is a problem because she lacks an address in her own name.
Pedro Espada Jr., Soundview's executive director, said the war hits poor people hardest. His argument is buttressed by the fact that the first two New Yorkers killed -- Manuel Rivera Jr. and Ismael Cotto, both Marines -- were from the South Bronx.
Meanwhile, loved ones at home endure the suffering they have always known, with fear and loneliness now thrown in. "There are thousands like Carmen," Mr. Espada said.
This is a story with no easy moral. But Sandra Love, who works for Soundview, said Mrs. Valentin should be commended for two achievements. One is that she has stayed off drugs in a drug-plagued world. The other is that she has successfully fought to keep her child.
But both these victories have had their hollow side. Mrs. Valentin said that if she took drugs, addicts would take her in; if she sold them, she would have money. And if she gave up her baby to her mother-in-law, who insists she could take better care of him, Mrs. Valentin admits the child might benefit.
"I live in a place that's disgusting," she said. "I can't lie. My baby don't belong there. I know that."
So she remains poised on a tight rope. If she were again homeless -- instead of in an inadequate home -- she would be eligible for housing and other assistance. But her beloved child wouldn't have a roof over his head.
Too, there is the $500 that her husband sends her each month. The amount is enough to keep her off welfare, Soundview social workers say. And since Mrs. Valentin has no permanent address, her husband mails the money to his mother. His mother parcels it out in bits that Mrs. Valentin considers minuscule.
Mrs. Valentin has a dream. A nice apartment on an Army base after the war. And after her husband re-enlists.

HEADLINE: Daily News and Unions Begin Final Phase of Talks

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Amid signs of movement and rising urgency, The Daily News and its striking unions have begun what both sides regard as a crucial final phase of negotiations that would either end the three-month walkout or force the closing of the 70-year-old newspaper.
The News, which announced two weeks ago that it intended to shut down in 60 days if it was unable to reach a settlement or sell the paper, and its nine striking unions have stepped up the pace of talks, scheduling a series of negotiating sessions in recent days and over the coming week. 
 "We're getting to the end -- everything we do now is crucial," said George E. McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the unions' umbrella group.
"The situation is urgent," said James Hoge, the publisher of The News. "We must either reach settlements or conclude a sale, which would have to be based on settlements -- or shut down."
Yesterday, negotiators for The News and the drivers' union -- which began the strike 100 days ago and is widely regarded as crucial to any settlement -- met for nearly three hours at the Manhattan offices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
No breakthrough was reported, but a person close to the talks said The News had offered a new proposal that included a reduction in the number of drivers from the pre-strike level of 700, and the union, rather than rejecting it outright, said it would study the plan over the weekend.
Mr. Hoge declined to comment on the talks, as did Jack Sweeney, the Federal mediator. Michael J. Alvino, the president of the drivers' union, formally known as the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers of New York and Vicinity, and Robert Ballow, a lawyer who leads The News's negotiating team, could not be reached for comment.
The Newspaper Guild, which represents 750 editorial and commercial employees, also was preparing a counterproposal to a News offer made this week, and its leaders said they would submit their plan to Daily News negotiators at a meeting next Tuesday.
There were other signs of movement as well. Mr. Hoge said in a brief interview that both sides, in an effort to focus on important economic issues, had agreed to set aside questions of what would happen to the 800 replacement workers hired during the strike. Early in the strike, the issue of the "permanent replacements" appeared to be an insurmountable primary question; in recent days, however, both sides have backed off, without abandoning their positions.
 
Talks Are Scheduled
 And some union leaders said The News had agreed to use the old contracts as a framework for negotiations and had agreed to eliminate for the time being most non-critical issues, like dues check-offs, bulletin boards, jurisdictional questions and other minor matters. Mr. Hoge noted that at least one negotiating session between The News and each of the striking unions had been scheduled before next Friday under the auspices of the Federal mediators, and that follow-up talks were also being sought.
The Allied Printing Trades Council scheduled a meeting for next Tuesday to report on the talks and to coordinate strategy. Few details have emerged publicly from the talks, but Mr. McDonald has said that The News this week offered the mailers' a 36-page proposal and that the mailers had countered with a four-point plan that included a wage freeze and a cut of 25 workers from a 100-member mailroom staff. Mailers insert advertising supplements into the paper.

HEADLINE: South Africa Moves to Scrap Apartheid

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President F. W. de Klerk moved today to smash the legal bedrock of apartheid by announcing that he would scrap the remaining laws on which South Africa's ideology of racial discrimination has long rested.
In a speech opening the 1991 session of Parliament, Mr. de Klerk said legislation would soon be introduced to repeal the Land Acts of 1913 and 1936, which reserved most of the country's land for the white minority, the Group Areas Act of 1966, and the Black Communities Act of 1984, which entrenched the separate status of black townships.
In appealing for the revocation of racial laws, now considered to be virtually certain, Mr. de Klerk went beyond what had been expected by also mentioning the Population Registration Act, which classifies all South Africans into four racial groups: blacks, whites, people of mixed race and Asians. Reversing an earlier Government position, he said that the law, entrenched in the nation's Constitution, would, like the others, be soon eliminated.
 
Transitional Steps Proposed
 He said this could be done through the enactment of what he described as "temporary, transitional measures" needed to maintain the present Constitution until a new one can be negotiated and drafted.
"Should Parliament adopt the Government's proposals," Mr. de Klerk said, "the South African statute book will be devoid, within months, of the remnants of racially discriminatory legislation which have become known as the cornerstones of apartheid." [Excerpts from the speech, page 7.]
In Washington, the State Department welcomed the proposals as "dramatic and far-reaching," but noted that all political prisoners had yet to be released, as required under United States laws governing the lifting of sanctions.
 
Further Momentum
 The speech by Mr. de Klerk today lent further momentum to a process that the President began at the opening of Parliament last year, when the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations were legalized and Mr. de Klerk announced his Government's intention to release the congress's leader, Nelson Mandela. Mr. Mandela walked out of a prison farm nine days later.
"In the short span of a single year," Mr. de Klerk said today, "substantial progress was made. The Government is determined to build on the foundations laid purposefully, efficiently and with due speed.
"South Africa cannot allow or permit the dynamic process of reform to slow down," he told Parliament.
As he spoke, the African National Congress, conducted mass marches in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria and some other cities to put pressure on the Government in advance of looming but as yet undefined Constitutinal talks. The anti-apartheid group also sought to underscore the reality that blacks remain excluded from Parliament and from institutional political life.
In Cape Town, Walter Sisulu, a senior leader of the congress, addressed a crowd of perhaps 15,000 people who had gathered outside City Hall.
 
Insists on Right to Vote
 "We still do not have the vote, and this is what our people want today," Mr. Sisulu said. He added that the scrapping of the apartheid laws must be followed by "measures to retrieve the damage they have done."
Mr. de Klerk reiterated his opposition to an elected constituent assembly to draft a new constitution and an interim government, something that the African National Congress has demanded.
"The idea that the present, legally constituted Government should relinquish its powers and simply hand over its responsibilities to some or other temporary regime cannot be considered in a sovereign, independent state," Mr. de Klerk said.
But he suggested that the Government might share some of its authority with the congress and with other groups outside the parliamentary process, once the transition to nonracial democracy was under way.
"Consideration may be given to certain transitional arrangements on the various legislative and executive levels to give the leaders of the negotiating parties a voice in the formulation of important policy decisions," Mr. de Klerk said.
 
Entrenched Inequality
 While the elimination of the remaining racial laws will likely signal the demise of apartheid as a legal system, the disparities, inequality and hostility that have divided black and white South Africans under the apartheid system are unlikely to be erased as categorically.
Though public facilities like libraries and community swimming pools were legally integrated in October, many of these remain unused by blacks. Similar recent laws enabling some formerly white schools to accept black pupils when more than 72 per cent of the parents approved have so far to led the integration of 205 schools, a small number nationwide, with generally few black children admitted at each school.
Once the laws cited today are repealed, a black South African will legally be able to live in a white neighborhood and buy land previously set aside for whites. In practice, though, few blacks can afford it. The Government has not said that it will return land confiscated from dispossessed blacks, with little or no compensation, in the last four decades.
Some lingering resistance to change was evident in Parliament, where legislators of the right-wing Conservative Party, the official opposition, angrily walked out during Mr. de Klerk's hourlong speech. The Conservative Party leader, Andries P. Treurnicht, said later that Mr. de Klerk's plans to scrap the apartheid laws struck at the roots of white community life.
"It is surprising that South Africa now has the only leader in the Western world who is negotiating himself, his party and his people out of power," Mr. Treurnicht said.
 
White Liberals Gratified
 However, Zach de Beer, the leader of the liberal Democratic Party, observed that President de Klerk had promised to repeal the Group Areas and Land Acts. But, Dr. de Beer said, "most of us did not expect that the Population Registration Act would go this year, and we're pleased."
The Government had said that the Population Registration Act would have to remain in force until a new constitution extending political rights to the black majority was adopted.
But President de Klerk said today that "following investigation, it would, in fact, appear possible to repeal this act, provided that this is accompanied by the adoption of temporary transitional measures toward the acceptance of a new constitution."
The total elimination of existing racial distinctions would throw into question the legitimacy of Parliament, which now has separate chambers for white, mixed-race and Asian legislators, though none for blacks. Mr. de Klerk was proposing, among other things, keeping Parliament, and by extension his Government, intact through temporary legal provisions in place of the Population Registration Act.
Gerrit N. Viljoen, the Minister for Constitutional Development, told foreign journalists that the racial classification of all new babies or immigrants would end the day the Population Registration Act was repealed. He suggested that the racial classification of other South Africans, while still on the registration books, would quickly fall into disuse.
The President is not expected to have difficulty enacting his proposed reforms because his National Party and the liberal Democratic Party control close to three-quarters of the seats in the white House of Assembly. The leaders of the Democratic Party have consistently sought discussions with the nation's black majority, and in recent years, Mr. de Klerk has convinced many in his own party that such dialogue is inevitable.
 
End of Emergency Rule
 Since he committed himself and his Government to fundamental change, Mr. de Klerk has repealed the Separate Amenities Act, which let municipalities reserve public services for whites, has opened hospitals to all races, among other changes, and has ended a national state of rule by emergency decree, which restricted political activity.
Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha said that the measures announced today were not aimed at eliminating the economic and other sanctions imposed by Western nations, including the United States.
"What is happening today is confirming President de Klerk's clear statement that the process toward the dismantling of apartheid and fundamental change in South Africa is irreversible," Mr. Botha said.
 
Tutu Now Doubts Sanctions
 The Anglican Archbishop, Desmond M. Tutu, who attended the African National Congress march, told reporters there that President de Klerk's speech made it hard to dispute his seriousness about dismantling apartheid.
"We are getting very near to where it will be irreversible," said Archbishop Tutu, a prominent proponent of economic sanctions. "It is going to be very difficult for us to continue to ask for sanctions."
The Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act enacted by the United States Congress in 1986 provided that sanctions would end once the Pretoria Government released Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners, repealed rule by decree, legalized banned political parties and unfettered political activity, repealed the Group Areas and Population Registration Acts, and agreed to enter into good-faith negotiations with representatives of the black majority.
It further permits the President to suspend or modify sanctions once three of the last four conditions were achieved.
The President told Parliament that the constitutional reform he envisionedd had to be accompanied by economic growth to give blacks real equality. "Until the pressing problems of poverty and unemployment are alleviated," he said, "constitutional models will be of little avail to us."

 	 	 		--------------------	 		 	 	
 
U.S. Praise and Pressure
 WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler today called President de Klerk's proposals "dramatic and far-reaching." But she said that South Africa has yet to release all political prisoners or people detained without trial.
Current American sanctions ban new investment in South Africa; the import of South African arms, iron, steel, gold coins and farm products, and also bar South African Airways flights. They also restrict banking activities. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 		 	 	
 
Europeans Encouraged
 BRUSSELS, Feb. 1 (AP) -- The European Community's executive body said today that Mr. de Klerk's plans to repeal South Africa's major apartheid laws could lead to a softening of sanctions against the country.
"The enforcement of these initiatives will allow the community" to discuss softening the economic sanctions imposed in 1986, said the community's External Relations Commissioner, Frans Andriessen.

HEADLINE: Arts Officials Voice Shock at Cuomo Cuts

BYLINE: By GRACE GLUECK

 BODY:
"We are reeling and on the ropes," Senator Roy M. Goodman said yesterday. Mr. Goodman, a Republican State Senator from Manhattan and chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Arts and Cultural Affairs, was referring to Gov. Mario Cuomo's proposal for a cut of 56 percent in the budget for the New York State Council on the Arts.
For arts officials on the receiving end, the real news was not so much the cut itself as the size of it. 
 "We all knew there'd be cuts, but this is an outrage," said Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
Richard Oldenburg, director of the Museum of Modern Art, said, "It seems extremely disproportionate, a sign of the low priority Governor Cuomo puts on arts and cultural programs in general."
Calling the proposed cut "a staggering inequity," Mr. Goodman said: "It's from 3 to 6 times the cuts in such areas as school aid, parks and recreation and the State University of New York. It means that from the Governor's standpoint, the arts are a disposable commodity."
In his package of spending cuts for the fiscal year 1991-92, the largest in the state's history, the Governor recommended that the arts council's overall budget be reduced by nearly $25 million from its present level of $46.7 million, bringing it to $21.9 million.
 
'A Long Leap Backward'
 Senator Goodman noted that the Governor's budget proposals would cut aid to schools by 10 percent, to parks and recreation by 19.5 percent, and to the State University by 20 percent.
"The Governor's budget takes us a long leap backward to the dark ages of arts funding in the state," he said. "The ravages of inflation have been bad enough at existing levels, but the proposed budget causes the arts to suffer acutely in terms of real purchasing power."
The New York State Council on the Arts supports a wide variety of cultural institutions and programs in the state, from big-budget organizations like the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the DeWitt Historical Society of Ithaca.
For arts organizations in New York City, the cuts would come on top of severe reductions in cultural financing by the city, as well as reduced contributions to individual organizations from the National Endowment for the Arts. For fiscal 1991, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs' budget of $92.4 million was cut by $7.9 million and a further cut of $13.1 million is proposed for 1992.
 
Less Aid for Programs
 Because the National Endowment for the Arts was recently required by Congress to increase basic grants to states to 30 percent of its program budget of $125 million, it has had to make compensating cuts in the grants it makes to specific programs. It will thus have to lower by about $12 million the amount awarded cultural organizations and individuals who apply directly. In fiscal 1993, another mandated increase will provide the states with an additional 5 percent, amounting to another cut of $6 million in the program budget.
Asked whether the Governor's cuts could have been proposed in anticipation of more money from the National Endowment, an endowment spokesman said that even under the new mandate the total that would go to the New York State Council on the Arts in fiscal 1991-92 was projected at $727,000, only a small fraction of Mr. Cuomo's suggested cuts.
 "There's going to be less money from the Feds, and we're taking enormous cuts from the city; in the next fiscal year they're proposing $455,000," said Karen Brooks Hopkins, executive vice president for planning and development at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which has an annual operating budget of about $12.5 million.
"As for the New York State Council," she continued, "this year we received $316,000; so if you halve that, we're losing another $150,000 plus. It's devastating for us because there's no way to cover it. We've cut as deeply as we can, but it's definitely a crisis for us."
If the larger organizations are affected by the proposed cuts, smaller ones in the state are feeling overwhelmed.
"For us, it's a double whammy," said Joseph Flaherty, director of Writers and Books in Rochester, which operates programs in 20th-century literature at schools, hospitals and senior citizens' centers.
He said that 25 percent of the organization's $350,000 budget had been provided by the New York State Council on the Arts. "This year we took a cut of 7 percent; we're also getting cuts on the Federal and county levels," Mr. Flaherty said. "About half of our budget is earned income from programs we run, but with cuts like this we have to dismiss program people. So not only do we lose grant income, but the earned income from programs. We can't run them without core funding for administrative costs."
 
Primacy Is Threatened

 For many in the arts community, the unkindest cut was to New York's primacy in the arts. Some officials cited a 1983 survey by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that put the economic impact of the arts in the New York metropolitan region at $5.6 billion, including income generated from restaurant meals, transportation, hotel registration, sales taxes and so forth.
"That makes it even more difficult for arts organizations to understand why the cut is so drastic," said Tamara Watson of the Alliance of New York State Arts Councils, an umbrella organization for local arts councils. "It just doesn't make good fiscal sense."
Mr. Oldenburg of the Museum of Modern Art added: "It sends a very harmful signal nationally because New York has been the clear leader, in size of its arts budget, the scope of its programs, and the superb job it's done of encouraging the arts. This is a time when arts support on all levels, Federal, state and city, is under attack, and Governor Cuomo is in effect telling the country that the leading state thinks the arts are unimportant."
Officials at the New York State Council on the Arts would not comment, but issued a statement saying that the council would re-examine ways to continue providing "the artistic leadership that has made New York State the cultural center of the country."
The Governor's budget will go to the Legislature on Tuesday. "There'll be a lot of fighting," said Senator Goodman. "The Governor has been stopped before and we'll make every effort to do that this year. It may look like an anthill to him, but he's sitting on a volcano."
Senator Goodman added that he would call an emergency meeting of cultural leaders next Friday at 2 P.M. in Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center.

HEADLINE: Hollywood Abuzz Over Cost Memo

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1

 BODY:
An internal memorandum written by the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, Hollywood's most successful film studio, has quickly gained a wider readership here than any movie script, and set off a debate about the movie industry's inability to keep expenses under control.
In the 28-page document, originally issued to top executives at Disney, the studio head, Jeffrey Katzenberg, criticizes his own company and its rivals for succumbing to "a tidal wave of runaway costs and mindless competition" for actors and scripts. Since it was distributed to his colleagues on Jan. 11, the memorandum has been reprinted on fax machines at studios, agencies and production companies all over Hollywood, and by Jan. 15 parts of it had made their way into the trade journal Variety. 
 "If we remain on our current course, there will be the certainty of calamitous failure," Mr. Katzenberg wrote, warning that "fear and uncertainty in the real world" are likely to have a major impact on the movie industry in the months to come. "Costs have escalated; profitability has slipped, and our level of risk has compounded," he continued. "The time has come to get back to our roots."
Mr. Katzenberg suggested that in making "Dick Tracy," starring Warren Beatty and a host of other major stars, Disney itself had been guilty of the very practices he was criticizing. That movie, which grossed just over $100 million in the United States but cost nearly the same amount to film, market and promote, "made demands on our time, talent and treasury that, upon reflection, may not have been worth it."
 
Disappointment Expressed
 Officially, distribution of Mr. Katzenberg's analysis was to have been limited to about a dozen top executives at the Walt Disney Company. In a statement issued Wednesday, Mr. Katzenberg said he was "disappointed that an internal document that is an assessment of Disney's business, and only Disney's business, has found its way out into the Hollywood community."
Most studio executives, agents and producers, however, are convinced that Mr. Katzenberg intended from the start that the memorandum be a very public statement of Disney's principles and future direction. "He wants Hollywood and Wall Street to know that Disney learned a lesson from 'Dick Tracy' and won't make the same mistake again," said one producer, who spoke on condition he not be identified. "It's a brilliant analysis, but to pretend it was intended only for internal circulation is disingenuous, to put it mildly."
Though Hollywood executives have been talking in recent days of little else but the ideas raised in Mr. Katzenberg's memorandum, few have been willing to comment publicly on the document. The Disney Studios chairman singled out recent films made by its rivals Paramount, Warner Brothers, Universal and Carolco as examples of practices that are to be avoided.
Mr. Katzenberg was particularly critical of studios that, rather than developing scripts themselves, pay millions of dollars to acquire a screenplay or to hire a well-known actor or director, saying those practices are "a blatant admission of creative bankruptcy." Many movie executives believe his remarks were intended mostly for Jon Peters and Peter Guber, who have spent heavily to acquire the film properties that interest them since they were hired two years ago by the Sony Corporation to run Columbia Pictures.
 
Low-Budget Pictures
 "I didn't read anything that way," Frank Price, the chairman of Columbia Pictures, said at a news conference today when asked if he thought Mr. Katzenberg's analysis was directed at Columbia. "From my fairly casual reading of it, I saw only stuff that one should be in favor of," Mr. Price also said. "Make low-budget pictures and get big hits."
Mr. Katzenberg's other major target is the agencies that represent those who act in, write and direct the films Disney and other studios distribute. Mr. Katzenberg said that while Disney once "had a fairly strict and pretty successful strategy, which we referred to as our singles and doubles philosophy," most studios are now increasingly gripped by "home run thinking."
"Not surprisingly, this box-office mania is fostering a frenzy among actors, writers, directors and their agents," he continued. "If a leading star who received $6 million for his last film reads that another star is getting $10 million for a picture, he immediately calls his agent insisting on nothing less than $12 million for his next movie."
Hollywood's leading agent and the presumed target of those and other remarks, Michael Ovitz of the Creative Artists Agency, declined to comment on the memorandum. But other talent brokers reacted with a combination of irritation and amusement to Mr. Katzenberg's remarks.
 
'Just Say No'
 "It's not exactly a secret that he has no love for us, but I think he's gone out of his way to try to shift the blame away from the studios," one agent said. "Nobody is holding a gun to the head of any studio, forcing them to make this movie with that star. All they have to do is just say no."
With Mr. Katzenberg's memorandum, Disney becomes the third major Hollywood studio in recent months to make known its desire to move away from what the document calls "the dictates of the blockbuster mentality." Both Paramount, which has been Disney's principal rival over the last five years, and Warner Brothers, attempting to recover from a series of big-budget, big-name flops, had already let it be known that they intended to change course.
"We are putting fewer movie and TV projects into development in order to make sure that those we do develop are properly managed and nurtured," Frank Mancuso, the chairman of Paramount Pictures, said in a speech to the National Association of Television Programming Executives on Jan. 15. "To do this means not only more creative control but increasing economic efficiency as well. How much we invest is secondary to how productively we invest."
As part of its efforts to increase productivity and cut back on expenses, Paramount late last year announced the end of a longstanding association with the producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, regarded in Hollywood as the personification of the big-spending movie makers thanks to films like "Top Gun" and "Days of Thunder." Last month the pair resurfaced at Disney, leading to amused comment at rival studios that Disney was talking one way and acting another.
 
An Apparent Contradiction
 Mr. Katzenberg, who did not respond today to telephone calls seeking comment on his memorandum, addressed that apparent contradiction in the document. He argued that the producers' new deal at Disney is in line with Hollywood's new economic realities and will discourage any excesses on their part.
"I know that 'conventional wisdom' holds that they can only make giant big-budget movies," but "as usual, the conventional wisdom is wrong," he wrote. The deal with Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bruckheimer "will be structured so that they will be extremely well rewarded in success," he added. "But they will also be at substantial risk, along with us, in failure."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Not Letting TV Do Its Best Job in the War

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"Television is inherently a medium of simplicity," observed David Gergen, the White House aide turned journalist, at a forum put on this week by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Much of the day was given to criticism of television coverage of the war in the Persian Gulf from such other journalists and sometime journalists as the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Hodding Carter 3d. There was a lot of politics in the air, but Mr. Gergen's simple observation about simplicity seemed to strike most directly at the network news departments' current problems.
Television is at its most effective when presenting pictures that tell a story without many or any words. One does not look to the nightly news for complexity. It did not prepare viewers for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and is not likely to prepare them for the political and economic consequences of the American response. 
 What it can do, if permitted, is show, virtually while it happens, what war brings, especially on the receiving end. That is not the whole story; it may in fact be misleading; it is not likely to raise morale. But without that, no comprehension of any war can be complete. The pictures of damage that Iraqi censors have so far approved for export are too vague, and too plainly intended to make a point, to have much punch.
Only this week, for the first time, was the nation given glimpses of recognizable battle as land war broke out in the Saudi Arabian town of Khafji. There were tanks and helicopters on the move, marines under fire, a tall building being battered in the distance, and later, the remains of the recaptured town and the corpse of an Iraqi soldier, the first corpse of the television war. These pictures, although still somewhat remote, had the effect of focusing attention on how little actual warfare has been shown so far. (There were No pictures of the marines who were killed in the area.)
Without strong images, television reporting is either a return to radio as it was that first gripping but unrepeatable night or a display of stock photographs and talking heads, which have largely filled the hours since. One watches, absorbed by the details yet aware that television is not doing what only television can do. You want more yet fear to see too much.
There have been memorable pictures, such as the captured American pilots delivering their set pieces for Iraqi television and the perspective through the target sights of planes and missiles, but mostly the tube has provided official briefings, mild, sometimes boosterish interviews with troops in the field and experts galore. The latest Pentagon-supplied photographs of bridges being hit have a video-game fascination, but as the fellow says, if you've seen one . . .
It's all so far away, and expectations have been aroused by war movies: if a bomb is dropped, you get to see the bridge collapse.
Journalists are being kept from the action by a combination of the nature of the war and the nature of censors on both sides. As James Webb, a former Secretary of the Navy and Assistant Secretary of Defense noted at the Columbia Journalism School forum, the difficulty of covering the Gulf War is "absolutely ideal from the military's point of view."
To judge by a recent poll under the direction of Princeton Survey Associates, most people are satisfied with the news they are getting and think that military censorship is a "good idea." Complaints come, unsurprisingly, from those being censored. About 10 days before Bob Simon, the CBS correspondent, disappeared with his crew near the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, he said, "I suspect that the Pentagon, the Administration, would like war coverage to come back with F-15's taking off and landing, with aircraft carriers plowing the seas, with the kinds of footage that promote the kind of war which the Pentagon, which the Administration, would want to see on American television screens." The networks have complained about restrictions on coverage, but to no effect.
Opponents of the war, too, want up-close reporting, in the belief that only scenes of death and destruction can stir misgivings among the majority that supports the war. Today's military commanders, old enough to have endured Vietnam, when correspondents in the field became Washington's adversaries, evidently share that belief and are determined to keep reporters at a distance. The Pentagon won ground superiority over the press before it achieved air superiority over the Iraqis. The invasions of Panama and Grenada, from which journalists were effectively barred, were training grounds for the information officers of this war.
All those easily satirized retired generals and admirals and all those think tankists who have turned up (Mr. Carter called them "a dung heap of experts") have their uses. They have helped instruct the nation in the tools and tactics of modern war. But in relying so heavily on a technical approach and a trade jargon ("assets" for weapons is neat; "collateral damage" for civilian casualties is brilliant), the networks have found themselves playing the game by the Pentagon's specifications. War as a slide presentation.
 Those who attacked television coverage in Vietnam sometimes also lamented that the United States was forced to fight with at least one hand behind its back. In the Persian Gulf, it is the journalists who have their hands tied. Despite the best efforts of experienced reporters, network news has so far been giving the nation a controlled war, from afar and through the sights of the military. If the land encounters glimpsed this week are a signal of things to come, the pictures will grow grittier and bloodier, and many people around the world may find themselves thinking back wistfully to the days when watching the war on television was easier to take.

HEADLINE: Center for Auto Safety's Point Man

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
For Clarence M. Ditlow, the seeds of activism were sown on field trips to Pennsylvania factories when he was studying chemical engineering at Lehigh University.
He was horrified, he now remembers, as he watched workers at a steel plant scatter when molten wire cable spiraled out of control, and he shuddered as employees at a sulfuric acid plant raced to the parking lot to move cars threatened by a shift in the wind. "I was struck by the working conditions," he said, "and I was struck by the environmental conditions." 
 For the last 15 years, Mr. Ditlow, son of a Chevrolet service manager in Harrisburg, Pa., has been director of the Center for Auto Safety, the consumer advocacy group founded by Ralph Nader and Consumers Union. Now 47 years old, soft-spoken and buttoned-down, he would hardly seem out of place in the General Motors executive suite. But he has become one of the automobile industry's most formidable and visible antagonists.
 
Victory for Air Bags
 These days he is savoring victories in several long campaigns, particularly the one that will put air bags in at least 35 percent of the new cars sold this year. By 1995, he estimates, air bags for both driver and front-seat passenger will be as common as automatic transmissions.
"There's no way but for our hard-core advocacy of air bags, including all the litigation, that we would have gotten them," he said.
Mr. Ditlow's center seeks to promote not just car safety but all aspects of automotive transportation, including highway design and fuel economy. "We're pragmatists," he said in an interview in his small, plant-filled office just off Connecticut Avenue. "The car is here, so why not not make it more efficient, safer, less polluting and more reliable? Our goal really is to make the car more socially acceptable."
With an annual budget of $800,000 and a staff of about 20, including part-timers and interns, Mr. Ditlow is gearing up for new battles. The agenda for the 1990's includes these goals:
*Extending Federal safety regulations for cars to pickup trucks, minivans and utility vehicles.
*Requiring car makers to notify all customers when they extend warranties because of defects, rather than extending them privately, on a case-by-case basis.
*Preventing the trucking industry from adding a third trailer to tractor-trailer rigs, increasing the longest truck to 120 feet. The center maintains that the third trailer is hard to control, posing a safety hazard.
 
'I Like Being the Underdog'
 Fighting these battles will mean fighting some well-financed lobbies in Washington. That does not seem to bother Mr. Ditlow. "I like being the underdog," he said. "I like challenges. You don't last long in the public-interest community unless you really like what you're doing. I can't wait to get in here every morning."
The motivation is not money, it would seem. Mr. Ditlow, who has never married, earns $41,000 a year. But as classmates headed off to climb various corporate ladders, he recalls asking himself whether there wasn't "a better way to get involved in the decision-making process."
So he went to law school at Georgetown University, while holding a full-time job evaluating inventions at the United States Patent Office (a job, he readily acknowledges, that kept him out of the draft in the Vietnam era). After that, he went on to Harvard, where he received a master's degree in environmental law.
Under Mr. Ditlow, the Center for Auto Safety was active in the battle to impose the first fuel-economy standards on new cars in the 1970's. That battle goes on in the 1990's: the center is now seeking to raise the standards substantially. "I frankly don't think there's any place in America for a car that gets 15 miles per gallon," Mr. Ditlow said, adding that with new technology even big cars can get double that mileage.
But auto makers say such increases cannot be achieved without reducing both size and weight, jeopardizing safety. If the center "really cared about safety," asked William H. Noack, director of communications in General Motors ' Washington office, "why would they even want to take the chance that there might be more fatalities" with smaller and lighter cars?
Mr. Ditlow acknowledges that big cars are safer than small ones, other things being equal, but says there is still much to be done to improve the safety of small cars. And he notes that in recent years big cars have shed an average of about 1,000 pounds -- a reduced disparity that helps small cars survive crashes with big ones. The center also receives complaints from consumers: about 40,000 last year, either about "lemons" or about problems that may be widely shared, like faulty brakes or gas tanks prone to catch fire in crashes. About three years ago this process was computerized, enabling the center to search for patterns. Its usual response is to send out information packets, mostly tailored to specific problems, along with solicitations to become a member of the center at $15 a year.
About 40 percent of the center's revenue comes from members or other private citizens; Mr. Ditlow said there were no big individual donors. Twenty percent comes from the insurance industry, which shares the center's interest in auto safety, and from foundation grants. Thirty percent comes from the sale of written materials, notably "The Lemon Book" and "The Car Book."
"The Lemon Book," published about every 10 years (most recently in 1990), offers advice to owners of problem-plagued cars. "The Car Book," which assesses the new models each year, was formerly published by the Federal Department of Transportation but was discontinued by the Reagan Administration.
 
'We're Not Really Enemies'
 The rest of the center's budget comes from investments and fees generated by research for product liability lawyers, who are billed at $60 an hour. Critics complain that the center is overly chummy with such lawyers, compiling manuals like "Ford Park-to-Reverse" and "Jeep Roll Over," which have been promoted in legal publications. Mr. Ditlow defends the practice by pointing out that in return, these lawyers often supply the center with information available nowhere else.
Mr. Ditlow, who drives a 1987 Chevrolet Nova (without an air bag), says Detroit is shortsighted in its resistance to the center's efforts. "We're not really enemies," he said. "We'd like nothing more than to see Detroit make good cars. Consumer protection is good for car companies and for consumers both."
He noted that Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, was a fellow Lehigh alumnus. "He makes 'em; we recall 'em," Mr. Ditlow said. "We have a standing offer to stop our opposition when they stop making bad cars."

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
An Opposition Leader?

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The Persian Gulf war obviously has wide public support, enough to intimidate dissident politicians from standing up to oppose it. Someone, probably but not necessarily a Democrat, nevertheless may be missing an opportunity by holding his or her tongue.
 A number of factors suggest that support for the war will fade, perhaps even rapidly. For one thing, not every patriotic American who backs the troops and hopes for his country's victory agrees that war was necessary or wise. Before the shooting started, the nation was deeply divided; and today's enthusiasm may fade as prewar doubts and questions re-emerge. 
 For another thing, the inevitable ground war is beginning, once again confounding the rosy claims of air-power buffs; in Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf's words, that means "the best is still to come." He might better have said "the worst," since he referred to the major allied effort to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, a push expected to bring hard fighting and high casualties. Soviet generals long familiar with the Iraqi military, as well as U.S. analysts, believe the U.S. has underestimated Saddam Hus sein's and Iraq's fighting potential.
 Unsettled war aims also may portend declining unity. The recent Baker-Bessmertnykh statement seemed to suggest, for instance, that Iraq might end the war with a "commitment" and "concrete steps" to withdraw from Kuwait, rather than the previously specified withdrawal itself. But Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, says the war will not end until the Iraqi regime is destroyed, an aim neither the Arab allies nor Moscow embraces and one that the U.S. has not yet formally avowed.
 What happens if, after hard fighting, the Iraqis are driven from Kuwait but do not give up? The U.N. mandate will have been satisfied but not Israeli demands or the desire of many Americans -- probably including George Bush -- that Saddam Hussein be removed and Iraq's military potential destroyed. Will the war go on in that event? Would it then enjoy such wide support?
 Sooner or later, moreover, many Americans will question the priorities that place the gulf war ahead of crying domestic needs barely acknowledged by the Bush Administration. How long can it be contended that war against Iraq is more important than the nation's failing education system, its inadequate health services, its massive crime problem? How long can or should superpower pretensions be maintained, in spite of the nation's weakened economic and social bases?
 For all these reasons, and perhaps others, the potential for a strong opposition to the gulf war exists. On the home front, too, the recession may well be longer and harder than President Bush says he expects; and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggests that a long war might well cause a deeper recession. Thus, war and the economy might cause public opinion to move sharply against Mr. Bush.
 Who, in that case, would be the political beneficiary? At the moment, it's not surprising that none of those most often mentioned as possible Democratic nominees in 1992 are speaking out. Most no doubt remember that even an active and powerful domestic reaction against the Vietnam war failed to produce an outright opposition candidate in 1968; and that George McGovern, as such a candidate in 1972, lost a landslide.
 An opposition leader would have to weigh his words carefully in order not to be seen as undercutting brave American troops in the field. But the ambiguity of the Administration's intentions, the dark uncertainties surrounding a postwar settlement and numerous neglected domestic problems would provide such a leader with legitimate causes for his stand. He might genuinely argue, for example, that the most useful support for American troops is to spare them needless casualties in unwise battles.
 Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, whom some consider a potential Democratic candidate, voted against authorizing the President to start the war. His current support for American forces and American victory can't change that vote, or the impression that he believed the war unnecessary up to the moment it was started.
 A Democratic dark horse, Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska, also voted against war. He has a Medal of Honor, and Senator Nunn has a history of military support and expertise, as a defense against charges of being "soft." But it's probably too much to expect that either would take the undeniable political risk of leading the opposition -- even to a war that's likely to lose acceptability as the months go along.

HEADLINE: Why the Gulf War Is Not Vietnam

 BODY:
"It won't be another Vietnam," President Bush keeps saying about the Persian Gulf war. That's a sure applause line. Americans now agree that the long U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia was a disaster for America. But the President's oratory, and the applause, are confusing, because Americans still differ sharply about the nature of the disaster.
For liberals, Vietnam was an immoral war, in support of insupportable Saigon regimes. Worse, America lost its innocence through napalm attacks, carpet bombing and the My Lai massacre. The lesson: America should be wary of Presidential and Pentagon scenarios and go to war only as a last resort. 
 For centrists, Vietnam represents good intentions gone awry, proof that John F. Kennedy's summons to fight any Communist foe and bear any military burden was simply beyond America's means. Obsession with an unwinnable struggle distorted priorities and politics, ignited inflation and undermined patriotism. They, too, wish urgently to avoid another costly crusade in the name of American determination that ends up dissipating American resolve. To them, the lesson is: Pick wars carefully, fight with a sense of proportion.
For conservatives like Mr. Bush, Vietnam represents mainly a failure of political will. First, Washington forfeited public support by fighting a limited war, resisting, for example, military demands for all-out bombing of the North. Then, by withdrawing U.S. troops amid domestic political protest, America showed the world that it lacked staying power.
Conservatives believe that this showing invited subsequent policy disasters like Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Iran. To them, the lesson is: The United States must prove it has the will to fight for freedom.
Thus in the Persian Gulf President Bush moved rapidly to build up American forces. He quickly gave up on the economic embargo, which needs months to work. And he has lately been pressing for all-out military victory.
Are any of these lessons of Vietnam relevant to the gulf war? Probably not, if only because circumstances have changed so greatly. The United States is no longer in a global confrontation with Communism. And Washington can no longer afford the global commitments that a Pax Americana, J.F.K. style, would require.
The need to deter aggression remains -- with collective security, not new and improved versions of power projection in the cold-war style. That means not just financial burden-sharing and formal U.N. votes but serious commitments to joint diplomatic, economic and, if necessary, military actions in defense of international law.
In the days and weeks after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait, Mr. Bush masterfully organized a collective response. Then after the November elections he changed tack, stressing the military, and the American, side of the equation.
The best way to avoid another Vietnam is to move forward into collective security rather than slip back into fantasies about a Pax Americana.

HEADLINE: 100% Deposit Insurance Is Wrongheaded

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Let Every Depositor Sleep Securely" (editorial, Jan. 9) should give every taxpayer nightmares. Of all the proposals circulating in the name of banking reform, 100 percent deposit insurance has got to be the most wrongheaded. With the exception of an anomaly such as the case of the Freedom National Bank in New York City, that's what we have now, and it has undermined market discipline in banking. 
 Assuming you are correct that thecollapse of the Bank of New England threatened the local economy, deposit insurance is intended to provide stability to the banking system and not to protect a local economy, and certainly not every uninsured depositor. The Federal Reserve System is responsible, in its capacity as lender of last resort, for providing liquidity to good banks experiencing unusual deposit outflows. The banking system, indeed the national economy, is ill served by protecting banks that are truly bad.
Your "dream" of 100 percent deposit insurance removes any semblance of market discipline from the deposit-taking process. Market discipline can't be instilled by risk-based premiums unless they were established on an actuarially sound basis. Many banks can't afford the current level of premiums let alone the intolerably high premiums that would be required to maintain the actuarial integrity of a risk-based system.
The current deposit insurance system and certainly your 100 percent deposit insurance have a serious flaw that erodes, if not destroys, market discipline. That flaw is known in the insurance business as "moral hazard." It is a characteristic of insurance that reduces the insured's attention to the risks insured against. In the case of deposit insurance it makes insured depositors indifferent to the riskiness of the banks that hold their deposits. Rather, the incentive is to search for the bank paying an extra few basis points, which is probably going to be the riskiest bank since return is generally related to risk.
Risk is one thing, but as evidenced by many thrifts and the Bank of New England, one can buy an insured deposit from a failing or even failed institution. That's exactly the same as being able to buy fire insurance while your house is burning or, worse yet, after it has burned down.
An effective way of containing the moral hazard in deposit insurance has been suggested by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the American Bankers Association and others: Limit coverage to one account per depositor, require depositors to share part of the loss over the per account insurance limit -- 10 percent for example -- and do away with too-big-to-fail.
No change in banking structure and certainly not enlarged powers should be considered unless and until market discipline is established in deposit taking. A 100 percent deposit insurance system is precisely what not to do. If deposit insurance is not reformed to instill market discipline in deposit-taking, depositors may sleep securely but they will do so at the expense of the taxpayers.

HEADLINE: The Bad News Boys, Mr. Florio Cuts Back

 BODY:
Among the 30-odd states grappling with prospective deficits, New Jersey is in relatively good shape, thanks to big tax increases last year. But any deficit is difficult. Gov. Jim Florio's budget combines toughness, gimmickry and hope for only a mild recession.
Faced with an $800 million gap despite the higher taxes, Governor Florio proposes cutbacks for most agencies, layoffs for several thousand state employees and a salary freeze and higher benefit costs for the rest. It's a harsh but necessary menu. He would also consolidate several agencies and -- the big gimmick -- sell some highways. Selling roads is unusual, but other states have done it. 
 A year ago Mr. Florio got $2.8 billion of unpopular income and sales tax increases and a controversial new formula for channeling more help to poor school districts while cutting local property taxes. The uproar continues. Anti-Florio votes nearly unseated Senator Bill Bradley, and Democrats still fear they could lose majority control in this year's legislative elections. Running for cover, the State Senate's majority leader, John Lynch, wants to skim $395 million from the Governor's school aid plan, and parcel it out around the state for property tax cuts.
Given the dicey political atmosphere, and the inherent pain of spending cuts, Mr. Florio concedes his plan is negotiable -- a far cry from his inflexibility last year. There will be no new taxes, as such, but substantially higher tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike to support the sale of feeder highways to the Turnpike Authority.
Instead of retiring debt, the authority would use $400 million of surplus funds to buy connecting roads, but that requires higher tolls to pay interest on the extra debt. In addition to budget relief, the plan has fringe benefits: out-of-state drivers will bear half the burden, and some local turnpike commuters will switch to mass transit.
The Governor's plan is sufficient for the deficit he anticipates next year, but not beyond. He's done it with equal doses of courage and legerdemain. But salaries can't be frozen for long, and there's only a limited market for used pavement.

THE WARRIOR WORKER
The Challenge of the Korean Way of Working.
By Robert P. Kearney.
276 pp. New York:
Henry Holt & Company.
$24.95. 
 Of all the have-not nations that have ascended the economic ladder, few started lower, or have climbed higher, than South Korea. As the economics journalist Robert P. Kearney reminds us in "The Warrior Worker," when combat with North Korea ended in 1953, South Korea was a destitute land that seemed likely to remain so for a long time.
The country lacked not only an industrial base, but the raw materials and the infrastructure to build such a base. South Korea's economic success has been constructed on the vitality of its people. But there are only 17 million people in the South Korean work force, against 60 million in Japan's. And the first half of this century saw the Korean people "colonized, brutalized, exploited . . . dislocated by the millions through conscription and war and the division of their country, killed, maimed, and terrorized."
That is hardly the basis for an economic boom. Yet South Korea's growth over two decades has run three and four times that of the United States, while its exports grew by 30 and 40 percent a year in the 1960's and 1970's. By 1988, South Korea's Hyundai automobile was America's best-selling subcompact import, Mr. Kearney says, and a nation that once lived on American handouts was running an $8.7 billion trade surplus with the United States.
If that growth continues apace, says Mr. Kearney, "by the end of the century, this Indiana-sized nation will be one of the world's top ten traders and have one of its top fifteen economies." Its standard of living will rival that of Britain. Yet Mr. Kearney calls South Korea "the most unnerving Asian nation," and the prospect of so promising an economic future scares him.
He worries that not only will South Korea take additional markets and jobs from the United States, but also that it is setting a model for economic competitiveness other developing countries will follow. "If these nations are even half as successful as Korea," he warns, "American workers will find their standard of living, and the terms and conditions of their employment, in serious jeopardy."
The country's model is militaristic, says Mr. Kearney, with South Korean workers subjected to long hours, low pay, harsh discipline and authoritarian rule. "Korea is, above all, a glimmering advertisement for the benefits of fascism," he insists.
Even Japan doesn't worry Mr. Kearney as South Korea does. He argues that Japan was an industrial nation before World War II, and has merely regained its place in the economic sun. But South Korea, only a generation ago, was "a bombed-out back water, a pathetic dump of a country." He frets that "if Korea could come this far in a few decades, why not India, China, Indonesia? This is a rationale for paranoia that Japan has never offered."
Yet South Korea may never experience either the glowing economic or quasi-totalitarian future that so worries Mr. Kearney. It is already coming under assault from within and without. At home, its workers have grown militant in demanding more from the nation's prosperity. South Korean productivity is certain to slip, and with it some of its competitiveness.
Abroad, South Korea faces trade restrictions from its best customers -- the United States included -- and growing competition from developing nations, which, whether they have emulated South Korea or not, are competing with it.
Finally, the world economy has turned hostile since Mr. Kearney wrote his book. He warns that "another oil shock or a recession in the United States . . . could send [South Korea's] economy reeling." Now, we have both.
South Korea provides a story of economic success that is both grand and troubling. Whether it can build on that success is questionable, and Mr. Kearney's concerns about Korea's economic future seem overblown. Still, that's a minor quibble about an otherwise admirable book. "The Warrior Worker" is extensively researched and crisply written. It is definitely worth reading to expand our understanding of a nation, a people and an economy we should know better than we do.

HEADLINE: Emancipation for What?

BYLINE: By Eric Foner; Eric Foner is DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia University. His most recent book is "Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution."

 BODY:

FREEDOM
A Documentary History of Emancipation, 1861-1867.
Selected From the Holdings of the National Archives of the United States.
Series One, Volume Three. The Wartime Genesis of Free Labor: The Lower South.
Edited by Ira Berlin, Thavolia Glymph, Steven F. Miller, Joseph P. Reidy, Leslie S. Rowland and Julie Saville.
937 pp. New York:
Cambridge University Press. $54.50. 
 Future historians may well regard the work of the Freedmen and Southern Society Project at the University of Maryland as this generation's most significant encounter with the American past. A team of scholars headed by Ira Berlin has combed through millions of Civil War documents in the records of the Army, the Treasury Department and other Government agencies, and selected a few thousand for publication. The three volumes that have appeared so far bring vividly to life the greatest drama of the nation's history -- the liberation of four million African Americans from bondage.
The first volume, "The Black Military Experience," published in 1982, established the black soldier's critical role both in winning the Civil War and defining the war's consequences. The second, "The Destruction of Slavery," appearing three years later, centered on the black men and women of the South who fled to Union lines, thus helping to bring down slavery well before the Emancipation Proclamation. Now the series enters less familiar terrain. "The Wartime Genesis of Free Labor" proposes to trace in two volumes how new labor systems displaced slavery after the arrival of Union troops. A volume on "The Upper South" is forthcoming; "The Lower South" deals with the South Carolina Sea Islands, southern Louisiana and the Mississippi Valley.
Like its predecessors, this book represents interpretive editing at its best. Most historical editing projects aim above all at completeness. For Mr. Berlin and his colleagues, selection is the primary concern. The documents published here form part of a coherent historical argument, set forth in a long introductory essay that constitutes a major contribution to the literature of the Civil War.
The theme that unifies the account is the triangular struggle, involving former masters, former slaves and Northern conquerors, in which nothing less than the definition of freedom was at stake. Indeed, one of the volume's most profound insights is that rather than being an established, well-defined category, freedom was a terrain of conflict, whose meaning changed for blacks and whites alike during and after the Civil War.
To the former slaves, as a black minister told Gen. William T. Sherman, freedom meant "placing us where we could reap the fruit of our own labor." The best way to accomplish this was "to have land, and turn it and till it by our own labor."
Planters, whether loyal or Confederate, hoped to establish a new system as close to slavery as possible. Assuming blacks were either inherently lazy or simply determined to escape plantation labor, they demanded that the Army force the freed slaves back into the fields. To many planters, the end of slavery meant little more than an opportunity to throw off paternalist responsibilities. Even hardened military men were shocked by the frequency with which former slaveholders evicted the elderly and infirm from their plantations and discontinued food supplies and medical care for young children.
Northerners had traditionally viewed the wage earner, who lacked the economic independence necessary for republican citizenship, as less than fully free. But as the editors point out, the Northern definition of freedom was itself evolving in these years. As capitalism became entrenched, the hallmark of liberty became the ability to sell one's labor without hindrance in the marketplace, rather than the ownership of productive property. Thus, most Northerners rejected the planters' efforts to bind former slaves to the plantations. But most also believed that blacks could be genuinely free without owning land.
Overseeing the transition from slave labor to free labor was the Union Army. The Army itself began the employment of blacks as wage workers, using tens of thousands of them to lay railroad track, build fortifications and do other manual labor. Military commanders, however, were less interested in devising a new system of Southern labor than in winning the war. They often put refugees from slavery back to work on plantations simply to avoid responsibility for them.
Nowhere was the collision of competing definitions of freedom more revealing than on the Sea Islands. Among the participants here were: a black community that had achieved an unusual degree of autonomy before the war; Northern investors lured by a typically American desire to promote the "cause of Emancipation and human progress" while turning a tidy profit; military commanders; and Northern reformers bent on uplifting the former slaves. Conspicuous by their absence were the former slaveholders, who fled the islands when Union forces approached.
Despite the pleas of blacks, reformers and sympathetic military men, the Lincoln Administration did little to encourage black landownership on the islands. Instead, it auctioned abandoned plantations to Northern investors.
Many of the investors were self-conscious advocates of free labor, determined to prove that blacks were motivated by the same market-oriented desires as Northern laborers. In order to "multiply their simple wants," one plantation manager established stores with previously unavailable items like housewares, beef and fine clothing. The freedmen, he assumed, would happily work for wages in the cotton fields to improve their level of consumption. But the former slaves preferred to concentrate on food crops for their private use rather than on cotton for a market economy, and continued to insist that without access to land of their own, they had not achieved real freedom.
The situation in southern Louisiana differed substantially from that of the Sea Islands. Large numbers of planters remained on their estates, and the Lincoln Administration, seeking to weaken the Confederacy, hoped to bring the state back into the Union with their help. As slaves by the thousands fled the plantations, the Army ordered them to return under yearly labor contracts. Even after the initially low wages were raised, this system of compulsory free labor (extended to the Mississippi Valley in 1863) pleased no one, since blacks resented having contracts forced upon them and planters -- barred by the Army from using corporal punishment -- complained that they were unable to make their laborers work as diligently as slaves.
By the end of the war, nearly half a million former slaves had taken part in some kind of Federally sponsored free labor system. Only a handful were allowed to farm on their own. In January 1865, General Sherman set aside a large part of coastal South Carolina for black settlement. But before the year ended, President Andrew Johnson had ordered the land returned to the former owners. The final South Carolina document in the collection dates from December 1865, with three Federal tax commissioners protesting this "violation of the pledged faith of the Government."
One can safely predict that the volumes of the Freedmen and Southern Society Project (which will soon be moving on to cover such areas as the black family and black society ) will be examined by only a tiny fraction of those who watched the highly acclaimed PBS series on the Civil War. It is not easy to read the sometimes prolix reports of military commanders or the ungrammatical petitions of men and women just released from bondage. But those who persevere will appreciate something the television series never quite grasped: more than just a succession of battles, the Civil War was a genuine social revolution that helped to determine the very meaning of freedom for postwar America.

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON

 BODY:
A PEACE TO END ALL PEACE: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914-1922, by David Fromkin. (Avon, $14.95.) A historian tells how today's Middle East jigsaw was carved from the Ottoman Empire with the help of the British, who wanted to insure that they had a land bridge to India. " 'A Peace to End All Peace' is one of the first books to take an effective panoramic view of what was happening," Wm. Roger Louis said here in 1989. "Among the reasons for Mr. Fromkin's success is the breadth of his vision, which takes the reader deep into areas normally not associated with the Middle East."
VINELAND, by Thomas Pynchon. (Penguin, $9.95.) In this novel by the elusive and seldom-photographed author of conspiratorial fantasies, the heroes of chaos and entropy are led by an ex-hippie named Zoyd, sworn enemy of the evil renegade Federal prosecutor and champion of order, Brock Vond. Last year our reviewer, Salman Rushdie, called the novel "free-flowing and light and funny and maybe the most readily accessible piece of writing the old Invisible Man ever came up with. . . . What is interesting is to have before us, at the end of the Greed Decade, that rarest of birds: a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself, to its children, all these many years." Also available from Penguin is a matching edition of Mr. Pynchon's 1973 novel GRAVITY'S RAINBOW ($12.95). 
DEVICES AND DESIRES, by P. D. James. (Warner, $5.95.) When Commander Adam Dalgliesh inherits a cottage from an eccentric aunt, he finds the coastal community haunted by a serial murderer and a controversy over a nuclear power plant. "While it has the richness of a classical novel, this topical tale is told in a taut time framework and unfolds in the near cinematic scenes that are Miss James's style," Judith Crist said here last year.
BARBARIANS AT THE GATE: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. (Harper Perennial, $10.95.) Two reporters who covered the $25 billion takeover of a seemingly lackluster behemoth named RJR Nabisco show why we no longer hear Wall Street financiers crowing about how leveraged buyouts and junk bonds are really good for the economy and the American way. This account has "all the suspense of a first-rate thriller," Patricia O'Toole said here last year. It is "one of the finest, most compelling accounts of what happened to corporate America and Wall Street in the 1980's." Plume has republished another chronicle of what has been called the biggest deal of the decade: TRUE GREED: What Really Happened in the Battle for RJR Nabisco, by Hope Lampert ($9.95).
LORD BYRON'S DOCTOR, by Paul West. (University of Chicago, $12.95.) In real life, Dr. John Polidori, who briefly signed on as the private physician to Lord Byron in the hopes of promoting his own literary career, seemed a rather dull, self-important buffoon. In turning him into the protagonist of this novel, Paul West "imagines a complex character roiling with envy, spite, fury and, most of all, the desire to be Lord Byron." The result is "a powerful book, a disturbing and memorable evocation of the pernicious consequences that Byronism could have."
WHAT KIND OF LIFE: The Limits of Medical Progress, by Daniel Callahan. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $9.95.) America's worship of technology and the good of the individual over the commonweal has left us with a health system that is ineffective and unaffordable, an expert on medical ethics argues. Daniel Callahan writes "with elegance and lucidity," Charles E. Rosenberg said here in 1989. "He excels at describing present irrationalities and in underscoring the benefits anticipated in his new model health care system."
ORDINARY LOVE AND GOOD WILL: Two Novellas, by Jane Smiley. (Ivy, $4.95.) In the first of these stories about the breakdown of families, a middle-aged divorced woman confesses to her estranged children that it was she who destroyed their happiness by having an affair with a neighbor; in the second, a Vietnam veteran exiles himself and his wife and son on an isolated farm. In 1989 our reviewer, Josephine Humphreys, said the two tales are "mutually resonant, thematically linked in satisfying and subtle ways."
THE DELUGE AND THE ARK: A Journey Into Primate Worlds, by Dale Peterson. (Avon, $11.95.) After the author learned that a species of South American monkey had been reduced to about the size of the student body of his old high school, he embarked on a journey to visit endangered primates and the people trying to save them. "His book is a fine expression of [his hopes] and a passionate plea for more, better and larger arks, in fact for treating the whole world more like the ark it once was and still could be," Paul Schullery said here in 1989.
FELLOW PASSENGERS: A Novel in Portraits, by Louis Auchincloss. (St. Martin's, $3.95.) Dan Ruggles, a lawyer who dabbles in writing detective fiction, provides a behind-the-scenes look at the rich people who like to confide in him. In 1989 our reviewer, Isabel Colegate, said the best of these stories are "reminiscent of Somerset Maugham at his most urbane."
A SAFE PLACE, by Leston Havens. (Ballantine, $8.95.) In a series of case studies -- of a troubled student, a suicidal depressive, a schizophrenic, a physician preoccupied by fears of death -- a psychiatrist shows that it takes more than theories to help people. The book provides "an unforgettable sense of a professional healer who is so empathetic that one can almost see his mind reach out to embrace another," Richard Flaste said here last year.

WINDS OF CHANGE

BYLINE: BY CARRIE DONOVAN

 BODY:
EVERYTHING AFFECTS FASHION -- INCLUDING, undoubtedly, the fighting in the Persian Gulf. Paris designers just finishing up their spring couture showings, and those elsewhere who are deep into plans for next fall's collections, are as concerned, distracted and apprehensive about the conflict as everyone else. How all this will come together in cloth and thread is still to be determined. The only sure thing is that it will. History has shown that style inevitably absorbs the atmosphere of the moment and distills it into adornment.
But even before the current turmoil, the winds of change were whistling through the corridors of fashion. The most creative talents -- those whose sensitive antennae pick up the signals before the rest -- were already exploring new directions. Skirts, after all, have got to the point where they can get no shorter. Clothing that is so tight it clings to every curve has become commonplace. The skimpy look has reached its zenith, while vulgarity, expressed in excessive displays of color and razzle-dazzle, is now accepted as the norm. Unquestionably, the time is now for new moves. But what? 
 Shortly before the fighting in the gulf began, interviews with leading designers pointed out some of the shifts sure to give the international fashion scene a change of focus -- or perhaps even a jolt or two. "Fashion evolves; it's no longer a question of dramatic change," says Donna Karan, maybe America's most vocal talent. "Everything starts with the fabric. We're not going to lose stretch, but I'm looking for those that are crisper, that will hold their shape and not depend on the body to do it. . . . And I'm ready for a new shoulder with some shape." Shoes too, she says, are going to change: they'll be more chunky. As for new shades, "the shock of color is now commonplace," says Karan, predicting that "we'll be reversing to black."
 Over in Paris, two designers who wield worldwide influence, Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Lacroix, have already acted on their predictions. Lagerfeld's new spring suits for Chanel are made of the familiar tweeds, but these are now woven with stretch yarns. As a result, the jackets -- particularly their sleeves -- fit like snug gloves. These jackets are very long in line and go with skirts that are still above the knee, but not as short as before. Lagerfeld settled on these proportions after deciding "shorter you cannot go, and longer is too dull." But it is his shoes, with their bulkier soles, that give these new Chanels the distinct flavor of French fashion in the 1940's, during and just after the German occupation.
Lacroix, he of the famous flings of wild, wonderful colors and fanciful flourishes, now finds himself in a much more somber frame of mind. "This is not because of the war," he says. Rather, "it's a desire to design with more of an awareness of reality -- of what can be worn in the street, not in a fantasy world." He refers to his new silhouettes as "abstract and sculptural." And Lacroix is deep into black, white and pastels. His ball gowns, usually elaborate productions, will still be sumptuous, but more architectural in line and neutral in coloration.
Meanwhile, back home, Isaac Mizrahi, the imaginative, irrepressible new star, says: "I'm so bored with real life. We need fantasy. And color? All colors have now become neutrals." Mizrahi plans to make his fall collection a celebration of the variety of American ethnic influences. Just the other morning -- in the shower, Mizrahi says -- he decided to show as many midcalf-length skirts as short ones, because "the length of a skirt doesn't matter." Mizrahi adds that he detests 1940's-style platform-soled shoes -- "but that's my personal taste."
Bill Blass is, as always, brisk and businesslike. "In a soft economy, for whatever reason, women experiment with fashion," says Blass. "But I don't think a longer skirt is the answer. It tends to look dowdy." Blass's surprises will be in the way he puts colors together and in the use of contradictory fabrics -- a tweed strapless evening gown, for example, with a tulle skirt.
Down in Milan, Giorgio Armani, whose world influence is formidable, expects to stay on his serene path, making his elegant clothes "just a bit more modern and young."
As usual, Geoffrey Beene in New York has the last word. "There are just too many options today," he says. "All women are going to arrive at a 'uniform' look that works for them. . . . I said a decade ago that a chemist's tube was where the next real change would come from. We're going to have to develop fabrics that perform better." Abraham, the renowned Swiss fabric mill famous for its purebred silks and cottons, is supposedly working on some synthetics. Now that is real change.
The question is, where do all these winds of change lead the style-acclimated customer? Though it will be fall before most of these directions come to pass, it is clear now that there is an overall move toward a more subdued approach to chic. Beyond that, autumn will bring plenty of new options -- good news for those with an independent mind and personal flair, but not for women who want and need a fixed weather vane.

HEADLINE: They Shoot Presidents, Don't They?

BYLINE: By DAVID RICHARDS

 BODY:
Ever since he hunkered down in the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas and fired the bullets that slew President Kennedy, the question has refused to go away. Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone or was he merely the front man, carrying out the orders of others?
Not only does "Assassins," the audacious new musical by Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman at Playwrights Horizons, unequivocally endorse the conspiracy theory, it actually names the co-conspirators -- eight in all. If I tell you that John Wilkes Booth is one, Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme another and John Hinckley a third, then you may get an idea of what I mean by audacious. History lesson, carny show and bad dream all swirled into one, "Assassins" is a spangled celebration of America, a land where anybody can grow up to kill a President. 
 Mr. Sondheim has long since accustomed audiences to expect the unexpected. His musicals have brought the characters in a famous pointillist painting to life, rolled merrily backward in time and taken the Brothers Grimm one step beyond happy ever after. He has imagined beguiling songs for Japanese warlords, over-the-hill Follies girls and a barber with a hyperactive razor. Nothing, however, quite prepares you for the disturbing brilliance of "Assassins," unless it is the irony that has always been the constant in Mr. Sondheim's work. And even that has been raised to teeth-chattering levels.
Those who claim that his music requires repeated hearings before revealing its beauties will have no cause to complain here. The score is instantly appealing -- an all-American compendium of show tunes and Sousa marches, broad-shouldered hymns and wind-swept folk songs. But melody and message are purposefully, defiantly, at odds. Watching "Assassins" is rather like receiving a death notice in the form of a singing telegram.
You have only to consider "Unworthy of Your Love," a brokenhearted lament that would appear tailor-made for popular success. First, however, it will have to disengage itself completely from the show. In "Assassins," you see, it is sung by a disconsolate John Hinckley (Greg Germann), and while it is possible to appreciate the quiet poetry of the opening lines -- "I am nothing / You are wind and water and sky" -- by the time he's moved on to, "Tell me, Jodie, how I / Can earn your love," your hair is beginning to curl.
 Soon, an equally despondent Squeaky Fromme (Annie Golden) joins in -- pledging her unworthy affections to a certain "Charlie," whom I probably needn't tell you is Charles Manson. No one's forcing the issue -- certainly not the two performers, who seem to be shot up with Novocain. Yet when they're through, a simple, seemingly unassuming number has taken on diabolical overtones. Indeed, with no further ado, Hinckley draws a gun, turns upstage and fires repeatedly at a billboard-sized photograph of a beaming Ronald Reagan, while Squeaky goads him on with her mockery.
 The full contingent of assassins -- actually, the full contingent minus one, but more about that in a second -- is lured on stage in the opening number by the try-your-luck spiel coming from the congenial proprietor of a shooting gallery. "Hit the Prez and Win a Prize," proclaims the sign over his head. "Some guys/ Think they can't be winners," he coos, all slick and encouraging, "First prize/ Often goes to rank beginners." One by one, they let themselves be convinced and plunk down their money, before adding their insolent voices to the sweet refrain: "Everybody's/ Got the right/ To their dreams."
Thereafter, Mr. Weidman's book -- a scrapbook, really -- plays fast and loose with time and place. It thinks nothing of having Charles Guiteau (the assassin of President Garfield), for example, put the make on Sara Jane Moore (who bungled her attempt on the life of President Ford). Samuel Byck, a lunatic in a Santa suit who plans to divebomb President Nixon's White House, frequents the same saloon as Giuseppe Zangara, who moans that nothing will cure the sharp ache in his stomach, until a dapper Booth steps forward and suggests, with all due respect, "Have you considered shooting Franklin Roosevelt?"
For its first hour or so, "Assassins" seems little more than a revue, content to present its characters and their heinous deeds in songs, sketches and monologues -- some of which are sardonically funny. Sara Jane Moore (Debra Monk) is a true flibbertigibbet, as likely to pull a banana from her capacious handbag as she is a pistol. When she finally does lay her hands on the pistol, nothing says she won't turn it on her dog or a bucket of Colonel Sanders' fried chicken. While a sullen Zangara (Eddie Korbich), strapped to an electric chair, waits for the switch to be thrown, a clutch of Florida vacationers reaps all his publicity by boasting, in a lively patter song, "How I Saved Roosevelt."
Byck (Lee Wilkof) almost qualifies as a stand-up comic, as he dictates a message to Leonard Bernstein into his tape recorder, urging him to save the world with his God-given talent and write more love songs. Then, barely taking time to shift gears, he decides that Bernstein, with his hotshot life style, probably doesn't give a hoot. Nobody gives a hoot! And he's off to get himself a President.
As for the preening Booth (Victor Garber), well, isn't he an actor already? The other assassins call him "our pioneer," but he seems to see himself more as an impresario of the damned.
If you find yourself thinking that matters are a bit scattered, I suspect that you're reacting just as the show's creators intend. Early on, a balladeer (Patrick Cassidy), who serves as the unofficial narrator, points out that, "Lots of madmen/ Have had their say /But only for a day." We are being encouraged to look upon the various assassins as flukes of history. Their craziness passes. The country mends. Who even remembers Leon Czolgosz (Terrence Mann), the unemployed bottle maker who took up his place in the receiving line waiting to greet President McKinley at the Pan American Exposition in Buffalo, and instead of pumping his hand, pumped lead into him? There may be madness in their acts, but surely no method, no pattern, no connection.
Then, the turntable at Playwrights Horizons revolves 180 degrees to reveal the Texas School Book Depository and Lee Harvey Oswald (Jace Alexander). We'd almost forgotten him in the preceding hullabaloo. No matter. He doesn't look much like an assassin, anyway. He's entirely too preoccupied with his own collapsing life to hear the news on the radio that President Kennedy's plane is landing at nearby Love Field. What concerns him is the note he's busy scribbling, after which he intends to train the pistol in his lunch box on himself.
Booth won't hear of it. Suicide is such a wasteful gesture. Appearing from behind a stack of cardboard boxes, he tries to stay Oswald's hand and redirect it to a more consequential target. Called in as reinforcements, the other assassins add their supplications to Booth's: If Oswald comes over to their side, they will no longer be freaks and misfits. They will be a force, a dark necessity, a permanent shadow on the national anthem.
"Bring us together," pleads Byck. "We're your family," intones Moore. "You are the future," asserts Zangara.
 It is a stunningly theatrical ploy, even though the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Suddenly, the fragments of "Assassins" have coalesced in a chilling vision of evil reaching out to evil, and dark acts begetting dark acts. There is no coherent sociological explanation for the behavior of assassins, nor does the show pretend to offer one. They simply are -- the lurking side of human nature. They come with history. Mr. Sondheim and Mr. Weidman have produced a morality play about the forces of good and bad, and then boldly exiled goodness to the wings.
No musical in the last decade has dared this much.
If the form is thought to be quintessentially American, it is because for years musicals fostered optimism and endorsed enterprise. Their brash spirits, we liked to believe, were the country's. "Assassins" has no shortage of energy in the grand Fourth of July staging by Jerry Zaks, but it turns the musical's traditional values inside out and delivers a rebuke to George M. Cohan on his very own turf.
Loren Sherman's set design, which relies on tabloid photographs and period etchings for backdrops, artfully evokes the twilight zone where journalism meets history. And one look at Squeaky Fromme's red dress and kerchief (sort of latter-day French Revolution) is enough to convince you that William Ivey Long has the costumes just right. Ms. Golden's drug-fueled fervor is manifestly the kind that wants to burn down the world -- the only question in her eyes, black as a badger's, is where to begin.
If some of the performances are more vivid than others, some assassins, frankly, have been more colorful than others. Ms. Monk makes Moore's shrill discombobulations wildly amusing, while Mr. Garber goes about Booth's dirty work with arrogant majesty. Jonathan Hadary's religious zeal, as Guiteau, extends to his bristling coiffure, which is also striving to meet the Lord. This puts him at the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Germann, whose Hinckley is nothingness itself, hiding behind glasses and woebegone bangs. Splendidly cursed, all of them.
In "Gypsy," Mr. Sondheim had three tired strippers coach an inexperienced Gypsy Rose Lee on the secret of success. "You gotta have a gimmick," they told her. But, of course, you don't. "Assassins" lets us know that a gun will do just fine.
And you, too, can be a shooting star.

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Yielding To a Helping Hand

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
WHEN Timothy Protzman left his job at a Hartford radio station three years ago, he saw no financial danger in the month-long break before the start of his next position, at a local televison station. But that unpaid furlough was the beginning of his financial freefall.
Within a year his wife left work temporarily to bear the couple's second child, and with every passing month it was more of a stretch to make his paycheck cover the mortgage for their new home, higher day-care expenses and credit-card payments. By last summer he was two months in arrears on his mortgage loan and on his way to missing a third payment. 
 But instead of demanding back payment in full and late charges, which came to more than $4,000, Citicorp Mortgage, based in Shelton, Conn., the lender holding the Protzmans' mortgage, stopped the clock and worked out an agreement letting them pay back the debt over time if they could get back on track with current payments.
Citicorp's leniency with the Protzmans is not unusual these days. In the face of a rising home mortgage delinquency rate, banks increasingly are throwing safety lines to borrowers facing default.
This financial breathing room can come in a variety of forms: The lender can extend the loan by tacking the amount in arrears to the end of it; it can temporarily lower the mortgage rate; it can agree to let the delinquent borrower pay the missed payments over time, and -- in rare instances -- it can forgive part of the debt to avoid foreclosure.
"I have been in credit counseling for many years," said Beverly Tuttle, executive director of the Hamden office of Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Connecticut, to whom Mr. Protzman turned for help last October. "I have never seen banks more flexible, more willing to work with delinquent borrowers."
Until recently, banks were not particularly forgiving when a mortgagee fell seriously behind in monthly payments. Banking regulations say that mortgages in arrears more than 90 days are legally delinquent. At that point a bank can start proceedings to foreclose. So a borrower who had missed more than three mortgage payments could expect a lender to start talking foreclosure if the debt were not satisfied.
Now, however, banks are willing to work with borrowers to help them find a way to keep their homes if they run into financial difficulties.
Both of the Protzmans are working again, and in addition to their regular mortgage payment of about $1,000 for their home in Newington, they are making payments of $500 to $1,000 a month toward settlement of their old mortgage debt.
"My wife has always been pretty good with managing money," said Mr. Protzman, who is now in the Consumer Counseling Service's debt-management program. "But with the higher mortgage payments on our new house, and the expenses of another child and problems with the car, it did not take long to lose control."
Banks concede self-interest in these rescue missions. Keeping the families in their homes is their best hope of saving loans.
"WE don't want to take these properties," said Roger Williams, a senior vice president of the Dime Savings Bank, which last year formed an asset recovery division of which he is the general manager. "We don't want people to lose their homes. Foreclosure is the worst outcome for all parties involved."
Most lenders consider a mortgagee in arrears if a loan payment is more than 16 days late. After that, many of them charge late fees. In the past, a bank might wait until a second payment had been missed before contacting the borrower, but most do not wait that long now.
"The rate of success with this type of intervention is much greater if we can get to people early," said Tom Dolce, a vice president with Midlantic Home Mortgage, a division of Midlantic Corporation, the second largest bank in New Jersey. "Past a certain point most borrowers just can't be helped."
Some of the banks with the most aggressive customer recovery programs are those that made so-called low-documentation mortgage loans in the 1980's as a way to expand or hold on to their share of the mortgage market. At the time, these lenders thought they had a safety net in the underlying value of the residences.
But because home values have fallen severely in many areas, lenders now face the prospect of taking a loss when the sale price of a foreclosed property does not cover the mortgage balance.
Another reason banks will go to great lengths to avoid foreclosure is that the process, which requires court action, can be long and expensive. As the number of foreclosures rises, the time it takes for cases to work their way through the court system increases.
"You cannot discount the human relations relations aspect, either," said Raymond Teed, vice president of marketing for Astoria Federal Savings, based in Astoria, Queens. "In a foreclosure, the bank plays the heavy."
The Dime, Mr. Williams said, learned a useful lesson watching the troubles that befell lenders in the Southwest a few years ago.
"We saw that the banks that survived in that atmosphere were the ones that worked with the borrowers to avoid foreclosure," said Mr. Williams. "We will be as innovative as we can to do that with our customers."
Mr. Williams said that last year the bank, which has extended mortgage loans in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, "saved" more than 1,000 loans advancing toward foreclosure. He said he expects to see an increase this year as the asset recovery division's counselors reach more borrowers early in their delinquencies.
Banks are reluctant to disclose the extent of their delinquent loans. But data collected by the Mortgage Bankers Association, a trade group based in Washington that represents home lenders, show that the New York metropolitan region is following the national trend of more delinquencies. The association's National Delinquency Report, a quarterly publication of data on mortgage bankers, savings and loan associations, commercial banks and service bureaus, shows an increase in mortgage delinquencies both nationwide and in the region. In New Jersey, for example, delinquencies increased more than a percentage point between the third quarter of 1988 and the third quarter of 1990, rising in that time from 3.91 to 4.92 percent.
In Connecticut, delinquent mortgages represented 3.09 percent of all outstanding home loans in 1988 and 3.50 percent the following year. The data show that in the third quarter of 1990 delinquencies were up to 3.55 percent.
The Mortgage Bankers statistics indicate that throughout New York State there has been a slight improvement in the delinquency rate: It was 4.56 percent in the third quarter of 1989 and fell to 4.32 percent in the same period last year.
BUT some mortgage lenders in New York City say that the statewide figures do not reflect the gravity of the situation in the city and its suburbs, where home sales outpaced those in the rest of the state.
Statistics from the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision showed a considerable jump in delinquencies in the area embracing New York City and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. In the six-month period between April 1 and Sept. 30 of last year -- the months for which the most current statistics are available -- the number of delinquent loans went from 82,666 to 94,015. The figures, which track permanent loans on one- to four-family residences, have not been calculated for the last quarter of 1990.
The reasons behind these delinquencies are many. But most lenders and credit counselors agree that the economic slowdown has dealt a blow to the budgets of many borrowers. Many are young professionals pushed back on their heels by huge layoffs in industries like financial services, real estate, insurance and advertising.
"Some people are feeling the hardship for the first time," said Ms. Tuttle of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Connecticut. She described them as "people not familiar with financial hardships who often do not think in terms of preparing for them."
No matter what color the collar of the mortgagee, the loss of one paycheck in a two-income household can sink a borrower without a reserve in a matter of weeks.
Not only unemployment has put people behind. The loss of overtime wages as companies economize can be nearly as devastating as layoffs in households that have relied on extra income to pay bills. Also, lenders have found among their delinquent borrowers home buyers who are now feeling the financial pinch of the higher monthly payments on adjustable-rate mortgages.
Banks like the Dime, Astoria Federal Savings and Midlantic Home Mortgage are among those in the region that have established special units to help borrowers in trouble.
Mr. Teed of Astoria Federal said that despite his bank's willingness to spread a safety net for borrowers in a financial bind, the bank is not a soft touch.
"There has to be a business rationale in every one of our workouts," he said. "In each case, we have to see that the borrower has the ability to make the loan current and cure the default and there has to be value in the property to justify this approach."
Few of the cure packages used by lenders cut into their profits. Rather, these repayment plans delay their revenue by giving the borrower more time.
Some mortgage restructuring plans call for the borrower to pay the arrears as a single-payment "balloon" at the end of the mortgage term. Others add the debt to principal owed on the loan and require slightly higher monthly payments.
In cases where the borrower's financial problems involve long-term changes -- like a drop in commissions in a sales job -- some lenders may agree to a temporary lowering of the mortgage interest rate until the income increases.
"IF the borrower has little prospect of an increase in income in the short term," said Mr. Williams, "there is little chance he will be able to resume current payments, let alone make contributions to the old debt."
A temporary lowering of the loan's interest rate or some other form of restructuring of the terms of the loan involves closing costs -- including legal fees or mortgage recording costs -- that the borrower must pay.
Mr. Teed of Astoria Federal cited a plan for one delinquent borrower on Long Island whose 15-year mortgage was rewritten. He was three years into the loan when he fell behind and the bank rewrote the mortgage with lower interest rates and lower payments. Even though the family's income was stretched to the limit, Mr. Teed said, the bank justified this approach because the owner was also willing to subdivide and sell part of his property, which was very large, and use the profit to pay down on his loan.
When the mortgage went from a $300,000 loan to a $200,000, the monthly payments were cut by $1,075.
For another borrower -- a mother of two who fell behind after a divorce and whose delinquency of several months was well past the point of legal foreclosure -- the bank agreed to extend the loan and reduce the monthly payments to $300 from $350 a month.
"Again," said Mr. Teed, "the extension of the loan was justified because of the amount of equity in the home, and most importantly because we could see that she was making a serious effort to meet the obligation."
Banks that have sold their loans in the secondary market, which is a common practice today, must have approval from the investor before offering to restructure a mortgagee's interest rate or extend the terms of the loan.
When keeping the borrower in the home is not possible, a bank often will agree to take a deed to the home in lieu of foreclosure. In this transaction, the borrower gives title to the bank, thus avoiding a court foreclosure and its consequent blemish on his credit record.
In cases where the borrower is able to avoid foreclosure by selling his home, but not at a price that will cover the mortgage, the lender in some cases will forgive a portion of the debt to avoid the expense of a foreclosure.
Mr. Dolce said that while rare, these "short sales" have taken place when prices have declined considerably in recent years.

HEADLINE: Co-op and Condo Delinquencies Rising

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
IN a pattern showing up with increasing frequency at condominiums and cooperatives across the country, nine of the 31 shareholders at 210 West 103d Street -- a 50-year-old brick building in New York City's Manhattan Valley neighborhood -- have fallen more than 60 days behind in their monthly maintenance payments of about $725.
"It's one thing to be four weeks late," said Mark Schorr, president of the six-story co-op, where one-bedroom apartments sell for around $100,000. "Its another to be four months overdue. Our clock is ticking." 
 Time has already run out at Sherburne Village, a 96-unit condominium in Kingsboro, Mass. Collections there became so deficient just over a year ago that when the septic system failed the officers could not raise the $1.3 million to hook up to a sewer system. Instead, everyone had to leave temporarily and the vacant complex is boarded up.
"Its a real mess," said Don Lavallee, a former board chairman. In November, a court appointed a receiver to sort out the association's affairs because it could no longer pay its vendors. Many owners say they expect to lose their entire investment.
 As more people lose their jobs, it grows harder to collect monthly charges, which are vital to maintain such basic services as utilities, garbage removal, cleaning and structural repairs. In co-ops, the charges, or maintenance fees, also pay real estate taxes and the underlying mortgage.
 "It's becoming the No. 1 management problem of 1991," said Bob Kirkland, president-elect of the Research Foundation of the Community Associations Institute, a national network of professionals and elected co-op and condominium officers. At state chapters, around the country, he said, demand for education programs about collections, bankruptcies and foreclosures are "at the top of the list."
The institute represents 6,500 member condominiums and co-ops across the country with 1.3 million unit owners. It estimates that owners of 10 percent of the units in the Northeast and 5 percent in California are in default. The normal rate is 1 to 2 percent.
 In most places, boards are muddling through with a patchwork of temporary measures, such as dipping into reserve funds or special assessments. But, warn lawyers and managers, such steps are unlikely to sustain budgets over a long period.
 The problem tends to be compounded. Anthony Bryant, a businessman who owned an investor unit at Sherburne Village, said that when common charges were $96 a month he could meet them and his $625 monthly mortgage payments from rental income. But common charges eventually rose to $163 because of the sewer problem and to make up for rising delinquencies. Then an assessment of $1,000 was requested as legal costs and temporary pumping charges unbalanced the revised budget.
"It got to a point where I couldn't afford to pay and I don't expect I will ever catch up," said Mr. Bryant. He figures he owes about $3,000 in overdue charges and $10,000 in mortgage payments. The bank has taken the unit into foreclosure.
 Delinquencies on investor-owned units are a major problem. "When there's no equity left in the unit, investors lose interest." said Stephen M. Marcus, a lawyer in Braintree, Mass."Its not their home and they're not about to pay dues on a losing asset."
Also slipping into arrears are many condominiums used as second homes, again because the owner's vital interests are not so directly affected, said Charles Incandela, president of Maintainamation of Bohemia, N.Y., a management company.
 In New York City, well-established co-ops with high financial standards for admission -- some demand that buyers have a net worth two or three times the purchase price -- are well insulated from the delinquency problem. The shortfalls are most severe in their consequences in buildings converted in the last four or five years.
"Buyers paid top dollar for their apartments and were heavily leveraged," said Stuart Saft, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. When charges started going up because of rising taxes or a special assessment, "some people just couldn't keep up," he said.
 Mr. Saft, a lawyer with Wolf, Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz of Manhattan, which represents some 140 buildings in New York City, said that in the past his firm typically pursued about 10 deliquencies a year and mere threats of legal action usually cleared the matter up fast. But by the end of 1990 some 50 owners were being chased and only half had agreed to settle.
ALONG the Virginia coast, delinquency rates have risen from an average of 2 percent a year ago to nearly 5 percent, said Mr. Kirkland, who is also president of Professional Property Managers of Virginia Beach, Va., which manages some 11,000 units. Also growing, he said, is the time that owners remain in arrears.
 The traditional safeguards that prevented the build-up of overdue charges are no match for today's chaotic economic climate. Historically, as soon as a unit owner fell more than 60 days behind, the lender who held the mortgage would quickly take over the collection chore to try to preempt trouble with its own loan, insisting the owner pay those charges or face foreclosure even if mortgage payments were current.
 Such rapid intervention meant that the unit was either sold very quickly and the arrears were recouped from the sale -- there was ample cushion in a rising market -- or the owner was sufficiently shaken to pay up.
"Now the banks have got so many bigger problems on their hands they can take months befoe they do anything at all," said Richard Pepin, president of Signature Management of Duxbury, Mass., which handles some 2,000 units in Boston suburbs.
 While the condominium association or co-op corporation also can legally initiate a foreclosure -- after placing a lien on the unit -- it becomes prohibitively expensive to do when the number of deliquencies starts to rise. And the chance of getting enough from the sale of a unit in a falling market is slim since there is rarely anything left after the mortgage has been paid off.
Moreover, "it's very costly to keep hiring a lawyer, especially when you are running low already," said Jeff Guertin, board chairman of the 293-unit Century Estates Condominums in Framingham, Mass., who did research on the problem for an article in the November issue of the monthly Condo Management.
 A foreclosure can take more than a year to complete because the courts are now heavily backed up with foreclosure actions, said Robert Huhtanen, senior property mangager with Thibodeau Management Services of South Windsor, Conn. Thibodeau manages over 8,000 units, 10 percent of which are now more than 60 days in arrears compared to a prior norm of 3 percent.
 Another obstacle has been the rash of personal bankruptcies, which tie the hands of the association or corporation and may entirely wipe out the debt. "We're dealing with four or five bankruptcies a month," said Mr. Kirkland. Where the developer or sponsor still owns units and has also declared bankruptcy, shortfalls are further compounded.
MOREOEVER, assuming the financially strapped owner is eager to cooperate and is indeed trying to get out, it can take months to find a buyer.
 Some associations are cutting corners, trimming cleaning staff, shortening pool hours or closing down the clubhouse. Others are dipping into reserve funds.
"Fifty percent of our properties no longer have adequate reserves because we've had severe delinquency problems in Houston for three years now and this was the way they chose to get by," said Rhonda Burrage, a supervisor at Bay Area Property Management of Clear Lake City, Tex.
 Only by explaining those dangers to residents, said Mr. Pepin, did he recently persuade the owners in a 210-unit condominium in suburban Boston to accept a $110 special assessment payable over three months to recoup a $23,000 shortfall -- $18,000 from unpaid dues and $5,000 for collection costs.
 As the problem worsens, lobbying for corrective legislation is beginning. The Community Associations Institute is planning an effort to alert members of Congress to the seriousness of the situation. And in Massachusetts, managers and lawyers have begun lobbying legislators for "superlien" rights for common charges -- the ability of a condominium association to collect unpaid charges from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale ahead of the first mortgage holder.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Assessment Roll;
Changing a System of Unequal Burdens

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
BELATEDLY, assessments in New York City rose in the mid-80's to reflect the growth in market values. And now, again belatedly, they have begun to drop to reflect the decline.
The 7 percent drop in overall assessments may have been the most significant news embedded in the tentative assessment roll for the 1992 fiscal year made public at City Hall last month. It has been overshadowed for the moment by the awkwardly timed effort by the Dinkins administration to raise as much as $800 million more from the property tax than it is producing this year. To do that, tax rates will have to rise. 
 Homeowners on average would find their taxes going up about $300 a year from the average bill of $1,340 in the current year. Taxes on apartments -- rentals, co-ops and condominiums -- would on average go up about $230 a unit from a base of $1,430.
The biggest blow would fall on commercial property in Class 4, where billable assessments are still rising from past assessment increases on which taxes are being phased in. Additionally there would be a tax-rate increase of about 12 percent if Mayor David N. Dinkins's fiscal plan is fully enacted.
Property taxes in Class 4 would reach a level approximately double what they were in 1987, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. The year-to-year increase averages out to $1.28 a square foot. For a 10,000-square-foot office tenant, this is a $12,800-a-year rent increase, since tax increases are passed on under standard leases.
Apart from the anomaly of falling assessments and rising property taxes, however, the roll has an interest in its own right. It is the first to be produced under the leadership of Carol O'Cleireican, an economist, as Finance Commissioner. She has pledged a new openness and fairness in the property assessment system. On the first point, she has already made a notable contribution. But on the second, well-wishers may be permitted skepticism. Unfairness in terms of the ratios of assessed values to market values is legislatively built into New York City's assessment system. An argument can be made that the situation is growing worse.
"I know that reform will not be easy," said the Commissioner in a statement that accompanied the publication of the roll, which will become final following adjustments made by the Tax Commission after an appeals period. "But every long journey begins with a first step."
The first steps toward openness have already been taken. This year the Finance Department disclosed to the owners of income-producing properties the figures known as capitalization rates that assessors assign to categories of income-producing property. The assigned rate reflects their judgment of the current value of a building's income stream, or rents after operating expenses are deducted, to a buyer. Rates are influenced largely by geographic location and building age. The lower the rate, the higher the presumed value.
For example, if the net income is $100,000 and the assessors use an 8 percent capitalization rate, the assessed value would be $1.25 million. But if they use a 12 percent rate the valuation would be $833,300.
Last year, owners of so-called Class B office buildings -- older buildings in nonprime locations, including many in Manhattan that were upgraded or changed from manufacturing to office use in the 80's -- organized themselves as the Property Tax Fairness Coalition and commissioned a study by a Los Angeles consulting firm with a Manhattan office, Hamilton Rabinovitz & Alschuler.
"We found that the system as it was administered produced an unfair distribution of the burden on small older buildings compared with prime properties," Mr. Alschuler said. "There was no deliberate attempt at bias, but the lag between the marketplace and the ability of bureaucracy to react is too great."
WITH rents going down and taxes going up, taxes can be expected to consume over 30 percent of every rent dollar in these secondary, or Class B, office buildings over the next two to three years, said Stephen Green, chairman of S.L. Green Real Estate, which manages about three million square feet of office space, mainly in the midtown south area. Mr. Green was an organizer of the coalition.
On the fairness issues, however, Ms. O'Cleireican's task is more formidable. In the New York City assessment system, inequality among classes of property has been legislatively fixed since 1981 and in fact has grown. Many legislators would argue that fairness to small taxpayers requires nothing less. The issue has a history, all of it pointing to the conclusion that "fairness" usually implies raising the tax burden on commercial property.
To overcome a legal threat that the city would be required to reassess all property at the same relationship to market value, the Legislature in effect froze the existing relationships among the classes. Then it put a limit of 6 percent on how fast homeowners' assessments -- Class 1 property -- could rise in one year, with a limit of 20 percent over five years.
As homes rose faster in market value in the 80's than any other property class, they are now being assessed on average at 8 percent of market value.
This year, after two postponements, the Legislature is supposed to adjust the class shares. But it is to be based on changes in market value between 1989 and 1990. It is not likely to result in a radical shift.
Meanwhile, the City Council systematically used its authority in the 80's to lift 5 percent of the tax burden from one class and put it on another. It was lifted from Class 1 and shifted to office buildings and other commercial property. For these properties, at least in Manhattan, high sale prices in the mid-80's and an effort to lift valuations of unsold properties felt to be undertaxed led to rapidly rising property taxes.
As a result, Class 4 properties bore 52.9 percent of the property-tax burden in the current fiscal year, up from 41.5 percent in 1983. If class shares remained unchanged, they would pay the same percentage share in fiscal 1992. The class can be assessed at up to 45 percent of market value. There are no limits on how much assessments can rise in any single year, but higher taxes are phased in over five years under a transitional, or billable, assessment.
MEANWHILE, other small-property owners have lobbied successfully for the caps and phase-ins that have protected homeowners. Two years ago vacant land was moved from Class 4 to Class 1, protecting homeowners with yards that are separate tax lots. Earlier, caps and phase-ins were applied to smaller rental buildings.
The Finance Administration itself, in its proposed assessment roll, has decided to put certain "mom and pop" mixed-use properties under this umbrella, lowering assessed value for 1,500 properties to $1.3 billion from $1.8 billion. The reclassification occurs when 50 percent or more of the space is in residential use. In buildings with three or fewer units, the reclassification is to Class 1. If there are four to six, to Class 2a, or seven to 10 to Class 2b, which also have caps and limited phase-ins.
Among co-op and condominium owners there was an outcry a year ago when assessments leaped in many buildings. The Legislature had tried to protect these owners, too, by requiring that their assessments be comparable with that of rental property. But in certain cases assessors apparently found recently built rentals with close to market rents from which to derive comparables. In others, assessments on co-ops in high market-value areas like the East Side have been held down by the presence of older stabilized rentals with long-term rental occupancy.
Fairness, in a nutshell, will always be an elusive and ambiguous concept in assessments that are set at any less than uniform percentages of value. But if it is defined as the relative share of the tax burden borne by the classes in 1981, it is clear that a major shift away from fairness has occurred over the last 10 years.

HEADLINE: Delinquencies of Condo and Co-op Owners Rising

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
In a pattern showing up with increasing frequency at condominiums and cooperatives across the country, nine of the 31 shareholders at 210 West 103d Street -- a 50-year-old brick building in New York City's Manhattan Valley neighborhood -- have fallen more than 60 days behind in their monthly maintenance payments of about $725.
"It's one thing to be four weeks late," said Mark Schorr, president of the six-story co-op, where one-bedroom apartments sell for around $100,000. "Its another to be four months overdue. Our clock is ticking." 
 Time has already run out at Sherburne Village, a 96-unit condominium in Kingsboro, Mass. Collections there became so deficient just over a year ago that when the septic system failed the officers could not raise the $1.3 million to hook up to a sewer system. Instead, everyone had to leave temporarily and the vacant complex is boarded up.
"Its a real mess," said Don Lavallee, a former board chairman. In November, a court appointed a receiver to sort out the association's affairs because it could no longer pay its vendors. Many owners say they expect to lose their entire investment.
 As more people lose their jobs, it grows harder to collect monthly charges, which are vital to maintain such basic services as utilities, garbage removal, cleaning and structural repairs. In co-ops, the charges, or maintenance fees, also pay real estate taxes and the underlying mortgage.
 "It's becoming the No. 1 management problem of 1991," said Bob Kirkland, president-elect of the Research Foundation of the Community Associations Institute, a national network of professionals and elected co-op and condominium officers. At state chapters, he said, education programs about collections, bankruptcies and foreclosures are "at the top of the list."
The institute represents 6,500 member condominiums and co-ops across the country with 1.3 million unit owners. It estimates that owners of 10 percent of the units in the Northeast and 5 percent in California are in default. The normal rate is 1 to 2 percent.
 In most places, boards are muddling through with a patchwork of temporary measures, such as dipping into reserve funds or special assessments. But, warn lawyers and managers, such steps are unlikely to sustain budgets over a long period.
 The problem tends to be compounded. Anthony Bryant, a businessman who owned an investor unit at Sherburne Village, said that when common charges were $96 a month he could meet them and his $625 monthly mortgage payments from rental income. But common charges eventually rose to $163 because of the sewer problem and to make up for rising delinquencies. Then an assessment of $1,000 was requested as legal costs and temporary pumping charges unbalanced the revised budget.
"It got to a point where I couldn't afford to pay and I don't expect I will ever catch up," said Mr. Bryant. He figures he owes about $3,000 in overdue charges and $10,000 in mortgage payments. The bank has taken the unit into foreclosure.
 Delinquencies on investor-owned units are a major problem. "When there's no equity left in the unit, investors lose interest." said Stephen M. Marcus, a lawyer in Braintree, Mass. Also slipping into arears are many condos used as second homes, again because the owner's vital interests are not so directly affected, said Charles Incandela, president of Maintainamation of Bohemia, N.Y., a management company.
 In New York City, well-established co-ops with high financial standards for admission -- some demand that buyers have a net worth two or three times the purchase price -- are well insulated from the delinquency problem. The shortfalls are most severe in their consequences in buildings converted in the last four or five years.
"Buyers paid top dollar for their apartments and were heavily leveraged," said Stuart Saft, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. When charges started going up because of rising taxes or a special assessment, "some people just couldn't keep up," he said.

But by the end of 1990 some 50 owners were being chased and only half had agreed to settle.
 Along the Virginia coast, delinquency rates have risen from an average of 2 percent a year ago to nearly 5 percent, said Mr. Kirkland, who is also president of Professional Property Managers of Virginia Beach, Va., which manages some 11,000 units. Also growing, he said, is the time that owners remain in arrears.

HEADLINE: Businesses Try to Trim Health-Care Costs

BYLINE: By CHARLOTTE LIBOV

 BODY:
SPENDING $11.2 million to build a luxury hotel may not seem like a way to cut down health-care costs. But saving money is the idea behind the New Haven Medical Hotel. The hotel, designed to serve patients recovering from surgery who do not need a more costly hospital room, is one of several new approaches being used by Connecticut businesses to try to control spiraling medical-care costs.
As a growing number of companies rate employee health-care costs as their prime concern, some are installing health-management systems that penalize patients for not obtaining authorization for some medical services. Other employers are requiring workers to contribute more to their health-care costs. 
 "Every year, we do a membership survey to determine the major problems facing our companies," said Jan Spegele, vice president of the legal department at the Connecticut Business and Industry Association in Hartford, a business organization with 7,000 members. "This year, for the third year in a row, the cost of health care has been identified as the No. 1 cost concern for them, and, with the recession, it will be getting worse."
Like its competitors, the state's largest health-insurance carrier, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut, has been raising its charges for several years, said a spokeswoman, Paula Laudano. In 1986, the average annual Blue Cross and Blue Shield rate increase for groups with at least 50 members was 8 percent, she said. The average increase was 12.5 percent in 1987 and 23 percent in 1988. In 1989, the average increase was 36 percent and apparently will be the same for 1990 when current figures are compiled, Ms. Laudano said.
To help contain costs, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which serves 1.2 million people in the state, is instituting a system of "managed benefits" for most of its member groups, Ms. Laudano said. Under the new system, patients must notify the insurer when a hospitalization is imminent, so the expected costs can be reviewed. If the procedure is not followed, she said, the patient may face additional charges.
"If you can't control doctor's costs or what hospitals charge for an admission, maybe you can control that patients are not going in for a seven-day stay when they could go in for a five-day stay," she said.
But some physicians say the time needed to deal with the new insurance procedures will add to, not reduce, medical costs, said Robert Brunell, director of scientific affairs for the Connecticut State Medical Society, which represents 6,000 physicians.
 
Innovative Hotel
 "All of a sudden, the doctor is getting phone calls from people he's never heard of, requiring more paperwork and more time with a claim," he said. "These claims cost him more time, so the cost is probably shifted to other patients and third-party insurers."
Attempts to deliver medical care at lower cost than in a traditional hospital have inspired controversy, too. Blue Cross and Blue Shield said it is not yet certain whether to cover stays at the New Haven Medical Hotel, which opened on Jan. 7. The insurance carrier said it is concerned that the hotel it will increase the overall cost of patients' care.
The hotel features a 28-foot atrium, guest rooms with a total of 93 beds, a swimming pool, restaurant and cocktail lounge. The rooms are comfortably furnished and designed to resemble those in a hotel, not a hospital, said James Cullen, vice president for operations at St. Raphael Hospital in New Haven, one of the investors in the for-profit venture. Other investors in New Haven are the Temple Medical Center, which provides ambulatory surgery; Fusco Corporation, which built the hotel; United Illuminating Company, and 100 local physicians.
The hotel, the first of its kind in New England, charges $190 per night, compared to the average $500 charge for a semiprivate room at St. Raphael, Mr. Cullen said.
The hotel was designed to serve patients recovering from surgery without complications, including those who have undergone open-heart surgery several days before. It will also enable the Temple Medical Center, which offers outpatient surgery, to expand into other services, said Dr. Alvin Greenberg, a neurosurgeon who is president of Temple and the hotel's chief executive officer.
"We saw this as an opportunity to expand the continuum of care," he said. "It is more ambient for the patient, and it saves money, as long as it's safe and there are adequate quality-of-care controls."
 
Dispute Over License
 Blue Cross's concern about the hotel "can be summed up in one word: appropriateness," said Albert May, a spokesman for the insurer. In some cases, patients who might have been discharged to home care might be sent to the hotel, which will be more expensive, he said. Blue Cross said it is also reluctant to cover the costs because the hotel is not licensed by the state as a medical site. But Dr. Greenberg said he was told that no such license is required.
Like employers, workers are also concerned about health-care costs, but sometimes those goals clash.
For the past several years, United Technologies Corporation of Hartford has attempted to reduce the sum it spends on health care for its employees throughout the nation, which is $335 million annually, said Paul M. Thomson, director of compensation and benefits. Workers at United Technologies used to enjoy virtually free health insurance coverage, he said. But last year, a "flexible benefits" plan was enacted for non-unionized employees, who were offered a variety of plans, all which require workers to contribute to the cost of the insurance. The contributions range from 10 to 30 percent of the cost, Mr. Thomson said.
Labor unions that represent United Techologies employees are fighting what they have called an erosion of the health coverage that workers have traditonally enjoyed.
"The labor movement tried to establish a principle that organized workers were entitled to reasonable health care at the employer's expense," said Daniel E. Livingston, a Hartford lawyer who represents unions and employees. "Over the past five or six years, numerous employers have conducted open warfare against that principle. Sometimes it's been financially motiviated, because companies are in trouble. But sometimes it's used as an excuse to go back on gains workers have won in struggles over many years."
United Technologies had tried to create its own health-care network by contracting directly with doctors. The company had planned to create a nonprofit corporation called Valuecare to provide health services for employees of United Technologies and 18 other businesses in Connecticut.
In January, however, the employers decided to give up the effort, after only 250 doctors signed up, far short of the 1,500 Connecticut physicians needed, said Daniel O'Connoll, corporate director of human-resources planning for United Technologies.
Mr. O'Connoll said doctors were unhappy over Valuecare's desire to select among them. But Mr. Brunell of the Medical Society said some members of the group had voiced concerns about some of Valuecare's contract stipulations.
With Valuecare's demise, the problem of health costs "has not gone away," said Mr. Thomson. "We've really scratched the surface with what needs to be done in controlling health-care costs. It's a major national problem."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY ON THE GULF CRISIS -- PARIS;
Stepped Up Airport Security: Reports From Abroad and the U.S.

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

 BODY:
On Jan. 2, the first phase of a special security plan known as Vigipirate went into effect all over France, with 200,000 police officers and gendarmes placed on the alert. Phase two, declared on Jan. 17, represents the tightest security France has known since the 1954-62 Algerian war, with 3,000 "sensitive points" given extra protection. These include the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports outside Paris.
At both, to allow time for new security checks, travelers are being asked to check in 30 to 60 minutes earlier than usual. For Pan Am economy class passengers, for example, this means three and a half hours before take-off. Paris Airports, which runs the two airports, has also urged passengers to travel to Charles de Gaulle and Orly by bus or subway and not by car. Paris Airports said that, on average, half of all flights were leaving Paris 30 minutes late.
A spokesman for Paris Airports said the number of unaccompanied bags destroyed since the war began was considerably higher than the pre-war average of 10 a day. He said several bomb threats had required all or parts of terminals to be cleared, but would provide no details.
At Orly, where many flights to North Africa and the Middle East originate, passengers must now show tickets to the police before approaching check-in counters. Normal X-ray and metal detector devices then check passengers and hand luggage at the departure lounge. Arriving passengers are also being asked to show their tickets before being allowed into the baggage area. Arriving passengers are also being required to show a passport and answer questions when they head for the "Nothing to Declare" exit at Customs.
At Charles de Gaulle Airport, several roads and overpasses have been closed to allow police spot checks on cars. A spokesman for Pan Am said the airline was happy with security at the airport. This has not, however, stopped Pan Am from closing its only downtown Paris office for security reasons, referring all queries the airport.
The sharp drop in passenger traffic has helped security operations. Although January is traditionally a slow month, the outbreak of war brought a rash of flight and passenger cancellations. Air France said that a comparison of the third week in January 1991 with the same period last year showed an 86 percent drop in passenger traffic to the Middle East, a 44 percent drop to North Africa and a 23 percent drop within Europe, but only a 1.8 percent drop to North America.

HEADLINE: Balancing The Budget With an Idea Borrowed From Past

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
GOV. JIM FLORIO'S plans to stanch the flow of red ink and balance his $14.3 billion budget for next year include finding some novel revenue sources, including the funds of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which previous governors have tried to capture without success.
On Tuesday Mr. Florio met his constitutional obligation to present the Legislature with a budget that is balanced, at least on paper. He told the lawmakers that if they did not like any of his spending or revenue measures, they had better be prepared to come up with the money to pay for any changes. 
 "I come here today because it's my job to propose a budget," Mr. Florio told a joint meeting of the Legislature. "I do not come here with a monopoly on ideas. I know there are things in this proposal that different people and groups might want to change. Let's talk about it."
The Governor's plan to trim 8,000 jobs, some through attrition and buyouts but also with about 3,700 layoffs, has already drawn some grumbling from members of his own Democratic Party. They include Assembly Speaker Joseph V. Doria Jr. of Bayonne and Senate President John A. Lynch of New Brunswick, who are trying to find ways to keep party control of both houses in this November's legislative elections. Mr. Lynch generally praised the Governor's announced aims to make state government smaller and more efficient, but he added, "At the same time, our determination to arrive at a consensus spending plan for the coming year must not ignore the legitimate concerns of all the working people in state government."
The Governor's proposal to sell still unspecified state roads to the Turnpike Authority for $400 million and perhaps to siphon funds from other independent authorities is inspiring the most discussion.
Critics of the plan say that it may be illegal and will probably prompt a lawsuit from bondholders and that, even if it succeeds, it is a one-shot fix that will leave the succeeding 1993 budget with a $400 million revenue gap.
The plan to sell state assets to the authority came on the heels of Mr. Florio's announcement that he would approve turnpike plans to increase tolls on cars by 70 percent and on trucks by 100 percent.
The deputy Assembly minority leader, Gerald H. Zecker, Republican of Clifton, said the Governor's proposal could backfire. "The authority, which has financial problems of its own, would become responsible for the maintenance of these roads," Mr. Zecker said. "So motorists could very well pay for these 'savings' through higher tolls in the future. And I find it disturbing that the Governor would propose such an idea right after approving a toll increase for the turnpike."
But David J. Goldberg, the chairman of the Turnpike Authority and a former State Transportation Commissioner, said, "I told the administration it was worth going through the process of studying the idea."
He said that every Governor had felt that the state's independent authorities had a responsibility to help the state meet its needs and "are not totally insulated just because they are independent authorities."
He recalled that former Gov. Richard J. Hughes, under whom he served in the 1960's, once tried to merge the Turnpike Authority with the Transportation Department in order to use some of the authority's surplus for the state budget but that the idea was voted down.
 
Merger Proposal in 1970's
 John P. Sheridan Jr., another former State Transportation Commissioner, recalled that a proposal to merge the three independent toll road authorities -- the Turnpike Authority, the New Jersey Highway Authority, which operates the Garden State Parkway, and the New Jersey Expressway Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Expressway -- under a single authority and use some of the surplus for state programs was studied during the Cahill administration in the 1970's but never put into action.
Both Mr. Goldberg and Douglas C. Berman, the State Treasurer, said details of how Mr. Florio's plan would be put into effect had not yet been worked out.
"This represents an attempt on the part of the administration to get the maximum utilization out of a resource, and in that sense I'm not troubled by the approach," Mr. Goldberg said. "How we do it and whether it will work, we still don't know."
Mr. Berman said his conversations with state transportation officials, turnpike lawyers and the Attorney General's office "leave me with a high degree of confidence that it can be worked out."
Among the questions to be answered are whether the plan would violate convenants with holders of turnpike revenue bonds or the statute creating the authority and whether the Federal Government would have to be reimbursed for the highway aid it provided for construction of the state roads if the turnpike took them over.
But Mr. Berman said he had talked with Wall Street and had got a positive response because the state had made tough choices last year by increasing its tax base and this year by proposing cuts in the size of state government. Both Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service continue to give a triple A credit rating to New Jersey, one of the few states to enjoy this level of investor confidence, he said.
Last June the Governor's $2.8 billion tax program, which increased the state sales and income taxes, was enacted. It prompted protests from taxpayers and inspired the formation of protest groups who are working to roll back the increases.
Mr. Berman said he recognized the one-time nature of the plan to obtain the turnpike revenue. And he said if the money were going to support some new program, it would be an irresponsible move. But with the tax changes and the planned cuts in government staffing levels, he said, the state is poised to make a strong recovery from the current recession and should not need another infusion of revenue outside the normal tax base.
"In an ideal world, we should not rely on one-time revenue sources," he said. "But this is the real world, and this is a real recession."
Mr. Berman said the money the state hoped to obtain would come from a $2 billion bond issue approved by the Turnpike Authority during the Kean administration. It was designed to pay for a major widening program, but Mr. Berman said $700 million was spent chiefly on planning and environmental studies, prompting Mr. Florio last year to reject the idea of a toll increase for the authority. He said the Governor agreed last month to approve the increase after the turnpike outlined a series of improvements it would undertake in the next five years.
This program will cost $900 million and will leave $400 million from the bond authorization that can not be spent in that time, he said. "A toll increase would be needed anyway to pay off the bond revenues that were already spent," Mr. Berman said.
In his budget address, Mr. Florio also proposed merging the Departments of the Treasury and Personnel, which employ 6,500 people, and combining "dozens of divisions and agencies." He will also place all responsiblity for managing the state's $1.2 billion Medicaid program in the Department of Health, which now shares the responsibility with the Department of Human Services.
He said the program, which provides health care for the poor, made up almost 10 percent of the state budget and was "a major force behind the rising cost of health care."
But the major battle in the coming weeks will come with the unions representing state workers. In addition to the proposed layoffs, the administration wants to lower health and pension benefits for state workers and to forgo pay increases called for in state contracts.
Money to finance these obligations was omitted from the budget, and the administration is preparing legislation to reduce benefits, which Mr. Berman said were better than those for comparable jobs in the private sector.
State officials are negotiating with the unions about the proposed wage freeze. The administration contends that language in the contracts indicates the raises will be paid if the money is available in the budget. The unions disagree with this reading of the contracts and say they will go to court if the raises, amounting to about $188 million, are not paid.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY ON THE GULF CRISIS -- BANGKOK;
Stepped Up Airport Security: Reports From Abroad and the U.S.

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
Security has been heightened considerably at Bangkok's Don Muang Airport, hotels and Western embassies since the United States State Department issued a warning Jan. 19 of "possible terrorist action" here.
Tourist arrivals are said to be down as much as 40 percent.
Thai army soldiers are guarding Western embassies and patrolling the airport, and passengers and their luggage are being searched more intensively. The warning to travelers and residents said there is "a credible threat" of terrorism in Thailand and "neighboring countries" due to the war, and it suggested that Westerners "exercise caution." The warning is believed to stem from information that Iraqis with diplomatic status have been moving grenades and other weapons out of their embassy here.
The travel advisory, which has been repeated by the British and Australian authorities, has prompted complaints from Thai tourism officials. Tours are being canceled; walk-in trade is down; tourists here are switching to non-American airlines. Japan Air Lines says 10,000 people canceled bookings for Jan. 17 to Jan. 31, including 4,000 to Southeast Asia. Some United States airlines have canceled flights to Bangkok.
Immigration Department officials, releasing figures a week ago, said say tourist arrivals dropped 40 percent after the war began, compared with last year at this time, when 20,000 tourists arrived in Thailand daily. The recession is also a factor.
The head of the Thai Airport Authority, Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, said the number of flights through Bangkok dropped 10 percent after Jan. 15, but the drop in tourism wascloser to 20 percent.
Tourists moving through the airport said there was no undue delay or complications, and that security guards were polite and helpful.

Fraternities Adopt A Ban on Kegs At Their Parties

DATELINE: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.

 BODY:
Beer kegs will soon be a thing of the past at fraternity and sorority parties at Purdue University. Come March 10, it's strictly B.Y.O.B.
A new policy, written jointly by the Interfraternity Council and the Pan Hellenic Association, prohibits the use of fraternity and sorority chapter money for alcohol, including kegs of beer. 
 Richard R. Halderman, president of the Interfraternity Council and a senior majoring in agricultural economics, said the policy was a response to a court ruling that said serving alcohol from kegs was more of a risk than having a cash bar or having people bring their own bottle.
Because Purdue does not allow the sale of alcohol on university property or in any fraternity or sorority house, the Greek system has adopted the bring-your-own-bottle approach. People can take alcohol to a Greek house if they are identified by a hand stamp or a plastic bracelet as being 21 years old and if the alcohol is given to a bartender, who then gives out tickets equivalent to the number of drinks brought.
 
Alcohol Availability
 Mr. Halderman said the system should cut down on the number of underage drinkers at parties.
"The availability of alcohol is just not there anymore," he said. "When kegs were used, it was easy for anyone to drink from it. This policy shows we are not only concerned about liability but with safety, too."
The policy also requires the host fraternity or sorority to designate drivers and door monitors. A sober patrol comprising both fraternity and sorority members must check periodically at fraternity and sorority parties to make sure they are following the policy.
Melissa K. Bock, vice president of the Pan Hellenic Association and a senior in education from Midlothian, Va., said the policy changes may also help reduce incidents of drunken driving, date rape and alcohol poisoning, which have been growing concerns of Purdue students and faculty. The policy goes into effect March 10.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Bundesbank as Bogyman?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Both the Federal Reserve Board and the German Bundesbank moved key interest rates last week. On Friday, the Fed lowered its discount rate half a percentage point and was apparently trying to cut the Federal funds rate by the same amount. The day before, the Bundesbank pushed its key short-term Lombard and discount rates up half a percentage point.
While both moves were expected, the timing of each was surprising. 
 The German move raised disturbing questions about the state of international cooperation at a time when the Persian Gulf war makes economic management as difficult as it can be.
The Bundesbank acted just 10 days after the finance ministers of the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- met in New York. At the session, the United States tried to set a tone for lower worldwide interest rates. The hike in rates ordered in Germany reflected a power struggle within the Bundesbank, analysts said, noting that earlier last week, the central bank's president, Karl Otto Pohl, said an increase in rates now was not appropriate.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the Fed moved sooner to cut rates than many people thought it would. The lowering of the discount rate to 6 percent -- combined with the apparent effort to set a target for the Fed funds rate of 6.25 percent -- represented a new aggressive posture that reflected a deeper concern about the decline of the American economy.
The immediate reaction of world stock markets to the German and American moves was muted.
Equities rose in Europe even though the German move, which will have repercussions throughout the continent, could slow growth and hurt earnings.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.70 points Friday. But that decline came on the heels of a 73.77-point rally Wednesday and Thursday that was fueled in part by hopes for lower rates and an early end to the recession.
For its part, the dollar fell Friday to a new post-World War II low of 1.4680 against the mark, but the decline was not precipitous.
Of course, reactions to news events often are muted at first, even when there is an element of surprise. But some analysts said Friday that the shifts in rates would not change their outlook for stock markets for the year because such moves had already been incorporated into their forecasts. Nonetheless, the combination of higher German and lower American rates should push the dollar down at a faster clip than had been expected. This year, the dollar is already down 1.6 percent against the mark.
The Fed's actions show that board members may be much more concerned about the state of the American economy than Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, let on in testimony before Congress last month. At that time, he indicated that the recession could be over soon.
Now, however, it looks as if the Fed is starting to worry that the war in the gulf might drag on. Last week, Mr. Greenspan said in an interview that "if you get beyond three months, you begin to risk consumer confidence erosion and that would abort any meaningful recovery."
The lowering of the discount rate came within an hour of the release of discouraging economic data for January, the first month of the gulf war. Unemployment data for January and the newest report from the nation's purchasing managers showed that the economy may not be in for a quick turnaround.
As for the Bundesbank rate increase, that move "showed just how thick-skinned they can be," said George Magnus of S. G. Warburg in London.
The rise to 9 percent for the Lombard rate and 6.5 percent for the discount rate will increase the economic squeeze on Germany's neighbors in the European Community. It will make it harder for Britain to lower interest rates to fight its recession and for France and other countries to lower rates to counter their slowdowns before they become recessions. It will hurt the dollar. And it will, in part, shift some of the cost of the unification of Germany to its neighbors and allies.
"It is neither the appropriate timing nor the appropriate means," added Norbert Walter, the senior economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. What should the Bundesbank have done? It should have switched to a floating Lombard rate, Mr. Walter said, a move that would have amounted to less of an endorsement of higher rates.
Mr. Walter said that the rate increase appeared to have been pushed though by the presidents of the country's regional banks, which would have lost significant authority over monetary policy if the Bundesbank had switched to a floating Lombard rate. A floating rate moves with market interest rates, rather than acting as a stimulant for broader increases.
"It was not only a situation when there was a G-7 meeting 10 days ago," added Mr. Walter, commenting on the poor timing of the Bundesbank. "We obviously have a difficult situation with the economies in our neighboring countries," and the interest rate hike "is really posing a problem."

HEADLINE: Chasing Few Buyers With Too Many Tires

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

DATELINE: AKRON, Ohio

 BODY:
Tom H. Barrett has had a gruelling two-year tenure as chairman of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Since he took over, Goodyear, once known by its rivals as The Gorilla because of its dominance of the world tire business, has lost the lead to France's Groupe Michelin. And the tire business has taken a turn for the worst.
None of the top companies -- not Michelin, Goodyear or Japan's Bridgestone Corporation -- is faring well. And the uncertainty over oil prices, the unending price cutting and chronic overcapacity among tire producers, plus anemic auto sales, are likely to keep the industry in a tailspin. 
 There are simply too many tires chasing too few buyers. Despite consolidation of the industry into the hands of a few global companies over the last decade and the idling of dozens of plants, producers have been unable to raise prices as industry costs have increased, leaving them little choice but to cut their own costs to make money.
And here, no company has been any more aggressive than Goodyear. As the only publicly traded tire company among the top five, which also includes Germany's Continental and Italy's Pirelli, Goodyear is under greater pressure from investors than its rivals to post quarterly improvements.
Mr. Barrett and his top managers decided last summer to slash the company's capital spending and flatten the layers of management in its North American operation. Over the next two years, Goodyear expects to lay off about 3,000 employees, nearly 3 percent of its work force worldwide -- the largest layoff in its history.
"We have taken some actions that have been difficult, but they will help this company compete," said Mr. Barrett, a plain-spoken man from Topeka, Kan., who has been with Goodyear for 37 years, principally in manufacturing. "These are difficult times for us. And I get a little impatient that we're not moving as fast as we should in some areas."
With up-to-date plants that are as efficient as any in the industry, Goodyear may now be poised for an improvement. Indeed, since the company announced the restructuring, its stock price has climbed. It is trading at around $20, up from $14 in November. Still, that's well down from the $50-plus range of 1989 and last week, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it was considering downgrading some of the company's ratings.
"A lot of what they're doing is positive, but it's not payting off yet," said Dennis Byrne, a professor of economics at the University of Akron and a tire industry consultant.
Harry W. Millis, an independent tire analyst in Cleveland, said "Oil prices will probably be lower than people expected and Goodyear has done a lot of cost cutting that will show up in the next year," He expects the company to earn $120 million this year. That would be well below its performance in 1989, when it netted $206.8 million on sales of $10.8 billion, but better than 1990. The company has yet to report results for all of last year, but analysts project a net loss of at least $30 million on sales of more than $11 billion.
Tire makers are being tarred in part because they are captives of the auto market. The slump in auto sales has already caused auto makers to slash the price they're willing to pay for new tires by about 20 percent. At the same time, competition in the replacement market, which accounts for about two-thirds of the industry's roughly $47.5 billion in worldwide sales, is forcing companies to cut prices so deeply that profits are thinner than they have been in decades.
"The industry just doesn't seem to make any sense," said Professor Byrne. "It seems as though the major goal among the tire companies is to get market share and they will do anything to sell more tires than the next guy."
Earnings might have been healthier if companies had been shouldering less debt. Each of the top five has taken on a mountain of debt in the last five years either to make an acquisition or, in the case of Goodyear, to fend one off. For instance, Michelin, which recently said that it would report a $400 million loss for 1990, assumed $800 million in debt in its purchase last year of the Uniroyal Goodyear Tire Company. The acquisition vaulted it into the market-share lead, but brought its debt to $6 billion.
Goodyear is the only top-tier tire maker not to have merged in the last decade. Still, it has yet to recover from a 1986 takeover attempt by Sir James Goldsmith, the British investor. To fight off the pursuit, Goodyear sold its highly profitable aerospace division to the Loral Corporation for $650 million and took on $3.8 billion in debt, largely to finance a $2 billion stock repurchase plan. The company's ratio of debt to equity soared to more than 70 percent, from 30 percent, and has since fallen back only to the 60 percent range.
And Goodyear has suffered other headaches that rivals have not. A big one: The unprofitable 1,750-mile crude oil pipeline between California and Texas that it bought in 1985 as a way to diversify. Although the pipeline is designed to carry more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day, it is handling only about 100,000 barrels.
"The revenues are probably not running more than 10 percent of what they had anticipated," said Mr. Millis. "What should have been a $100 million-a-year positive is a $110 million to $120 million drag on earnings."
War in the Persian Gulf, should it push oil prices up, might yet make the pipeline pay. "The question is how good a project it turns out in the long run," Mr. Barrett said. "It has the possibility of doing what we projected." On the other hand, he added, "I'm not saying it's a great investment." And an oil-price rise would hit its basic business hard (box, lower right).
Mr. Barrett is putting more faith in the measures he has taken to retread Goodyear's tire operation. Under his management, the company has established 28 regional offices that report directly to headquarters here. Previously, 43 district offices reported to five regional divisions, which in turn reported to headquarters. In addition to realigning the company's divisions, Goodyear slashed its capital spending budget by about $125 million, to about $575 million last year. And it expects to cut the capital budget further, to $450 million this year.
But the retrenchment has zapped morale of Goodyear's 109,000 workers. Said one senior-level executive, who asked to remain anonymous: "People see the layoffs coming, which have never been part of the Goodyear tradition, and wonder when it's going to end. Employees are feeling a sense of fear of the future that is unusual around here."
When will Goodyear be able to raise prices and lift profits? "I don't see anything in the short term that's going to change and improve conditions in the industry," said John J. Nevin, now retired, who was chairman of Firestone until it was acquired by Bridgestone four years ago. "You've got a recognition on the part of tire makers that, to survive, they have to maintain strong positions around the world."
Professor Byrne contends that 15 to 20 percent of the worldwide tiremaking capacity needs to be shut down before supply and demand come into line. Michelin announced in December that it would close some old Uniroyal-Goodrich capacity. And Goodyear said it is considering some shutdowns of plants. Overall, though, tire makers have been slow to mothball plants.
 Some industry executives hope that further consolidation will improve conditions. Fifth-place Pirelli S.p.A., which purchased the Armstrong Tire Company of New Haven, Conn., in 1988 but is still considered a regional southern European player, last year proposed a merger with fourth-place Continental A.G. of Germany. That would create an $8.4 billion company with about 14.5 percent of the world market. Continental said in January it had no interest in such a move. But Pirelli, which claims it can muster more than half the voting shares of Continental, said it will take the issue before shareholders next month.
Mr. Barrett, meanwhile, seems only mildly daunted by the prospect of resuscitating the old gorilla. "I think you're going to see some improvements for the industry," the Goodyear chairman said. "I feel that Goodyear is a position to maybe improve at a better rate than the rest of them."
 
OIL PRICES ANOTHER PROBLEM
 One wild card in any recovery scenario for the tire industry is oil prices. Higher oil prices after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait put a dent in tire markers' margins. Tom Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, said their costs have increased at least 3 percent since August because of the oil price increases.
That, some analysts say, could mean the difference between making or losing money. The average passenger tire takes about seven gallons of oil or derivative products to produce.
"Under those circumstances you get killed on the cost-price relationship," said Harry W. Millis, an independent analyst in Cleveland. "You can only squeeze out a little black ink, if you're lucky."
Dealers have been resistant to increases in the price of tires, balking at the latest attempt by tire makers to raise prices last fall. Even when they do stick, price hikes are not always helpful. When Goodyear raised prices in the fall of 1988 by about 15 percent, dealers rebelled: Its share in the United States replacement market dropped to about 26 percent, from about 30 percent. Only after lowering prices to match the competition did market share climb back to nearly 30 percent.

Reverberations From a Forgotten Recession

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
When the word "recession" is mentioned on Wall Street, it is the downturns of 1974-75 and 1981-82 that are recalled. But there was another recession sandwiched between those two, one that has been almost forgotten.
That was the recession of 1980, and it may soon seem to be a precursor of our current recession. Then, as now, weak economies suffered a quick blow from an unexpected event. In 1980, it was credit controls imposed by a Government fearing inflation. In 1990, it was rising oil prices and falling consumer confidence, brought on by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
There are big differences between 1980 and now. Then, the problem was rampant inflation. Now it is the economy's excessive debt burden. But in both cases the sharp blow was short-lived. Oil prices are now down, just as credit controls were quickly lifted in 1980. In each case, the Federal Reserve responded by aggressively easing credit. 
 In 1980, stock traders responded with alarm to the start of the recession, and with glee to signs that it was ending. The Dow fell 16 percent in less than three months, but regained that ground within a few months and soon climbed above the then-magic number of 1,000. It hovered in that area until the spring of 1981, when evidence of a new recession sent it plunging again. The quickie recession, it turned out, had done little to solve the economy's underlying problems.
This time, the Dow also took less than three months to hit bottom, but it fell further, losing 21 percent of its value. Less than four months later, it has recovered about three-fifths of the lost ground. Last week, the Dow rose 71.28 points, to 2,730.69.
The signs of economic revival now are limited at best: durable goods orders rose in December, thanks to a surge in military buying, and consumer confidence showed signs of reviving after the war began. On the other side are a dismal employment report for January and an even worse survey of purchasing managers.
Still, Wall Street is betting that this recession will be over soon. It is following one of the oldest, and best, pieces of investment advice: Don't bet against the Fed. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, seems to be determined to push down interest rates, and evidently is quite unconcerned that the dollar is also tumbling.
Other Government officials are also scrambling to stimulate borrowing and avoid blame for the bad economy. Robert L. Clarke is well on his way to losing his reputation as a Comptroller of the Currency with a backbone. Now he says it is O.K. with him for banks to avoid writing down loans by declaring that the assets backing the loans are only "temporarily impaired," as if an increase in prices were a sure thing.
In 1980, the Government managed to end the recession by pumping the economy in every way it could. But while that pleased the stock market temporarily, it did no long-term good, and only set up the country for a longer, and deeper, downturn that began in 1981. That is a precedent that officials, and traders, might do well to recall.

HEADLINE: Hutchinson No Longer Holds Its Nose

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

DATELINE: HUTCHINSON, Minn.

 BODY:
Paul Ackland, Mayor of this prosperous little river city, noticed that his visitor was troubled.
"What's wrong with 3M?" the man asked. The pungent, chemical smell that meant 3M's two big plants were running was missing. The visitor feared that so, too, was the town's biggest employer. 
 It's just the smell that's gone, though. The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, best known for consumer products like Scotch sealing tape and videotapes, last summer installed $26 million worth of equipment to recycle and burn off solvents from the two plants -- in an area that already meets Environmental Protection Agency standards. After pumping 25 million pounds of volatile organic solvents into Hutchinson's air in 1989, "we are achieving 95 to 98 percent reduction" in emissions, said Carol Neis, a 3M engineer in Hutchinson.
Environmentalists and financial analysts alike say that 3M, perhaps more than any other major American company, is dedicated to cleaning up after itself through a program that provides case-study examples of how managers at all levels should handle environmental issues. It is nowhere near finishing the job, and continues to emit large quantities of toxic chemicals. But it has ambitious goals, and a record of achievement.
"They are one of the few companies that have been doing the right thing for years," said Barry Commoner, director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College and a long-time environmental activist. "They understand that the way to prevent pollution is to eliminate the production of toxic materials."
The Franklin Research and Development Corporation, a Boston-based investment firm that rates companies on social responsibility, has given 3M the highest ranking on environmental issues on a scale where 1 is the best and 5 the worst. "They are rated 1 on the environment," said Stephanie Leighton, an analyst at the firm. "That is unusual; most companies are down around 3."
At a time when companies big and small must pay closer attention to the toxins they release into America's air and water, the $13 billion company has melded its environmental strategy -- now 15 years old -- into all layers of management and production.
 
The Overall Program
 * It has been building environmentally sound processes into product design and manufacturing to insure that new processes are as clean as possible. A company policy that fosters innovation -- 3M wants to make 25 percent of each division's sales come from products introduced within the past five years -- means that engineers regularly revamp production processes and this provides easy access for pollution-reducing technology.
* In older plants, 3M is investing in pollution-control equipment. It says it will invest $150 million by 1993 to install state-of-the-art air pollution control equipment at its plants, a move that it says will cut air emissions by 70 to 75 percent from 1987 levels. It wants to cut all emissions 90 percent by the year 2000 from a base of 1987; it also wants to reduce the generation of hazardous waste 50 percent by the same date. Others -- including the Monsanto Company and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company -- have set similarly ambitious targets in recent years as public concern about deterioration of the environment has increased.
* At factories around the country, 3M is forfeiting -- rather than selling -- Federal pollution-reduction credits, a move it says will reduce pollution overall rather than merely allowing other companies to do it. (Box, page 6.)
* The company is using its environmental policy as a competitive tool, offering to help customers reduce their own waste problems by taking back some of its packaging.
* For years, it has been cleaning up its operations before state or Federal regulations force it to do so.
"The company is run by a group of executives who believe in making their own strategic decisions without relying on signals from the Government," said Bruce W. Piasecki, an associate professor of environmental management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. For example, it is digging up all of its underground chemical storage tanks, planning to replace them with above-ground units by 1992 rather than 1998 as Federal rules require. Above-ground units are considered to be less hazardous because they reduce the risk of leakage into water supplies.
"Like everyone else we are trying to develop new products more quickly," said Robert P. Bringer, 3M's vice president for environmental engineering and pollution control, the head of its environmental efforts. "But regulations have the opposite effect; they are time expanding. So if we get rid of the pollution, we get out from under the regulations."
As a business strategy, that gets little argument. "They don't do these things because they are in love with nature; they do it because it is smart," said Alfred Marcus, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota's School of Management. "Why spend the money to clean up pollution at the end of the pipe when you can redesign a process to avoid generating it in the first place?"
 
A Major Polluter
 All the praise notwithstanding, 3M has a formidable job on its hands. It has been a major air polluter for years, and it remains the largest emitter of chemicals -- among them, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene -- known to cause or suspected of causing birth defects, according to data filed with the E.P.A. The most recent figures available, for 1988, show that 3M spewed 61.3 millions pounds of toxic materials into the air -- 52.8 million pounds of them linked to potential birth defects. The second-worst company in the E.P.A.'s birth defect category is the General Motors Corporation, at 40.6 million pounds.
In their defense, 3M executives say that the E.P.A.'s classification of chemicals in the birth defect category is based on limited animal tests done at concentrations well above anything that would be encountered near a 3M plant. They also note that the new controls at Hutchinson and other facilities will sharply reduce emissions beginning this year.
Overall, on a list of companies that emit toxic chemicals to the air, land and water, 3M ranks No. 13. Topping the list are Du Pont, Monsanto and American Cyanimid.
"They are good salesmen," said Virginia Yingling, chairman of the Sierra Club's chapter in Minnesota, where 3M has its headquarters. "They are one of the largest polluters in the state. Our impression is they only make changes when it has a good public relations impact or when it looks like the state may take action."
Still, 3M has since 1975 operated a program it calls Pollution Prevention Pays. So far, the company said, 2,511 individual 3P programs have saved $500 million -- $426 million in the United States and $74 million overseas -- by altering processes to avoid the generation of wastes that would have had to be treated. The program has also reduced total pollution to half of what the company said it would have been, given the company's growth and considering production increases.
 
Bringing Initiative In
 At first, the 3P program was based on initiatives at the plant level. Then, in 1989, it was superceded by a more structured plan, 3P Plus. That plan calls for each of the company's 40 product-operating divisions to develop plans to minimize waste and increase recycling. A pollution prevention group monitors these efforts at the corporate level. Meeting environmental goals has become part of the criteria used in annual performance reviews for executives, reviews that determine pay increases and other benefits.
"We think the 3P program has been a model for industry," said Ms. Leighton of Franklin Research.
Some of those close to the company attribute its leadership on environmental issues to its roots in the upper Midwest, where access to the outdoors is highly prized and a clean environment appreciated. "People around here are very conscious of the environment," said Mayor Ackland of Hutchinson, where almost one-quarter of the city's budget -- the largest single item -- is spent on parks and recreation.
Whatever the case, Wall Street likes the company. "People have a lot of confidence in the quality of management," said Curt Rohrman, an analyst with the First Boston Corporation. "I don't know if they get separate Brownie points for their environmental stance, but it all goes into the mix. A lot of the expenditures they are making now on pollution control equipment is spending they will have to make some time, so it makes sense to do it now while profits are strong."
Indeed, 3M expects that the $26 million invested to clean up the Hutchinson plants will produce more than just environmental savings. It said the solvent recovery system at the videotape plant, for example, will save $5 million to $7 million a year in chemicals that had been lost to the atmosphere. That works out to a little under 4 cents per videocassette.
The company envisions other benefits, too. In addition to producing cassettes for home recording, the Hutchinson plant sells bulk videotape to companies that duplicate movies for sale to the public. The big rolls of tape -- called "pancakes" in the trade -- are shipped in plastic foam packaging to protect them from damage. The used packaging is then collected at customer sites and shipped back to the plant where it is used over again. This means 3M's customers do not have to pay for dumping the material into landfills -- an increasingly difficult and expensive proposition in the large urban areas where duplicating companies are located.
 
A Competitive Edge
 "This gives us an edge over suppliers from Japan or Korea," said Doug D. Ward, manager of the videotape plant. "They are in no position to recycle their packaging." Tactics like these have helped 3M hang on as the last major American manufacturer of videotape.
At retail, the cleanup effort also looks bright. "Green products will be a new area of product differentiation over the next 10 years," said Mr. Bringer. The company is already using some recycled wood fiber in its Post-it notepads and plans to use more once it figures out how to remove the glue from the pads.
Several recent surveys have indicated that consumers are willing to pay a little more for products that offer some environmental benefit. That's just as well, as the pollution-related savings are still a way off.
"That equipment being installed in Hutchinson adds to the price of a roll of Scotch tape," said Theodore F. Bolles, technical director of 3M's basic research laboratories in St. Paul. "That has an impact on the survival of American industry in global competition." The capital invested in them, as he and others point out, adds nothing to output and tends to put the company at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis competitors in areas with lower environmental standards.
But this doesn't mean 3M should retreat on environmental issues, Mr. Bolles said. Rather, it should develop methods of making things that are inherently less polluting than the ones now used. Research is a big deal at 3M, which spends 7 percent of its annual sales, or about $850 million this year, in the laboratories.
 
Cleaning Up Coatings
 A large percentage of the company's thousands of products -- from sandpaper to tapes to Post-its -- involve putting a thin layer of something on a base material. In the past, that usually involved the use of solvents, which were used to suspend or dissolve the material to be applied and then driven off with heat after application. The problem is that solvents -- like the toluene, xylene and methyl ethyl ketone used at Hutchinson -- combine with nitrous oxides and sunlight to form smog. The new Clean Air Act will tighten allowable emissions of such volatile organics and some state and local restrictions are even stiffer.
In some instances, water can be substituted for the organic solvents. That solves the emissions problem, but adds to energy costs because it takes more heat to evaporate water than the more volatile organics. Nevertheless, water is used for many of the Scotch tapes made here.
At 3M's research laboratories in St. Paul, different coating methods are being tested. Not one involves a chemical solvent. Scientists are testing materials that undergo polymeric reactions when exposed to light; they may become emission-free paints. Other experiments involve laser and electrical discharge treatment of plastic surfaces, enabling them to be coated without chemical preparation.
However, mindful of the negative publicity that manufacturers of plastic garbage bags received after bragging about biodegradability -- when degradability offered little environmental benefit -- 3M is making no advertising claim about recycled contents. "We will take a cautious approach on claims," Mr. Bringer said. He said as definitions of just what recycled means are developed, the company will market as "green" the products that meet the definitions.
 
POLLUTION CREDITS: OPTING FOR A TAX DEDUCTION
 In addition to trying to anticipate regulations and comply with them in advance, 3M has pledged not to sell Federal pollution "credits" -- which allow emissions -- even though it may do so under law and will lose money if it does not.
Companies that install equipment reducing air pollution in areas not meeting clean air standards earn credits based on the amount of the reduction. Under Federal law, these credits can be traded within a region. For example, if a company reduces emissions of a polluting substance by 100 pounds a day, it can sell the right to emit that much more to another company.
Such trading couples economics with environmentalism, or so the reasoning goes: Trading is said to reduce pollution by encouraging companies that can clean up at the lowest cost to do so -- and to let them make money by selling credits to those whose cleanup costs would be higher.
Not everybody agrees with this approach. Critics, including Barry Commoner at Queens College, denounce the practice as just "trading the right to pollute."
Executives at 3M have decided to take the environmental rather than the overtly economic approach by declining to trade any credits the company earns. It is returning any credits it earns to local air quality control authorities, thereby permanently removing that amount of pollution from the atmosphere.
"Top management felt if we sold credits all we would have done is transfer emissions, not reduce them," said Thomas W. Zosel, one of 3M's environmental specialists. "Making money by selling credits was not the purpose of the program. It was to reduce emissions." The company does, however, take a tax deduction based on the value of the credits.
So far, according to Mr. Zosel, the company has returned credits allowing the emission of 1,000 tons a year of organic solvents in New Jersey; 1,059 pounds a day in the Los Angeles area, and 140 tons per year in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. "We expect to do a few more" in 1991, Mr. Zosel said.
The Los Angeles credits alone could have been sold for more than $1 million, experts say. "Credits are worth $1,000 a pound a day in the Los Angeles market," said John S. Palmisano, the head of Arex, a Washington-based company that brokers air emission credits.
Arex executives said that while some other companies have occasionally turned in credits, 3M is the only one to have a stated policy of doing so.
 
RECAPTURING SOLVENTS

In Hutchinson, 3M has added the equivalent of a chemical refinery to its videotape plant. Its goal: to recover and re-use the solvents toluene, cyclohexanone and methyl ethyl ketone that, in the past, have been released to pollute the air.
At the plant, a system of ducts collects chemicals as they are evaporated off the tape soon after those chemicals have helped apply a magnetic layer that records sound and picture information on a plastic base. The fume-laden air is blown into one of three large tanks -- each 40 feet long, 12 feet in diameter -- that are adjacent to the factory and filled with activated carbon.
The carbon adsorbs, or collects, gaseous solvents, leaving almost completely clean air to be exhausted to the outside. Once a tank begins to approach the limit of its adsorbing capacity, it is taken off line and purged with steam. The solvents are driven out of the carbon by the steam. The steam-and-solvent mixture is transferred to another vessel, where the steam condenses into water. The mixed solvents then are separated in a distillation tower and prepared for re-use in the plant.
Because the solvents are so critical to the quality of the videotape produced, 3M technicans are still testing the recycled product for this use.
But eventually, according to 3M engineers, the recovered solvents are expected to be purer than any they can buy commercially. The recovery system is expected to save the company from $5 million to $7 million a year in purchases of new solvents.

THE ECONOMY
 
Greenspan Points a Finger at the Persian Gulf War
 
Jittery consumers and rising unemployment have made Alan Greenspan change his optimistic tone. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Board chairman said that if the war drags on for more than three months, consumers will turn gloomy and the recession will become severe. On Friday, with a dismal unemployment report, he led the board in a unanimous vote to lower the discount rate a half-point to 6 percent, the second cut in six weeks. Banks responded by reducing their prime lending rate a half-point also, to 9 percent. Mr. Greenspan might be doing some pre-emptive rate-cutting and explaining. Politicians say he shares the blame for the recession, President Bush used his State of the Union address to press for lower interest rates, and Mr. Greenspan comes up for reappointment in August. If the economy does crash, Mr. Greenspan is in effect saying blame the war, not me.

The Falling Payroll
 
So much for the notion of a stabilizing economy. The Government said Friday that the nation's payrolls fell by 232,000 jobs and that the average workweek was a half-hour shorter in January. The unemployment rate climbed only one-tenth of a point, to 6.2 percent for the month, the highest rate since 1987, but analysts agreed that the figure understated the deterioration of the economy.

Is It Over Yet?
 
The bleak unemployment picture undermined the weak hint of a recovery in the Government's forecasting gauge, which sent the stock market on a brief mid-week spree. The index of leading indicators for December rose one-tenth of 1 percent, the first sign of growth in six months. Last week's figures on durable goods orders and personal income also came in rosier than expected, if not in full bloom. But many economists want to wait until March or April to decide if sunnier days are truly here. "You have to see three or four months before you see a story," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. The decline might be slowing, he said, but he won't declare the recession over.
 
America's Medical Bill
 
It's as if corporate America's largest stockholders, and most insistent greenmailers, were the M.D.'s. Last year, medical costs swallowed up 26 percent of the average company's earnings. The average cost for each employee rose 17.1 percent to $3,217, according to a survey that A. Foster Higgins & Company, a benefits consulting firm, publicized last week. "You cannot have increases like that and continue to be competitive internationally," said Philip R. Lee, who directs the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California at San Francisco. Costs were highest, at $3,500 an employee, in the Middle Atlantic region, which has relatively few cost-containment plans. Dr. Lee admits that, as an Assistant Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the 1960's, he was mistaken to expand the supply of doctors in hopes of controlling costs. In general, he now says, the more doctors per capita, the higher a state's medical costs. Many doctors aim to achieve target incomes with busy practices that generate a host of tests and hospital admissions.

The Fed's Chain Reaction
 
Minutes after the Government released unemployment figures for January on Friday, the Federal Reserve lowered the boom on interest rates to stimulate the economy. The move set off a chain reaction among the banks, including J.P. Morgan and Citibank, which lowered their rates. But economists say further cuts will be needed before the economy changes direction. And many are much grimmer about the forecast, saying hard times may last until next year rather than this summer.
 
Dissension on the Bank Fund
 
Last week, L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator, sounded more optimistic about the banking system than either the White House or Congress. Mr. Seidman, remember, was so gloomy last year that Administration officials frequently urged him to leave public life. On Thursday, he said no taxpayer bailout would be needed to keep the bank insurance fund afloat. The fund, rapidly dwindling, will remain solvent, he said, adding, "There is no crisis here." The Office of Management and Budget predicted that the fund will have a deficit in 1992; the Congressional Budget Office predicted one by the end of 1991.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Intel's Japanese-Style Strategy
 
Let other companies scatter their money on high dividends and other means of filling short-term investors with glee. The Intel Corporation will spend as much as $1 billion this year on plant and equipment, probably outdoing any other semiconductor company in the United States or Japan. In the flush times of 1988, Intel spent $450 million. The company is adopting the Japanese strategy of raising capital spending in a recession to charge ahead of competitors.
 
Unfair Advantage for Airlines?
 
Finally, Eastern Airlines' creditors heard some unexpected good news: the carrier's airport gates and flight slots have brought so much interest that the bankruptcy judge handling the liquidation has scheduled an auction for Monday. Airlines are among the likely bidders. The Justice Department's antitrust lawyers -- sensing something anti-competitive about, say, Delta Air Lines maybe having 87 percent of Atlanta's passengers -- have promised to review the sales.
 
A new No. 1 to the sun? Airlines trying to climb out of bankruptcy proceedings usually don't look for ways to expand. But Continental Airlines is trying to capture Eastern Airline's traffic between New York and Florida. Continental added 32 flights last week -- a dozen from Newark to Florida.
 
I.R.S. Catches an Outlaw
 
Farmers are now doing well enough to organize a concert called "Willie-Aid." Mr. Nelson has long cultivated an image as a musical renegade, an outlaw, and now the Internal Revenue Service has taken him at his word, demanding $16.7 million in back taxes. The I.R.S. has auctioned off his Texas ranch, his grand piano and a golf cart shaped like a Rolls-Royce. If the proceeds fall short of the tax bills, Willie Nelson's fans -- Texans, country music lovers and other prideful separatists -- will find that going to his concerts means supporting the Treasury of the United States.
 
Gannett's Tonic for Low Profits
 
The Gannett Company posted its first annual earnings decline since going public in 1967. It is the nation's largest chain of newspapers; its flagship, USA Today, is known to be sassy, quick-reading and upbeat. Gannett earned $377 million, about $20 million less than the year before. The company's advice:
* Don't blame us. The economy's bad.
* Hold the stock. Things might get better.
* Buy our newspapers to cheer you up.
 
USX Separation
 
The USX Corporation filed papers last week for a trial separation from its traditional business of making steel. At the insistence of Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest stockholder, USX agreed to separate its energy and steel operations by issuing new stock for the steel. Mr. Icahn, who has said that spinning off steel would raise the value of USX shares, agreed to buy no more of the company's stock for seven years.
 
Rules of Auction
 
New York's leading auction houses defended their right last week to accept bids from inanimate objects like chandeliers. Auctioneers recognize "chandelier bids" to get things going when nobody else bids an item up to the secret minimum price. The practice is legal in New York City, but some at a state legislative hearing on Wednesday questioned whether it should be. "It's nothing short of an effort to deceive people into thinking there's real competition when their isn't any," said one leading dealer. But John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, said a secret reserve price is a " time-tested and universally accepted device to protect sellers from accepting too low a price."
 
In Brief
 
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation Ltd. reached an agreement last week to reschedule $7.8 billion in debts due this month. The debts, which underwrote Mr. Murdoch's global media expansion, are now due in February 1994.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Fighting Inflation in Brazil
 
All it took to set off a run on cooking gas in Brazil was for President Fernando Collor de Mello to go on television with a warning to conserve it. On Thursday, his Government tried to order a halt to inflation; the monthly rate is now 20 percent. It froze wages and prices and abolished inflation-indexed savings accounts. The plan's success is at best uncertain. The Government insists that the move is an extension of the inflation-fighting program unveiled last year, which included freezing about two-thirds of the money supply. Wage and price controls during the late 1980's capped inflation only temporarily, and now Brazil has fallen into the worst recession in a decade.

Argentina's 'Last, Best Chance'
 
In Argentina, President Carlos Saul Menem treats every economic ailment with the same prescription: a new Economy Minister. With prices again soaring and the country's financial markets plunging, Mr. Menem named Domingo Cavallo on Tuesday as his fourth Economy Minister in less than 19 months. Riordan Roett, a Latin America specialist at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, said Mr. Menem might finally have a Minister with the prestige, charisma and political skill to bring the President's free-market reforms to fruition. "He is probably the last, best chance," Dr. Roett said. The nation's investors, familiar with Mr. Cavallo's record as Foreign Minister, celebrated by bidding up stock prices 30 percent the next day. But inflation is so severe -- the price of sugar was up 40 percent early last week -- that many shops refuse to take credit cards for fear the currency will be worth less when the banks settle. "The problem is, the Argentinians don't believe in Argentina," Dr. Roett said.

Global Bond Funds' Gulf Strategy

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Managers of global bond funds were among the top performers last year. But now they're at the center of wildly volatile international markets. Their worst nightmare, they say, is this: Iraq bombs the oil fields of Saudi Arabia, disrupting world oil supplies, sending up inflation and depressing bond prices. A major breakdown in the flow of oil is the wild card in all of their strategies, the worst-case scenario.
Despite such fears, fund managers in the $4.4 billion global bond market say they have done so much scrambling since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August that they are now sitting tight -- however temporarily -- to see how things unfold. 
 Their major strategy has been to juggle the maturities in their portfolios. When the United States began massing troops after the Iraqi invasion, many managers cut back on the maturities to give themselves more flexibility to react to any developments in the Middle East. But as events began to unfold, they slowly began to lengthen the maturities again, locking in higher rates. Now, as they sit tight, many are trying to find opportunities in the troubled markets.
 "The war was so well heralded that it was discounted in the bond and currency markets," said Gordon K. Johns, manager of last year's top-ranked Kemper Global Income Fund, with $57 million in assets. After the Iraqi invasion, he had shortened the average maturity of his holdings to about three-and-a-half years from six. But in early January, just before war broke out, he lengthened that to more than four years.
Clearly, he and others are trying to extend the gains they racked up last year. As a group, the 30 global bond funds gained 12.4 percent last year, ranking No. 2 among all bond funds, just behind the short-term world income funds. (In that period, all bond funds rose 4.3 percent, on average.) Grouped with the world income funds, they ranked second, too, among all the equity and bond funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services. (The No. 1: health-and-biotechnology funds.) And two global bond funds were among 1990's top 10 performers: Kemper Global Income, with a 22.7 percent gain, placing it sixth among the 3,110 funds ranked by Lipper, and the Scudder Global International Bond Fund, up 21.1 percent, for 10th place. Much of that performance came from currency gains that followed the dollar's plunge against foreign currencies. Money managers do not expect that to be repeated this year because the dollar is so cheap. Instead, they say, performance will be driven simply by rising bond prices.
S. Mark Turner, who manages Scudder's International Bond Fund, with $200 million in assets, has been extending the maturities in his fund, to more than five years at present, to lock in high rates worldwide. And he is looking beyond the war, which he says is obscuring an unfolding recessionary environment worldwide. The war may well push fragile economies like those in Canada, Australia and Britain into recession, he said.
"The real worry that people had was an oil price spike to $40 or $50" a barrel when war broke out, said Bill Kohli, who manages the Franklin Partners Tax-Advantaged International Bond Fund, with $4.3 million in assets. That didn't happen, so "we're starting to look at longer bonds," with a duration that could stretch 10 to 20 years, he said. He is avoiding the United States Treasury market in favor of Canada, with its higher interest rates and, he says, lower risk. If the gulf conflict isn't resolved quickly, he fears "significant economic consequences as the United States seeks to borrow to finance the war."
Looking past the war is not so easy for Nimrod Fachler, manager of the Paine Weber Master Global Income Fund, with $1.4 billion in assets, whose high school in Tel Aviv was leveled by an Iraqi missile. Still, he and others say the country to watch is Germany, not Iraq. That's because the costs and pace of German unification are now clear and the Bundesbank is tightening credit, which is pulling up European interest rates. But those rates may not be sustainable. "As soon as people realize the war is over and oil isn't a problem, long-term interest rates will fall," Mr. Fachler said. Since mid-December, he has lengthened maturities to nearly five years, from less than two.
In the end, war puts a damper on economic growth, an ideal environment for bonds to flourish. "War is a terrible thing," said David P. Boardman, manager of the $444 million T. Rowe Price International Bond Fund. "But the reduced economic activity sets the stage for future bond market gains, if inflation is controlled."
Les Nanberg, manager of the $150 million MFS Worldwide Governments Trust, says the war has given him "a more cautious view on bonds in the near term." But unlike his colleagues, he is shortening the average maturity of his portfolio from 10 years to roughly five-to-seven years. He has doubled cash levels to 20 percent, arguing: "I'd rather be in cash and find out tomorrow that the war is over and risk a little of the upside than to be fully invested and find out that things aren't working out as expected."

The War's Inevitable Fifth Horseman

BYLINE: By THOMAS FERGUSON; Thomas Ferguson is professor of political science and senior associate at the John W. McCormack Institute of Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

 BODY:
As the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse rampage east of the Suez, yet another scenario for a short, bargain-priced war is vanishing in the sands. The ghastly implications of this"creeping Vietnamization" are clear. But human sacrifices will not be the only costs.
In modern wars, a Fifth Horseman always trails behind the more familiar quartet to claim the toll on mountains of debt run up by the armies as they fire the cash equivalent of Mercedes-Benzes back and forth at each other. In 1991, this horseman's long, black shadow already stretches far across America. 
 Back in November 1990, when Desert Storm was still Desert Shield, the Center for Defense Information, a private research organization in Washington, estimated that the operation added about $74 million a day -- or $27 billion a year -- to the military budget.
This sum, however, did not take account of subsequent deployments, later revelations that the Pentagon was paying premium prices for equipment acquired on short notice or the gigantic costs of canceled debts and foreign-aid payments funneled to third world economies devastated by the crisis. For example, the United States has already forgiven about $7 billion in loans to Egypt alone. As of last December, at least half a dozen more countries had also received money from the allied coalition.
Once the air war started -- at about $500 million a day -- the sky became the limit in many senses. A recent Congressional Budget Office report suggests that a short, one-month war could cost about $28 billion while a longer one of six-months would cost $86 billion. But these widely repeated figures also neglect the costs of foreign aid and debt forgiveness.
The Administration, however, argues against any tax increase, claiming that the war amounts to an extraordinary one-time expense, which should simply be rolled into the deficit.
The Bush team also suggested that the allies and the gulf states will bail out the United States by agreeing to pick up much of the tab, a claim the President advanced himself in the State of the Union address.
These assertions essentially represent a very curious new "voodoo economics" of war.
While Administration economists sit in one room of the White House explaining that the war is a one-time expense, their colleagues down the hall at the National Security Council and across town at the State Department are leaking sweeping plans to restructure the whole Middle East once the shooting dies away.
Now it is perfectly obvious that the web of bilateral treaties and special security agreements American policy makers envision for the region will be spun from threads of the purest gold. Foreign aid "loans" -- better read as grants -- and, particularly, foreign military assistance, are destined to skyrocket. And while the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, argues that costs can be contained by not replenishing depreciated equipment, the postwar scenarios envision a massive pre-positioned buildup in the desert for possible future use.
The golden cloud does come with a silver lining: Saddam Hussein is an authentic monster whose departure will be extensively unlamented.
But there is a tunnel at the end of the light. Apparently unaware of how its "new world order" looks to the vast mass of poor Arabs, Washington now appears determined to throw its full weight behind a set of quasi-feudal regimes on the verge of a head-on collision with democracy and the 20th century. This we have all seen before and as we know, implies further visits by all Five Horsemen.
As for the allied promises to pay, the paltry amounts actually anted up thus far suggest that for purposes of realistic fiscal planning, these must be regarded as the equivalent of sovereign "junk bonds": worth something, but much less than face value.
Nor is it reasonable, once the war ends, to expect either the gulf states or the allies to finance a Middle Eastern Pax Americana at anything remotely resembling concessionary rates. Obtaining foreign financing for two major wars cost Britain its empire; in the long run, Americans cannot expect to pay any less if they go that route. Citizens and especially the Congress, accordingly, should recall that the policy makers who now assure them that foreigners will open their wallets are the same ones who said the allies would open their markets.
The Fifth Horseman, however, is implacable. He must still be paid. How?
Probably not in steeply inflated dollars. For this to occur, the political and economic establishment would have to be prepared to cede the international role of the dollar. This is about as likely as oil flowing uphill.
In the end, it is all too clear who will pay. American overseas assistance to less strategic areas will be cut even more, but most of the costs will come out of the domestic civilian sector.
Spending on virtually everything besides the military will be even more desperately squeezed. Financial pressures on states and cities will intensify. However, many of the foregone expenditures are precisely those that are most vital to the revival of American productivity.
But the Fifth Horseman will claim still more. In the short run, extra military spending will help pull the economy out of recession. But as the economy revives, the tumescent deficit will keep fueling total demand. To limit inflation, the Federal Reserve will have to tighten the money supply, bringing the economy right back to the devastating combination of tight money and expansive fiscal policy that defined real-life Reaganomics.
In the short run, as we learned in the 1980's, such policies can produce political business cycles substantial enough to guarantee the re-election of almost any regime. But as we also learned in the 80's, the cost in terms of long-term industrial competitiveness is steep: fixed investment by business -- outside of the military sectors -- is desperately squeezed, while import-competing and interest-sensitive industries like automobiles are hammered.
The Fifth Horseman's ultimate victims will thus be the middle- and working-class Americans whose real earnings will continue falling while racial and economic inequality increase.

The Appeal of Blue -- Now Red or Green -- Jeans

BYLINE: By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO

 BODY:
High-fashion denim, these days, means much more than designer jeans. Franco Moschino covers a denim jacket with transparent sequins. Donna Karan shapes a strapless denim minidress. As sales of blue jeans flag, designers are devising new uses for a familiar fabric.
These novelties tickle the fashion-conscious, but to most people denim still means jeans. More than 650 million square yards of denim are produced in this country every year, mainly by automated factories in the South. At least 90 percent of the denim goes into the basics: blue jeans, jackets, overalls and skirts. The domestic denim market has matured as a vast business. At $6 billion in 1989 retail sales for jeans and $8.25 billion for all denim clothing, it represents one of the largest categories of apparel. 
 Jeans and denim manufacturers remain optimistic despite fluctuations in their markets. Domestic demand has suffered from turmoil in the retail industry, a recession and the graying of the jeans generation, but foreign demand is on the rise. Manufacturers continue to expand the variety of jeans with new fabric finishes, colors and styling. "The key to the growth of the jeans business is innovation," said Arnold Elder, a vice president of Swift Textiles Inc., a major denim manufacturer. "In order to get a person to buy another pair of jeans, the eye must be attracted to something different."
 
Made in the U.S.A.
The Big Mills Are In the South
 The United States produces more denim than any other country, primarily for domestic use but increasingly for the world market. The largest denim mills bear little resemblance to the crowded plants of the past. Towering machines suck cotton from bales and spin it into yarn, dyeing the fibers, then weaving them into fabric that flows onto wide 600-pound rolls. The plants are spacious, but eerie for the scarcity of employees, whose duties are mainly to adjust the computer controls and tweak the machines.
Swift Textiles Inc., a United States subsidiary of Dominion Textiles Inc. of Montreal, is generally regarded as the world's largest supplier. For the year ended last June, Swift Textiles sold more than $300 million of denim, supplying major jeans makers like Levi Strauss, Lee, Wrangler, Sassoon and Liz Claiborne.
Next comes the Cone Mills Corporation of Greensboro, N.C., privately held but willing to confirm an annual output of more than 165 million square yards. The company says Levi Strauss is its largest account, since almost all the denim for Levi's best-selling five-pocket 501 jeans comes from Cone Mills. It also supplies Oshkosh B'gosh, Calvin Klein and Polo/Ralph Lauren. Industry executives say the next-largest producers are Greenwood Mills Inc. of Greenwood, S.C., and then Burlington Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C.
The mills have learned to produce much more than the traditional, 14 1/2-ounce-per-yard denim used in 501's. The fabric can be as light as 4 1/2 ounces, known as chambray, or as heavy as 15 1/2. About 90 percent of the denim is pure cotton, with 10 percent containing some polyester and a very small percentage incorporating stretchy spandex. Four of every five yards are indigo blue.
More American-made denim is going to South America, the Far East and especially Western Europe, which imports 40 million to 50 million yards annually. This amount is more than all the other markets combined, said Nessim Levy, president of the Level Export Sales Corporation, which sends Cone Mills products to Europe. Fashion-conscious Italians buy the most from the United States. American denim and jeans makers hope to find large new markets in Eastern Europe.
But denim production is by no means limited to the United States. Europe weaves an estimated 275 million square yards annually, while Japan fills much of its own demand and imports some from Hong Kong.
Arnold Elder, a vice president of Swift Textiles, said exports can more than make up for stagnant domestic consumption. "Denim is being worn today for everything from casual sportswear to shirts to dresses," he said. "It's acceptable around the world."
 
Levi, the Leader
Foreigners Want The American Look
 Levi Strauss & Company, a privately held corporation with headquarters in San Francisco, remains by far the largest jeans company in the world. Since Levi's founding in 1850, when a Bavarian immigrant used French cotton serge to sew sturdy trousers for California miners, the company has stitched up two and a half billion pairs. Sales reached $3.6 billion in 1989, with more than $4 billion estimated for 1990. The figures include Levi's Dockers, a line of cotton twill pants introduced in 1986, with sales of $600 million last year. Dan Chew, Levi's marketing manager, attributes the company's steady growth to the success of Dockers and the increased global demand for American jeans.
Europe is Levi's biggest foreign market, but Asians also like the American look. "Even though we manufacture in Japan for the Asian market," Mr. Chew said, "Asians go to great lengths to obtain Levi's 501's made in the United States, so we do export some American-made jeans to Asia."
Mr. Chew said Levi Strauss sells twice as many jeans as its closest competitor, Lee Jeans. Both Lee and Wrangler are subsidiaries of the V.F. Corporation of Reading, Pa., the country's largest publicly held apparel company. Lee estimates that it has sold one billion pairs during its one-century lifespan.
Jeans makers are still trying to develop computers and machines that can stitch up pants as well as they can weave fabric. Most jeans factories have rows of women tending sewing machines, with computers reserved for cutting patterns, tracking orders and managing inventory and distribution.
 
The Designer Craze
Paying for a Name On the Pocket
 Farmers, ranchers and laborers have always worn denim work clothes, but as a fashion for those with whiter collars, blue jeans have been cyclical. They represented social rebellion in the 1960's and entered the realm of high fashion in the late 70's and early 80's. When Brooke Shields promoted one designer by cooing about her Calvins, other designers rode the trend. Jeans sales reached an all-time high of 502 million pairs, 77 percent of them denim, in 1981.
Much of the appeal of designer jeans still lies on their back pockets, where labels like Calvin Klein, Gloria Vanderbilt or Ralph Lauren merit prices of $70 to more than $100. Basic jeans can be found for less than $20.
Designers who insist the extra money buys sassier styling do not discount the value of cachet. "Designer jeans historically cost more, but you buy a name and a fit," said Denise Seegal, president of DKNY, Donna Karan's less expensive line of sportswear.
DKNY spawned DKNY Jeans last year as a separate division, and Ms. Seegal projects sales of $40 million in 1991. But the basic DKNY jeans that sold for $85 in 1989 can now be had for $70. "I took a haircut to lower the price to position myself to compete," Ms. Seegal said. But Donna Karan is no kin of Levi Strauss. "When a store asks me why we can't sell jeans for $20," Ms. Seegal said, "I tell them that if you produce a million pairs, it costs less than producing a thousand pairs or a hundred thousand."
A designer's name may sell the first pair of jeans, but it will not necessarily produce repeat sales, some jeans makers have found. The customer must be tempted by something new, something he or she does not already own.
Now there are black jeans and white jeans, jeans in several colors absent even from the rainbow. All manner of finishes -- bleaching, over-dyeing, acid-washing, stone-washing, sand-blasting and even shotgun-blasting -- give denim a new, or old, look.
Until five or six years ago, 70 percent to 80 percent of the Levi's sold were rigid or slightly prewashed, said Mr. Chew. Now, 80 percent have further finishes. About 35 percent are acid-washed ("But that's on the way out," he said) and 30 percent stone-washed. All these washes and finishes make jeans softer and more comfortable. What's more, the styles make the wearer look like the survivor of a month on the ranch, a landslide, a shootout or at least a good dunking in a Clorox vat.
 
 
THE LITTLE BLACK DENIM DRESS
 Donna Karan calls denim the new gabardine. She uses it for much more than jeans. She has had a denim blazer in her DKNY line for two years and included denim in her latest high-fashion collection for spring. She uses a silk-and-cotton denim for dresses, jackets and skirts that bear as little resemblance to jeans as a cocktail party does to a hoedown. Her prices befit her clientele of movie stars and top executives: $640 for a short, strapless denim dress, $1,000 for a satin-lined denim coat.
Such are the inspirations that have allowed Ms. Karan to become one of the hottest designers in the country, building sales of more than $150 million in six years. "Denim is wonderful to style," she said. "It comes in different weights and it tailors beautifully. Everything can be made in it. Denim for me is a classic. It's a seven-days-a-week, day-to-night fabric."
Young American designers like Rebecca Moses and Zang Toi also used denim in unconventional ways for spring. Ms. Moses made a bustier and pants covered with transparent sequins. Mr. Toi used bright pink and red denim for short trench coats, strapless dresses and boleros with jeweled fringes.
American designers are not the only ones pursuing denim panache. Franco Moschino, the enfant terrible of Italian fashion, has a jeans line that racked up worldwide sales of $80 million last year. The line includes sundresses, sequin-covered jackets, skirts trimmed with beaded fringes and denim pants with pleated legs of see-through rayon.
The basic slacks account for only 10 percent of Moschino Jeans sales. To keep the price of these pants down to $32 wholesale, they are made in this country. The rest of the line is sewn in Italy of American-made denim from Cone Mills and Burlington. "In Italy, people wear Moschino jeans the way we wear Levi's," said Anne Marino, executive vice president of Simint U.S.A.
Simint, an Italian holding company, manufactures and markets Italian designer jeans and leisurewear, including Moschino's. The largest leisure apparel company in Italy, it also makes and distributes Armani Jeans in Europe and supplies the jeans to Emporio Armani boutiques in the United States.
Armani Jeans, a $100 million business, was one of the first to offer jeans in a wide range of colors and finishes, including ones it calls smoky wash, ice-blue wash and tea wash.
Like other designers looking to the 1960's for inspiration, Mr. Armani has turned to the past in his jeans line, reviving tie-dying. And Norma Kamali has reintroduced another 60's fashion that may portend the next direction for jeans: bell-bottom hip huggers.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
Afterward, Make Africa a Priority

BYLINE: By SALIM LONE; Salim Lone, a Kenyan, is editor of the United Nations periodical Africa Recovery.

 BODY:
When the war in the Persian Gulf is over, the United States will turn to the other pressing international concerns that need its attention. But there is a growing fear among United Nations, African and other development officials that one vital concern -- the deepening, decade-long economic crisis in Africa -- is unlikely to feature prominently in the post-gulf agenda of the United States and the other major aid-giving powers. Such neglect would deal a severe blow to the profound but largely unreported political and economic reforms being undertaken on the continent -- reforms that are Africa's only hope for reversing what is nothing less than an economic and social nightmare for its peoples.
Even before Jan. 16, when the war in the Persian Gulf began, it was getting increasingly difficult to mobilize the kind of attention from which Africa benefited in the mid-1980's, when a special session of the United Nations put the region firmly at the top of international development concerns. The democratic revolutions of Eastern Europe and the need to financially support their market reforms rapidly pushed Africa down the list of Western priorities. The ending of the Cold War also stripped the continent of its strategic significance to the superpowers. And Africa's puny contribution to international trade made it seem less and less relevant to the economic growth of richer nations. 
 If this marginalization continues, the dire present will lead to a cataclysmic future. Africa is the only continent where the gap between food production and food needs continues to widen. If present trends proceed unchecked, the continent's already crippling deficit of about 15 million tons of maize in 1990 is projected to grow within 30 years to 200 million tons -- nearly equal to the annual cereal output in the United States. Similarly, by 1995, Africa's poor will have nearly doubled, to 405 million from 210 million in 1985, while the proportion of those living in poverty will have substantially declined everywhere else in the world. And the just-released annual report of the Economic Commission for Africa reveals that per capita incomes fell again, for the twelfth straight year. The scale of Africa's woes can best be gauged by one stunning statistic: the nearly 500 million people of sub-Saharan Africa have a combined gross domestic product lower than that of the New York area.
There is an explicit link between such levels of deprivation and the bloody civil wars that rocked Liberia, Somalia, Chad and Rwanda during 1990. Predictions of even greater breakdowns of political and civil order abound.
A number of things need to happen if this grim scenario is to be averted. By far the most important of these -- the political and economic reforms within African countries themselves -- are well under way across the continent. The vast majority of African nations, including such determinedly socialist ones as Mozambique, Tanzania, Algeria and Ethiopia, have adopted painful, and politically risky, market-oriented economic reforms.
But the assistance that had been promised by the West to insure the success of these reforms has yet to materialize on anywhere near the scale needed. Instead, Africa watches helplessly, and with increasing bitterness, as much larger support for the Eastern European reforms is mobilized at record speed.
Action on two of the three urgently required areas of assistance -- debt relief and easier terms for receiving aid -- can be provided relatively painlessly by the West. The third area, finding ways to stabilize income from commodity exports, will take some doing. The prices of commodities, which account for 90 percent of the continent's income, plummeted throughout the last decade. The price index of two of Africa's major exports, cocoa and coffee, slid from 100 in 1980 to less than 40 in 1989. Finding a solution to this and other trade issues will take negotiation.
But action in the first two areas can come quickly and unilaterally from the richer countries. Recognizing that Africa's debt burden of $270 billion is unbearable as well as unpayable in full, Western governments, to whom the bulk of the debt is owed, have repeatedly indicated since 1987 that they intend to provide significant debt relief. The pace of this relief is perilously slow.
African governments are also pressing for relief from the stringent set of standardized policy prescriptions that are now a precondition for aid. As indicated, most African governments have demonstrated in practice their commitment to reforms favored by donors. Such governments now need to be given greater freedom in formulating policies they believe are appropriate to their particular environment. This is especially true since there is growing evidence that some external prescriptions -- such as cutting subsidies on food and social services for the poor -- are in fact deepening poverty and inhibiting economic recovery.
These are small prices to pay for a continent in severe distress. The cost of not paying now is rising every month, in dollars and in lives.

HEADLINE: Lower the Boom on the Bankers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A recent Market Watch dealt with a different standard for accounting for banks, ("Alice Meets the Accountants," Dec. 30). The real problem, of course, is not accounting methods, it is incompetent bankers. An article in Fortune in the late 1940's, "The American Genius For Bankruptcy," contained the statement: "Americans want banks so bad that even you and I can borrow from them." It is not polite to mention it, but we have suffered from incompetent bankers in this country for over two hundred years.
The solution, then, is not deregulation but better regulation. The savings and loans institutions were crippled by high interest rates that resulted from the Federal Reserve system's tight money policy, so Congress permitted them to make loans in fields where they had no experience. There was fraud, but that was a very small part of the problem. As Fred Schwed Jr., said in the 1954 edition of "Where Are the Customers' Yachts,": "Investors like to think they were robbed, rather than that they were fools on the advice of fools."

HEADLINE: Unexplored Territory, A Recession in Services

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
The unusual wave of white collar layoffs in the early stages of this recession is a sign that the United States service sector, once heralded as a powerful engine for new jobs, is undergoing a broad retrenchment, much as the manufacturing sector did in the past decade.
And economists are predicting that the trend may worsen the recession and slow the pace of a recovery in the short run. "It's one of four or five factors that will be a drag on growth," said Robert Gay, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
 
Sharp Contrast to the Past
 This is a sharp contrast to previous experience when regions with established service industries were often protected from extreme pain in recessions. 
 Unemployment will climb more than it would otherwise. "In the last recession, services were a sponge that soaked up laid off factory workers. Now you don't have that," said Mitchell S. Fromstein, chairman and chief executive of Manpower Inc., a temporary help concern based in Milwaukee. The Blue Chip consensus of economic forecasters expects unemployment, at 6.2 percent in January to reach 6.6 percent or more in a few months.
Over the long term, economists say, the nation's economy will benefit from this streamlining in the services, justas America's smokestack industries benefited from the retrenchment in the past decade. A leaner, fitter service sector, they predict, will help ease two perennial problems of the American economy: wage inflation and sluggish productivity growth.
Apart from the health-care field, which has an endless appetite for workers, service companies like retailers, financial service, accounting, real estate and temporary-help firms, have shed 208,000 jobs since August, according to a Labor Department report issued Friday. The latest monthly employment data showed that most service industries continued to cut jobs in January. "The services are weakening more rapidly than in past downturns," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
The emerging picture is that service companies went on a hiring binge during the 1980's. Retailers, restaurants and financial service firms, the producers of "invisibles" added a stunning 19 million jobs -- all the new jobs generated by the private sector since the end of the last recession in 1982. But while payrolls bloated, white-collar productivity languished. "Some service firms display the same excesses -- too many employees and high operating costs -- as manufacturing firms going into the last recession," said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at CRT Government Securities in New York.
One reason for the decline in the service jobs is that the demand for some services is shifting. Consumers, who have not saved much, are curtailing their spending. Corporate appetite for debt is fading. And takeover activity on Wall Street long ago eased from the fevered pace of the 1980's.
The result: too many banks, retail stores, fast-food restaurants and other service establishments. "The primary problem is that services expanded faster than long-run demand," said Mr. Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
 
Worse on Wall Street
 Nowhere has the cutting come closer to the bone than on Wall Street. Securities firms have already shed 50,000 jobs, 20 percent of the work force, since the 1987 crash. But revenues have fallen even more, and the industry is now in the red. So more cuts are coming, including further layoffs, pay cuts, canceled perks and, most important, efforts to consolidate huge, underused back office operations that process the river of paper. "Many service industries are reinventing themselves," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in New York. "It started a while ago and there's no end in sight,"
New York, which got off relatively lightly in the last recession, will have a longer, deeper recession than the entire country. Here, 9 of 10 jobs are service jobs compared with 8 of 10 throughout the United States. As of December, New York City payrolls had shrunk 3 percent compared with 1 percent for the country, the opposite of what happened in the last recession. In fact, the recession here started a year before the national one, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. Forecasters at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., also expect the New York recession to last longer.
 
More Mergers Expected
 More mergers are in the offing, too, especially among the more than 12,000 banks. Thanks to a bundle of bad real estate loans, the Government predicts that 340 banks will fail in the next two years and some of the country's largest banks are seriously short of capital. All banks face increasingly fierce competition for the best customers from non-bank lenders like mortgage companies and finance companies.
Low-cost companies are gobbling market share from high-cost firms. Take retailing, which added three million jobs during the 1980's. Bernard Sosnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank in New York, said, "The strong are getting stronger." For example, hard- driving Wal-Mart Stores Inc. opened 175 new stores last year, but Sears, Roebuck & Company, the country's biggest retailer, just announced 21,000 job cuts and is contemplating the sale of its 103-year-old catalog division.
 
Effort to Increase Efficiency
 
Elsewhere, companies are working overtime to increase efficiency, trying to squeeze more sales out of the exisitng work force or maintain sales with a smaller staff. Productivity in the restaurant business has actually fallen in the past decade. Facing a saturated market, some fast-food chains are reducing the amount of kitchen space to create more space for customers. So they are experimenting with new grills or using food prepared elsewhere under factory-like conditions. "Everybody's trying to cook more food with fewer hands," said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
Service companies are using computer technology to contain costs as well as improve quality. Price Waterhouse, the big accounting firm, is using a new computer technology to make huge amounts of sophisticated information easily accessible to its auditors. They are investing in such technology "to make life more interesting," said Arthur H. Siegel, vice chairman for auditing and accounting. It has an important side benefit: the firm will need to hire fewer junior auditors each year -- about 900 instead of 1,300.
Now when service firms are expanding, they are expanding mostly overseas. McDonald's Corporation built more Golden Arches overseas than at home last year.
"This is a permanent change, not just a response to the recession." said Mr. Gay of Morgan Stanley. "The era of indiscriminate hiring in services is over."
More restrained hiring by service companies would help get inflation down by easing the pressure on wages, a main element in inflation's momentum. There are already signs of some slowing. In the past year, compensation costs in service industries rose 4.8 percent, compared with 5.1 percent in the previous year.
Even more important, the overhaul in the service industries is key to overcoming the nation's chronic white-collar productivity problem. While efficiency gains in the nation's factories in the 1980's were stunning, productivity in the services as a whole stagnated.
 
An Early Positive Effect
 The unusually steep cutbacks in the service sector may already be having some effect, Mr. Gay said. He notes that the number of hours by non-farm employees worked fell further than non-farm output last fall. He concludes that productivity probably edged up. "That's never happened in the first quarter of a recession before," he said. "Productivity always falls at the beginning of recessions as companies hang on to workers while they try to figure out how long the downturn is likely to last."
The typical pattern in the past was that service companies just slowed down hiring when a recession started, but did not freeze or shrink payrolls. A recession was usually about a year old before that happened. And in shorter recessions, service employment usually continued creeping up.
This time, payrolls were frozen a year before the economy slipped into a recession and jobs were cut in the first months of the recession. "These industries were in trouble already," said Mr. Gay, the Morgan Stanley economist.
So that great American job machine, the service sector, is grinding into lower gear. But not everybody is complaining. Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors, said, "The benefits from lower inflation and faster productivity growth will provide a healthy foundation for future growth."

HEADLINE: As Economy Changes, the Port Authority Must Overcome Its Own Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Tapestries adorn the walls and helicopters carry officials to meetings, but these days the once-prosperous Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is in the unaccustomed position of paring costs and pleading for money.
Stagnant revenues, rising expenses, the travails of the airlines, shifts in trade and, to an extent, some of the authority's own initiatives have led it to seek a $1 increase in bridge and tunnel tolls only months after a similar plan was withdrawn in the face of opposition. 
 In renewing its campaign for higher tolls, the authority is trying to overcome its free-spending image and stressing its role in spurring growth as the regional economy stumbles. It asserts that 425,000 jobs depend on business sectors "anchored" by its investments and that another 166,000 construction and 20,000 permanent jobs will be generated by what it hopes will be $5.4 billion in new capital spending over the next five years and private investment that will accompany it.
 
2 Postponements
 But without higher tolls, the agency says, it will be forced to cut into plans to rehabilitate and expand not only its Hudson River crossings but also the region's airports -- just as they face increasing competition from airports in other parts of the country.
And even with a rise, expanding the capacity of the Goethals Bridge between Elizabeth, N.J., and Staten Island, building a rail link to Kennedy International Airport and unclogging the all-too-common jam in the Bronx from the George Washington Bridge will have to wait.
"The case that we must have an increase to continue the capital program is airtight," said Richard C. Leone, chairman of the 70-year-old bistate authority.
But despite a report from the accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick supporting its case, the agency has twice in recent days postponed a vote on raising tolls to $4, from $3, after failing to gain the support of both Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York. Both have the power to veto the increase. Mr. Florio has already rejected a 25-cent increase in the PATH fare that the authority had also sought.
Mr. Leone acknowledged that a toll increase would be an "enormous burden" for the Governors, given public antipathy to higher taxes and fees. But the $130 million that such an increase would provide -- which could enable the authority to issue bonds to finance about $1 billion in new investments -- would also seem an enormously tempting sum for two men struggling to fill huge budget deficits.
In the negotiations, New York and New Jersey are seeking to speed up some projects already in the authority's plan and to add others that could take some of the strain off the fiscally stressed states.
 
State's Plans
 New Jersey is interested in help for several expensive undertakings, including a mass-transit link to Newark International Airport, a Secaucus transfer station that would let some N.J. Transit rail passengers switch to trains on Northeast Corridor tracks for New York City and a connection at Kearny that would link the N.J. Transit Morris and Essex line to Northeast Corridor tracks.
New York State is concerned about residents on Staten Island, who are surrounded by toll bridges and have scant mass-transit options.
So far the changes being discussed by both states are said to affect about $400 million of the authority's plan. But if the talks drag on, there is a danger of a tug of war that could push the figure higher, forcing the agency to cut projects that it wants, even with a toll increase.
"This kind of interstate bickering is only going to lead to problems," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association. He said the authority should raise tolls by $2, pulling it even with the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which charges $2.50 each way on its East River crossings.
 
Past and Present at Odds
 But the Automobile Club of New York, in a letter to Mr. Cuomo, called the Port Authority toll increase discriminatory against motorists, especially on Staten Island. It questioned the agency's policy of using the suplus from the Hudson crossings, which the auto club put at about $200 million a year, to subsidize the PATH system.
"We know of no valid reason why bridge and tunnel users should be singled out to pay for a capital program that includes relatively little in the way of bridge and tunnel facility improvements," it said.
Politicking over tolls seems almost out of character for an agency that had the savvy to outfox Robert Moses twice -- gaining control of the airports and building the bus terminal in midtown over his objections -- and the wherewithal to build what were once the world's tallest buildings, the twin towers of the World Trade Center.
"Very few people believe that we're in need of a cash infusion," said Stanley Brezenoff, the authority's executive director.
That may be in part because of the authority's reputation for perquisites and salaries that Mr. Cuomo has complained are too high. Of the authority's 9,480 employees, 49 are paid $100,000 or more a year. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has 64 employees who are paid $100,000 or more, but has a payroll of 67,000.
 
Helicopter for Guest
 Port Authority officials note that 300 jobs, most of them managerial, have been trimmed, a hiring freeze is on and administrative spending has been kept to the level of inflation.
The authority was recently embarrassed when a New Jersey newspaper, The Record, published an article about travel expenses and the use of cars and drivers by authority officials, reporting that a commissioner had dispatched a helicopter to pick up a guest for a business dinner at the World Trade Center in 1989.
The agency is "coming down much harder on anything that looks like waste and abuse," Mr. Leone said.
The authority owns two helicopters. It says they are needed to move staff members across the region. But that is two more than the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which also has enterprises in many counties.
The Port Authority also owns 89 major works of art that are valued at $17.9 million. They were acquired for $2.9 million, the agency said and almost all are on public display.
But if the decor in the agency's executive offices is costly, at least by government standards, the mood is uncertain. Although they do not face the huge deficits that the Governors must cope with, officials can look out their windows at the trade center and see problems in nearly every direction.
 
Bridge and Tunnel Surplus
 The authority said it expects the PATH system, the Port Authority rail lines connecting Newark, Jersey City and Hoboken to Manhattan, to have a $135 million deficit this year, more than twice the deficit in 1984. The bus terminals, on Eighth Avenue in mid-Manhattan and in upper Manhattan near the George Washington Bridge, are expected to lose another $63 million, three times the deficit in 1984.
The authority offsets part of what it calculates is a $2 subsidy for each PATH passenger and a $1 subsidy for each bus rider with a surplus from bridges and tunnel tolls, arguing that if PATH and bus riders were to switch to cars they would paralyze the Hudson crossings.
Without higher tolls, officials say, the authority's entire interstate transportation network would lose $77 million this year, eating into surpluses of $131 million and $115 million, from the airports and the trade center, respectively, at a time when the authority wants to invest more money in them. The figures do not include interest.
The 110-story trade center towers, designed in the early 1960's, need $100 million over five years just to begin to modernize the elevators, part of $366 million in renovations scheduled during that period.
 
'Three Big Problems'
 At the three major airports, which economists consider crucial to the region's economic well-being, the authority projects that the number of passengers will grow to more than 100 million by the year 2000 -- if it can find ways to accommodate them.
"There are three big problems at the airports," said Prof. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark."
The authority's plan calls for $3 billion to be invested in the airports, including a "people mover" and more parking at Newark and new roads, new parking and another "people mover" at Kennedy. But the agency had to shelve the centerpiece of the Kennedy effort -- a 1.3 million-square-foot central terminal -- when the airlines balked. And the authority's five-year plan includes just a small part of its share for a transit link to the Newark airport and only planning money for a rail link to Kennedy.
Meanwhile, the region's seaports, on which the authority expects to lose $11 million this year, have been eclipsed as the nation's pre-eminent port by Los Angeles-Long Beach and need expensive rail connections and other improvements to stay competitive with other East Coast ports.
Professor Moss and others trace some of the authority's fiscal stress to the late 1970's, when the agency, flush with revenue, set out on a series of ambitious and innovative economic development projects.
 
Real-Estate Development
 The Fishport, a $25 million effort that was supposed to attract boats and dealers to South Brooklyn, was open only about a year and a half, the victim of sluggish sales. Space at Teleport, an office center with sophisticated communications links on Staten Island, has been difficult to fill.
Of its industrial parks, the authority expects to make $800,000 this year in the Bathgate section of the South Bronx but lose $2.5 million in Elizabeth, N.J., and $3 million in Yonkers. The resource recovery plant in Essex County, N.J., will make $9 million. The Newark Legal Center will lose $3 million. None of these figures includes debt service.
Voters in Hoboken rejected the authority's plan to rebuild a 32-acre section of its waterfront. Another development project involving the authority, at Hunters Point in Long Island City, Queens, was approved by New York City but faces a depressed real-estate market.
Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the authority's executive director when many of those projects were initiated, defended them as the kind of job-creating enterprises that the agency should have undertaken to stimulate economic growth.
But George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of urban planning at Rutgers University, said the authority is now "saddled with some pretty hefty stuff." "They're in the real-estate development business, and real estate stinks," he said.
 
Rising Debt
 In any event, under Stephen Berger, Mr. Goldmark's successor, the agency turned inward, starting to redress what Mr. Berger regarded as underinvestment in its main businesses -- bridges, tunnels, seaports and airports.
But as the region's economy cooled, traffic leveled off and revenues softened. The agency's debt is projected to grow to $4.6 billion this year, from $2.3 billion in 1984, while reserves would rise only to $800 million from $660 million.
To ease the pressure, Mr. Berger unsuccessfully sought higher tolls in December 1989, a year before the agency had expected to raise them, and the authority discussed a $6 toll in 1993.
"Steve fell on the barbed wire," Mr. Brezenoff said, "and now I'm walking across."
In its forecasts, though, the agency expects a $150 million gap in 1994 that may at best be offset in part by a new passenger surcharge at the airports. So even if it raises tolls this year, it seems likely to try to raise them again soon.

HEADLINE: Despite War, Pentagon Plans Big Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Faced with severe budget pressures, the Pentagon is proceeding with its plan to reduce the armed forces by a quarter by 1995 despite the war in the Persian Gulf and renewed strains in American-Soviet relations.
"With the ongoing withdrawal of Soviet armed forces from Eastern Europe, the dissolving Warsaw Pact military organization, and reforms in Moscow, the U.S. no longer focuses its defense planning on preparing for global, short-notice conflict," says a draft of the Pentagon's annual report to Congress, which has circulated among senior Defense Department officials. 
 Instead, the report said, planning will focus on "regional contingencies, often unforeseeable."
 
Looking Beyond Cold War
 Since the United States and its allies began their military campaign two and a half weeks ago to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait, Pentagon officials have been preoccupied with the war. But the Defense Department is also adapting forces and strategy to the ending of the cold war.
The Pentagon's plans for cutting and reshaping the military are laid out in its new $278 billion budget for the fiscal year 1992. That spending request is to be unveiled Monday, but Pentagon officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, discussed it beforehand. The spending request is $5 billion more than the Pentagon's authorized spending this fiscal year but 1 percent less when adjusted for inflation.
While the Pentagon is projecting big cuts in Army, Navy and Air Force units, the reductions are timed to guard against a worsening of American-Soviet relations, a senior Pentagon official said.
 
Lessons on Transportation
 The new Pentagon plans also reflect some of the lessons of the American military operation in the Persian Gulf. The Pentagon is now budgeting more than $2 billion through 1997 for additional transport ships or the positioning of military equipment overseas to ease the deployment of Americans for conflicts in third-world countries.
The budgeting of the funds reflects difficulties in quickly deploying troops in Saudi Arabia, as well as Congressional criticism that the Pentagon has failed to budget adequate funds for transport ships. Congress put in more than $1 billion for these purposes in the 1991 budget, which the Pentagon is now prepared to spend as soon a program is devised. In addition, the Pentagon is now budgeting an average of $250 million a year in additional funds, starting in 1993.
And the Pentagon now plans to keep A-10 anti-tank planes in the American arsenal. Before the conflict in the gulf, the Air Force had sought to phase out the A-10 planes from its active, non-reserve forces in favor of developing an improved version of the F-16 for close-air support of ground troops. But the A-10's have proved to be useful in Saudi Arabia.
 
The Army Slims Down
 As described by Pentagon officials, the Defense Department's plans call for cutting the number of active Army divisions to 12 from the current 18 by the 1995 fiscal year. The number of reserve Army divisions is also being cut to 6 from the current 10.
The Pentagon also plans to create two Army "cadre" reserve divisions, or partially manned units that would be brought up to full strength during an international crisis.
The Navy, which has 6 carriers deployed in the Persian Gulf, is also being reduced. The number of carriers is being cut to 12 by 1995 from the current 13, while the total number of ships is being cut from 545 to 451.
In an innovation promoted by Adm. Frank B. Kelso 2d, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Navy plans to transfer some frigates to the reserves. The ships would be manned by a small crew of active duty naval officers who would train reservists to operate the vessels. The Navy has previously turned down suggestions from Congressional critics who have suggested that the service make greater use of the reserves.
 
Planes and Missiles Affected
 As for the Air Force, it will see the number of its active and reserve air wings reduced to 26 1/2 by 1995 from the current 36, a Pentagon official said. About 15 of these wings will be in the active Air Force. One and half wings will be made of F-16 planes that will double as reconnaissance aircraft and combat planes. A wing is normally about 72 planes.
Strategic nuclear programs are also being pared, officials said. The Pentagon has virtually abandoned its plan to put MX missiles, each with 10 warheads, on rail cars.
A senior Pentagon official explained that research money has been budgeted to test fire an MX missile from a rail car, but that after that test the program will go into hibernation. No procurement money that would enable the Air Force to deploy the system is being sought.
The Pentagon is also planning to phase out all of its old Minuteman II missiles in anticipation of a new American-Soviet pact to cut long-range nuclear arms. But a Pentagon official said the Air Force would probably maintain some of the concrete missile silos so the United States could expand its strategic nuclear aresenal if there was a serious crisis in American-Soviet relations.
 
End of the Rainbow
 In another signficiant cutback, the Pentagon is canceling the Tacit Rainbow missile, which is intended to destroy Soviet radars so that American aircraft could carry out nuclear strikes.
The cancellation of the Tacit Rainbow system is especially ironic since Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d expended considerable negotiating effort in his meeting with the Russians to get Moscow to allow it under the emerging strategic arms treaty, and a senior State Department trumpeted this as one of the Secretary's more important negotiating triumphs.
The Defense Department plans to seek funds for the military operation in the Persian Gulf as part of a separate budget request. But experience with the military operation there has already influenced planning for the transport of troops and weapons and the storing of equipment overseas.
The Pentagon is planning to spend $200 million to $300 million a year, starting in 1993, for additional ships to carry troops and supplies or to store American equipment overseas.

HEADLINE: White House Reassures Hard-Pressed Governors

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The nation's governors, their states battered by recession, came to Washington today to seek more Federal aid and greater flexibility in administering Federal programs.
Leaders of the National Governors' Association, which opened its annual midwinter conference here, said after a meeting with top White House officials today that the Administration was sympathetic to their requests. The White House would not comment. 
 In his State of the Union address, President Bush said he would turn over at least $15 billion in Federal funds now earmarked for specific programs to the states for "flexibile management."
The governors have now made a number of specific proposals and said they were favorably received. They included a request for $120 million in emergency funds to supplement state unemployment insurance for tens of thousands of jobless people; a two-year moratorium on the 10-year expansion of the Medicaid program enacted last year, and a freeze on any further shift in costs from the Federal Government to the states.
 
Health Reorganization Sought
 The governors, noting that the increase in health costs accounts for the greatest rises in their state budgets, are also seeking a long-term reorganization of the health care system.
The governors said they were told that President Bush's promise on the $15 billion was "absolutely flexible."
"It might be $5 billion, it might be $50 billion," Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, a Democrat who is the chairman of the governors' association, said today after a meeting with John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, director of the budget, and Roger Porter, the President's domestic policy adviser.
"This was a late entry into the State of the Union," Mr. Gardner told reporters. "It was something the President thought was important. Every time the President meets with governors and legislators he asks, 'If I could do one thing for you, what would you like?' And we always say 'flexibility.' "
 
'Difficult for Congress'
 Mr. Gardner added, however, that the promise of the turnover of Federal funds to the states "is going to be difficult for Congress" because "the states aren't always the pure laboratory of efficiency that we'd like to see them." He also suggested that Congress might be unwilling to lose the patronage associated with some of the programs.
Mr. Gardner said that he thought it would be best if the Federal money to be turned over to the states came from education programs and community development block grants.
Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican and the vice chairman of the group, who also attended the White House meeting, said that he initially feared that Washington might want to turn over programs afflicted by escalating costs, as well as programs that Washington no longer cared about.
"I was concerned about the possibility that these were the programs they wanted to dump," Mr. Ashcroft said, "but that doesn't seem to be the case."
Nor would the turnover be a short-term strategy. "There were definite assurances of longevity," Mr. Ashcroft said, noting that the White House was speaking of a five-year plan.
 
Shortages in 31 States
 The governors' association noted in a policy paper: "Currently, 31 states are struggling with budget shortfalls. A significant part of the fiscal pressure on states is coming from increased costs in the Medicaid program. In 1980, Medicaid spending accounted for 9 percent of states' budgets; in 1990, it accounted for nearly 14 percent of all state spending."
The 10-year expansion of the Federal-state Medicaid program for the poor was enacted last year as part of the budget bill. It would gradually expand Medicaid to pay the health costs of all pregnant women and children under 18 whose incomes were 133 percent of the poverty level. Under current law, the states determine who qulifies for Medicaid,
A two-year delay in implementaing this expansion would save the states about $2 billion over a five-year period, in the opinion of an aide to the governors' group.
In a survey of state legislators released in conjunction with the governors meeting, a majority of the lawmakers in 30 states said that their states were in a recession, while a majority of those in 11 more states said they were headed for a recession. A majority in 31 states predicted that their states would raise taxes this year.

HEADLINE: Bush Blurs Home Goals

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Republican aides and analysts responded to the domestic side of President Bush's State of the Union Message this week as though it were a Rorschach test, with each projecting different hopes and fears onto what seemed to be its indeterminate content.
 That so many could come away with wildly varying interpretations renewed a bipartisan suspicion: that the President has not formulated a broad domestic policy. Indeed, some argue that politically he may not need one.
"It's an attempt to create the facade of a domestic policy without the significant content of one," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican analyst who has frequently been critical of the Administration's domestic activity.
The Administration has individual domestic policies, of course, and the speech provided a recitation of them: tenant-run public housing, a cut in the capital gains tax and a call for volunteerism. And to these familiar items, Mr. Bush appended others, from references to research and development to an overhaul of the nation's banking laws.
 
Months of Feuding

The speech was warmly received, and Mr. Bush has endured two years of criticism about a lack of domestic vision without suffering in the approval polls. If anything, his Presidential experience may have only confirmed his instincts to avoid the subject.
While his conduct of foreign affairs has won him praise, his few domestic forays, like those into taxes and minority scholarships, have brought battles with special interest groups and Congress and created factions among his own staff.
The State of the Union Message that Mr. Bush delivered Tuesday came after months of feuding among Administration officials over the tone and substance of domestic policy. Either despite its vagueness, or perhaps because of it, the speech has for now quieted the bickering.
Some of Mr. Bush's aides, most notably Jack F. Kemp, the Housing Secretary, and James P. Pinkerton, a White House deputy assistant for policy planning, had been pushing Mr. Bush to become the "empowerment" President.
The charged word refers to a list of social policies that circumvent bureaucracies, most notably tenant management of public housing and plans that let parents choose the schools their children attend. More generally, it is a plea for the President to set a more active tone on a variety of domestic fronts.
"The problems in our inner cities and poverty areas cry out for audacious solutions," Mr. Kemp wrote in a memorandum to the President last fall, suggesting ideas for the speech.
But others like John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, have viewed these enthusiasms warily. And they oversaw the drafting of the speech.
An Administration official said early versions had the President applauding Kimi Gray, the Washington tenant leader whom Mr. Kemp has turned into a symbol for his cause. But after review by Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu, that and other empowerment touches went by the wayside.
Mr. Bush never mentioned the word "empowerment" in his speech, although he spoke 10 times of "power," as in pledges to move "power and decision-making closer to the people."
 
A Victory or a Defeat?

Is that a victory for empowerment or a defeat? Political referees were scoring it both ways.
The address was solidly Republican in its reference to a capital gains cut to stimulate economic growth. But in claiming that a renewed country was "within our reach," it seemed to borrow from the title of a book by Lisbeth Schorr, a liberal academic, whose writing promotes precisely the kind of Government social programs that the empowerment theorists criticize.
Martin Anderson, who served as domestic policy adviser in the early years of the Reagan Administration, argued that Mr. Bush's call for a capital gains cut was a signal of a resolve to tax and spend less.
But Burton Yale Pines of the Heritage Foundation had the opposite fear, worrying that the speech's call for new highway and energy policies might be opening the door to "an enormous pork barrel."
Mr. Bush seems most comfortable, and most committed, when he speaks of voluntary service.
But in places like the Robert Taylor homes, the Chicago housing project where even the police are afraid to go inside. Does Mr. Bush truly envision a phalanx of volunteers stepping forth to do what he calls "the hard work of freedom?"
Mr. Phillips argues that a more active policy on social welfare issues could bring political risks. "He'd be playing with issues on which the Democrats have more credibility," he said. "If you give it lip service without being too specific about it, they can't tie you to it much."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Britain;
In Cotswold Town, Chance to Relive Finest Hour as B-52's Return

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: FAIRFORD, England, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The Royal Air Force flew British Stirling bombers against targets in Germany from here in World War II, and gliders that landed 250 troops behind the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944.
Any day now, giant American B-52 bombers will swoop down on the long runway, load up with up to 29 tons of bombs apiece, and take off again to unload on Iraqi targets 2,750 miles away. 
 For most people in Fairford, a picturesque Cotswold village about two hours west of London, the Americans are a welcome sight, since the R.A.F. no longer uses the base and the United States Strategic Air Command also pulled out, and pulled the plug on a part of the local economy, only last year.
That was after it was clear that war with the Soviet Union probably would never come. But fighting a real war to force Iraq out of Kuwait is something the British, with 40,000 troops in the Persian Gulf, take in stride.
 
Forgetting the Economy

For many villagers in this town of 2,500, participating in the war effort is a chance to relive their finest hour, forgetting the miseries of high inflation and rising unemployment, and fighting shoulder to shoulder with the United States against a faraway dictator, a role some have yearned after for the last 45 years.
"There's a war on, and the B-52's will help get it over with sooner," said Ruth Ritter, 65, the town mayor who served in the air force in what everybody here still calls the last war. "I think all war is a tragedy, but the place has rallied round, and most people are pleased the Americans are coming back. It's going to help unemployment for the short term."
Philip Hope, the 54-year-old proprietor of a news agent's shop on the market square, said that about a thousand United States Air Force medical personnel who were the first to arrive last month had found their mothballed housing lacking such necessities as blankets, sheets and pillowcases.
 
Truckloads of Blankets

"The girls are all dressing in the dark, because they don't have any curtains," he said. "We found out by chance, talking to them, that they didn't have any blankets, so we put up a notice in the store window, and we've had a great response -- two or three truckloads so far."
Outside, a dusting of snow lay on the slate roofs of the gray Cotswold stone houses and some of the Americans, part of a contingent of 1,000 staffing the 870th United States Air Force Contingency Hospital at the nearby air base of Little Rissington, were sightseeing around the 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic Church of St. Mary the Virgin in a cold mist.
"It's been a super reception," said one of the hospital's doctors, Lieut. Col. Michael Wilson, 40, of Iowa City, Iowa, who arrived Jan. 15 from Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where he is chairman of orthopedics and his wife is also a military physician.
Capt. Michael Rein, the unit's public affairs officer, said the 870th had been eastablished in 1984 as a 1,500-bed, long-term treatment center for casualties from the NATO-Warsaw Pact conflict that the B-52's had also originally been stationed here for.
 
No Eyebrows Raised
 While American nuclear weapons deployed in Britain to deter Soviet attack have often given rise to vigorous antiwar protests, the knowledge that eight-engine B-52's will soon be screaming down the runways with bellies full of conventional bombs to kill Iraqi Republican Guards does not seem to raise so much as an eyebrow hereabouts.
"Nobody here's against the planes for what they're going to do," said Clive Whitehead, 51, a local greengrocer on London Street. He said that a few of the villagers who lived along the runway approaches beyond the hill that separates the base from the town might be worried about the noise.
Several thousand chickens live there at Michael Griffin's poultry farm, but Mrs. Griffin gave the impression that the birds would be fine. When B-52's had flown in and out of the base in the past, she said, the birds had been more unnerved by helicopters than bombers.
 
Air Force Tankers Until '90
 KC-135A Air Force tankers were based here from 1979 until last summer, refueling the B-52's from American units that came here in annual exercises dubbed Mighty Warrior. The base was officially inactivated only last Oct. 1.
Plaques from two B-52 units, the Second Bombardment Wing and the 62d Heavy Bomb Squadron, decorated the wall of the bar in The Bull, the hotel on the main town square. Its manager, Leslie Hathaway, 39, said that business, which had dropped off considerably when the Americans left last summer, had picked up again since last week.
Knots of people warming themselves by the fireside talked mainly about the war.
One man, Steven Sevage, 21, an electrician from Liverpool, argued against it. "How far in evolution do we have to go before people stop getting stabbed in the heart with a bayonet," he asked. "How many countries in the Middle East did the British Empire invade? Nobody stopped us then."

HEADLINE: President to Seek $23 Billion Saving in Medicare Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Just three months after signing legislation to cut Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors by $32 billion over five years, President Bush will ask Congress on Monday to cut at least $23 billion more in a similar period from the fast-growing program.
The proposals, part of the President's budget for 1992, are sure to reignite debate over Medicare, which finances health care for 33 million elderly and disabled Americans. Some lawmakers are already suggesting that the proposals will break a budget deal sealed in October. 
 "As far as I'm concerned, further Medicare cuts would be a deal-breaker," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas. As chairman of the Finance Committee, Mr. Bentsen has more influence over Medicare legislation than any other senator.
 
Impact of Gulf War
 Congressional leaders of both parties say they want to preserve the framework for Federal spending and taxes forged by the White House and Congress last year. But it may be blown apart by the costs of the recession, war in the Persian Gulf and Federal insurance for depositors in banks and bankrupt savings and loan associations.
The Congressional Budget Office says the war could cost $28 billion to $86 billion, of which at least half may be defrayed by foreign contributions. Despite the war, Mr. Bush's budget for the fiscal year that begins in October proceeds with the Pentagon's plan to reduce the armed forces by a quarter by 1995. [Page 19.]
"Were it not for the twin problems of recession and the war," Senator Jim Sasser, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in an interview, "this would be a smooth budget year, and we could have taken an uncomplicated, uncontroversial approach. But if the war goes on for more than two or three months, we may have a very turbulent budget year."
Within the constraints of the budget agreement last fall, Mr. Bush will also propose low-cost steps to combat infant mortality, a modest expansion of some child nutrition programs, major reductions in Federal aid to college students from middle-income families and a substantial increase in spending for highways and space programs.
Administration officials acknowledge that the proposed cutbacks in the growth of payments to hospitals and doctors were not required by or envisioned in last year's budget agreement. But they say it is essential to slow the growth of Medicare costs, which rose nearly 14 percent last year, to $107 billion.
Last year's budget agreement covered five years, and many lawmakers say they assumed they would not have to make another major effort at deficit reduction before the 1992 elections.
It is not clear what Mr. Bush wants to do with the money he would save by trimming Medicare payments to hospitals, doctors, laboratories and suppliers of medical equipment to the elderly and disabled.
 
Teaching Hospitals Affected
 The biggest savings, $1.4 billion next year and $9.6 billion over five years, would result from his proposal to cut payments to teaching hospitals. Such hospitals receive an allowance for their extra costs from training doctors and treating people who are more severely ill than the average patient. Most teaching hospitals are in inner cities and serve many poor people.
Under another Bush proposal, the Federal Government would no longer pay hospitals for certain outpatient services provided to Medicare beneficiaries within 15 days after they are discharged from a hospital. The Administration contends that such a change is justified whenever the outpatient services are related to the illness or injury for which a person was admitted to the hospital and for which the hospital has already been paid. Medicare officials say this change would save $30 million next year and $230 million over five years.
Paul C. Rettig, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said the proposed cuts, if approved, would almost certainly contribute to "a deterioration in the quality of care and access to care."
After an agonized struggle over the budget last year, Congress appears unlikely to accept the President's Medicare proposals, some of which were previously considered and rejected by Congress. But many lawmakers operate on the premise that doctors are overpaid, so it is conceivable that Congress could agree to trim Medicare payments to certain medical specialists as the Administration suggests.
 
Change in Payroll Taxes
 Confidential budget documents show that the Administration is seeking to trim Medicare by $3.2 billion next year and more than $23 billion over five years. Nevertheless, Medicare would continue growing, to $123 billion next year, from $114 billion this year.
Mr. Bush also proposes to raise revenue for the Medicare trust fund by requiring more state and local government workers to pay Medicare payroll taxes.
Under current law, state and local workers are required to pay such taxes if they were hired after March 31, 1986, but not if they were hired on or before that date. Although there is a sizable pool of state and local workers who have not contributed to the Medicare and Social Security programs, most will still qualify for Medicare benefits because of other jobs they or their spouses have held. The Administration says eliminating this tax break would produce $1.2 billion in new revenue next year and $8 billion over five years.
The Medicare program is less than half the size of Social Security, but is growing twice as fast. Medicare outlays grow rapidly because the elderly population is increasing, because medical care costs are outstripping other prices and because beneficiaries are using more and increasingly complex services.
Mr. Bush's budget assumes that the recession will end by midyear and that the economy will start growing, so the gross national product will rise this year by nine-tenths of 1 percent, after adjusting for inflation.
In one chapter of the budget, Mr. Bush says deterioration of the economy will have "a large negative impact on the deficit," driving it to a record $318 billion this year. The Administration estimates that unemployment, which rose to 6.2 percent in January, will average 6.7 percent this year.
Here is a summary of other proposals in Mr. Bush's budget:
STUDENT AID: The maximum Pell Grant for students attending a college or trade school would be increased to more than $3,500, from the current $2,300. About 3.3 million students now receive such aid. To finance larger grants for the neediest students, Mr. Bush would reduce or eliminate grants to students from middle-income families. One result would be to channel more of the available money to trade schools, which enroll many of the neediest students.
HEALTH: The Federal Government would spend $170 million next year to provide comprehensive prenatal care and other medical services to pregnant women in 10 cities with the highest infant mortality rates, including Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington. But much of the money would be taken from other maternal and child health programs and from community health centers serving low-income people.
CHILD NUTRITION: Mr. Bush proposes a modest expansion of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children. The program, known as WIC, provides low-income families with Government vouchers to buy milk, cheese, infant formula, cereal, eggs and orange juice. It serves 4.4 million people, representing 60 percent of those who are fully eligible.
But Mr. Bush is also proposing to slash cash and commodity subsidies for lunches served to schoolchildren from families with incomes more than three and a half times the official poverty level, which was $12,675 for a family of four in 1989.
The White House is notoriously prone to error in predicting the deficit. In January 1990, for example, it predicted a 1990 deficit of $124 billion; in fact, it was $220 billion.

Central America Faces New U.S. Policy: The Cold Shoulder

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
AFTER a decade of war, clashing ideologies and Washington's obsessive involvement, Central America has found itself the object of perhaps the only United States attitude that could still leave regional leaders off balance: indifference.
Just 10 years ago, the strategic importance of the tiny continental appendage was considered a given. Leftist rebels were waging a "final offensive" in El Salvador. Sandinista Nicaragua seemed ready to export revolution. And the Reagan Administration declared the region's battles to be an apocalyptic showdown between freedom and Communist domination. 
 Today, with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, that grand geopolitical concern seems almost quaint. And the Persian Gulf, where Americans, not just their surrogates, are dying, has riveted the attention of United States citizens and policymakers alike.
But for Central Americans, who had rarely viewed their own troubles in cold war terms, the abrupt reduction in United States interest has proved just as baffling and precipitous as its sudden onset a decade ago. Like a train roaring through a rural town, United States foreign policy burst through central America at full speed and has now disappeared into the night.
Historians note that the reduced importance of Central America on Washington's foreign agenda merely continues a cycle of inattention, alarm and intervention that has characterized United States policy for a century and a half. It can also be explained as a function of domestic politics in Washington: Central America has become a subject of high political cost and minimum political benefit.
Having watched Ronald Reagan sacrifice public support to his commitment to the Nicaraguan contra war, George Bush recognized early on that the anti-Sandinista struggle was a political tar baby. The victory of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in Nicaraguan elections last year only permitted Mr. Bush a more graceful exit from a foreign policy conundrum that he was already determined to escape.
But a striking measure of the Administration's desire to put Central America aside has been the degree to which Washington's principal goals remain unaccomplished. In Nicaragua, Mrs. Chamorro's Government remains a thin, ineffective veneer over a still-formidable Sandinista-controlled army and police apparatus. In El Salvador, the bloody civil war grinds on. Even in Panama, a peripheral dilemma that Mr. Bush attempted to resolve once and for all by removing Gen. Manuel Noriega, no strong or stable democracy has taken root since the American invasion.
So completely has America's attention moved beyond such issues that events which might once have ranked as hemispheric crises have slipped past with no lasting consequences. In El Salvador, neither the murder of an American helicopter crew by rebel guerrillas nor the Government's refusal to fully investigate the 1989 assassination of six Jesuit priests has been enough to provoke serious changes in American policy. In Panama, a quixotic coup attempt by former military officers was put down, then ignored. And in Nicaragua, admissions that Sandinista army officers had shipped sophisticated weapons to Salvadoran rebels -- the incendiary charge that had ignited a decade of war -- was shrugged off after Mrs. Chamorro's Government stepped in to exculpate her Sandinista-dominated military command.
Once scrutinized and interpreted in the United States as part of a great national debate, such events have slipped back into the tedium and assumed irrelevance of most third world news. In San Salvador, the once-shocking chronicle of a self-destructing society has become a trickle of wire-service stories. In Managua, a once formidable press corps has shrunk to its lowest levels since before the Sandinista revolution in 1979.
To many experts, the eclipse of Central America as a foreign policy issue is a testimony to the power of the American President's ability to determine the nation's political agenda. Once defined by President Reagan and his first Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, as a cold-war battleground, Central America was invested with political importance independent of its true strategic value.
Since the Soviet bloc dissolved and the White House turned away, however, the effect has been reversed entirely. No strategic importance has been found where none is acknowledged. And viewed without a cold war lens, the region's sharp contrasts have turned to gray.
"Central America was always viewed as a story of good guys or bad guys," said Robert Pastor, an expert on Latin American affairs at Emory University. "Problems of political transition, economic adjustment -- those are not easy to describe in black and white terms, and they're even harder to resolve."
For many opponents of the Reagan approach to Central America, America's new indifference has been greeted as a source of hope and potential assurance against future intervention.
Paradoxically, however, perhaps no one has been as surprised or dismayed by Washington's attention as those who were the chief targets of its ire. As if hungering to reinject himself into American policy discussions, the former Nicaraguan President, Daniel Ortega Saavedra, journeyed to Baghdad in January with the declared aim of averting the Persian Gulf war and giving Saddam Hussein advice on how to negotiate with Washington.
But the Central American revolutionary, who had once obsessed and enraged Washington with his every utterance, earned only a few wordless seconds on TV and an unaccustomed lesson in the oldest law of politics: the only thing worse than bad press is no press at all.

Bush's Holy War: The Crusader's Cloak Can Grow Heavy on the Shoulders

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS President Bush gambles for greatness in the Persian Gulf, he finds himself in a rare predicament.
The pragmatic President who plied Realpolitik for the first two years of his Administration is suddenly on a moral crusade. The President who always tended to shy away from rallying the American public to any cause for any sustained period is now offering a passionate disquisition on good versus evil, right versus wrong, a just war, a moral use of force, virtue and vice, religious values and the will of God. 
 In explaining the war in the Middle East and building support for it, Mr. Bush must blend the proper elements of strategic realism and morality. If he errs on the side of realism, without offering a greater good, he demoralizes the troops and the country and encourages the notion that this is a conflict involving no more than trading blood for oil, as the protesters suggest. If he offers too much moral umbrage, too many overdrawn comparisons to Hitler, he runs the risk of so enlarging the war objectives that he could not accept anything less than total capitulation; how can you leave Evil Incarnate to run Iraq?
Wars are just, after all, precisely insofar as their aims and means are limited, keeping the violence in proportion to the reason for fighting. That is what makes them different from holy wars, in which there are no restraints or boundaries because it is God's will to slaughter the infidel.
For better or worse, by talking so aggressively about right and wrong, Mr. Bush has set a new moral standard by which to measure his future foreign policy. "If you claim to act from moral motives on one occasion, your motives will be questioned on other actions," said Michael Walzer, author of "Just and Unjust Wars." "There has to be a balancing of the moral ledger over the long haul."
The Democrats have already indicated that they will hold President Bush accountable for some consistency on the issue. In his response to the President's State of the Union address, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine said America must seek a world "where justice and human rights are respected everywhere."
"Students massacred in China, priests murdered in Central America, demonstrators gunned down in Lithuania -- these acts of violence are as wrong as Iraqi soldiers killing civilians," Mr. Mitchell said. "We cannot oppose oppression in one place and overlook it in another."
There will be some awkwardness about the President's returning to the "let's make a deal" style of policy-making that he practiced for two years with his friend Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d -- guided not by the sort of ideologies and moral edge that influenced Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, but more completely by instinct, reasonableness and a sensitivity to American economic interests. The White House has not given a high level of attention to Amnesty International reports in the last year detailing abuses in such countries as Iran, Burma, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. And while the State Department's annual report on human rights calls Iraq's record "abysmal," it also sharply berates Syria, an American ally in the gulf war, and to a lesser degree criticizes Kuwait, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel.
But just before he began the bombardment of Baghdad, Mr. Bush said "the moral purpose" of the war could be found in an Amnesty International report detailing the tortures and killing of Kuwaitis by Iraqi soldiers.
"I don't know about the rest of the American people, but I care," the President told People magazine. "Kids there who were passing out leaflets in Kuwait were picked up by the Iraqis. They were 15 or 16. They were tied to a stake in a square in Kuwait and then they were made to wait 'til their parents came and then they were shot. Does the world give a damn about that any more? I do, and I think those kids out there in the desert understand, too."
A senior Bush adviser was asked before the war why the lives of the Chinese young people were less a subject of vocal American moral outrage than the lives of the Kuwaiti young people. "Regimes doing it to their own is different because there's relatively little you can do about that," the White House official replied. "And the President thinks it's particularly horrible when an outsider comes in and visits these horrors on people."
Of course, Saddam Hussein has killed his own people, too, and with poison gas, but when he did it the United States was still in its time of Middle East pragmatism, hoping that Mr. Hussein's Iraq, however brutal, could be kept on a leash while continuing to balance the fanatacism of Iran. The United States had, after all, been hoping for that since Iraq invaded Iran in 1980.
The President's newfound vocal morality may make it more difficult for him to make the sort of trade-offs that he has made to keep the anti-Iraq alliance together, or it may at least give his critics ammunition when he does. The most dramatic of these maneuvers included refusing to strongly criticize Mikhail S. Gorbachev after Soviet security forces killed 21 pro-independence demonstrators in the Baltics, and posing for a smiling picture with Hafez al-Assad, even though the State Department notes that the Syrian leader's record on human rights is almost indistinguishable from Saddam Hussein's and even though it is believed that Syria is harboring the perpetrators of the bombing of Pan Am flight 103.
Political leaders must use moral rhetoric to justify wars because they have to defend, both ethically and politically, the act of killing people. On a purely cynical level, it is necessary to build a consensus. As Nietzsche once wrote, "Morality is the best of all devices for leading mankind by the nose."
But the United States is a nation with a streak of piousness and a belief that morality must be part of public policy, and leaders who fail to morally engage Americans risk a backlash. Patrick Glynn of the American Enterprise Institute noted that when Lyndon Johnson tried to keep Vietnam on a back burner and avoid a moral dialogue, fearing that his social programs might be swept aside if war fever raged and the political right benefited, the war protesters started the moral debate for him.
Mr. Bush may be known for the malleability of his political principles, but his advisers say he truly believes he has the moral high ground in the gulf. As one of his aides earnestly put it, the week America went to war: "This is not about oil. This is about right and wrong."
 Mr. Bush is, after all, from the Eastern upper class that dominated the foreign policy establishment for decades, certain of its own morality and its right to lead. Within that class, he was among those committed to the principle that America had an obligation to intervene to help less powerful countries and to hold the line against aggression.
In June 1940, 16-year-old George Bush listened raptly when Henry L. Stimson, Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of War -- who later would take a major responsibility in developing the atom bomb and deciding to drop it on Japan -- spoke at the graduation at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass. Colonel Stimson, who believed that internationalism went hand in hand with moral responsibility and that it was America's duty to civilize the world, told his young listeners he envied them "the opportunity" to choose between "right and wrong" and stand up for good against evil.
Last week, Mr. Bush cited Plato, Cicero and St. Thomas Aquinas in arguing that "the first principle of a just war is that it support a just cause."
"It is a war with which good will prevail," he told the National Religious Broadcasters Convention. "Our cause could not be more noble." In his proclamation for a National Prayer Day today, he said that, "entrusted with the holy gift of freedom, and allowed to prosper in its great light, we have a responsibility to serve as a beacon to the world."
While some American commentators have questioned whether it was prudent for Mr. Bush to go to war, Saddam Hussein makes such a seductive villain that few pundits have questioned the President's assertion that this is a just war.
St. Augustine developed the just-war theory in the fifth century, on the premise that there are worse evils than physical destruction; it has been the dominant Christian ethical position on war ever since. "We go to war to gain peace," he wrote, and St. Thomas Aquinas added the refinement that the invaders should have "a rightful intention."
Ethicists are heartened that the country is engaged in a moral debate. And, they point out, morality is not like logic. It is not always consistent and it is not always pure. A leader must act appropriately to each occasion, applying prudence and hopefully some consistency. But they also agree that now that Mr. Bush has shown his moral edge, he may not be able to sheathe it after the Iraqis are punished. As Mr. Glynn put it, "He may end up being carried along by this ball he's begun rolling."

HEADLINE: The World;
For the Economy, the Gulf War Has Little Impact -- So Far

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
WAR has a way of putting lesser matters in a different perspective, but as a number of politicians and economists noted last week, it does not make them disappear. Washington must still cope with the age-old issues of guns vs. butter. And mercifully, economists say, if there is ever such a thing as the right time to fight a war, this is it. Unless Iraq manages to wreak havoc in the Saudi oilfields or shocks American consumers into a prolonged and unaccustomed bout of self-denial, it will barely cause a ripple in the economy.
Astonishingly expensive weapons are going up in smoke in Operation Desert Storm -- a single Patriot missile costs as much as a year's worth of Head Start for 500 pre-schoolers. But as Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs International notes, "this is a prepaid war" -- the weapons are coming out of the enormous stockpiles amassed for a no-holds-barred defense of Europe, and most will probably not be replaced after the fighting is over. 
 No war, of course, can be fought entirely out of inventory. The Pentagon is shopping for hundreds of items ranging from sand-resistant boots to anti-nerve gas injectors.
At least one big-ticket item, fuel, is being picked up by the Saudis. And unlike Korea or Vietnam, this war is being fought during a recession. With excess capacity in almost every domestic industry, war production need not come at the expense of consumption or business investment.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned last week that one real risk is that the war will retard the economy, not overheat it. A big spike in oil prices or a mass strike by consumers would work like a tax increase, paring demand and deepening a recession that, in light of the latest unemployment figures, is looking increasingly serious.
 
Stimulating Demand
 But neither seems likely. Worldwide inventories of oil are apparently sufficient to buffer anything short of a wipeout of Saudi oil operations. And though consumer confidence has yet to rebound from prewar jitters, few analysts think the war itself will keep shoppers out of stores for very long.
Wars typically stimulate demand for goods and services, straining productive capacity and driving governments to extraordinary efforts to contain civilian buying power. In World War II, for example, Washington simply ordered companies to stop making low-priority items and rationed many others. These direct constraints were supplemented with high-pressure appeals to buy war bonds.
In the case of Vietnam, President Lyndon B. Johnson dared not ask Congress to cut domestic spending or take more out of workers' paychecks, and the public was hardly in the mood to save. The result was inflation -- what Richard Nixon the Presidential candidate called "the cruelest tax."
This time around, argues William A. Niskanen, the head of the Cato Institute, who was an economic adviser to President Ronald W. Reagan, circumstances are different. Great quantities of costly munitions are being expended in the air war, and a ground assault could use up hardware at an unprecedented rate. But conventional weapons inventories, built up over the last two decades to defend Western Europe against the Red Army, far exceed most analysts' estimates of projected needs.
Consider, for example, the TOW infantry missile. According to Steven Alexis Cain of the Defense Budget Project, the Pentagon has purchased some 267,000 TOW's since 1974. And while procurement is only a "rough estimate" of inventories, it is difficult to see how the Army could use up more than a small fraction of them against Saddam Hussein's few thousand tanks and armored personnel carriers.
A similar story can be told about the pinpoint-accurate Tomahawk cruise missile, used to wipe out command and communications facilities in the wee hours of the war. Some 200 Tomahawks were launched -- leaving 2,200 of the $1.35 million weapons. The Pentagon is doing some buying. The Commerce Department reported last week that factory orders for machines and other durable equipment were up 4.4 percent in December, with the gain due largely to orders for military goods. But thanks to the recession, the economy apparently has the capacity to meet military demands without breaking a sweat.
The gain made up less than half the 10 percent decline in factory demand in November, and left total orders a full 7 percent below last year's level. It is always possible, Mr. Niskanen concedes, that war demand will cause economic bottlenecks -- laid-off auto workers in Detroit won't jump on the first plane to Arizona, where jobs riveting helicopter fuselages are going begging.
 
Disguised Blessings
 The industry that might have been most greatly affected by shortages of specialized workers was air transport, which lost thousands of pilots in the call-up of reserves. But the call-up has proved a blessing of sorts, trimming payrolls while every airline had too many seats and too few passengers. The callup had similar effects in other industries undergoing layoffs.
It should thus come as no surprise that Robert Reischauer of the Budget Office argues it would be premature to offset increased military demand with higher taxes. Indeed, the Fed chairman, Mr. Greenspan, suggests the greater risk is that the war will actually lengthen and deepen the recession by curbing total demand.
The doubling of oil prices after the August invasion of Kuwait drained domestic purchasing power -- and with it any doubts that the American economy was in recession. Oil prices ebbed in December, as Saudi Arabia made good on its promise to make up for supplies lost in Iraq and Kuwait. And they fell sharply when it appeared that the liberation of Kuwait would be swift and easy. But a successful Iraqi attack on Saudi refineries and loading operations might again push crude prices toward $40 a barrel.
 
Awash in Oil
 Philip Verleger, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, notes that the world is now awash with oil. Commercial inventories are at their highest since the early 1980's, and the industrial economies are committed to selling 2 million barrels a day from strategic reserves to cover temporary shortfalls in production.
Tom Wallin, an analyst at the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, adds that seasonal oil consumption patterns are also working in the allies' favor: energy demand will dip to the annual low in April or May, giving the allies breathing room to repair any damage to the oil infrastructure.
With or without higher oil prices, the war could cause the economy to contract if Americans put away their credit cards for the duration. "You risk consumer confidence deteriorating," Mr. Greenspan told the House Banking Committee Thursday. "This economy is obviously subject more than at anytime I have seen in the recent past to changes in psychology."
But it is important to distinguish shoppers' decisions to stay home to catch the war news -- what has been dubbed "The CNN factor" -- from decisions to forgo consumption that reflect more fundamental concerns about their financial security. It is hardly surprising, argues Mr. Reischauer, that people think twice in the early days of a war before buying a new Cadillac. But he finds it improbable that the war worries would generate enduring changes in spending.
Historically, he notes, changes in consumer confidence are the effect rather than the cause of real changes in the economy. People may buy less because they fear unemployment. "But most analyses," he concludes, "suggest that expectations don't in themselves explain much."
The odds are still high, then, that the gulf war will neither generate new inflationary pressures nor add much to the pain of the current recession. That's good -- or is it?
In past wars, the effects have quickly been felt at home in the form of higher prices or material shortages. That has translated into a sense of shared sacrifice with the soldiers at the front -- or in the case of Vietnam, a check on the militancy of policymakers. This time around, harsh economic realities will not help fill the gulf of perception between those who do the fighting and those who watch it on TV.

New York City Tallies The Human Costs Of Its 1970's Cutbacks

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
FORCED to pare spending, some New York City officials are expressing concern that false economies will return to haunt them. Since the city's 1975 fiscal crisis, the enduring impact of thousands of layoffs, of other wholesale budget cuts, and of deferred maintenance of bridges, school buildings, roads and mass-transit equipment is difficult to quantify. But, as the city again considers economies of that magnitude for the first time since the mid-1970's, and New York State does, too, some officials are quietly asking -- and advocates outside government are questioning more vocally -- what price today's cutbacks will exact.
"We know from our experience in the 1970's," said Mayor David N. Dinkins, "that the budget cuts of today lead to higher social costs a decade from now." 
 As it begins its second year, the Dinkins administration is still struggling with the legacy of budget cuts made as long as a decade and a half ago. Mr. Dinkins has sought to protect and expand preventive services like prenatal care that he had championed as the Manhattan Borough President. But the dimensions of cutbacks now being contemplated, coupled with legal mandates to spend and political pressures that narrowly define what can be cut, have revived profound questions:
* Will curtailing school, social service and repair programs again prove to have been imprudent?
* Has the city been too timid to explore the elimination of frills that it can no longer afford instead of cutting into bone?
* Are officials transforming adversity into opportunity, as previous administrations did when, for instance, they managed to negotiate reductions in manning levels for garbage trucks and for certain police patrol cars?
Years before the fiscal crisis erupted in public, the neglect of New York City's physical structures was graphic. The plunging of an asphalt truck through the deteriorated deck of the West Side Highway in 1973 was paradigmatic of the city's deferred maintenance philosophy.
Measuring the impact of personnel decisions is more difficult, although the firefighters' union linked the deaths of two Queens men last month to the closing of a nearby firehouse. The city is still reaping the consequences of contract perquisites, including days off, that were granted in place of raises and of early retirements that depleted the ranks of experienced supervisors.
Many law-enforcement authorities draw a more direct line between the layoffs of several thousand police officers in the summer of 1975 and a precipitous rise in street robberies that peaked in 1981. They acknowledge, however, that other factors have fueled the increase in reported crime. Repeated campaign promises have been insufficient to restore patrol strength to pre-fiscal crisis levels.
"If you make a decision to lay off and not hire for five years, you pay a price for 15 years," said Chief Anthony M. Voelker of the Police Department's Organized Crime Control Bureau. The force shrank from nearly 32,000 in the early 1970's to fewer than 22,000 in 1981. Numerically, the department never recovered -- there are 26,851 officers on the force today (although other variables, including the expanded use of civilians in clerical jobs to free up uniformed officers, can skew comparisons).
"We're still trying to catch up," said Raymond W. Kelly, the first deputy commissioner. "Reported crime is up 60 percent, manpower is down 20 percent. We're training in an inadequate building. That's the immediate tangible legacy."
Correlating the decline in education and social services and soaring rates of juvenile crime, poverty and unemployment is more theoretical -- particularly when there may be little empirical evidence and when many other cities that did not suffer a fiscal crisis are experiencing some of the same problems. Anecdotal evidence suggests some connection, though, and even cuts that seem marginal in terms of a $29 billion budget can have major consequences for the public when an agency has to pare expenses by a hefty percent.
"A lot of these young people who are committing violent crime today are the negative beneficiaries of the cuts 15 years ago," said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch. "If we would've served 10 more kids it would have been worth it. But whether real alternatives would have worked, we will never know."
That more than 100 elementary schools are still without librarians and the fact that 4 in 10 teachers will be eligible for retirement in five years are both direct results of budget-cutting in the mid-1970's, Board of Education officials say. High-school dropout rates and the demand for remedial programs may still be, in part, a consequence of larger classes, lack of guidance counselors and elimination of organized after-school activities.
Some educators argue that increasing class size by several students probably had only a modest impact. Barbara Blum, a former city welfare official who is now president of the Foundation for Child Development, an advocacy group, suggests that shrinking services contributed to some of the high unemployment and antisocial behavior by young people, just as the decline in manufacturing jobs and other economic changes did.
While the enduring effects may be difficult to quantify, few people dispute who bore the brunt of the cutbacks. "The greatest burden was borne by the city's poor, whose standard of living was reduced," Professors Charles Brecher and Raymond D. Horton, now officials of the Citizens Budget Commission, a research group financed by businesses, wrote in "Setting the Municipal Priorities" (Allanheld, Osmun and Company Inc., 1981).
The legacy of the fiscal crisis has not been all negative. Some lessons were not forgotten as the city again imposed painful economies. "We learned that imposing layoffs in the middle of a school year imposes unique havoc," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "I'm the mother of a 22-year-old son who had six first-grade teachers and learned to read when he was 9."
Some New Yorkers were galvanized into greater civic commitment. Citizens formed security patrols, and businesses joined self-taxing districts to provide additional services, and a subway transfer point that had been contemplated by government for years was finally built by a private developer. Mr. Dinkins has commissioned more studies of how to deliver services more efficiently. "The one enormous legacy of the fiscal crisis was a missed opportunity," Mr. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission said. "We didn't change the way we provide public services. We simply shrunk the system."

The Push to Consider A Once Taboo Subject: National School Tests

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT

 BODY:
IS there something un-American about testing all elementary and high school students and providing the results to colleges and potential employers?
For more than a decade the notion of setting national standards that could be used to evaluate the performance of schoolchildren -- and their schools -- has been percolating among educational theorists. Such tests drive students' efforts in Japan, Britain, France, Germany and most of the rest of the industrialized world, and many argue that the United States has to adopt such methods to keep up. 
 While sharing the concerns about the quality of education, though, American politicians, educators and others have rejected any suggestion of weakening the tradition of state and local control over education as too radical for a nation of Horatio Alger bootstrappers.
But now proposals for national testing are being talked about and pushed by politicians and business groups frustrated with the under-prepared workers the American education system produces.
Reflecting that concern is the Secretary's Commission on Achieving Needed Skills, set up by former Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole to develop a test to determine the workforce skills that 16-year-olds should have. There is also talk of expanding into a national examination the testing already being conducted by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a branch of the Federal Education Department charged with monitoring what students learn. .
With growing support for such standards, education groups are being forced to reconsider the issue.
Last week, for example, Educate America Inc., a new education group headed by former New Jersey Governor Thomas H. Kean, proposed mandatory national tests for all high school seniors, with results made available to colleges and employers.
And two weeks ago, a Presidential advisory group made up of business executives, politicians and educators recommended a national examination for all elementary and high school students.
"There has been a sea change on this front in the last year or two," said Chester E. Finn, one of the 25 members of the President's Education Policy Advisory Committee. "The idea is attaining a level of legitimacy it didn't have before and is beginning to find its way into policy circles."
Apart from fears of losing out in the international competition, the momentum is being fueled by the national education goals for 2000 agreed upon by President Bush and the governors last year. Without tests, proponents say, the country won't be able to assess whether it is moving toward the goals.
But getting from policy circles to implementation will be a formidable task politically.
Adopting such a system would involve a fundamental change of course in the country's approach to education. The United States has always emphasized standardized testing that is intended to measure ability and aptitude. Other countries test students on whether they attain standards that are publicly set in a national standard tied to a national examination system.
 Experts say a national examination in the United States would probably draw on European experience, but it would be significantly different, in part, because it would be shaped by a debate over who would control it.
 
Contending With Sensitivities
 It also will have to contend with sensitivities in the states and even within school districts to the comparisons on performance that inevitably will be made and with the problems of drawing standards and tests to cover a diverse population fairly.
 Apart from established education groups, which remain opposed to such tests, poor people, minority groups and states with high levels of poverty also have been wary. That is because the performance of poor, black and Hispanic students on standardized tests has consistently been below that of other groups.
 A chief issue has been what shape such an examination will take. To date, the most comprehensive proposal has come from two nonprofit education research centers. Mark Tucker, president of the National Center on Education and the Economy, in Rochester, and Dr. Lauren Resnick, director of the Learning Research and Development Center at the University of Pittsburgh, have called for curriculum-driven testing in three parts, called performance, portfolio and project examinations. In a test intended to measure performance, a student is given a task to be carried out in limited time. A portfolio examination evaluates a body of work assembled by a student. A project examination assesses how a student works with a group.
For all the debate on the issue of a national testing system, a number of questions remain. But what is new, and startling, is that the questions are being discussed in increasingly wider circles.
The American Association of School Administrators, which represents 18,000 local school superintendents and administrators and which has been against national tests and standards, for example, again considered the issue late last month.
"The idea of a single national test of 40 million schoolchildren was rejected outright," said Bruce Hunter, associate executive director of the organization. "But that we needed a national agreement on what children ought to know -- that there should be some national dialogue on standards -- there didn't seem to be any objection to that. "

For Schools Chancellor, No Hat and No Rabbit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
THIS has been a strange and often cheerless winter for Joseph A. Fernandez, the New York City Schools Chancellor.
When he flew in from Miami a year ago, he hit the ground running with a string of dazzling managerial and legislative triumphs that promised to rejuvenate the city's ailing schools. But in recent months he has become mired in budgets and labor negotiations. 
 When the Chancellor has had time to discuss ideas, they are attention-getting, but usually not things that are considered central to his reform mission: a plan for making condoms available on request to high school students, an experimental school for black and Hispanic males and warranties that graduates can read and calculate.
To critics, the proposals are sketchy and not well-researched. All are adrift in controversy. Questions are being raised why the condom program needs to be so far-reaching when there is no proof that such a program will reduce AIDS among teen-agers and when the disease seems largely confined to homosexuals and intravenous drug users or their sexual partners. Civil liberties groups have attacked the proposed school for what they see as its separatist ideology.
The warranty plan, while lauded by educators in Massachusetts and Maryland who have tried it, has been seen by some educators as more of a promotional gimmick than as a solid effort to tackle weaknesses in instruction or academic requirements.
While those proposals have been slowed by such reservations, Mr. Fernandez has moved quickly to confront the impact of the financial crisis on the school system. A week ago, he capped an effort to prevent thousands of layoffs of teachers by getting officials of the teachers' union to agree to defer 1 to 1 1/2 percent of members' wages this year into 1995 and 1996.
Not only did he prevent almost certain disruptions in class and student assignments, but his solution will undoubtedly be followed by the Dinkins administration with other unions.
Still, advocates like Noreen Connell, executive director of the Educational Priorities Panel, wonder who is providing leadership in learning.
 
A Job of Damage Control
 "Fernandez is a great communicator," said Ms. Connell, whose group is a coalition of advocacy groups, "and it would be nice to see that kind of excitement around the issue of learning come to the foreground."
Some critics feel there has been too little talk by Mr. Fernandez about reinvigorating what gets taught and how -- the subject of mathematics being the one exception -- and about sparking the attention of the flocks of children from troubled homes, about the basics of reading and writing.
Others, like Marjorie Wilkes, executive director of Interface, a nonprofit research group that studies educational programs, worry about the nature of Mr. Fernandez's tight inner circle. Mr. Fernandez has surrounded himself with talented lieutenants, she said -- administrators like Stanley S. Litow, Amina Abdur-Rahman and Robin Willner -- but they are not educators and are not experts in fields like instruction and subject content.
"Which says something about the priorities of this administration," Ms. Wilkes said.
Still others absolve the Chancellor, saying he came to New York to revitalize the school system but suddenly finds himself spending most of his time keeping it intact. Mr. Fernandez's predicament comes after such triumphs as the state laws making it easier to transfer principals out of their schools and abolishing the Board of Examiners.
"He's been bogged down in budget," said Charles I. Schonhaut, dean of Long Island University's education school and a former deputy chancellor. "Those initiatives that he wants to bring off he hasn't been able to pay the kind of attention to them that he should." Other educators note that Mr. Fernandez has lacked the money to undertake anything expensive.
Mr. Schonhaut, who was assistant to Chancellor Irving Anker when he had to cope with the bitter fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, in which 14,000 teachers were laid off, said at such times the job of an educational leader is "damage control -- how can we have the system survive despite this enormous blow it's taking."
 Interviewed as he began his second year, Mr. Fernandez acknowledged that the budget crisis was a major diversion, but said that it would not set back his plans. "I came here on a reform agenda," he said. "And while there may be distractions, they're not going to change my fervor for getting it done."
The trouble is that the budget quagmire will not go away. Many of the artful strategies that Mr. Fernandez put together in recent days, like the wage deferral plan, only delay painful decisions.
New Yorkers may have to become more tolerant about the slow pace of change, suggested Jeanne Frankl, executive director of the Public Education Association, an old-line advocacy group. Ms. Frankl blamed the city's political culture and not Mr. Fernandez for some of the Chancellor's more superficial stabs at change.
"I really think these glamorous initiatives are a response to the very high expectations of New York business and media and nonpublic school communities that some hero will come in and fix it all up," Ms. Frankl said. "And being a very skillful politician and public figure, he has responded to those demands."

Two Governors Face the Facts Of Life in a Lean Time

 BODY:
IT was a big week for bad news.
On Tuesday, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey proposed a $14.3 billion budget that called for thousands of layoffs and an 8 percent across-the-board cut in spending by state departments. The budget called for no new taxes, but included a controversial revenue-raising trick: the sale of $400 million worth of state roads to the New Jersey Turnpike Authority. 
 Although Governor Florio's budget reflects recessionary times, it nevertheless increases spending by 13 percent. The money will come from higher taxes that went into effect last year, and it will be largely eaten up by new costs the state has taken on for education and for welfare payments formerly paid by local governments.
On Thursday, it was Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's turn in New York. Mr. Cuomo offered a $29.1 billion budget that called for state spending to remain unchanged for the coming year.
Because the cost of state services will increase with inflation, this no-growth budget translated into deep cuts in programs. The Governor proposed to slash spending on education, Medicaid and aid to local governments. He also called for a 10-cent-a-gallon rise in the state gasoline tax, a 2 percent tax on out-of-state telephone calls and an extension of the state's sales tax to include moving services and mandatory gratuities. Mr. Cuomo was also looking for novel ways to raise money: he proposed selling Aqueduct race track to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Both Governors' budgets represent only the first round of drawn-out budget battles in Albany and Trenton. Expect the fighting to be fierce.


GRAPHIC: Governor Cuomo estimates a shortfall of $6 billion between the state's revenues in the 1991-1992 fiscal year and what it would need to maintain funding for current state programs. He proposes to make up about three-quarters of the difference with spending cuts, and the remainder with tax increases and other revenue. About 18,000 jobs, a tenth of the state's workforce, would be cut under the Governor's plan, up to 7,500 of them through layoffs and the rest through attrition. The final cut would be worked out with the Legislature; the Governor's plan is in effect the opening bid in a complex series of maneuvers. Among the Major elements of the Governor's program:
 
SPENDING CUTS - $4.52 billion
 
$965 million: Elimination of 18,000 jobs, a wage freeze and other cuts in state services
 
$891 million: State aid to local school districts
 
$875 million: Medicaid cost containment
 
$468 million: Unrestricted aid to local governments
 
$530 million: Aid to localities for criminal justice, highway maintenance, arts and other programs
 
$229 million: Other education aid, including funds for libraries and for private universities
 
$228 million: Aid to higher education; Regents and Liberty scholarships would be eliminated (Up to $100 million of these cuts could be replaced by tuition increases)
 
$175 million: Social service programs
 
$159 million: Miscellaneous cuts
 
NEW REVENUES - $1.54 billion
 
$730 million: New revenues and fees, among them:
 
 * $500 million from increasing gas tax by 10 cents per gallon
 * $69 million from 2% tax on out-of-state phone calls, extension of
 the sales tax and other taxes
 * $50 million from a $5 tax on tire sales
 * $40 million from increased estate taxes
 * $35 million from miscellaneous fees and charges
 * $36 million from closing tax loopholes
 
$410 million: From deferral of a planned cut in personal income taxes
 
$400 million: From nonrecurring revenues, among them:
 
 * $200 million from speeding up tax payments from the Metropolitan
 Transportation Authority
 * $100 million from accelerated tax collections
 * $100 million from sale of state property, including possible
 transfer of Aqueduct Race Track in Queens to the Port Authority

 Governor Florio estimates a shortfall of $1.14 billion in his 1992 spending plan. He proposes to make up the difference by a reduction of up to 8,000 jobs, by refusing to pay cost-of-living increases and by making adjustments in health and pension benefits, by merging a number of departments and by a $400 million sale of state roads to New Jersey Turpike Authority. Half of the job cuts would be by attrition and half by layoffs. Mr. Florio, having increased state taxes by $2.8 billion last year, is not proposing any tax increases. Mr. Florio's program is expected to be challenged by state employee unions, and by Turnpike bondholders. Among the major elements of the Governor's program:
 
SPENDING CUTS - $741 million
 
$239 million: Program cuts, 8% cuts in budgets of most departments, and merging of 19 departments into 16
 
$164 million: Withholding of previously agreed upon salary increases; includes possible layoffs of 1,300 in state college system
 
$75 million: From requiring state employees to contribute 25% to the cost of their health benefits
 
$63 million: From program reductions leading to layoffs of 2,450 employees
 
$55 million: From layoffs of 1,000 managerial employees
 
$55 million: From early retirements (1,300 employees expected to accept)
 
$40 million: From ending state practice of paying for 2% of employees' contributions to pensions
 
$25 million: From loss of 2,000 employees by attrition; only 2 out 0f 3 departing employees are to be replaced
 
$25 million: From fringe benefit reductions because of retirements and layoffs
 
NEW REVENUES - $400 million
 
From sales of state roads to the Turnpike Authority

HEADLINE: The World;
If It's Good News For the Oil Industry, The World Beware

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THERE is war in the Persian Gulf, recession nationwide and stubbornly high gasoline prices on every street corner, but over the last few days the major oil companies have nervously weighed in with news of a different tone: their profits are up sharply.
 Oil is probably the only industry that is bashful about higher profits, and with good reason. "Profits are exceptionally high only when there's some exceptional condition," said John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in New York, "and it's very often tied to exceptional bad news." 
 The last time many of the companies had it so good, at least in terms of prices, was at the beginning of 1990, when a record-breaking cold spell drove the price of heating oil up sharply, along with consumers' tempers. In spring 1989, they enjoyed a sudden spike in gasoline prices brought on when the Exxon Valdez fouled the waters of south-central Alaska and the port of Valdez was briefly shut.
 To economists, this all seems natural. "All U.S. industries should be expected to 'make hay while the sun shines,' just as they endure unfavorable conditions," wrote Robert L. Bradley Jr., president of the Institute for Energy Research in Houston. "Does a homeowner sell his house at historic cost or at whatever price the market will bear? If homeowners were forced to sell their houses at historic cost in a rising market, there would be excess demand for homes and a housing shortage -- just as there were oil shortages in 1974 and 1979." Those shortages were made worse, he argued, because prices were held down by government controls, so consumers did not conserve.
 Oil is an industry people love to hate. As industry executives see it, people resent it that the car, the symbol of independence, is actually tied to the multinational corporations that supply the fuel. "People don't like to feel dependent, helpless, without options," said Arthur E. Weise, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association. The oil market is often compared with the market for other commodities, he said, but if the price of orange juice rises, "people can drink tomato juice or not drink anything, and still lead perfectly fulfilled, happy lives."
 Another problem, he said, is that the oil companies are so huge, with profits in the billions. Other industries have huge companies, but few that deal directly with the public. "No one goes in and buys steel," he said.
 Others trace the public's feelings to the old days of the Rockefeller oil trust, Standard Oil. "It goes back to Standard Oil and price fixing," said Kent Hance, a former Congressman and chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission. "You learned about it in school," he said, "and you grew up thinking that oil companies are going to gouge you on gasoline, regardless. If gasoline was 20 cents a gallon, some people would be saying 'they're gouging us.' "
 Certainly the industry's timing, from a public relations standpoint, is dreadful. The profitable fourth-quarter results came out as the air war started. Many oil companies commission polls to measure how they are perceived. They know the world hates them. And they would rather be loved, not least because of renewed calls for a tax on "windfall profits," as was imposed in the 1970's, by lawmakers who think it is wrong for a well owner to benefit because the barrels he used to sell for $20 are now worth $40.
 The companies, chastened by President Bush last August to "show restraint" in gasoline prices and "not take advantage of the Middle East situation," thought they were ready when the bombers went in two weeks ago. Most of them declared price freezes in the first few hours of the air war. This gesture did them little good, however, because oil prices unexpectedly fell. In New York, the freeze actually seemed to hurt the companies' image; New York City's Consumer Affairs Commissioner and the chairman of the state Consumer Protection Board quickly charged that the freezes were a ploy to keep prices from falling.
 The industry conducted an intense campaign as the season for announcing fourth quarter results approached, explaining that American companies do not control the oil market, and that despite sudden prosperity they were not, over the long haul, terribly profitable. With the drop in prices as the war began, the current quarter will not be particularly attractive, they say.
 Mobil ran ads in national publications saying that in 12 years of the last 20, everything from television to tobacco was more profitable than oil.
 But others painted a different picture. John S. Herold Inc., a financial analyst that regularly publishes value estimates of oil companies, said last week that for shareholders in most major oil companies, total returns -- capital gains plus dividends -- were higher than for the Dow Jones index as a whole for the last five years.
 Chevron, based in San Francisco, sent its chairman to New York with a sheaf of charts to persuade reporters that oil was friendly. Prices for gasoline never rose nearly as much as the crude from which it is made, he said.
 But a telephone survey of 1,500 adults in December by Winona Market Research Inc., commissioned by Chevron, showed that among the 27 percent who opposed President Bush's decision to send troops to the gulf, one third thought the reason troops were sent was "to protect U.S. oil companies' assets in the Middle East."
 In reality, as Chevron noted, nearly all of those properties were nationalized before the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74. Chevron and other companies do not claim that oil has nothing to do with the war; they stress, though, that the issue is access. Few of the people surveyed knew of a Department of Energy report exonerating the companies of price gouging early in the crisis, but those who were told of it still did not trust the industry, the survey found.
The public, rightly or wrongly, continues to bite the hand that lights it, heats it and propels it. Oil provides about 42 percent of the energy consumed in this country, down only slightly from its share at the time of the first major oil crisis, in 1973, and is unlikely to fall sharply any time soon. Confronted with decisions about whether to drill in wilderness areas, whether to grant tax breaks or whether to institute import fees, the nation is facing the challenge of making rational policy judgments about an industry it hates.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL: Midseason Report;
After a Half, Knicks Faltering on All Fronts

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN

 BODY:
Anyone who can solve the Knicks' problems should report to Madison Square Garden immediately. The team needs help. No one expected New York to be well under .500 this late in the season; not the players, not the coaches, not the front office, not the fans, not even the team's opponents. But the Knicks, with a record of 20-25 after their victory over Sacramento last night, have earned every defeat.
Their play has lacked emotion. Their overall effort has been questionable in many games. And while they are a veteran team, they have not matured as a unit on the floor. Under pressure, they are prone to make costly turnovers, to force bad shots, to make mental errors, to forget teamwork and to resort to one-on-one play. 
 If the Knicks make the playoffs, what are the odds of them beating Boston, Detroit or Chicago in a series when they have trouble beating Orlando and Minnesota at home? With New York apparently headed toward an early summer vacation, here is an assessment of the team midway through a disappointing season, with the criticism spread around:
 
Front Office
 Before last Thursday night, when Bernard King scored 49 points in leading the Washington Bullets past the Knicks, had you ever heard fans heckling a general manager in the middle of a game? Al Bianchi, the Knicks' general manager, is taking so much heat these days, it's surprising he doesn't have a permanent tan.
With the Knicks over the salary cap when his tenure began in the summer of 1987, Bianchi inherited a difficult job. And the team improved dramatically during Bianchi's first two seasons, largely because he acquired Mark Jackson, Charles Oakley, Rod Strickland, Johnny Newman and Sidney Green.
But Bianchi's most recent moves have not worked out as he had hoped.
The decision last summer not to re-sign Newman, who accepted an offer from the Charlotte Hornets, was based on economics. But the Knicks are still over the salary cap without Newman's salary, and they miss his scoring.
Strickland, unhappy with his playing time in New York last season, forced the Knicks to choose between him and Jackson as the point guard of the future. Before last season was over, Bianchi traded Strickland to San Antonio for Maurice Cheeks, who despite a potential Hall of Fame career, is 34 years old. Strickland is 24. And Cheeks's arrival only enhanced the point guard controversy. Now the Knicks are wondering what to do about the 25-year-old Jackson, who is unhappy playing behind Cheeks.
While Bianchi has been waiting for the Knicks to improve as a half-court team for two seasons, their personnel remains better suited to playing up-tempo basketball. Last fall, Bianchi became disenchanted enough with Stu Jackson to replace Jackson on Dec. 3, just 15 games into the coach's second season, with John MacLeod. But despite MacLeod's emphasis on fundamentals and teamwork, the Knicks are struggling worse under MacLeod than they did under Jackson.
Bianchi wants to make a trade, perhaps several trades, before the Feb. 21 deadline. But he is bargaining from a weak position. Many league executives feel the only two Knicks with strong trade value are Patrick Ewing and Oakley. Jackson's huge contract, Gerald Wilkins's erratic play, Cheeks's age, Kiki Vandeweghe's propensity for injury and Jerrod Mustaf's untapped potential make them hard to trade for someone of value.
Bianchi knew the Knicks needed help last summer, but he did not make a deal. Now it may be too late.
Hindsight is easier than foresight, and Bianchi staunchly defends almost all of his decisions. But consider this: Is the Knicks' present roster weaker than it was two years ago, when they ended the season with Oakley, Newman, Ewing, Jackson and Wilkins as starters, with Vandeweghe, Strickland, Trent Tucker, Kenny Walker, Sidney Green, Eddie Lee Wilkins and Pete Myers on the bench?
Perhaps the Knicks have been overestimating their talent for the last two years and are paying for it now. Unless they finish the season strongly and win at least one playoff series, New York fans may not have Bianchi to kick around anymore.
 
Coaching
 Those who thought Stu Jackson was the major reason for the Knicks' slow start this season have discovered otherwise. From his first day on the job, MacLeod has emphasized improving the Knicks' fundamentals: blocking out for rebounds, playing one-on-one defense, passing unselfishly, taking high-percentage shots. But whatever improvement New York has shown in these areas has come slowly and appeared inconsistently.
Some players are upset by MacLeod's failure to set defined roles. One night, a player may get 20 minutes; the next, he may not play at all. MacLeod also has tried numerous starting lineups, and says he will continue to make changes until the Knicks win consistently. But the constant shuffling of players may be doing more harm than good.
MacLeod is a proven winner, but it does not matter who is coaching the Knicks if they do not practice what the coach preaches. The Knicks may have too many problems to solve before April. And unfortunately for MacLeod, he may not get the opportunity next year to work with the Knicks from the opening of training camp.
 
Players
 Forwards -- Oakley is one of the game's best rebounders, but he also has games when he grabs just five or six rebounds and is virtually not a factor. And Oakley's lack of post-up moves leaves Ewing as New York's lone consistent low-post scorer.
Vandeweghe's chronic back condition rarely allows him to play at top effectiveness for more than a few weeks. He can score consistently, but he is no longer one of the league's most feared offensive players.
Walker's contribution off the bench has dropped dramtically this season because of a sore knee and reduced playing time. Brian Quinnett has an excellent jump shot, but lacks the all-round game to contribute consistently. MacLeod has turned away from Mustaf, preferring to use more experienced players.
Center -- Ewing has retained his rank as one of the game's top players. And win or lose, Ewing always gives maximum effort, one of the qualities that make him extraordinary. Despite his frustration with the Knicks' record, he never lets it affect his mental preparation for games.
One of the few criticisms of Ewing is his reluctance to take a more forceful role in the locker room. He is a quiet person by nature, but Ewing is the only Knick who carries enough clout to make a difference in the team's attitude. Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas and Larry Bird have been known to pull teammates aside when they are not performing, even yelling at teammates during games. Ewing seems to prefer leading by example, a trait that this team does not seem to respond to.
Eddie Lee Wilkins has never changed. He looks to score whenever he gets the ball, and sometimes he does. Yet he is still prone to foul trouble and he is not an intimidating defensive presence.
Guards -- Cheeks is totally unselfish, careful with the ball, a gifted defender, and has great basketball intellect. He is not a scorer, though, and he sometimes passes up open shots.
Jackson is in excellent shape, has played much better than last season, and has managed to control his anger concerning his backup status. His biggest problem is defense. Opposing guards go by Jackson consistently, putting pressure on New York's interior defense.
The more Jackson plays, the better he is. He made need a change in scenery to regain his form of two years ago.
Gerald Wilkins has improved his outside shot and has as much athletic ability as any of the Knicks. But he is still inconsistent, and he is prone to make blatant turnovers, especially in half-court situations. He would probably be more effective on a team that played more transition basketball.
John Starks plays with enthusiasm and has ignited the Knicks on several occasions. But his outside shot is not good enough to make him a consistent scoring threat.
Tucker has gone from hardly playing at all to becoming a starter last week. His outside shot has not been as consistent as it has been in the past, but he would probably have a higher shooting percentage if he were playing more regularly.
 
Outlook
 If the Knicks make a beneficial trade and become more comfortable with MacLeod's system, it is possible they could improve during the second half of this season. But right now, they show no signs of doing so. None of the Knicks are canceling their vacation plans for June.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
War and Recession Hit Thoroughbred Industry

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
When war broke out in the Middle East two and a half weeks ago, the eyes of the horse-racing world were turned on the annual January sale of thoroughbreds at Keeneland in Kentucky, a world-class auction that can make champions or break fortunes.
To be precise, the eyes of the racing world were turned on the big plungers, the princes and sheiks from Dubai and Saudi Arabia, who have spent $250 million at Keeneland in the last 10 years and now own 500 mares and 900 thoroughbreds in training on a dozen major farms in Kentucky, Ireland and England.
This time, they bought two horses. 
 "They arrived in Kentucky in 1981 and they've been the most significant group of foreign buyers by far," said James E. Bassett 3d, chairman of the Keeneland Association and director of the Breeders' Cup. "They buy at the top of the market. But their interest may wane."
To Calumet Farm, the home of champions, it looked as though everybody's interest might wane. The farm sent 96 horses into the auction ring at Keeneland that same week in an effort to reduce its stock, didn't hear the bids it had expected and went home with 34 of them.
"I've never seen many people sell horses," explained J. T. Lundy, the president of Calumet, "that didn't have a bottom price."
Thoroughbred racing is a luxury to some, a way of life to others, a livelihood to thousands and a $2 bet to millions. It attracts about 60 million people to tracks in 36 states on a total of 8,000 racing dates each year, and they bet more than $9 billion, while $3.5 billion more is bet at offtrack parlors or casinos.
But attendance and even betting seem to be waning, along with the sheiks' interest in buying horses at Keeneland. And racing people are wondering if these are omens:
*Gulfstream Park in Florida opened its current meeting to a record crowd on Jan. 14. But two days later, the war started in the Persian Gulf. Since then, tourism has plunged and attendance and betting at the race track have dropped 10 percent from a year ago.
*Santa Anita in California, which is usually spared the uncertainties of tourism and weather, is averaging 4.1 percent fewer customers in its current season, and they are betting 5.2 percent fewer dollars.
*Aqueduct in New York, which labors through the winter every year, is laboring more than ever this winter. It was hurt by one snowy day last month when only two races were held and only 2,329 persons showed up. But the numbers are stark, anyway: attendance is off by 14 percent, betting by 13 percent.
Is the recession eroding the life style centered on the horse? Is the war in the Middle East stemming the flow of money from Arabian investors, and transforming the financial structure of thoroughbred breeding? Or is horse racing reflecting a cutback in the public's spending on travel and leisure because of both the recession and the war?
On the international level, the answer for now seems to be no: The bloodstock market has been sinking for some years, initially because of changes in tax laws, lately because of the recession. But the heavy investors from the Middle East are probably wealthy enough to withstand fluctuations. And their horse holdings are based mainly in Kentucky and Britain.
On the national level, the answer seems to be yes: Fewer people betting fewer bucks at race tracks around the country. The recession diverts their dollars; the war diverts their interest.
"Everybody's weeping," said Joe Tannenbaum, a longtime racing official at Gulfsteam Park. "Dogs, travel, horses. The tourists aren't coming in big numbers, and the locals are staying home. Besides, we've got a great number of unemployed, especially since Eastern Air Lines folded and 8,000 jobs were lost here in South Florida alone.
"The big problem is the economy and the preoccupation with the war. Even our own staff keeps tuning in to TV."
"The only place we've gained," said Jane Goldstein, director of communications at Santa Anita, "is in overall betting at the track, by satellite and by commingling. And the reason we gained there is because we didn't have commingling last year."
Commingling is a system of taking bets at selected outside locations and feeding them into the betting pool at the track where the races are being run. It differs from the usual offtrack betting, which is independent of the track's wagering system.
Like most tracks, Santa Anita is introducing television and satellite technology to reach new markets of bettors, even far from the track. It now accepts commingling bets from the Nevada bookmakers, the Canterbury Downs track in Minnesota, the Birmingham Race Course in Alabama and Mountaineer Park in West Virginia.
But racing people everywhere concede the problem is double-edged: How to get people to come to the track to spend their money, and how to get people who can't come to the track to spend it, anyway.
"We've got to find reasons to get people to come out and watch a horse," said Jerry Lawrence, the new executive vice president of the New York Racing Association. "The competition is increasing from offtrack betting, casinos, a lot of things."
But Philip Dunn, executive director of television systems and simulcasting for New York racing, said: "The future is not on the track. You have to bring the product to the people."
Rich Rolapp of the American Horse Council in Washington gave a global overview that linked all the tremors in racing.
"With the Persian Gulf crisis," he said, "people just aren't going out as much. Travel's down. Theme parks are down. Casinos in Las Vegas are down. I don't think it's so much a reflection of the economy as the war. People are focusing on it.
"The bloodstock market has been in a downtrend for years. Tax changes in 1981 set the stage, and again in 1986. People were putting their money into stocks and bonds and other tangibles. Then the recession comes along, and the people who might buy horses may not have the money.
"The Arabs always bought horses at peak prices. The money comes from the small but wealthy Arab states. My impression is they stopped investing after the invasion of Kuwait because of the uncertainty of the Middle East situation."
But Ted Bassett, who heads both the Keeneland track and the Breeders' Cup series of championship races, suspects that the Arabs didn't spend as freely at the horse sales last month for a simpler reason: They already have all the race horses they can use for now.
"They're not affected by the recession in the United States," he said. "I don't think they're even affected by the war. They all have major farms in Kentucky and half a dozen in Ireland and England.
"They arrived in 1981, and they've spent in excess of $250 million at Keeneland since then. There are two groups: Sheik Mohammad Bin Rashid al Maktoum and his two brothers from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and Prince Khaled Abdullah from Saudi Arabia. Their interest may have waned at our sales, but only because they had reached a maximum level."
But, looking past today's financial hurdles in racing, Ted Bassett saw a glimmer.
"Horses generally appreciate faster than the rate of inflation," he said. "So, they're a good investment in down times."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL NOTEBOOK;
Hall of Famer Palmer Says He Pitched Wrong

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Jim Palmer's attempted comeback, as improbable as it might seem, has to be particularly galling to Pete Rose. Not only can't Rose make a comeback, but he also will learn tomorrow that he's not eligible for the Hall of Fame. Palmer is already in the Hall of Fame.
The hall's board of directors meets tomorrow to act on the recommendation by a special committee that anyone who is on baseball's permanently ineligible list be ineligible for the Hall of Fame. Rose is the only one around who in recent years has come to fit that description, so it's not difficult to link the board's action to Rose. 
 Palmer, on the other hand, is on the voluntarily retired list. He has been on that list so long, in fact, that he was eligible for the hall a year ago and gained instant entrance. Now, at the age of 45, six years after he last pitched, he is working to get himself off the voluntarily retired list.
"The career that got me to the Hall of Fame is over," Palmer said. "This is something different."
It certainly is different. No member of the hall ever has come back and played in the major leagues. Palmer doesn't know if he can, but he's just about ready to let people tell him if he can. Scouts from several clubs, including Baltimore, Montreal, Milwaukee and the Chicago White Sox, are expected to scrutinize the right-handed pitcher next weekend in Florida, where he has been throwing since mid-December.
Lazaro Collazo, for one, believes the scouts will like what they see. "I think he can get major league hitters out," Collazo said. "As a matter of fact, I know he can."
Collazo is an assistant coach for the University of Miami baseball team, for which he pitched several years ago. He has, in effect, been Palmer's guru in his comeback, even though he was born only the year before Palmer began pitching in the majors.
Known as Lazer, the 26-year-old Cuban has made an apparently significant change in Palmer's pitching motion.
"I told him how bad his mechanics look," Collazo said. "Instead of getting mad, he listened and worked on it. He had bad mechanics when he pitched. He could have got a lot more out of his body and arm if he had done it right."
Palmer recalled how Collazo approached that subject.
 "For a guy who's getting in the Hall of Fame, your mechanics are awful," Collazo said to Palmer.
"I'm in the Hall of Fame," Palmer countered.
"Lazer is great," Palmer said. "It took a lot of nerve to tell me my mechanics were awful."
The change in mechanics has to do with the positioning of Palmer's glove when he pitches the ball. Instead of snapping the glove back toward his chest, Palmer always let it wander off toward the first-base line, pocket side away from him. That move placed great stess on his left side, he recalled.
"My left side used to hurt as much as my right side," he said. "I kept winning 20 games, so no one wanted to change me. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Now, the way I'm doing it, it's very relaxing. If Lazer hadn't given me this tip to change my mechanics, I could never be doing this."
The question, though, isn't why has Palmer changed his mechanics, but rather why does he want to pitch again.
"What prompted me to do it was the state of the television industry," said Palmer, who did baseball games for ESPN last season. "It was kind of frustrating to be nominated for an A.C.E. award and get a congratulatory letter from ESPN, then two days later have them say we want you to work for us for three years at a drastic pay cut. All because they overpaid for the rights and losing over $50 million. I told them I'd take a pay cut for a year, but they said three years.
"The correlation of doing a good job and being rewarded for it doesn't exist so you look for something else to do. Part of feeling good about yourself is to have alternatives. I come to Florida every winter so I figured I'd start throwing and see where it went. One alternative is to do more games for the Orioles, which is what I'll do if I don't pitch. I'll let them know by mid-February."
Collazo said Palmer had been throwing his fastball in the 84- to 86-miles-an-hour range and has had a "great" breaking ball and a "great" changeup. Palmer, who regularly threw 95 m.p.h. in his prime, said he was throwing six or seven miles an hour harder than in 1984, his last season.
"I've been pleasantly surprised," said Palmer, who pitched 268 victories in a 19-year career with Baltimore. "I'm sure some people won't look on it with much credence, but I know I can pitch again. I've had a blister problem, and if the blister gets well, I think they'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm going to let other people determine if I can pitch. If not this year, I'll hold the microphone with my left hand and throw with my right. I'll throw all year and do it next year. There's plenty left in my arm."
 
The Orioles' Influence
 The Mets' elevation of Al Harazin to the position of executive vice president, where he is a step away from succeeding Frank Cashen as general manager, is the latest boost for the fertile front-office field of the Baltimore Orioles.
Harazin spent seven years in the Orioles' front office, which Cashen ran for 10 years. The major leagues are filled with general managers who learned the business, or a major part of it, as employees of the Orioles. Their executive history is akin to the trail of former Dodgers who became managers and former players of Paul Brown who became football coaches.
Like Cashen and Harazin, Harry Dalton of Milwaukee, Lou Gorman of Boston and John Schuerholz of Atlanta began their major league careers in Baltimore's front office. Hank Peters of Cleveland began his career with the Orioles' predecessors, the St. Louis Browns, then later served as the Orioles' No. 1 executive for 13 years.
Joe McIlvaine of San Diego was an Orioles scout for three years in his first major league job, and Herk Robinson of Kansas City spent a season as a Baltimore scout before joining Gorman and Schuerholz with the fledgling Royals franchise.
Jim Frey of the Chicago Cubs served as a scout and a coach for the Orioles for 16 years. Pat Gillick of Toronto didn't work in the Orioles' front office, but he played in their minor league system for five years. Bill Lajoie, Detroit's recently departed general manager, played in the Orioles' organization for 10 years.
Counting Roland Hemond, current holder of the Baltimore job, 10 of the majors' 26 general managers have some link to the Orioles.
 
Another Height for Clemens to Scale
 His confrontations with umpires and police officers have not reduced the value Roger Clemens has to the Boston Red Sox. The two sides, in fact, are said to be close to announcing a contract extension that will be the most lucrative contract in baseball's rapidly changing economic history.
The Red Sox had wanted to hold the extension to four years, but Clemens wanted five and will apparently get his wish. He will also receive what officials of other clubs have heard will be a total in the $25 million to $27 million range. Jose Canseco of Oakland has the heftiest contract now: five years for $23.5 million.
Clemens's contract will have the impact of a resounding thud on the Mets' negotiations with Dwight Gooden and Frank Viola for extensions. The Mets would like to hold those deals to three years for something less than -- certainly no more than -- $12 million. The pitchers, who have different ideas, will have those thoughts enhanced once the Clemens negotiations are completed.

Blacks in the Military

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Protesters, Heard" (editorial, Jan. 27), you suggest that the disproportionate representation of blacks in the United States military is testimony to the opening of the military to advancement by minorities, and not itself a symptom of social pathology. Contrary to your observation, the rise of Gen. Colin L. Powell to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the positive racial role model that may provide, does not explain why blacks are 12 percent of the United States population but 29 percent of the armed services.
Blacks are two and a half times more likely to join the military than other Americans because their civilian options are so severely limited. Young blacks face an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent. When the effective choices are poverty, criminal activity or the military, the military's offer of upward mobility may be exceptionally attractive.
For blacks in the United States, as for the impoverished in the third world, the military has historically served as a vehicle for upward mobility. But before we congratulate ourselves for providing this opportunity, we should acknowledge its social genesis in racism, poverty and lack of alternative options.

But Does Hussein Care?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gary C. Hufbauer and Kimberly A. Elliott ("Sanctions Will Bite -- and Soon," Op-Ed, Jan. 14) drew conclusions about the effect of sanctions on Iraq that go well beyond what their evidence shows. They have looked at 115 cases in which sanctions were used, but as they acknowledge, they are not acquainted with Iraq's economy. I am, as the former desk officer for Iraq at the International Monetary Fund, and I have done a detailed study of the effect of sanctions on Iraq, published by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Those of us inside and outside the Government who know Iraq's economy agree almost entirely about the impact of sanctions on it. Iraq is becoming a poorer and militarily weaker country day by day, and the food situation will be critical in May just before the wheat and barley harvest, which will give Iraq enough cereals to last until fall or winter. This, however, does not tell us whether Saddam Hussein cares enough about the growing poverty of his people to leave Kuwait.
I would hate to see us base our policy toward any country on an average of what has happened in the last 115 similar cases. Historical analogies are interesting but not decisive. Furthermore, Mr. Hufbauer and Ms. Elliott have an intriguing idea of how to read the record of the past. Among their 34 percent of successful cases of sanctions are World War I, World War II and the Falkland war. I wonder how many professional historians would agree with their judgment that sanctions made an important contribution to the outcome of those conflicts.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Showroom Buildings;
Specialty Dealers Remain Together To Draw the Buyers

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
A VACANCY RATE of 9 percent would look good almost anywhere, certainly in an 84-year-old building. But that is not all that distinguishes 225 Fifth Avenue.
"There are probably more wicker baskets in this building than bricks to hold it up," said Sean T. Higgins of Cushman & Wakefield, executive director of the property, which is best known as the Gift Building. Offering little outside evidence of its special character, the 12-story structure between 26th and 27th Streets is home to more than 175 tenants, representing something like 2,400 lines of wholesale merchandise. 
 Along potpourri-scented corridors that the public cannot travel are show windows filled with stuffed bears, ceramic rabbits, copper pigs, illuminated dachshunds, pewter nudes, enameled eggs, silk fruit, embroidered picture frames and crystal grandfather clocks.
No. 225 is among a cluster of specialty buildings, including the Toy Center South, 200 Fifth Avenue, between 23d and 24th Streets; the Toy Center North, 1107 Broadway, at 24th Street, and the Textile Building, 295 Fifth Avenue, between 30th and 31st Streets.
These buildings benefit from their tenants' having to stay close together to attract the greatest number of buyers, but they can also suffer more than those with heterogeneous rosters, because any industry-wide malaise affects every tenant in the building.
"The recession hits here first and it hits somewhat precipitously," Mr. Higgins said. "But this industry levels off more quickly. People may cut back here first, but Christmas doesn't go away. Birthdays still occur in a down market. So does Easter, bar mitzvahs, Mother's Day, Father's Day. People don't put off purchases of gifts for three years, as they might a refrigerator."
Thomas S. Arbuckle, the general manager of the Toy Center and a vice president of Helmsley-Spear, said that while his two buildings were completely occupied (except for ground-floor retail space on 23d Street), the days were long past when the industry was thought of as recession-proof.
"As a result of bankruptcies and other difficulties," he said, "there are fewer retailers to sell to than ever before. And many retailers are in a financial condition that it's questionable whether one can sell to them. That's very damaging to the toy industry. It's pretty frightening when you talk about whether people are afraid to sell to Macy's."
The Toy Center, whose tenants include Binney & Smith, Color Forms, Flexible Flyer, Kenner, Lego, Lionel, Matchbox, Ohio Art, Parker Brothers, Tonka and Tyco, is bracing for the annual Toy Fair, which begins Feb. 11, when 20,000 buyers descend on the buildings.
At the Textile Building, where the bed, bath and linen industry shows its lines, the vacancy rate is 7 percent. "The industry is not doing too well because it's dependent on the health of the big stores," said Claude J. Litton, president of the Manhattan Properties Company, which owns and manages the building. "We've had a certain weeding out. We've had people going bankrupt lately. However, over the long run -- and that's what we're geared for -- we do fine."
The Textile Building is in the hands of the family that built it in 1920. The Toy Center South has been under continuous ownership for 40 years by a syndicate formed by Harry B. Helmsley and the late Lawrence A. Wien, which now includes Mr. Wien's son-in-law, Peter L. Malkin. They have also owned the Toy Center North since 1967.
For many years, the Gift Building was owned by Milton Kimmelman, a hotelier and landlord, who died in 1984. It was bought from his estate in 1989, for $92.5 million, by the Japan Green Stamp Company of Tokyo and Saxon Capital Corporation of Manhattan.
"IN Japan, the trading-stamp business is still very successful," said Masahiko Kasuga, president of Japan Green Stamp America. "Because of the type of business, we can produce lots of cash flow." Looking for a place to invest some of that money, Japan Green Stamp began investigating Manhattan real estate in early 1988.
"We saw some high-profile hotels but that was not really what we wanted to do," Mr. Kasuga said. Noting that Japan Green Stamp owns the LS Collection boutiques, he said, "We're very interested in the gift business, so this building was the perfect match."
At the time, the building was 87 percent occupied. Since then, the new owners have put almost $3 million into remodeling the lobby, building a special-events room and cleaning the facade. Meanwhile, several tenants -- the Towle Manufacturing Company most prominent among them -- were filing for protection under the bankruptcy code. Now the building is 91 percent occupied.
"We've been going through even more tragedy in the industry than we expected," said Dennis A. Frank, president and chairman of the board of Saxon Capital. But he also noted that several leases now being negotiated would, if signed, bring the occupancy up to 94 or 95 percent.
To change the tone of the building, the new owners renamed it the International Showcase and set to work on the lobby. Mr. Kimmelman's son-in-law, Mitch Leigh -- the producer, director and composer ("Man of La Mancha") -- had earlier tried to put some Broadway sizzle into the space, with moving lights, pink and black walls and a front desk in the form of a grand piano. The results, however, were not to everyone's liking.
The new lobby, designed by Vicente Wolf Associates of Manhattan, has mahogany-paneled walls, a white barrel-vaulted ceiling and massively rusticated columns that echo those on the exterior.
As a result of the renovation, "the attitude in the building changed overnight," said Al Reiner, president of Knobler International and Pilgrim Glass and head of the tenants association. "When a buyer comes in, we want to set a tone that they're in a building that has exquisite taste," he said.
TENANTS were pleased when the new owners rolled back the rent 5 percent for the six months, from February to July 1990 (a gift from the landlord, dictated by Japanese custom, to celebrate the first anniversary of the acquisition); picked up the tab for challenging the city's real-estate assessments and then agreed to hold back 50 percent of the rent escalation pegged to the Consumer Price Index this year. "That's approximately $1,000 a month I'll save," Mr. Reiner said. "I promised that I'd take that money and put it into advertising, to attract buyers to 225."
Mr. Higgins, who says that 225 Fifth Avenue has to be run "more like a hotel than an office building," has found other ways to accommodate tenants. "As you know," he said, "it's against the law to get married without receiving five or six ice buckets." Competition is therefore intense to offer the latest, most eye-catching designs. So in the weeks before the semiannual Tabletop and Accessories Show, Mr. Higgins is besieged with requests for rolls of white paper, which tenants use to cover showroom windows and frustrate the spies among their neighbors.
There is one respect in which conditions have improved considerably, according to owners and managers, and that is the closing of the Prince George Hotel on East 27th Street, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. By the mid-1980's, the Prince George and two other hotels on the same block, the Latham and Madison, housed the greatest concentration of homeless people in New York City.
"Those three hotels stopped cold the growth that was taking place and actually reversed it for a short period," Mr. Arbuckle said. "We're just now beginning to recover from the damage that was done."
"We would like to see somebody buy the Prince George Hotel to renovate it into a businessman's hotel," Mr. Frank said. "That will help the situation tremendously."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 3 about showroom buildings misidentified the owner of the Toy Center and misstated the role of Harry B. Helmsley in the ownership. The owner is Fifth Avenue Building Associates. Mr. Helmsley is a minority partner of the buildings' operator, 200 Fifth Avenue Associates, not a partner in Fifth Avenue Building Associates.

SQUANDERED FORTUNE
The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford.
By Lisa Rebecca Gubernick.
Illustrated. 272 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $24.95. 
 A woodworker once told me that he learned more about furniture from taking it apart than from putting it together. Lisa Rebecca Gubernick's tale of a shiftless heir, "Squandered Fortune: The Life and Times of Huntington Hartford," should be read in a similar pathological spirit. In 1940 the Hartford family ranked among the nation's four wealthiest, trailing only the du Ponts, the Rockefellers and the Mellons. The family money came from the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, now the A.& P., which was owned by Huntington Hartford's grandfather. As late as 1955 Mr. Hartford, then 44 years old and poorer than when he was born, was still worth $100 million (the equivalent of about $400 million today). Thirty-five years later he had very little to show for it but photographs.
Most of them showed his mother, Henrietta. Mr. Hartford's father, Edward, died young, leaving his son in the care of a mother with ferocious social ambitions. Little Hunt wasn't raised so much as groomed. Each day he and his mother played croquet; each evening "they would walk around the porch, mallets in the small of their backs, following her regimen for proper posture." Hunt's teachers at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., referred to him in the classroom as the "million-dollar milk-fed baby." When he entered Harvard his mother moved to Boston to study with her son. The heir was left so exquisitely dependent that later, wishing to rid himself of his first wife, he actually suggested that his mother adopt her and make her his sister.
I'm stealing all of this from Ms. Gubernick -- who is worth stealing from. A senior editor at Forbes magazine, she writes well and handles her subject with the touch of a natural storyteller, interweaving Mr. Hartford's dissipation with the decline of the A.& P. (once a symbol of American capitalism, now owned by a German company -- a symbol of a different sort). As she tells it, some of the most pathetic moments concern Mr. Hartford's lifelong search for a job, a cause or a purpose. After leaving Harvard he joined the A.& P. as a clerk in charge of monitoring sales of bread and poundcake. He arrived late, left early and occasionally abandoned his desk to sleep on the floor. "There he was," said his uncle and employer, "surrounded by people who really had to work for a living, and he was receiving callers who wanted to sell him paintings." He was warned that if he took another day off he'd be fired. He pressed his luck. "Yale stopped Harvard 14-0 on November 24, 1934," writes Ms. Gubernick, "and Hunt and Mary Lee [his first wife] were there to see it. Thus ended his career at the A&P." "I had an income of over a million dollars a year," Mr. Hartford later said. "Can you imagine me sitting out with a bunch of clerks?"
Well, no. The idea of Huntington Hartford counting loaves of bread does seem ridiculous, especially if you believe -- as we like to pretend we do -- that the purpose of work is to get money. Mr. Hartford was denied this excuse to work by birth. He found himself nearly as disconnected as a pauper from the daily give-and-take of the money economy, and he flopped about his entire life in search of some plausible economic identity. He was hired by the short-lived New York newspaper PM as a reporter -- in exchange for his investment of $100,000. He tried to live on his salary of $120 a month. "I want to inject the element of struggle in my life," he said. The struggle lasted a few days. The job lasted six months. He opened a modeling agency, then was forced to sell it when the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs caught him propositioning the models. He opened and closed an institute for handwriting analysis. And so on. "Hunt spent his money the way he did," said wife number two, "to try to show that he could do serious things."
It wasn't until Mr. Hartford tried seriously to invest his fortune that it began to vanish. He then became a magnet for all those forces -- gold-digging spouses, bad advisers, shifty partners -- that exist to separate capital from its owners. His first three wives demanded seven-figure divorce settlements. His fourth wife sold his antique furniture. In one business deal alone -- the purchase and resale of an island called Paradise in the Bahamas -- Mr. Hartford in less than seven years turned $30 million into $1.5 million. The ease with which he was exploited suggests a strength of modern American capitalism: there is less than there is in, say, England, to shelter entrenched wealth from grasping upstarts. (If Karl Marx had been born in modern America he'd be dealing in real estate rather than protesting the tyranny of the capital-owning class; it's quicker.)
The few millions the cat-skinners missed were poured into the arts. Mr. Hartford, "a man who weighed his worth by the number of projects that bore his name" in Ms. Gubernick's words, founded a retreat for artists in California and named it the Huntington Hartford Foundation. He opened a theater in Los Angeles and an art museum in New York, both of them named for himself. For a brief moment he seemed something other than a case for confiscatory inheritance taxes.
"I have always wanted to be a crusader for that religion known as culture," he said. To that end he wrote a reactionary pamphlet on contemporary art entitled "Has God Been Insulted Here?" His zeal in denouncing such trends as abstract expressionism led a young journalist named Tom Wolfe to describe him as the new Martin Luther. But Mr. Hartford's Luther was comic. He was a Luther who journeyed to Wittenberg Cathedral with his theses and hammer only to realize he had forgotten his nails. Mr. Hartford could never make his points stick. He was, as Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have remarked to a friend about Mr. Hartford, "the sort of man who will come up with an idea, pinch it in the fanny and run."
Until he could run no longer. Ms. Gubernick ends her story with a visit she made in 1989 to Mr. Hartford's Manhattan town house. There she found a squalid courtyard reeking of garbage, a warning on the front door from the Health Department and a broken man. "I pounded on the door for five minutes," she writes, "before Hartford, clad in a stained oxford-cloth shirt and boxer shorts, finally appeared. He said nothing as he opened the door. . . . I followed [him] up to his bedroom, watched as he lay down on the bed. 'I'm so tired, I'm just so tired.' He sighed and curled into fetal position . . . then drifted off into unconsciousness."
 
THE WONDER AND THE PITY
 Lisa Rebecca Gubernick admits to having a "weakness for broken butterflies." And when Ms. Gubernick, who writes about the entertainment business for Forbes magazine, was sent to interview Huntington Hartford, she found herself fascinated by the "wonder and the pity" of his life. "I couldn't believe what I was seeing," said Ms. Gubernick of her first encounter with a broken Mr. Hartford. "What I saw was downbeat and depressing, but it was also a great story about how so much can go so wrong."
For Ms. Gubernick, exploring Mr. Hartford's life was a way to explore Newport in the 1930's, Hollywood in the 1940's and the development of Paradise Island in the Bahamas in the 1960's. The James Bond-style Bahamian hideaway was typical of his ventures, costing him millions before he lost control. And her odyssey also afforded Ms. Gubernick a chance "to look at what money does to people."
"I don't see him as entirely unsympathetic," Ms. Gubernick said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where she was on assignment for Forbes. "I think he is a victim. He was never schooled in survival. Giving him so much money was like sticking a machine gun into the hands of a 3-year-old."
Ms. Gubernick, however, is far less charitable to Mr. Hartford as a father. She recalls attending Malcolm Forbes's funeral while writing "Squandered Fortune" and being touched by the eulogies from his children. Such affection is not the case with Mr. Hartford, who had four children from two of his four wives and from a mistress who later committed suicide.
His illegitimate son, who yearned for the Hartford name, also committed suicide. One daughter became a drug addict before dying young. Another son has kept his distance. Only his youngest daughter has regularly visited him.
"Each of the children," Ms. Gubernick said, fought for Mr. Hartford's attention "over and over again. There were so many material resources available and they were incredibly impoverished emotionally. He didn't have a father. He never knew how to be one." -- LESLIE WAYNE

HEADLINE: Boxing;
Leonard Still Ticking as Clock Winds Down

BYLINE: By PHIL BERGER

 BODY:
It has come to this: He is 34 years old and the opponent this time around wears an earring. Need we further reminders that the clock is ticking down on the career of Ray Charles Leonard?
Conjure up the Sugar Ray Leonard whose 100-kilowatt smile and whirring fists won him a gold medal and worldwide acclaim at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. That was nearly 15 years ago. 
 Fifteen years. Think about it. Ray Jr., who was 5 1/2 years old when he appeared with his famous father a few years later in those appealing soft drink commercials, is now 17, a senior at Churchill High School in Potomac, Md. College recruiters are scouting him as a running back and high hurdler.
Time flies, and in its flight it keeps agitating Leonard to rub up against danger, in seeming defiance of the deadening effects middle age routinely has on prize fighters. The other American gold medalists from those '76 Olympic games -- Michael and Leon Spinks, Howard Davis, Leo Randolph -- have all retired, but Leonard, who turned pro in February 1977, is still at it.
On Saturday at Madison Square Garden, he goes back into the ring once more, this time to fight Terry Norris for Norris's World Boxing Council superwelterweight title. The bout will be televised live on Showtime.
The 23-year-old Norris, who fights without the earring , is quick and strong and has a reputation of being a big puncher, particularly in the early rounds. He won his superwelterweight title (154-pound limit) by knocking out John (the Beast) Mugabi in one round last March, and in his only title defense, a decision over Rene Jacquot last July, he had Jacquot on the canvas three times, in the 1st, 2d and 12th rounds.
Leonard, whose opponents have lately been mostly over 30 -- the so-called seniors tour -- welcomes the test against a youngblood like Norris, believing it will clarify just how well his skills have or haven't held up. "My palms sweat," he said, underlining his eagerness for this combat.
"Everything holds more significance for me because I'm touching the end of my career," he said. "So I value each and every time I step out there. And I can tell you this: I still want to train and be in shape and look good. I don't want to just show up."
If Leonard seems reluctant these days to acknowledge being any less the fighter he was in earlier years -- "I'm just as quick," he said -- the longer that self-analysis proceeds, the more it echoes a boxer keenly aware of inexorable change.
"I'm more economical now, and far more analytical," he said, in assessing the fighter he has become. "I try to break my opponents down mentally even more than physically."
As ever, though, a fight is a test of wills, the outcome often depending on that innate spark that a boxer either has or hasn't. When Leonard says, "I'm still as gutsy as I ever was; I still go for it when the fight is tight," he sounds like a man not about to yield center stage, middle age or not, without a furious struggle.
"Norris is a young, fresh champion with physical attributes like mine: the speed and mobility," Leonard said. "He's got the ability to push me to the limit. But as far as I'm concerned, I can contend with any guys in this era."
As for Norris (26-3, 15 knockouts), he said that when he was a youngster Leonard was his hero, but he professes to be undaunted by the prospect of having to thrash him now. "It's my time; it's my turn," Norris said.
Leonard (36-1-1, 25 knockouts), who has won world titles in weight classes ranging from welterweight (147-pound limit) to light heavyweight (175-pound limit), has not fought in more than a year. The last time was on Dec. 7, 1989, when he outboxed Roberto Duran to win a lopsided 12-round decision.
The Duran bout was not the sort of thriller on which fans of Leonard were raised and by which Leonard became crowd pleaser enough to earn more than $105 million in purses, which is the career total credited to him by his attorney, Mike Trainer.
Against Duran, Leonard fought more conservatively than he usually does, content to jab Duran silly and then retreat. But he was not unaware of the crowd's restlessness with his tactics, and late in the fight he tried to mix with Duran. The assault backfired. While trading punches, he suffered cuts over his right brow and on his left eyelid.
Leonard would later say the cuts came from Duran's head rather than his fists. But the wounds were the latest of the small calamities Leonard has known in recent bouts.
In November 1988, when he fought Donny Lalonde for the W.B.C. supermiddleweight and light-heavyweight titles, Lalonde knocked him down in the fourth round and rocked him in the ninth, the same round in which Leonard came on to stop him.
In June 1989, Thomas Hearns scored two knockdowns in a disputed draw, a decision that Leonard now says should have gone to Hearns. In the early rounds that night Leonard seemed acutely wary as Hearns winged serious punches, a tentativeness out of character for him.
Taken in the cumulative impression, these sticky moments could be viewed as a portent of things to come Saturday. To Leonard, though, they are merely the vagaries of a hard trade and by no means a signal of his imminent demise. He is the man, after all, who shrugged off a detached retina and came out of retirement twice to make comebacks that included a stunning upset of the seemingly invincible middleweight, Marvelous Marvin Hagler.
So while the rough patches in recent bouts may signal the first stage of decrepitude to some, attention must be paid to Leonard, who disagrees.
On Lalonde: "He may look somewhat awkward and all but hey, Lalonde can punch. His right hand is lethal."
On Hearns: "Tommy was ready. My problem was I listened to what you guys were writing -- that he was a shot fighter -- and I think inadvertently I fell into that mode. Everybody was saying it, my camp, my brothers: 'One good shot and it's over.' But let me tell you, whoever fights me gets themselves to another level. Think of the rewards of beating me."
On Duran: "Other than the cuts, I felt, 'Hey, I got it all back.' Deja vu. The movement, the speed."
If skeptics might see these responses as the usual palliatives fighters concoct to sustain their illusion of potency -- a necessary illusion, to be sure -- Trainer insists that they would be wrong to think that of Leonard. For what Leonard has done, he says, is to show an artiste's compulsion for challenge, in recent years fighting opponents whose weight advantage was often far greater than it seemed.
"While the other guy would go in the ring 5, 6, 7 pounds heavier than he was at the weigh-in, Ray would actually lose weight the day of the fight," Trainer said. "It's adrenaline, and more: it's his nature.
"Look, the cuts from the Duran fight can happen to anyone. There isn't a guy in boxing that gets examined more regularly than Ray. He's been to the top dermatologists. They tell him, 'Your skin is fine.' As for the knockdowns, if you go back and look at Ray Leonard's history, you'll find Ray always got hit. He got hit because he was aggressive. The difference is back then he was hit by guys his size."
After Leonard beat Duran, he was eager to fight again, as soon as possible. But his divorce from his wife, Juanita, grew thorny, in spite of a prenuptial agreement that Trainer said the fighter and she signed before their marriage in January 1980. Leonard was soon deep in marital complications and not thinking of boxing.
"I was trying to resolve that marriage situation," Leonard said. "It became a priority, to settle it without it becoming a circus."
The case was settled in November and the divorce became final in December, with Leonard and his wife agreeing to joint custody of their two sons. Leonard retained the five-bedroom home on two and a half acres in Potomac, Md., where he now lives with Ray Jr. His wife resides with the younger son, Jarrel, 6, in the house Leonard bought her in Bowie, Md., when they separated about two years ago.
In the period since he fought Duran, Leonard has been shuttling between Los Angeles, where his girlfriend lives, and Potomac, where he has been spending time with his sons, on occasion feeling chagrined by paternal duty.
"One time I took Jarrel to the Air and Space Museum at the Smithsonian," said Leonard. "I got down there. Jarrel says to me, 'Daddy, the jets are upstairs.' And he proceeded to give me the tour.
"Little Ray has a class in film production in high school, and had a project to direct and produce a commercial. He got home one night; I asked him what he was doing. He said he had to edit the commercial. I asked him, 'Where's the story board?' He looked at me, like he couldn't be bothered, and said, 'Daaaddy, I'm busy.' "
A smile, a shrug: the boxing legend as befuddled father.
Over the past year, Leonard said, he did no boxing workouts, but kept a semblance of condition by running several times a week and playing tennis. In December, though, when he began training for Norris, he found that he was a long way from being in fighting trim. A week or so into his training camp, he was knocked down by a sparring partner, Michael Ward. Leonard termed the knockdown "my wake-up call."
The prevailing sentiment is that despite being the betting favorite, Leonard stands at some risk against Norris, jeopardy that is accentuated by the minor hitches that have developed in recent fights. Of course, the element of danger is heightened by Leonard's advanced boxing years -- he will be 35 in May -- an age that prompts alarmists to view his refusal to retire as folly. The frequently heard refrain is: What does he need it for? What's he trying to prove?
Trainer said for sure Leonard was not boxing for just the money.
"Ray can't spend the interest he's earning," Trainer said. "It's seven figures a year, interest on a very conservative portfolio. Tax-free municipal bonds, treasury obligations, C.D.s under $100,000, Ginny Maes, I.M.R.A.'s. There are no stocks, no cattle, no investments in oil and gas drilling or historic hotels. He doesn't own a plane, a yacht or limo, and isn't in any joint ventures or partnerships. The only exception: He did make a commitment to a local group vying for a major league baseball franchise to be a minority investor."
Then if not the money, what keeps Sugar Ray on boxing's center stage?
"Simple," Leonard said. "I enjoy it, and I do it fairly well. Why 34 is such an old and ancient age beats me. I guess it gets to me when people say, 'Why are you still fighting?' Why shouldn't I? If I beat the guys that claim to be monsters, why can't I?"

L.P.G.A. Seeks Stability With Mechem

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
The Ladies Professional Golf Association's 41st season opened in Jamaica the same week war broke out in the Persian Gulf, and the sense of incongruency was emphasized by the lack of televisions at the cloistered Tryall Club.
So while Charles S. Mechem Jr. tried to explain his views on becoming the tour's new commissioner in a sitting room equipped with a rare and unactivated television, several people craving an update on the war anxiously popped their heads in.
"Any more bombing?" one man asked. 
 "Not that I know of," said Mechem in the pleasant intonation that is his natural voice. Turning back to his interviewer, Mechem gestured toward the television and said, "I guess we're lost without it."
The commissioner could have been talking about the L.P.G.A., whose irregular presence on the tube in recent years has caused it to stagnate in the national sports consciousness. If the 60-year-old Mechem has a mandate, it is to get women's golf on television as much as possible.
Mechem appears well-suited to the task of stablizing an organization that has undergone an intense self-examination in the last three years. With a background that has included prolonged stints as a lawyer, television executive and women's tournament sponsor, Mechem is on paper the most well-rounded, highly qualified commissioner the L.P.G.A. has ever had.
"I think the L.P.G.A. made the perfect choice," said Frank Chirkanian, the executive producer of golf for CBS. "It's important they have somebody who is an expert in what makes professional golf work, and Charlie is a man who will make good things happen."
Judy Dickinson, the L.P.G.A. president who was instrumental in persuading Mechem to take the job, takes a more comprehensive view.
"Charlie gives us a lot of respectability in every area," said Dickinson. "I think that with this commissioner, the sky's the limit."'
Perhaps, but Mechem inherits an L.P.G.A. vessel that recently underwent a bumpy emergency landing. The association is recovering from the divisive, sometimes chaotic regime of Bill Blue, who was forced to resign last September after 19 months on the job.
Blue, who was hired for his expertise in marketing, mixed a slick public presentation with a brusque interpersonal manner that ended up alienating him from sponsors and players and left him open to charges of questionable integrity.
Mechem, while taking pains to avoid casting even indirect aspersions on his predecessor, has made it clear by his actions that his style will be substantially different.
Unlike Blue, who never moved his primary residence from his luxury condominium in Beverly Hills, Mechem has taken up an apartment near the L.P.G.A. headquarters in Daytona Beach, Fla., a location only 200 miles from the permanent residence he and his wife keep in Jupiter.
To heal wounds and establish the kind of relationships he feels will be essential to longterm success, Mechem has begun his tenure crisscrossing the country to meet with as many sponsors, players, media, and of course, television executives, as possible.
"I trust Mr. Mechem, and that's very important," Vic Higgs, the tournament director at Jamaica who was one of the first sponsors to speak out against Blue. "The commissioner should be equal parts manager, diplomat and salesman, and I believe he will be very good at all those things."
While the tenor regarding Mechem's early reign is optimism, the L.P.G.A.'s players, despite Dickinson's "sky's the limit" metaphor, are cautious. It was not that long ago that they were singing the praises of the newly appointed and unproven Blue.
"We know we have a good man who is going to do the best possible job for us," said the veteran player Colleen Walker. "The money will go up, and we will probably get on television more, but we don't really expect anything specific. We just want an organization we can be proud to belong to."
Such a view is consistent with Mechem's own track record of achievement the old-fashioned way. Born and reared in the small town of Nelsonville, Ohio, he earned a law degree from Yale and was a captain in the Army before joining a law practice in Cincinnati.
In 1967, Mechem became chairman and chief executive of Taft Broadcasting (now Great American Broadcasting), which owns five television stations, 17 radio stations, Hanna-Barbera Productions, and helps develop amusement parks. For 12 years, the company was also a co-sponsor of the L.P.G.A. Championship. Mechem retired from Great America last May.
Dickinson and the tour's executive board and offered a five-year contract conservatively estimated to be worth well over $1 million. After talking it over with his wife of 38 years, Marilyn, Mechum agreed in November to become the fourth commissioner in the L.P.G.A.'s history.
But even if his social skills and integrity are unquestioned, Mechem has a tough job ahead. Women's golf has in the last decade been decisively passed by the Senior Tour. And in an uncertain economy in which even the burgeoning PGA Tour has begun to lose some sponsors, the L.P.G.A.'s traditional slow but steady growth could be in jeopardy.
In 1991, the women will be playing for more money than ever with $17.4 million in total purses. But the schedule will again contain a three-week gap in April devoid of an event that has been derisively dubbed "Spring Break." Only 12 of the 37 events will be televised in this country, with no television scheduled from April 1 to June 27.
The L.P.G.A. also needs to expand and improve its administration, which lost two high level deputies with Blue's ouster, as well as implement an anti-discrimination policy for its host clubs similar to ones adopted by the PGA Tour, the PGA of America and the United States Golf Association in the wake of Shoal Creek.
With the male dominated structure of most private clubs, this could be tricky for a women's organization that is not in a power position financially.
As he learns the lay of the land, Mechem is hesitant to get into specifics about future moves.
"The only way I've ever known to really market something is to make the organization so strong and so attractive that it basically sells itself," said Mechem. "If you try to do it any other way, you're going to have some Roman candle kind of successes: a big display, and then nothing."
Mechem has started to use his building-block approach to make inroads into the quicksilver starmaking machinery of television. He has visited with heads of all three networks, as well as several major cable outlets. Mechem isn't daunted by the traditionally low ratings L.P.G.A. events have received, arguing that nearly all golf telecasts receive low rating points, but are generally watched by audiences with "high" demographics.
"There's a growing realization that television ratings are compressing into a sort of band where the difference between the high guy and the low guy is a hell of a lot tighter than it used to be," said Mechem. "If you can get a strong sponsor, television will listen."
Although Chirkanian agrees Mechem's background will give him some leverage with the networks, he believes that the only place women's golf can significantly expand their presence on television will be on cable. Of the 12 L.P.G.A. events being televised this year, six will be carried on cable.
"I don't see any of the major networks having anymore room for women's events," said Chirkanian, adding that CBS, which is not contracted to do a women's event, is scheduled to air 74 individual golf telecasts this year. "I think eventually that Charlie will have to find himself a cable network that considers the L.P.G.A. its primary agenda."
Mechem, knowing the pitfalls, is cautious about being perceived as a surefire pipeline to television.
"Even if we don't get more television," he said, "we can improve other things, like the quality of our tournaments and the amount of money we play for. There are a lot of other things I'd like to be measured by down the road."
Mechem believes he can market the L.P.G.A. simply as the best women golfers in the world. He seems less inclined than his predecessors to emphasize sex appeal, and more inclined to be open about things like how far the women actually hit the ball. Most L.P.G.A. players drive the ball an average of about 215 yards, but the association has never released driving distance statistics.
In fact, Mechem has a lot to sell in terms of top competition, with Beth Daniel, Betsy King and Patty Sheehan at their peaks, and Amy Alcott and Pat Bradley closing in on the L.P.G.A. Hall of Fame.
The possibilities have reenergized Mechem at a time when he was considering a placid semi-retirment rather than high profile job. He describes himself as both excited and impatient, a mood that is verified by the yellow legal pad he carries that now contains more than 70 ideas and future projects he would like to implement.
"I don't want to say that the job that has been done for the last number of years hasn't been a good one," said the always diplomatic Mechem. "But what I will say is that the L.P.G.A. has a vast, unrealized potential."

HEADLINE: Tough Times Pinch Welfare Programs

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
ACROSS Connecticut, municipal officials are finding that welfare budgets, prepared before the economy took a serious downturn last spring, are woefully inadequate.
Roberto Garcia, director of the welfare department in Bridgeport, said he believes his $15.4 million budget will fall about $1 million short by June 30, the end of the fiscal year. 
 "When we were preparing our budget last year, we had hoped the caseload would level off at less than 2,400," Mr. Garcia said. But the city had 3,110 people on welfare by the end of December, and he estimated that the number topped 3,300 by the end of January.
At a recent meeting of 36 municipal social-service directors, Donald T. Muirhead of Windham asked how many had already requested supplemental appropriations to cover welfare costs. Representatives of 11 towns said they had, and another 23 said they expected to need additional funds in the current fiscal year. Only two of the welfare officers said they could probably make it through the year without additional money.
The higher welfare costs are a barometer of recent layoffs and job losses in the state's economy, state and city officials say. The higher costs, they say, are adding to the fiscal problems already facing some localities and the state governmnent, which pays most of the welfare costs of the cities and towns.
Even relatively affluent suburbs are being hit by the rise in welfare cases. Sheila T. Knox, director of social services in Newtown, said that January's average caseload was 30 to 35, compared to 11 or 12 a year earlier and 5 in 1989.
Ms. Knox's general-assistance budget was more than doubled for the current fiscal year, to $55,000 from $24,000, she said, but the money was still depleted by December, halfway through the year. Her budget request for the 1992 fiscal year, which begins on July 1, will be more than $100,000, she said.
 
First-Time Applicants
 "We're seeing people who have never had to apply for any type of assistance before in their lives," Ms. Knox said. "We used to see only people who couldn't work for medical reasons. But more and more, it's people who just can't find a job."
Greenwich has had problems with its welfare budget this year, said Carol A. Femia, commissioner of social services. "We started to see it beginning last January, just a trickle," she said. "Then it really started getting heavy in March.
"It wasn't that the number of new cases was up that much. It was that people were staying on much, much longer."
Ms. Femia said that for the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 1989, her department handled 233 cases, costing $224,647. For the fiscal year that ended last June, the number of cases was up 5 percent, to 245, and the cost was up 37 percent, to $306,928, she said.
This year, she said, the town actually trimmed its welfare budget because of concerns about higher taxes, reducing it to $304,588 from $313,500. "We had always been running a surplus," Ms. Femia said. "But it now looks like we'll need at least another $150,000 to get through this year. And for next year, we're asking for $600,000."
Because the state reimburses towns for 90 percent of direct welfare costs, the impact on towns is softened. But the towns' 10 percent share is rising sharply, and the administrative cost, which is not reimbursed, is up also, because more cases must be handled.
And all the towns are worried about a recommendation now under consideration in Hartford that reimbursement be lowered to 50 percent in an attempt to control the state budget. "The cities in no way could absorb that kind of a budget shift," Mr. Muirhead said.
William Rufleth, director of general assistance for the state Department of Income Maintenance, said for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30, the most recent statistics available, welfare costs were up 34 percent over a year earlier. This year, the state budgeted $83 million for welfare, but the actual cost will probably be closer to $100 million, Mr. Rufleth said.
 
Exhausting Unemployment Benefits
 Unemployment has increased, and more people are exhausting their 26 weeks of unemployment compensation benefits before they find work, said C. Richard Ficks, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor. Some 66,0000 people a week were receiving unemployment compensation at the end of December, he said, up 32 percent from 50,000 a year earlier.
"Between 800 and 1,000 people a week have been exhausting their benefits," Mr. Ficks said.
Unemployment compensation pays a maximum of $270 a week plus $10 for each dependent, up to $50, Mr. Ficks said. Welfare payments depend on the region, with a family of four getting $792 a month in western Connecticut, $683 a month in the state's east.
In most cases, the shortfalls are much more severe in small towns, local officials said. While some towns are facing an increase in welfare costs of 100 percent or more, most city welfare budgets are expected to be short by 25 percent or less.
"In the large towns, poverty is really a constant," said Mr. Muirhead of Windham. "We have bad in good times, so we're less impacted in the bad times."
Stonington saw a tripling of its welfare budget when its caseload went from three to nine, whereas a six-person increase in Windham would barely have been noticed, Mr. Muirhead said.
 
Consequences of Cutbacks
 Because many towns are seeking ways to trim municipal budgets, Mr. Rufleth said, "the social-service directors are faced with the prospect of laying off staff at the same time they've got more people coming through the door."
Bridgeport has learned the consequences of administrative cutbacks. Because it was short of staff, the city's welfare department was taking up to 18 working days to process new applications. Connecticut Legal Services filed suit, and a Superior Court judge threatened to jail Mr. Garcia unless he got that delay down to four working days before Feb. 11. Late in January, he managed to meet the judge's requirement, and his experience is likely to make other towns wary of cutting too deeply.
Deborah A. MacKenzie, director of welfare in Danbury, said that as of Dec. 31, halfway through the fiscal year, her budget was 63 percent depleted and going quickly. She said the first clients through the door early last year were typically restaurant workers, custodians, retail clerks, and laborers, who are the first to be let go in a downturn.
"We have painters and carpenters on general assistance now, who are subject to seasonal employment anyway," she said. "But in 1989, the season ended a lot quicker" than in previous years, "and in 1990, it never really picked up."
Ms. MacKenzie predicted that the problem will get far worse. People who are on welfare do not make enough money to afford most apartments in Danbury, she said, which rent for an average of $700 to $800 a month.
"People who are evicted become homeless," Ms. MacKenzie said. "And then there is no easy way for them to regroup, and they stay on welfare a lot longer."
 
Lives Fall Apart
 Ms. Knox of Newtown said she is seeing related problems as well. Two years ago, the town might see one application every few months from a person who wanted in-patient substance-abuse treatment. By last year, that had risen to two a month, and in January there were eight.
"We've seen people who had a job and house and other things, and they've seen one thing go after another, and they turn to substance abuse," Ms. Knox said. "The economy is bad, and they can't find work, and people are enormously stressed out."
She said more people are also relying for longer periods on private sources of help, like food pantries and the Salvation Army. "Those are supposed to be for families in crisis," Ms. Knox said. "But the crises are lasting a lot longer."
Mr. Garcia said the number of welfare cases has been rising steadily since January 1989, without any of the mid-year softening that had occurred in the past. He and others said they hope to see the cases fall off this spring.
"The end of March is our best indicator," Mr. Garcia said. "If things don't bottom out in March, we're going to be a lot more worried about this trend."

HEADLINE: Few Bidders Are Expected In Bank Sale

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Like skeptics coming to kick the tires at a used-car lot, bankers have been flying to Boston to examine the books at the failed Bank of New England. Within three months, the bank is scheduled to be sold by the Federal Government, most likely to another bank. But those close to the process say it will not be an easy sell.
So far, the Bank of America, the nation's third-largest bank, and the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, the 27th largest, have sent examiners. The investment group Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company is also said to be interested, but will not comment. And while talk is circulating of interest among regional and foreign banks, no other bidders have emerged. 
 In fact, only a handful of bidders, if that many, is expected. New York City banks, which have long hungered to enter New England, lack the capital to take over an institution as large and troubled as the Bank of New England, which has more than $3.3 billion in troubled loans. It is expected the buyer will need to provide some $800 million in fresh capital to meet Federal guidelines to establish a financial cushion for future losses.
 
Other Logical Buyers
 New England banks are not considered strong enough to make a bid, and other logical buyers, like the NCNB Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., which has bought failed banks and savings and loans in Texas, have said they are not interested.
"There's not a lot of buyers out there," said David Cates, an analyst with Ferguson & Company, a Washington consulting group. "There are not that many healthy banks, and everyone believes we are headed into a difficult period."
For its part, the Government, which is obligated to protect the bank's $15 billion in deposits, wants to shift this responsibility to someone else at the least cost possible and with the minimum strain to the banking system. The longer the process takes, the greater the likelihood that the value of the bank will deteriorate as customers flee, and the higher the ultimate cost to the Government.
The Government estimates that the Bank of New England will cost at least $2.3 billion to rescue, the largest bailout yet. And analysts say the tab could run higher if the New England economy continues to sour and further reduces the value of the bank's real estate loans.
Rather than face the costly prospect of liquidating a bank and simply compensating depositors, the Government generally tries to arrange the sale of a failed bank's deposits and loan portfolio to a healthy bank, which then puts up its own capital to support expanded operations. The difference between the deposit obligation taken on by the new bank and the value of the loan portfolio of the failed bank is what the Government must pay the buyer -- and that is where all the negotiating takes place.
That is also where the trouble can begin. Last week, for example, a Congressional report criticized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for its handling of the sale of the two biggest banks to collapse before the Bank of New England. The report claimed that in arranging the sale of two Texas banks -- the First Republic Bank to NCNB and MCorp to Banc One -- the Government offered "overly generous" subsidies while retaining most of the risk and costs.
"From the Government's side, you have to make the deal attractive enough to find a bidder," said Charles Peabody, a banking analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company, "but not so attractive that you end up in the political hot seat with Congress."
 
Casting Off Bad Loans
 But potential buyers simply will not touch a deal like the Bank of New England without some Government protections -- usually an agreement allowing the buyer to cast off bad loans back to the Government long after the bank is sold.
"Whoever gets Bank of New England will not be able to gamble on its problem loans," said Bert Ely, a consultant in Alexandria, Va. "They want very little, if any, risk, and that's the key."
Potential bidders have only to look to Texas to see that deals with the Government are not necessarily without risk. The former chairman of the First Chicago Corporation, A. Robert Abboud, led a rescue in 1988 of the First City Bancorp in Texas, and that venture has turned into a money-loser.
Apparently, Mr. Abboud's group miscalculated the amount of Federal assistance needed to reverse that bank's fortunes. After raising some $500 million in private capital, the bank reported a 1990 loss of $158.3 million and is struggling with a portfolio of bad loans. Similarly, the Hallwood Group, an investment group, put up $50 million to buy BancTexas, only to see that institution fail and fall back into Government hands.
 
A Regional Opportunity
 Still, potential bidders for the Bank of New England seem drawn to the opportunity to become a force in the region in a single transaction. But any buyer would be making a bet on the New England economy, which may or may not have hit bottom.
"It's not that a buyer wants the bank, it wants the territory," said Thomas A. Hanley, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
Those close to the process say the F.D.I.C. has also indicated that it is open to bids from a group of buyers who then might divide up the bank's parts -- it has subsidiaries in Connecticut, Maine and Massachusetts. Such a bid might come from Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts.
The New York firm, which has organized several huge leverage buyouts, may have gained support for a bid in last week's Congressional report. The report criticized the selection of Banc One in the MCorp sale and said Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts had been rejected more for political reasons than for the quality of its bid.
 
Change in Attitude
 The F.D.I.C. responded that Kohlberg, Kravis was rejected because it lacked bank management expertise. At the time of the MCorp sale, regulators were being criticized for making deals with financial entrepreneurs. But the Congressional report, say those close to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, indicates that attitudes in Washington have changed and that the firm may have a better chance now.
"I think K.K.R.'s interest is genuine, and I think there is a lot of nontraditional money looking at the banking industry," said James McDermott, president of Keefe Bruyette & Woods, a bank research firm.
Other nonbank groups have also been investing in banks: Warren E. Buffet, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a multi-industry holding company in Omaha, recently took a big stake in Wells Fargo & Company, the large California bank. And the Tisch family, with interests ranging from broadcasting to real estate, has large holdings in the Bank of Boston and other New England banks.
Still, some question whether such nonbank entities could attain cost efficiencies that an existing bank, with its established back office, could get in the deal.

HEADLINE: Environmental Coalition Is Split

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
An unlikely coalition of state officials, industry representatives and environmentalists that had pledged to reduce the amount of solid waste going into landfills in the Northeast has become divided over rules intended to cut down the amount of packaging used in consumer products.
Eleven environmental and consumer organizations have stopped participating in the Source Reduction Council of the Coalition of Northeast Governors because of what they said was a lack of action on setting specific packaging-reduction goals. 
 Their departure raises questions about whether the venture can move beyond broad goals to make a dent in the solid waste disposal problem in the Northeast. In establishing the council in 1989, the governors of the states involved described it as "the first-ever concerted regional effort to develop a coordinated strategy to reduce waste at the source."
 
A Common Policy
 The plan in the Northeast was to develop a common policy for the region to avoid fighting the same battles repeatedly in the nine state legislatures from Maine to Pennsylvania. Because packaging represents about one-third of all municipal solid waste, it quickly became the focus of the council's efforts. Last year the council drafted model legislation that limits the amount of toxic heavy metals in packaging. The legislation has been enacted by eight states, including six in the Northeast.
But talks have bogged down on various issues, including how to define such environmental claims as "recycled" and how to impose standards for reducing the amount of packaging in products. In general, packaged-goods companies and packaging makers want loose, voluntary standards for labeling and reduction efforts, while environmental and consumer groups want specific goals and timetables.
 
Debate Over Standards
 For example, many environmentalists contend that a package should have a minimum amount of recycled material, perhaps 50 percent, before it can be labeled "recycled" or "contains recycled material." But industry spokesmen say specific minimums are unnecessary and could cause confusion if different rules are adopted in different states.
Similarly, environmentalists say labeling a package as "recyclable" is misleading unless convenient systems to recycle that package exist. But industry's response is that labels have an educational value, particularly if they include information on where recycling centers can be found.
"The Source Reduction Council has generated not one pound of solid waste savings in the Northeast in two years of operation," said Allen Hershkowitz, vice chairman of the panel and an official of the New York-based Natural Resources Defense Council. He said industry representatives appeared more interested in protecting their individual company's economic position than in reaching overall waste reduction goals.
 
'Going in Circles'
 "We were going in circles on the packaging guidelines," said Jan Beyea, a scientist at the National Audubon Society. "We were successful with the toxics bill, but since then there has been no progress."
Other environmental organizations involved include the World Wildlife Fund and the Environmental Defense Fund, along with state-level groups.
Some of those state organizations, notably the Public Interest Research Groups in many of the Northeast states, are planning a lobbying effort this spring to back legislation restricting the use of packaging.
One effort, which would have required that packages be reusable or made of recycled or recyclable materials, was defeated in Oregon last year. "There will be legislation on the Oregon model and debate in the legislatures this year," said Susan Birmingham of the United States Public Interest Research Group, an umbrella group for the state organizations.
In a letter to the governors late last year, the environmentalists on the Source Reduction Council charged that their influence had been reduced by changes in the group's operating procedures. "We simply cannot participate in a forum that can use the good name of our influential organizations to further a policy with which not one of us agrees," they said.
 
Reports Are Blocked
 To encourage consensus, the council originally agreed that at least one vote from each of the sectors, designated as state, industry and nonprofit, would be needed to approve any action. But when the environmentalists blocked the issuing of several reports, state officials changed the rules so that only a simple majority of votes was needed.
"Over time it became difficult to get at least one vote from each sector," said Anne Stubbs, the executive director of the governors' coalition. "So last fall the state members decided that information we had developed should be forwarded to the states with majority and minority views. The nonprofits had a problem with that."
Ms. Stubbs said the council was continuing its work without the environmentalists, but some industry representatives questioned the value of the effort without their presence. "We are not going to renew our membership next year," said Chaz Miller of the Glass Packaging Council, which represents manufacturers of glass bottles and jars. "I do not see the benefit without the environmentalists being there."
Nevertheless, several industry executives appeared eager to include the implicit approval of the environmentalists on a 50-page set of voluntary guidelines for reducing packaging that the governors' coalition is preparing. "The preferred packaging guidelines manual reflects the comments we received from them," said Frank Consoli, a packaging manager at the Scott Paper Company and a member of the Source Reduction Council.
 
'We Have Not Signed Off'
 But Mr. Hershkowitz said any reports issued by the Source Reduction Council would not carry the endorsement of its environmental groups. "We may have worked on some things in the drafting stages, but we have not signed off on anything," he said.
Ms. Stubbs said a final decision had not been made on defining and releasing the packaging guidelines. She indicated that the governors' group would seek a reconciliation with the environmentalists first.
But Mr. Beyea of the Audubon Society said: "We will not participate unless there is movement in our direction. If the governors are not interested in coming up with goals for packaging, then it is a waste of time."

HEADLINE: Developers Shrug Off Rate Cut

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The latest steps to reduce interest rates -- the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in the discount rate on Friday and a similar cut in the prime rate used by banks -- are no more likely to provide relief to developers and investors in the beleaguered commercial real estate market than other interest rate cuts in the last six months, developers and financiers say.
These people say the risks of investing in the overbuilt real estate market still overshadow the lower rates. After the Fed cut the discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to commercial banks, most banks cut the prime lending rate to 9 percent from 9.5 percent. 
 But despite the lower rates, investors still perceive real estate as a risky investment for all but the best quality projects, said Henry Elghanyan, chairman of the Rockrose Development Corporation, a New York real estate company.
 
'The Bankers Are Scared'
 "With regulators looking over everyone's shoulder, the bankers are scared, and any project that is marginal is having a difficult time being financed, despite lower rates," he said.
Andrew J. Singer, president of Ackman Brothers & Singer, a mortgage brokerage firm for commercial real estate projects, said, "Lower rates might help some borrowers hang on a little longer" but have done little to increase the availability of money needed to finance sales or refinancings of existing buildings.
Not all sectors of the economy are so unexcited about the lower interest rates. Businesses with bank loans tied to the prime rate or other short-term interest rates, including some companies carrying heavy debts as a result of leveraged buyouts in the late 1980's, will quickly benefit from lower interest payments. Consumers with credit card debts or home-equity loans pegged to the prime lending rate are also benefiting.
 
Looking for Even Lower Rates
 Analysts noted that interest rates were still not as low as they were in the last half of 1986 and early 1987, when the prime rate fell to 7.5 percent and the yield on Treasury bonds fell below 7.5 percent.
"If and when rates come down another percentage point or two from today's levels, then you could see some positive effects," Mr. Singer said.
Because of the increased risk of default by borrowers, he said, lenders are now asking interest rates on 3- to 10-year commercial mortgages that are 1 3/4 to 2 percentage points higher than Treasury securities of comparable maturity. That is at least a quarter-point more than the gap between mortgage rates and Treasury securities in 1988 and 1989.
"The higher spread has more than offset any decline in interest rates on Treasury notes," Mr. Singer said.
Mr. Elghanyan said part of the problem for the real estate market is that rates of return demanded by real estate investors "are not tied so much to interest rates as they are to the more subjective judgment calls of value."
 
'An Absolute Standstill'
 Even in the residential mortgage market, where consumers are normally responsive to lower interest rates, the immediate reaction was muted.
"If we did not have lower interest rates, we would probably be at an absolute standstill," said Angelo R. Mozilo, president of the Countrywide Funding Corporation, a Pasadena, Calif., company that specializes in home mortgages. "As it is, lower rates have counterbalanced consumers' worries about the economy, unemployment and the melancholy induced by the war in the Persian Gulf."
Mr. Mozilo said Countrywide, the largest independent originator of home mortgages in the country, was handling about 220 applications a day, down from 280 before the military buildup in the gulf in August and 300 a day in the first half of 1990. He noted that activity had declined even though mortgage rates were lower than last year.
As of Friday, when yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 8.08 percent, the lowest level in a year, 30-year mortgages were being offered for about 9.5 percent for loans with a Government guaranttee and 9.75 percent for those without Government backing. In the past, mortgage rates below 10 percent have often been the catalyst for a noticeable increase in consumer demand.
 
Reduced Income Estimates
 Charles A. Shorter, senior vice president at the Real Estate Research Corporation, a Chicago company that specializes in real estate appraisals and advisory work across the country, said owners and potential buyers of a wide variety of commercial projects were reducing their estimates of the income those buildings would produce.
Because of the widespread vacancies and the incentives offered new tenants, some large tenants who signed leases a few years ago when rents were high "are now demanding and obtaining rent reductions," Mr. Shorter said. A decline in rents from a commercial building is a powerful depressant on the building's price.
Mr. Shorter said the benefits of lower interest rates were also obscured by investors' perception that the risk had increased and by lenders' demands that investors commit more of their own money as equity.
Peter Manning, chief financial officer at the Bank of Boston, said some accounting changes under consideration by regulators "might be more effective than lower interest rates in inducing new lending." He said the normal benefits to borrowers of lower interest rates were being held back by bankers' concerns about harsh accounting treatment for loans that they expect to be repaid in full eventually, but that are now seen as risky because of the slump in real estate prices.
 
'Temporarily Impaired'
 Mr. Manning and other bankers have urged Federal regulators to change some rules to reduce the amount of reserves a bank needs to set aside as a buffer against possible losses from loans that are found to be "temporarily impaired."
Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency and one of the top banking regulators, said Thursday that his office was considering guidelines that would encourage bankers to make more use of the temporarily impaired designation. These guidelines would include information about how bankers could prove that a particular loan would eventually be repaid in full, despite the current slump in real estate prices and rents.
Mr. Manning said regulators might reduce the amount of reserves banks would have to set aside for possible losses in the case of new loans made to borrowers who have difficulty paying the original interest rate but can make some payments. He said regulators could recognize that partial interest payments might still equal the bank's cost of money, even if they are far short of the original terms of the loan.

HEADLINE: Scandal Yields Windfall for an Impoverished City

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill., Feb. 3

 BODY:
Frustrated by the roller coaster of high hopes and dashed dreams that this nearly bankrupt city has been riding for years, a Federal district judge has found a way to turn a financial scandal into a windfall for its residents.
The judge, William D. Stiehl, on Thursday sentenced the Wall Street investment firm of Matthews & Wright Inc. to pay $7 million as community service in exchange for a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy and fraud for its role in a $223 million municipal bond issue for a river port that was never built. 
 United States Attorney Frederick Hess, whose office prosecuted the case, said it was the first time a corporation has been sentenced to perform community service through payment.
Judge Stiehl also established the East St. Louis Community Fund to oversee the spending of the money for the benefit of East St. Louis. The court order calls for the money to go for projects that include education, health care and housing.
 
First $1 Million Surrendered
 A representative of Matthews & Wright gave the court a check for $1 million. The firm must outline to the judge within 30 days a plan for an annuity that would provide $1 million a year through 1997. It was also fined $1 million.
Arthur Abba Goldberg, the former executive vice president for Matthews & Wright who arranged the bond transaction, was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and fraud.
David Aufhauser, a Washington lawyer representing Matthews & Wright, said the sentence offered his client solace and even a little pride at being able to do something constructive with the $7 million.
Judge Stiehl formed his plan for overseeing the fund after weeks of research and consultation with not-for-profit foundation professionals. Bruce Reppert, the assistant United States attorney who negotiated the plea agreement, volunteered to serve as counsel to the fund without charge.
 
Six-Member Board for Fund
 Judge Stiehl appointed a six-member bipartisan, biracial board for the fund. The $1 million was deposited in the Union Bank of Illinois here, which will act as the fund's trustee. Any project costing more than $50,000 must be approved by the court.
After the judge consulted the Ford Foundation, that organization and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation offered to provide a $40,000 grant to the National Economic Development and Law Center in Berkeley, Calif. The center will use the money to train the fund's board and help it plan.
"East St. Louis has really become known around the country as a symbol of hopelessness and despair and absence of leadership," said Robert Curvin, director of the Urban Poverty Program for the Ford Foundation.
 
'No Politics or Politicians'
 Judge Stiehl bypassed the troubled municipal government in setting up the fund. "There will be no politics or politicians involved with this fund," Judge Stiehl said.
Mayor Carl E. Officer had argued in a Jan. 17 letter to Judge Stiehl that the money should be paid directly to the city. He said that the city was the victim of the fraud and that "the city, not a trust fund, is the entity responsible and accountable for providing services to citizens."
Eric Vickers, a St. Louis lawyer who acts as corporate counsel for East St. Louis, said racism was behind the decision to create the fund. Mr. Vickers and Mr. Officer are black, as are most of the residents of East St. Louis. The judge and the United States Attorneys involved with the case are white.
But Johnny Scott, president of the East St. Louis chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, disagreed with Mr. Vickers. "I see nothing wrong with the concept," he said after the sentencing. "In fact, I applaud it."
Mr. Vickers also said Mayor Officer is under investigation in the bond fraud. Mr. Reppert confirmed that the investigation was continuing, but he declined to confirm or deny that the Mayor was a target.
Judge Stiehl told a packed courtroom on Thursday: "It is important that this fund not be another pie-in-the-sky scheme. It is imperative that their hopes and dreams not be raised, only to be dashed to the ground again, as they were in this case."
 
Scheme Involving the Bond
 The scheme to which Judge Stiehl referred was a $223 million bond issue underwritten by Matthews & Wright in 1985 to finance a huge river port that prosecutors said the conspirators in the fraud had no intention of building. The project was billed by city officials as one that would attract industry.
East St. Louis, where 43 percent of the population lives below the national poverty level of about $12,675 a year for a family of four, has been running at a deficit. The city is now about $50 million in debt, and the Chamber of Commerce says that nearly half of its 40,000 residents are unemployed.
What happened in the bond deal, the prosecutors contended, was that Mr. Goldberg used a bogus check drawn on a credit union to guarantee the closing of the bond issue in 1985 before an anticipated unfavorable change in the tax law. At the same time, Matthews & Wright arranged a sham sale of the bonds to a bank on the Pacific island of Saipan, the prosecutors said. The bonds were in fact sold in 1986, the prosecutors said.
Neither the bondholders nor East St. Louis lost money. The Government said Matthews & Wright made money in fees from sale of the bonds and on returns from investment of the money.

HEADLINE: SOVIET VENTURES ARE LOSING APPEAL FOR U.S. BUSINESS

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
One casualty of the political and economic chaos in the Soviet Union has been American enthusiasm for investment there.
The explosive tensions between Moscow and the Baltic republics, as well as the bureaurats' dogged hold on power, make the Soviet Union a far less welcome place for investors than Eastern Europe. Most former Soviet satellites have eased visa restrictions, are closer to the Western European market and, unlike Moscow, usually do whatever it takes to attract Western ventures. 
 As a result, the small but steady flow of American investment into the Soviet Union, which began in 1987, has greatly slowed down. Many companies that were leaning toward investing here are thinking again. The dollar amount lost might be relatively small, but the Soviet Government remains hungry for Western technology and management expertise as well as money.
 
Three Forms of Caution
 "The Western financial and investment community is more cautious now," James H. Giffen, president of the American Trade Consortium, a group of major American companies that is negotiating to invest in the Soviet Union, said in an interview at his Moscow office. "This caution is taking the form of either withholding investment entirely, slowing investment or downsizing investment."
The experience of Dresser Industries, a Dallas-based producer of oil-drilling equipment, reflects the difficulties facing Western investors. When President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began courting Western investors four years ago, Dresser jumped at the chance and set out to build two factories in the world's largest oil-producing nation.
Today, despite climbing hurdle after hurdle, Dresser's plans, remain just that -- plans. The ministry Dresser was working with was almost abolished. It found it had to negotiate with both Moscow and the republics, which are locked in a tense tug-of-war. And Dresser's state-owned joint-venture partner said it did not have the money to help build the factories.
 
'Situation Getting Prohibitive'
 "Things have changed," said Raymond Cossette, coordinator of Soviet activities for Dresser, which says it has not given up. "The situation in this country looks as if it's getting prohibitive."
Other American companies have similar woes, and many corporate executives are considerably less enthusiastic than they were when plans for Soviet investment were formulated. After two years of negotiations, RJR Nabisco Inc. is still waiting to sign papers to produce cigarettes in Leningrad and crackers outside Moscow. The Colgate-Palmolive Company is mired in negotiations with the Ministry of Health to open a toothpaste plant this year in Kiev.
"The Soviet Union is a large market with a massive population of 280 million people, and obviously that represents a lot of teeth for us," said Edgar J. Field, group vice president for international business development at Colgate-Palmolive.
 
Still Seeing Opportunities
 Many American companies are loath to drop their plans. They still see colossal opportunities, and America's corporate giants want to make sure they are not the last to arrive as one of the world's largest countries and consumer markets opens its economy to the outside world.
Among the other American companies that continue to negotiate in the Soviet Union are Texaco, Chevron and Eastman Kodak. They hope to join companies that have already invested here, Pepsico, McDonald's, Johnson Wax and Combustion Engineering among them.
Some American executives even privately support a drift to dictatorship, saying someone needs to take firm control of the chaotic situation. Still, they worry that the increasing power of old-guard Communists will slow, and perhaps threaten, the transition to a market economy.
"The fact that there may be some reactionary influences at work I don't think scares investors all that much," said Karl von der Heyden, chief financial officer for RJR Nabisco. "The basic thrust is toward a more open society."
 
Abundance of Horror Stories
 Every American in Moscow has a horror story or two about the difficulty and unpleasantness of living and working in the Soviet Union. Even though the McDonald's restaurant in Moscow had a contract to buy chopped meat for one ruble a pound, it is being forced to pay seven times that. Some American executives who come to explore prospects go away complaining about unappetizing meals that cost $75 and shabby $200-a-night rooms in hotels where 25-watt bulbs and prostitutes are part of the decor.
Making investment less inviting are the K.G.B. officials who rail against Western executives for gathering what the K.G.B. contends is sensitive information about the Soviet Union. American companies are also often unsure whether they should negotiate with the national Government or individual republics.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what can and cannot be done," Michael Adams, chief executive of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency office, said in an interview in his Moscow office. "You have the Russian Federation saying, 'Come on down; let's make a deal,' and then you have the all-union government making fundamentally different policy. You don't know whether to scratch or wind your watch."
 
$12,500-a-Month Rental Unit
 For months, Mr. Adams has been searching for a respectable house or apartment. A Communist Party official who got wind of his quest invited him to look at a modest house at a riverside retreat for party functionaries. Mr. Adams inquired about the rent and was stunned: $12,500 a month.
American investment in the Soviet Union is as varied as American industry. Chevron plans to drill for oil; McDonald's has opened the world's busiest restaurant, on Gorky Square; Price Waterhouse has a small accounting office; Tambrands makes sanitary napkins in the Ukraine; Combustion Engineering's joint venture makes process controls for oil refineries.
Mark S. Vecchio, a Moscow-based lawyer with the firm of Coudert Brothers, said many American companies were attracted by the nation's immense natural resources and large proportion of highly skilled low-wage workers. But some companies invest without doing their homework, he said.
 
'Lots of Wishful Thinking'
 "There is lots of wishful thinking about what is possible," he said. "Some companies think, 'If there is such an immense consumer market, then all I have to do is come in and the Soviets will buy my product.' But they forget that the Soviet ruble is not convertible, which makes it hard for them to take out their profits."
More than 2,000 joint ventures have been registered so far in the Soviet Union, but because of the bureaucratic thicket they must hack through, only about 500 are up and running. Of these, about 100 are losing money.
Several of America's best-known companies have set up the American Trade Consortium, in which one member, Chevron, will in theory provide the hard currency for the others through its revenues from exploring and developing Soviet oilfields. All told, consortium members hope to invest more than $10 billion over the next dozen years.
"We wouldn't be here if we didn't think we could make a profit," said Mr. Giffen, president of the consortium and chairman of the Mercator Corporation, which is serving as its merchant bank. "The trick is to have a profit level commensurate with the downside risk."
 
Soviet Entrepreneur's View
 Andrei Stroyev, widely considered the Soviet Union's foremost entrepreneur, criticizes Americans for being far more hesitant than Europeans to invest here.
"American business thinks that the best solution is just to be careful and that waiting is better," Mr. Stroyev, a real estate developer, said. "But I can't close my door because there are so many Germans, Swiss, Swedes, Austrians, Italians knocking."
He is co-chairman of one of the few successful Soviet-American joint ventures. It is named Perestroika, and it specializes in real estate development. Its American partner is the Worsham Group, an Atlanta-based developer.
The two-year-old venture renovates buildings and then rents offices to blue-chip companies, including Hoechst, Mitsubishi and Fiat. They pay their rents in hard currency, making the Worsham Group one of the few companies that can easily repatriate its profits.
 
Service-Oriented Concerns Gain
 Many service-oriented companies have also been successful. Ernst & Young, Price Waterhouse and other large accounting firms rushed to open offices here, which help Western companies prospect for partners and analyze Soviet businesses and balance sheets.
Advertising agencies do market research and public relations for Western companies. The law firms here, including Coudert Brothers and Baker & McKenzie, help draw up contracts and negotiate with Kafkaesque ministries. Manufacturers have a far tougher time.
An aluminum company wanted to start a joint venture in Armenia, for example, but backed off when it learned that neighboring Azerbaijan had cut the rail lines.
 
McDonald's Talks Took 14 Years
 McDonald's had to weather 14 years of negotiations before opening one restaurant in Moscow.
Although the rubles-only restaurant has generated little hard currency earnings, George Cohon, chairman of McDonald's Canada and vice chairman of McDonald's in Moscow, said the outlet was a huge success, with 50,000 customers a day and 1,200 workers. The company plans to open several more restaurants soon, including one that would sell hamburgers for hard currency.
Looking out at the 90-minute-long line of shivering people, he said: "Sure, it's a risk to be here now. But it might be a bigger risk to wait. I don't care what system there is in this country: people are going to continue flooding into this place."

HEADLINE: Oakland Journal;
Schools Resist Call of the Military

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Jan 31

 BODY:
Oakland Technical High School is a campus of nearly 1,600 students, 93 percent of them black, Hispanic or Asian. Unlike some other inner-city high schools, it appears to be winning the war against drugs and gangs and is keeping its old buildings well-maintained and nearly graffiti-free.
But in this school, students and parents complain of another source of concern: the tactics of military recruiters. 
 Like thousands of schools around the country, Oakland Technical has been making its senior class list available to military recruiters. The lists have names, home addresses and telephone numbers, and people here say the recruiters have made liberal use of them.
"Some kids have been called 10 times by the same branch of the service," said Dr. Gerald Kramer, the school's principal. "They say they are not interested and they still get called again and again."
In January, a week before fighting broke out in the Persian Gulf, the Oakland Board of Education voted unanimously to stop giving recruiters the lists from its six high schools. A week after the war began, the Los Angeles School Board followed Oakland's lead, ending a 20-year practice.
The resolutions do not affect the ability of the military to come to campus and contact interested students, like any other potential employer.
Sheila Jordan, the Oakland School Board member who sponsored the resolution and whose son attends Oakland Tech, said the vote came after a public meeting in which there was "an incredible outpouring from both parents and students."
Ms. Jordan, who was active in the peace movement during the Vietnam War, said that for her generation the times have "such a ring of familiarity with demonstrations, war, being upset with the government." But to these teen-agers, the experience is a new one.
"A lot of the students are very confused," she said. "They don't want to be unpatriotic, but they feel specially targeted. There is a high level of political consciousness around race and oppression here."
Barbara Sorensen, a spokeswoman for the Army Recruiting Command, denied that minority and poor students were being singled out for recruitment. Rather, she said, many young people whose horizons seem limited view the military as providing them with training and college money.
State education law allows schools to give students' names to the military, and many districts continue to do so.
Rick Jahnkow, program coordinator for the Project on Youth and Non-Military Opportunities, a group based in San Diego County that informs high school students about career and college alternatives to the military, said many schools went well beyond giving the names of students. Thousands of schools give the military's vocational aptitude test or allow recruiters to administer it and use the results for recruiting. "These recruiters are the best-trained salespeople in the world," Mr. Jahnkow said.
Some students say that while they dream of a college education the military seems to be the only way it is economically possible. Mr. Jahnkow says that even in California, with its enormous system of tuition-free community colleges and state universities, many students whose parents did not attend college mistakenly think there is no other way for them to go either.
Like many other critics, Mr. Jahnkow said recruiters deliberately focused on inner-city schools in areas with large black and Hispanic populations and high unemployment rates. "They try to do more outreach to schools where kids are more vulnerable," he said. "Recruiters don't put effort into schools where they know the kids have options."
Along corridors filled with boisterous teen-agers on their lunch break, Breeze C. Murphy, a senior at Oakland Tech, said he had been called by every branch of the service. "They talk like they're selling a used car," he said. "They said I didn't even have to agree with the United States foreign policy, that I should just do it for the money and the benefits. Service for the good of the country is one thing. But they're inducing selfishness."
Ms. Sorensen of the Army Recruiting Command said: "We're not going to apologize for the opportunities the Army offers. Money for college is part of the reward for service."

HEADLINE: As Realty Taxes Go Up, Up, Dreams Die in New Jersey

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDISON TOWNSHIP, N.J., Jan. 31

 BODY:
Much of the often angry politics in Trenton these days boils down to the kind of numbers that torment Angelo Verduci, a 74-year-old retiree in this fast-growing suburb.
His income: $13,000 a year.
His property taxes: $2,654 and rising.
Mr. Verduci fears that taxes will some day force him to leave the small cement house that he built himself 30 years ago, when much of Middlesex County was still rural. In the meantime each increase in property taxes cuts into his budget for food, clothing and medical care.
 
No Thought of Moving
 "This is a place I built to live and die in," said Mr. Verduci, whose property taxes rose 20 percent, more than $400, last year.
In this state of bedroom communities, where Democrats depend on the votes of modest homeowners, rising property taxes have seared the electorate and deeply divided the party.
Property taxes are a growing frustration across the state, in wealthy communities as well as middle-class ones, as soaring garbage-disposal bills, expensive labor contracts, a decline in Federal aid and other factors drive up the cost of local government and schools.
For the less affluent, and particularly people on fixed incomes, the rising taxes on their homes can rouse the kind of anger more often associated with issues like race and crime.
 
Cutting to the Bone

"It's gotten to the point where we've cut everything to the bone," said Mr. Verduci's son Bradley, a 44-year-old mechanic who lives next door with his wife and two children. Taxes, he says, have forced him to think of leaving the neighborhood.
"One more rise in taxes, and it will be very hard to make it, to pay our bills."
People like the Verducis, lifelong Democrats with conservative social leanings, were the type of New Jersey voters who often decided elections in the last decade, giving victories to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bush and to Govs. Thomas H. Kean and Jim Florio.
Realizing the importance of property taxes to people of modest means, Governor Florio promised them property-tax relief last year as he pushed through the Legislature $2.8 billion in sales, income and other tax increases.
Part of $1.3 billion in higher income taxes imposed on the state's top 17 percent of wage earners was aimed at reducing property taxes, with the rest marked for more aid to the state's poorer school districts.
 
Little Help Envisioned
 Now some Democrats, including the President of the State Senate, John Lynch, say Mr. Florio's plan will do too little to help people like the Verducis. By miscalculation or plan, they say, the Florio tax package will pour hundreds of millions of dollars into poorer schools but permit, or even require, property taxes to rise for most people.
Mr. Lynch has proposed stripping $395 million from the Florio school plan and directing it to municipalities to help keep property taxes down.
In 1988, New Jersey had the third highest per-capita property taxes in the United States, according to a preliminary study of United States Census figures gathered in the fiscal year beginning July 1987. For every resident, $933 in property taxes was collected, compared with $860 in New York and $911 in Connecticut.
Alaska had the highest property taxes, followed by New Hampshire.
 
Recession Makes a Difference
 Between 1989 and 1990, property taxes rose substantially in New Jersey, said Ernst C. Reock, director of the bureau of government research at Rutgers University. County taxes rose an average of 9.8 percent, municipal taxes 12.4 percent and school taxes 13.1 percent.
But the consternation over property taxes, particularly among middle- and lower-middle-income New Jerseyans, goes beyond those numbers, Mr. Reock said. Rising property taxes were not felt so much through the 1980's as the economy boomed, salaries rose and the value of real estate advanced steadily.
With the onset of the recession and sharp drops in property values, wage earners who believed they were increasing their wealth merely by owning a house now feel they have lost money. And people who believed they could make up for higher taxes with steadily rising salaries now face flat incomes and the fear of unemployment.
"What complicates matters is that people in the 1980's got themselves into a position where they were living at the edge of what they can afford in good times," Mr. Reoch said. "Now they have slipped below that level."
 
Acute Problem in Edison
 In Edison, a sprawling township near the convergence of the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, Interstate 287 and Route 1, property-tax problems are particularly acute. Through the 1980's it was one of the fastest-growing towns in the state, lifting its population by 26 percent -- to 88,680 from 70,193. And for years the government kept taxes relatively low by selling municipal lands in deals that now are being criticized by some residents as grossly mismanaged.
In 1990, residents saw their property taxes rise 19 percent -- from $1.36 for every $100 of assessed valuation to $1.63, said Paul Raffiani, Edison's Tax Assessor. In previous years taxes had risen at 7 to 8 percent a year.
To Elizabeth Conway, another Edison resident, there is little doubt that the state must turn its attention to the property-tax burdens of less affluent suburbanites. At 36, she and her husband look back on the years when they both worked, saving money so she could stay home to raise children.
Now her husband's job is threatened: he works as a heating and ventilation specialist in a largely empty office building that once housed the investment firm of Drexel Lambert, which has gone bankrupt.
Meanwhile property taxes on their three-bedroom colonial house have risen to $100 a month this year. Ms. Conway says life for her children, aged 5 and 2, will be far different than originally planned. There will be no vacations to Disneyland in the winter, no summers away from home. If things get tougher, Ms. Conway expects she will have to return to work.
 
Living Precariously
 On Ethel Road, where the two generations of Verducis live side by side, the mood is particularly dark in the home of the elder Verducis.
Both Angelo and Mary, who is 73, recall arriving in the area from other states as children, when Ethel Road was farmland where Angelo would hunt for wild asparagus and pick blueberries and huckleberries for his mother to make jelly.
Out of the Army in 1946, Mr. Verduci paid $675 for a plot of land, and together with his father-in-law, who bought the adjacent plot, the two men spent 13 years building the homes at night after Mr. Verduci finished working his shift as a technician at the Squibb Corporation. He retired in 1979.
In the last year the property taxes for the elder Mr. Verduci and his wife rose from $2,162 to $2,654. With one out of five dollars of their fixed income going to property taxes, there is not enough money for a movie or an unplanned drive. Both he and his wife live in fear of getting sick, for just about any doctors' bills are beyond their budget.
Most of all, Angelo Verduci fears that new increases in property taxes will make it impossible for them to keep their home.
 Next door Bradley Verduci said that until recently he had thought he could sell his home, which tripled in value during the 1980's to $149,000, according to the Town Assessor. But the idea of moving to North Carolina dissolved with the eroding real-estate market, which in many New Jersey suburbs has seemingly produced a "For Sale" sign on every other front lawn.
The new austerity in Bradley Verduci's home has meant, for example, that he was forced to delay for months a $300 repair of the kitchen stove. His wife suddenly found herself doing all her baking next door in her mother-in-law's kitchen.
"Even if they put a freeze on my taxes, it still would be out of proportion to what I can afford," he said.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: Latin America;
War's Ripples Lap at Latin America

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador

 BODY:
One recent morning, a group of young men hurled paint bombs at the United States Consulate here, protesting American participation in the Persian Gulf war.
The same day, a separate group of young men gathered at the consulate to inquire about enlisting to fight for the United States in the Persian Gulf. 
 While the first group was motivated by politics and the second by unemployment, the context was similar: as North America goes to war, South America once again watches from the sidelines.
With Brazil on the war's distant periphery, tourist officials predict a surge in reservations as Europeans and Americans change vacation plans and book flights to a destination that suddenly seems safe. The region's largest oil importer, Brazil has imposed curbs to cut gasoline consumption. Fuel pumps across Brazil are now closed on Sundays and weekday evenings.
 
Company Continues Aid
 Brazil's rocket manufacturer, Avibras, caused a furor when it disclosed that it was continuing to provide Iraq with technical aid to maintain its Brazilian-made radar and land-to-land rocket systems. A Foreign Ministry spokesman immediately vowed to take "all legal measures" to end the aid.
In Argentina, the decision by President Carlos Saul Menem to send two warships to the Persian Gulf provoked demonstrations outside of Congress and fist fights inside. Although Kuwait's government-in-exile paid Argentina $18 million in January for the aid, congressional approval was won only after a debate that split the nation and the presidential couple.
Zulema Yoma de Menem, the President's estranged wife, condemned the interference in the Middle East of "a group of powers with hellish destructive power." Mr. Menem declared to the nation, "Argentina is at war."
Most visible are the protests and bombings that have taken place across South America. Many have tapped traditional resentments against the United States.
 
Protests Outside Embassy
 "Arabs should attack interests of the U.S.A. in reprisal for its imperialist war," Ali Muhama, a Brazilian of Palestinian origin, told a demonstration on Jan. 12, four days before war broke out.
There have been protests outside the embassy and four consulates of the United States in Brazil, but none have been reported outside Iraq's embassy in Brasilia. In one evenhanded exception, Brazil's Green Party formed a human "peace chain" that linked the United States Consulate in Rio de Janeiro and the local office of Iraqi Airways, two blocks away.
So far, attacks on American installations have been minor. A small bomb broke windows at the embassy library in Quito, Ecuador, and a small rocket damaged the central air-conditioning unit of the embassy in Lima, Peru.
"We have had far more people trying to enlist than people throwing stink bombs," said a spokesman at the embassy in Lima, where a sign warns that the embassy is not accepting volunteers. "It's presumed to be a ticket to a green card," the spokesman said, referring to the United States work permit for immigrants.
 
Bomb Threats in Sao Paulo
 In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the continent's most populous city, the local bomb squad had investigated 42 bomb threats by mid-January, eight times the normal rate. In Brazil's only two bombings recorded to date, both on Jan. 20, a bomb damaged a synagogue in Porto Alegre and another damaged a Mormon church run by American missionaries in Goias.
The bomb threats have created a siege mentality among American diplomats, who have left explanations of the United States participation in the war to Cable News Network, which is extensively broadcast by local television with Portuguese or Spanish voice-overs. In contrast, Iraqi diplomats are peppering the press in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay with interviews.
"Our missile attacks on Israel have killed 1,000 people and wounded 2,500," Munthir Mushin, Iraq's charge d'affaires in Argentina, recently asserted in an interview with a Buenos Aires newspaper.

HEADLINE: Science Would Receive One of Sharpest Rises in Spending in Bush Plan

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Science and technology would receive one of the highest rates of increased spending under the budget that President Bush will send to Congress on Monday, Administration officials say.
That increase, for the 1992 fiscal year, would be $8 billion, to a total of $72 billion, a 13 percent rise over the current year's level, not accounting for inflation. By comparison, the rest of the budget would rise only 2.6 percent over all. 
The Administration would give a particular boost to "big science" projects, like the superconducting supercollider, the 50-mile-long atom smasher that is to be built just south of Dallas, and the Human Genome Project, which seeks to find and map all the genes in the human body. Financing for the supercollider would increase 120 percent, to $534 million, and for the genome project 26 percent, to $169 million.
In addition, the National Science Foundation, the chief source of all civilian science grants outside medicine, would get a 16 percent increase in spending authority, to $2.1 billion, and the spending authority of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would rise 18 percent, to $8.6 billion.
 
AIDS Spending About Steady
 Financing for AIDS research, education and treatment, totaling $2 billion, would not be significantly increased beyond inflation. It would rise $120 million over the current year's level.
As has frequently been the case with the Federal budget in recent years, the greatest amount of the increase for science and technology would be devoted to developing military hardware. Of the $8 billion increase, $5.2 billion would be spent to further develop new weapon systems, including an advanced version of the Cruise missile, a new tactical jet fighter loaded with electronics, a new attack submarine and the Stealth bomber.
This increase in spending on military technology comes as the overall military budget loses 1 percent to inflation.
The science and technology increases "are part of an ongoing campaign of the President to invest more in the future of America rather than just programs for the present," said an Administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "In other words, it is the third budget in a row in which he has placed heavy emphasis on research and development."
 
Response From Scientists
 Dr. Leon Lederman, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who is president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the largest general science organization in the world, said in an interview that the President's budget was a "good" one, "considering what we face and what is happening to others in the budget crisis."
But, he said, the proposal "will not solve the problems that we raised earlier."
Dr. Lederman raised those problems a month ago, when, after questioning 250 researchers at 50 universities, he reported that the responses "paint a picture of an academic research community beset by flagging morale, diminishing expectations and constricting horizons."
His report to the association said: "From one institution to the next, across demographic categories, across disciplines of research, the nation's scientists are sending a warning: Academic research in the United States is in serious trouble."
At the time, Dr. Lederman recommended doubling the Federal budget for science over the next few years, and following that with increases of 8 percent to 10 percent "continuously."
 
Increase in Costs
 Dr. Lederman said that after adjustment for inflation Federal financing of science was only slightly higher in 1990 than in 1968. In the intervening years, the number of scientists with doctorates has more than doubled, the cost of instruments and laboratory buildings has gone up several-fold and the cost of paperwork and overhead as a whole has also risen sharply, he said.
Albert H. Teich, a budget expert with Dr. Lederman's organization, said that the increases proposed by the President were a step in the right direction but that, after subtracting 5 percent for inflation and assuming that Congress would trim some of the proposals, they were modest.
Given the thaw in the cold war and pressures to increase spending on non-military science, he said, the biggest surprise is that military weaponry is once again the big winner while some other science programs suffer.
In the last seven years, Federal spending on science as a whole has been increasing somewhat, while spending on many other sectors of the budget have been held level, and Dr. Lederman said this posed "a great dilemma for us: how to complain when science is being favored."
 
New Limits Imposed
 He said of Mr. Bush's budget: "This is a good step. But it will still be an uphill fight to get the kind of exuberant leadership" by the President that science enjoyed 25 years ago.
Mr. Bush's request is the first under the new budget rules laid down last fall, in which caps were imposed on each of three broad categories: discretionary domestic spending, military spending and foreign programs spending.
"The caps were explicitly intended to force a competition among programs on their merits" within each of those categories, an Administration official said. "There is a clear message here: a chief priority is science, research and development, and an objective debate on the merits, we believe, will result in science winning."

HEADLINE: Cuts After Decade of Cuts: Governors Grim at Meeting

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
People who have been attending the midwinter meetings of the nation's governors for years cannot remember a bleaker assessment of the states' financial condition than the one they heard this weekend.
The governors, who spent the last decade lamenting cutbacks in Federal aid, said they were so bereft of money when the current recession arrived that they now faced unprecedented budget deficits and threats to essential services, including health and welfare programs. At the four-day meeting of the National Governors' Association here, they are exchanging proposals to freeze benefits, reduce services, shrink programs and lay off state employees. 
 "The atmosphere is much bleaker than the meetings during the 1981-82 recession because states had not gone through a decade of spending cuts," Brad Johnson, director of New York State's office in Washington, said today. "States are already at the bone, and the recession is ravaging their budgets across the country."
A survey conducted by New York State found that 40 states predicted deficits totaling $33 billion in the next fiscal year. New York expects a $6 billion shortfall, out of a $30 billion budget, in the fiscal year beginning in April.
 Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican, told his fellow governors, "We are now facing in most of the states a gap between revenue and expenditures that is unprecedented."
He predicted a $7 billion to $10 billion deficit in the next 18 months and proposed a freeze on all increases in cost of living allowances and state salaries and a reduction in welfare payments. "We want to avoid further health and welfare cuts," he added.
Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a Republican, said, "There isn't any entity of government that isn't being sorely stressed."
Today John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, reassured the governors that President Bush's proposal to give the states control of $15 billion worth of Federal programs would not mean a cutback in Federal assistance.
"They understand that it is not designed to save one cent in Federal spending," Mr. Sununu told reporters after a private luncheon meeting with the governors. "We want it to be programs that they and their state legislatures feel comfortable with."
 Mr. Sununu said that the turnover would last at least five years, and that the programs would be selected from among those totaling $22 billion in Federal spending.
Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a Democrat who had expressed concern that Washington would underfinance the programs, said after Mr. Sununu's luncheon presentation, "He was very reassuring." He was echoed by Gov. William F. Weld of Massachussets, a Republican, who said, "People were worried they might be trying to sell us a pig in a poke."
Discussions of state fiscal problems dominated the meeting. "The recession is driving these budget deficits," said Mr. Johnson of the New York State office. "Forty governors have not engaged in gross mismanagement simultaneously. The lion's share of the gap is a revenue falloff."
But the recession has also meant more people on Medicaid and welfare and more people receiving unemployment insurance. And in recent years Washington has directed the states to spend their own money on a wide variety of programs, especially those involving health and the environment.
 
Paying for New Programs
 Gov. John Ashcroft of Missouri, a Republican, said, "We have $140 million in new revenues, but 14 new mandates will cost $112 million." He said a projected deficit of $100 million meant that "we've had to ratchet back education and a variety of programs."
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat, told his fellow governors this morning, "We need to get a handle on the Medicaid mandates, otherwise some of us are going to go broke," especially those with large and growing numbers of poor people.
But Governor Chiles pointed out that Congress mandated state expenditures because it felt that the states dealt inadequately with problems like providing prenatal care to poor women. "I helped put some of the mandates on," said Mr. Chiles, a former Senator. "Some states weren't doing anything about it."
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey projected a $600 million to $800 million deficit in the current year, which he called "substantial but manageable." He has proposed eliminating three departments and consolidating 40 agencies and divisions.
Connecticut anticipates a $1.5 billion deficit, Texas a $4.2 billion deficit in the next two years, and Virginia a $1.9 billion deficit, according to the New York State survey.

Branstad of Iowa. (Michael Geissinger for The New York Times)

HEADLINE: With New Law, Budget Makers Face New Limits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Some items in President Bush's 1992 budget, which will be made public on Monday, will be worth careful scrutiny. Others can be safely ignored.
One figure not worth much attention is the projection that the deficit for the 1992 fiscal year, beginning in October, will be $281 billion. 
 The size of the deficit will depend to a large extent on whether the country pulls out of the recession before October, on how long the war with Iraq lasts and what it costs, and on how much the Government will be forced to spend on failed banks and savings and loan associations.
No one knows the answers to those questions. But since this $1.45 trillion budget assumes optimistically that the recession will be over by summer and allocates only $15 billion for the war the deficit figure is much more likely to be higher than $281 billion than it is to be lower than that.
 
Political Battles in One Field
 What should be looked at carefully is how the Bush Administration wants to allocate money in three broad areas: the military; benefit programs, like Medicare and welfare for which payments are automatic to everyone who is eligible, and discretionary domestic programs, like education and highways. This is the field where the political battles will be fought.
In contrast to previous budget laws, which set overall defict ceilings, the budget law that was enacted last fall works this way: spending ceilings are set for three categories, the military, foreign assistance and most domestic programs. In addition, the law prohibits additional spending for benefit programs unless it is offset by cuts in these programs or new taxes. Most important, the law precludes, for example, cutting military spending and using the money to pay for domestic programs. But within the spending limits of each category, it does not say which weapons should be produced and which ones scrapped, or specify which domestic programs the Government should emphasize.
Details of the budget are not so tightly held these days as they once were, and many of the important elements of the documents that will be sent to Congress on Monday have seeped out in the last few days.
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, ran through some raw numbers this morning on the NBC News program "Meet the Press": "$87 billion for children. $2.7 billion for the Department of Education more. $2.1 billion for Head Start. $11.1 billion for drugs."
 
Benefits for Wealthy May Be Cut
 He also suggested, without providing details, that the Administration would propose limits on Medicare benefits to wealthy elderly people. This is a proposal that Mr. Darman has made many times in the past but one that has been rejected by Congress.
The Pentagon budget, Mr. Darman said, will provide $15 billion for the war with Iraq. He called the figure a "place-holder" and said it would be raised or lowered depending on how much the war cost and on the extent to which the tab was picked up by contributions from the allies.
Defense Department officials have said the Pentagon budget would reflect deep cuts in Army, Navy and Air Force units; cuts in new purchases of A-10 antitank planes, which have proved useful in Saudi Arabia; a reduction in the number of Navy ships to 451, from 545, by 1995, and a cancellation of the Tacit Rainbow missile, which was designed to destroy Soviet radar equipment.
Potential political fights could develop over closing military bases and other military cutbacks that might have economic effects in certain states and Congressional districts.
 
Congress to Make Changes
 On the domestic side, according to the latest available documents, the budget will call for large cuts in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals, low-cost steps to combat infant mortality, a modest expansion of some child nutrition programs, cuts in Federal aid to college students from middle-income families and a substantial increase in spending for highways and space programs. Congress, of course, will have different priorities, and many of the Administration's proposals will be rejected.
As a rule, Administration budgets nowadays are not as important as they were a generation ago. Then, Congress could be expected to make marginal changes in the President's master plan, but, as is the case in parliamentary democracies, the Government ran generally according to the initial blueprint provided by the chief executive. But lawmakers became upset by what they saw as Richard M. Nixon's usurpation of Congress's constitutional power of the purse and established new budget procedures to put it on an equal footing with the executive branch.
Now Congress has its own experts and computers. And with Democrats holding large majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Congress has recently been unwilling to accept the priorities set by Republican Presidents.
 
Openly Political Documents
 Ronald Reagan turned his budgets into openly political documents. Year after year, he offered proposals like deep cuts in mass transit subsidies that stood no chance whatsoever of approval. His supporters and opponents alike realized that these budgets were, in the phrase of the time, "dead on arrival" on Capitol Hill.
The budget that Mr. Bush submitted last January, covering the fiscal year that began in October, had much the same tone. His economic forecasts were so optimistic that the deficit for this fiscal year is expected to be three times the $100 billion he projected.
The budget he submits Monday will have much less room for political extravagance, since the spending on the military ($295 billion), benefit programs ($687 billion) and other domestic programs ($211 billion) is fixed in law.
But his proposal for a cut in the capital gains tax was meant mostly to satisfy his conservative Republican allies, although having been rejected by Congress for two years, it is unlikely to be adopted this year. And Mr. Darman acknowledged in his television interview today that cutting the Medicare benefits of well-to-do elderly people had a particular political attraction.
"It will be somewhat ironic," he said, "if the Democrats, who are expressing concerns about fairness, are reluctant to reduce the subsidies for the wealthiest Americans."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Paperbacks Seem to Be Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
In the economically lean 1990's, people have been returning to sensible things like home-cooked dinners and family cars. Now, publishers are beginning to detect a swing back to another sensible product, the paperback book.
For more than 40 years, mass-market paperbacks thrived because they were cheap and convenient. But in the last decade, the handy, portable volumes introduced in the United States by Pocket Books in 1939 languished. During the high-rolling Reagan years, they lacked the pizazz of many hardcover best sellers. 
 "It was a little annoying, all the attention paid to hardcovers, but the big publishing revolution of the 80's was there," said Lou Aronica, the publisher of Bantam's mass-market paperback division.
 
Readers Switch Allegiance
 Lured by discounted hardbacks promoted in chain stores with the aggressive marketing techniques first introduced by paperback publishers, readers switched allegiance and created the new phenomenon of the mass-market hardcover book selling as many as two million copies.
Meanwhile, huge paperback best sellers like "The Exorcist" and "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," which sold as many as 10 million copies, became a thing of the past.
"During the 1980's, the mass paperback market was stagnant," said Carolyn Reidy, the president of Avon Books. "There were fewer paperback racks out there, and market shares shifted."
Mass-market paperback sales grew at a rate of just 6.5 percent a year from 1982 to 1989, compared with a 12.4 percent annual increase in the same period for adult hardbacks, according to the Association of American Publishers. Whereas adult hardback sales more than doubled to $1.7 billion a year in 1989 from $770.8 million in 1982, paperback sales only increased to $1.1 billion from $703 million in that period.
Bill Lofquist, a publishing analyst at the Commerce Department, said the increase in paperback sales was mainly a result of higher prices. Unit sales scarcely rose, he said.
But 1990 appears to have been a much better year for paperbacks than for hardcover books. Preliminary figures for the first 11 months of 1990 show mass-market paperback sales rising 7.2 percent over the comparable period in 1989, while hardback sales increased only 4.4 percent. These figures could change when December -- an important month for book sales -- is added in, but publishers said December's paperback sales were particularly good.
Although paperback sales also grew faster than hardcover sales in 1984 and 1988, publishers see the latest figures as an indication that in a recession people may be much less willing to pay more than $20 for a book when the same thing can be had a little later in paperback for $5.95.
"For the first time in years, I'm beginning to see a rise in actual units of paperbacks sold," said Phyllis Grann, the chief executive of the Putnam Berkley Group. "It's early to say, but this could be the next trend."
David Shanks, the president of Berkley Books, agreed. "I don't know whether it's the recession or the boom in military thrillers linked to the gulf situation, but our sales in recent months have been remarkably strong," he said. "We printed four million more books last year than in 1989."
While paperback publishers caution that evidence of a resurgence is still too flimsy to be called decisive, a new optimism is evident.
"It's entirely likely that during the recessionary period, there would be a greater impact on hardcover than on paperback and probably some trading down," said Jack Romanos, the president of Simon & Schuster's mass-market division. "That should continue to benefit paperbacks."
Several factors contributed to the stagnation of the paperback market during the 1980's. Among them, the price difference between hardbacks and paperbacks narrowed. Whereas paperbacks had once been a tenth of the price of hardbacks, they often became only a third cheaper.
Moreover, some retail outlets like Woolworth began to abandon unprofitable paperback racks.
 
Several Big Mergers
 As a result of its problems, paperback publishing began a period of restructuring. Several big houses merged. Ballantine bought Fawcett; Berkley bought Ace Charter; Penguin acquired New American Library, and Bantam was brought together with Doubleday Dell.
Most crucially, the old habit of being essentially a reprint business was abandoned. Paperback publishers like Bantam, Simon & Schuster's Pocket Books and Berkley began re-inventing their business, becoming publishers of original paperback material that was more varied than ever. Authors like John Saul and Jude Deveraux became best-selling writers through original paperbacks.
The trade paperback -- a hyrbid of the paperback and the hardback, bound in paper but larger than the traditional paperback -- was developed into a $1 billion business. Many paperback houses, including Pocket Books and Bantam, also became serious hardback publishers.
At Pocket Books, 75 percent of the paperback books are now from original manuscripts. "If you remained reprint-oriented, as we were at the beginning of the 80's, your business disappeared," Mr. Romanos of Simon & Schuster said.
At Bantam, too, the proportion of original paperback books has risen. And this year the company divided its mass-market paperback list into six genre imprints -- science fiction, crime, historical saga, women's fiction, high-tech action and nonfiction.
"For a long time, we all clung to the belief that there were still paperback books that everyone wanted to read," said Mr. Aronica, the Bantam mass-market president. "But mass-market is now a misnomer. There are many big audiences, but all different."
Thus, the return of the paperback is unlikely to bring a return of blockbusters like "The Exorcist." The market has changed.
"The days of the 7- or 10-million-copy paperback are gone," said Susan J. Petersen, the president of Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett/Ivy Books. "You won't get one book that size, but millions of books selling some copies."

HEADLINE: A Sudden Revival for East Asian Oil

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
In the months before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, East Asia was beginning to despair of its role as a producer and refiner of oil and feared that its huge dependence on the Middle East for crude oil would only rise as this region's continuing economic boom sent fuel consumption soaring.
But war in the Persian Gulf has changed that -- at least for now. The region is stepping up efforts to drill for oil and several governments are scrambling to profit from the demand for crude oil, both in the short term and the long. Suddenly there is fresh interest in exploring the South China Sea, from the coast of Vietnam to the shores of Borneo, along with a host of projects to increase the output of existing wells and to build new refineries. 
 For now, the biggest beneficiary is Singapore, which has long been a "swing" refiner because of its ability to make up for specific shortfalls in a fuel. Singapore has been an oil trading center, but never an oil capital. Temporarily, at least, that has changed. The refineries on the islands off Singapore's shores are running above capacity. On the horizon, full tankers are bobbing around, unable to move because there is no room for storage ashore. Saudi Arabia, long one of Singapore's biggest suppliers, has suddenly become one of its biggest clients -- mostly for jet fuel for allied warplanes.
 
'Running at Full Tilt'
 "All of us are running at full tilt, many even faster," said Cheng Hong Kok, the president and chief executive of the Singapore Petroleum Corporation, the biggest local refiner listed on the Singapore stock exchange. "With Kuwait looking like it will not be operating for a long while and many tankers afraid of moving through the gulf, we may be producing like this for some time."
Of course, this boom could be short-lived. For one thing, if oil prices stay relatively low several projects will probably be scrapped.
Moreover, the refining boom will continue only as long as crude oil flows readily from the Middle East. And though stockpiles are high now, there are growing fears that a long war could plunge some of the world's fastest-growing -- and least oil-efficient -- economies into a severe slowdown.
East Asia does produce some oil, but it depends on the Middle East for nearly three-quarters of its crude oil. Some studies suggest that over the next decade dependency will worsen, as countries like Malaysia and Indonesia deplete their reserves and the region's demand increases.
A recent study by the East-West Center in Honolulu predicted that East Asia's oil exports in the next 10 years, now a major source of foreign exchange, would decline significantly as production was diverted to domestic demands.
 
Decline Reversed
 For Singapore, the latest turn of events is an unexpected change. The refining business had shrunk here since the mid-1980's, with the Government estimating refinery output at 800,000 to 900,000 barrels a day, though the industry had capacity for more than a million barrels. Shell, which has dominated Southeast Asia's oil markets since colonial days, mothballed some operations in the mid-80's. Recently they reopened, and other refiners here say they have been installing new equipment to increase output.
In a nation that leaves little to chance, this sudden boom is not exactly what Singapore had in mind to revive its role in the oil business.
Gong Wee Lik, the deputy director of the industry development division for Singapore's powerful Economic Development Board, said Singapore had been moving for some time into specialized petroleum products, hoping, for example, to produce plastics and other materials that could be turned into circuit boards for the country's numerous electronics makers. Instead, it finds itself trying to make up for Japan's sudden shortfalls in kerosene and the United States' sudden interest in a quick supply of jet fuel.
 
Searching for New Fields
 A number of neighboring countries plan to open refineries in the next few years, including a giant plant near Malacca, the ancient trading city of Malaysia.
As a result, the war in the gulf has stimulated exploration.
"There is such a heightened sensitivity now that if you can find any oil away from the Middle East, you will go for it," said Lisa Totto, a researcher at the East-West Center. "And Asia needs it so much, there there does not seem to be such a big problem finding capital for exploration."
Malaysia's state oil company, Petronas, is already worried about meeting its promise of increased production during the gulf crisis, and it is renewing its interest in fields off Sarawak and Sabah, the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo.
Indonesia, the region's largest producer, is offering incentives to recover oil from fields that many producers had all but abandoned. It has entered a number of exploration contracts with foreign companies in recent months. By some estimates, more than $4 billion will be spent by American and European companies in the next five years to hunt for oil in Indonesia. Still, the country's production is expected to fall, as existing fields begin to dry up.
Oil executives here say that much of the problem is the difficulty in exploring many of East Asia's most promising areas. Many lie in deep water, and a few in deep jungle with no roads. "These are areas that will be explored only if the war drives oil up to $40 a barrel or so," said one American executive in Malaysia, who insisted on remaining anonymous. "Otherwise, no government is going to convince anyone to take the risk."
 
Political Hurdles
 More than a few of the obstacles are political. One of the more promising oil producers over the next few years is Vietnam, which by the most optimistic estimates may have reserves of one to two billion barrels. American oil companies are barred from exploring there because of the longstanding United States trade embargo against Hanoi. But that is hardly slowing Japanese businesses, which are buying most of Vietnam's current crude-oil production, and are negotiating for exploration rights.
Malaysia, Vietnam and other East Asian nations are also in the race, and the decrepit few hotel rooms in Hanoi are filled these days with Asian business executives hoping to strike a deal with a Government still uncertain how to exploit its offshore riches.
In the last two years, Vietnam has signed about 10 contracts with overseas oil companies to explore its reserves and to share any resulting oil. Under one such contract, completed recently with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company of Australia, Broken Hill will spend the next five years exploring, and bear all costs if no oil or gas is found. But if they are found, Broken Hill's capital investment will be reimbursed and it will have an interest in the oil field.
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is another potential producer, though on a smaller scale. But the Government there is still trying to keep the lid on a smoldering democracy movement and is fighting rebellions in its northern territories. Few foreign investors, even the Japanese, traditionally Myanmar's biggest source of foreign aid, seem willing to take the risk.
Malaysia and Thailand are arguing over fields in the Gulf of Thailand, though a joint-exploration agreement now seems likely to work. And then there are the Spratly Islands, a desolate and otherwise forgettable cluster that is claimed by the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, China and Taiwan, all of which believe that the chain might be sitting on top of one of East Asia's most lucrative fields.
When battling over Kuwait is over, the islands are believed to be a good candidate for the site of the next power plays for oil.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Reality: Bumpy Streets, Library Cuts and Tuition Rise

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
The sleek stone facade of the central branch of the Brooklyn Public Library is to be draped in black today, in mourning as much as protest, over a New York City fiscal crunch that is only now beginning to impinge on the lives of New Yorkers.
After months of dire and sometimes confusing statements at City Hall, evoking for many the city's brush with bankruptcy in the 1970's, the pronouncements are beginning to turn into an unpleasant reality -- shorter library hours, dirtier and bumpier streets, broken street lights, higher tuition for the City University system. 
 Starting today, the central branch of the Brooklyn library on Grand Army Plaza is to be closed on Mondays, the first time in its 50-year history that it is to close regularly on a weekday.
 
Reduced Hours for Branches
 Handwritten notes taped to the doors of scores of branch libraries last week announced a reduction in days and hours, with many libraries to be open only four days a week, some three. Schoolchildren, the main users of the city's libraries, are to lock the Brooklyn library's doors symbolically with a chain of paper.
Street cleaning is also suffering. The Sanitation Department has started to reduce street-cleaning routes in business districts across the city. On the Upper West Side of Manhattan, for example, post-midnight sweepings by mechanical brooms along Broadway, Columbus Avenue and the major cross streets have been eliminated.
Manual street sweeping is being virtually eliminated as the cleaning force is being cut to 800 from a peak of 2,500 several years ago. "We will be doing less street cleaning than we did during the fiscal crisis," said Steven M. Polan, the Sanitation Commissioner. "There will be a decline in cleanliness."
At the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, administrators have just learned that the city will immediately cut $744,577 from its annual subsidy for the museum, an 11.1 percent reduction. They were told to expect an additional 19.4 percent cut starting in July. Over all, aid to cultural programs was cut by more than $7 million this year and will be cut by $13 million next year from the spending levels announced last July.
Administrators at the museum have begun to debate whether to slash educational programs for children, close exhibition halls during the day, reduce hours or raise the recommended admission fees to make up for the budget cuts. "These cuts will clearly have an effect on our operations," said Barbara Gunn, the museum's vice president for finance.
The Parks Department, facing some of the steepest cuts, is closing the Central Park children's petting zoo, cutting the number of playground attendants by a third, reducing park flower planting and cutting lifeguard hours at public beaches. The swimming season at the city's major outdoor pools will be shortened, and 33 neighborhood mini-pools will not be opened at all.
To reserve a ball field, softball leagues will have to pay $8 instead of $4. The marionette theater in Central Park will be shut. Betsy Gotbaum, the Parks Commissioner and a top fund-raiser for Mayor David N. Dinkins during his campaign, said that she hoped to solicit private contributions to reverse a small part of the cuts but that many would be unavoidable.
In all, the jobs of 430 full-time and 76 seasonal city park workers are being cut. Also being cut are 109 Parks Department administrative jobs.
To forestall cuts in city bridge maintenance programs, Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio said he had ordered deep service cuts in several programs, slashing plans to rebuild city streets and to make nonemergency highway repairs.
 
'Kind of a Heartbreaker'
 The city will repaint fewer lines on highways, cut crews surveying streets for pothole repairs, and delay replacing 5,000 damaged street lamp fixtures, though burned-out bulbs will still be replaced. New nighttime parking meters will be installed in the midtown theater district and thousands of other meters will be adjusted for higher rates.
Grass-cutting and nonessential cleaning will be halted on most highways, except for roadways that most tourists and business travelers see driving in from Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports like the Grand Central Parkway, Long Island Expressway or Van Wyck Expressway. "It's kind of a heartbreaker," Mr. Riccio said. "It will get visibly dirtier out there on the highways."
But some fiscal experts, inside government and out, say those cuts are only the beginning. Deeper service reductions in the city's parks, libraries, museums and cultural institutions and its schools are to begin in July.
Even more cuts may be needed, both to deal with a laggard city economy and a state budget proposed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo that would cut more than $400 million in aid to the city. Some experts say that before the current tribulations end, the city may be drastically and permanently reshaped.
"The economic base here can no longer support the current level of services," said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the state's Financial Control Board. "You need to preserve those services that are necessary to live and do business in the city, and cut or eliminate others."
Mr. Proctor and others have noted that despite the steep cuts for city parks and libraries, other agencies -- the Fire and Police Departments and to a lesser extent the city's Human Resources Administration -- have been spared many deep and painful cuts.
Many smaller city agencies, like the Board of Elections and City Clerk's office, would continue to grow under Mr. Dinkins's budget. In fact, with most school job cuts postponed until next year, the number of workers on the city payroll is likely to rise this year.
"The decision makers in the city need to hear from the people that certain things -- education and libraries -- cannot be cut because we can't retrieve what is lost" said Representative Major R. Owens, a Democrat who represents part of Brooklyn in Congress. "We've got to wage war. We have to fight the assumption that the city and state are poor. The money is there; it is being wasted."
Some analysts see the service cuts as part of a political scheme to mobilize public opposition to budget cuts and support for larger tax increases.
"I do believe the libraries are being held hostage," said Henry J. Stern, a former Parks Commissioner who is the president of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit group. "It is part of a strategy to overcome the Council's reluctance to increase taxes. The administration talks layoffs, but they want taxes."
 
'Where the Dollars Are'
 Marc V. Shaw, director of the City Council finance division, said that once the Mayor decided to protect social services, health services and the police from deep cutbacks, he had little choice but to cut where he did. "That is where the dollars are," he said.
While Mayor Dinkins still hopes to avert most of the layoffs called for in his preliminary budget, the Brooklyn Public Library was forced to lay off 77 clerks and librarians on Thursday. The layoffs were needed to manage a 10 percent cut in aid this year and an additional 8.3 percent cut for next year, said a library spokesman, Donald Kaplan.
The New York Public Library's main research library on Fifth Avenue will open later and close earlier, making it more difficult for working people to use it, said Mimi Koren, associate manager of public relations. The system's 82 branch libraries will provide a total of 58 fewer days of service each week.
Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge of Manhattan found the library cuts particularly galling. Last year, she said, she enlisted Council support to add $50,000 to the city's library subsidy so the Riverside branch library, at Amsterdam Avenue and 69th Street, could open on Saturdays. "Now," she said, "it is closing on Tuesdays."

HEADLINE: Plan to Limit Deposit Insurance Is Defended

 BODY:
The Treasury Department's plan to curtail deposit insurance at the nation's banks was described yesterday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady as an attempt "to make the system safe for savers, but yet to make sure the taxpayer does not have to pay enormous bills when banks fail."
The Treasury proposal, details of which were disclosed on Saturday, will be formally announced on Tuesday. It would limit the number of federally insured accounts that one person could have at a single institution. Under the proposal, each person would be limited to one $100,000 account at a single institution, as well as one $100,000 retirement account. 
 "Don't worry," Mr. Brady said in an interview on the ABC television program "Business World." "Savers are going to be presented with plenty of opportunity to put their money in places that they consider absolutely safe."
 
Response to Criticism
 After a series of meetings, and after hearing strong criticism recently from many bankers on a plan for sharper restrictions, senior officials at the White House and the Treasury Department agreed on Saturday about how to limit the coverage.
People could still have multiple accounts of $100,000 at different institutions, each covered by the Government's deposit insurance.
The plan needs the approval of Congress.
The Treasury is also contemplating a second, more stringent part of the plan. It would call for a $100,000 insurance limit on each individual regardless of how many different banks the money is kept in.
The Treasury proposed that such a systemwide limit be phased in after five years, after a study on the costs of adminstering such a program is conducted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
'A Good Approach'
 "This seems to be a good approach," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, a member of the House Banking Committee. "Insured deposits have to be limited in one way or another." Telephone calls to members of the Senate Banking Committee last night were not answered.
If it is approved by Congress, the Treasury's proposed limit on accounts at a single institution would be phased in over a year, Bush Administration officials say. The curb is intended to encourage large depositors to open accounts at different banks.
The Treasury plan will also eliminate the insurance protection provided to pension funds and other institutional investors that are able to get insurance for their huge deposits by breaking them into accounts of $100,000 or less.
The proposed limitations on deposit insurance come at a difficult time for the nation's banks. The deposit insurance fund administered by the F.D.I.C. and financed through premiums paid by banks has been drained by numerous bank failures, a process likely to continue during the recession.
 
Skepticism From Bankers
 Some bankers contacted yesterday were skeptical of the impact of the proposed changes.
Richard H. Deihl, chairman and chief executive of H. F. Ahmanson & Company, a savings and loan association in Irwindale, Calif., said the limits on institutional depositors were more significant than the curbs on individuals' deposit insurance. He called the proposed changes in the deposit insurance "window dressing," adding, "They are attacking the wrong enemy."
Richard D. Parsons, chairman of the Dime Savings Bank of New York, said the limits on individuals' insurance would be a difficult administrative task.
"This thing they are talking about creating is a nightmare," he said. "I am not sure that it is going to be practical at an operational level."
 
Cost-Benefit Analysis
 Regulators concluded last week that a systemwide limit of $100,000 an individual might cost as much as $1 billion to enforce.
"We wanted to make sure that the benefits offset the costs," said an Administration official who spoke on the condition that he would not be identified.
The official said there was very poor data on the impact of the proposed restriction or more severe limitations.
"It has been very, very difficult to determine how much can be saved by limiting the coverage," he said.
The official added that less than 6 percent of the nation's households have more than $100,000 in the nation's insured banks, savings associations and credit unions.
 
Diversification Encouraged
 In its plan, the Administration will also propose the elimination of laws going back to the Great Depression that prohibit the mergers of investment banks and commercial banks and also sharply limit interstate banking. It will propose the repeal of a law that bars industrial enterprises from owning commercial banks.
Administration officials say these changes will permit banks to diversify and become more profitable, and thus fewer will have to rely on assistance from the bank insurance fund. They also hope that such measures will make banks more attractive to investors.
The plan also substantially modifies the current policy of rescuing all depositors, no matter how large, at banks that officials consider too big to fail, by placing the decision primarily in the hands of the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve Board, instead of the F.D.I.C.
The too-big-to-fail policy, which has been strongly criticized by lawmakers who say it is unevenly applied, was most recently invoked last month with the failure of the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks. The F.D.I.C. has estimated that those three failures will ultimately cost the bank insurance fund at least $2.3 billion, which would make it one of the most expensive bailouts in history.

HEADLINE: Poland Asks West to Cancel Most of Its Big Foreign Debt

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Asserting that Poland deserves favorable treatment because it is a pioneer in moving toward a market economy, Poland's new Prime Minister called on Western creditors today to forgive 80 percent of his nation's $46 billion in foreign debt.
In his first major speech before a Western audience, Prime Minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki also promised to speed up Poland's already-rapid transition to capitalism, saying he hoped to privatize thousands of small businesses and hundreds of industrial enterprises in the next few months. 
 Speaking in this Swiss ski resort at the World Economic Forum, which brings together government and corporate officials from more than 50 countries, Mr. Bielecki pledged to remove obstacles to foreign investment, but he said his nation's huge debt was certain to slow growth and investment.
"This debt is a major destabilizing influence," he said. "It badly affects the climate for investment, particularly for foreign investment."
The 39-year-old Prime Minister welcomed a decision in principle by the Group of Seven industrial nations two weeks ago to reduce Poland's debt. But he said he was dissatisfied with the 40 percent reduction figure mentioned by the Finance Minister of France, Pierre Beregovoy.
The extent of the reduction is a matter of intense negotiation. Mr. Bielecki thanked the United States for leading the fight among industrial nations to cut Poland's debt.
Officials close to the negotiations said France was the main opponent of debt reduction of more than 40 percent. French officials say this would create a troubling precedent, since Western nations have agreed on a 33 percent debt-reduction ceiling for poor African countries.
In an interview today, Mr. Bielecki asserted that if Western officials followed their policy of giving debt relief on a case-by-case basis, Poland deserved special treatment.
"Poland is a unique example for Central and Eastern Europe, especially for the Soviet Union, that it is possible to make the transition from one system to another," he said in fluent English.
Mr. Bielecki, who is gray-haired and bearded and who ran a business consulting firm before President Lech Walesa named him Prime Minister, added that Poland also led the way in establishing a new political order in Eastern Europe.
 
Aiming for March
 Mr. Bielicki said it was extremely important to have a debt-reduction agreement by late March, when a moratorium allowing Poland to suspend debt payments is scheduled to end.
Polish officials say $30.9 billion of their country's foreign debt is owed to Western governments, principally to Germany. Another $10.6 billion is owed to commercial banks and $2.4 billion is owed to the Soviet Union and other members of the old Soviet trading bloc. The other debt is to miscellaneous creditors.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University professor who has advised Poland on its economic changes, said in an interview here that few if any countries deserve more favorable treatment on debt relief than Poland.
Professor Sachs said that Poland's economic problems and debt burden were huge. To cure the economic woes left by Communism, Poland began a program of shock therapy a year ago that involved eliminating most subsidies to industry and consumers, eliminating the Government's budget deficit and slashing the growth of the money supply.
 
Suport for Entrepreneurship
 Mr. Bielecki was one of the main speakers at the weeklong forum here, and his speech today was in many ways an ode to entrepreneurship.
"Our intention is to move to a market economy as fast as possible," he said. "That is the only way of giving hope to the young."
He said that one difference between his economic policies and those of his predecessor, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, was that he would put far more emphasis on the privatization of shops, restaurants and other small businesses. These moves, he said, are essential for creating a middle class, which "will be the natural supporter of economic change."
He said he had no plans to expand Poland's safety net for the one million unemployed, saying they would be encouraged to start businesses and find jobs themselves. "We have to unleash Poland's natural entrepreneurial spirit," he said.
Mr. Bielecki also outlined an extensive program to privatize large companies and create a sense of efficiency-minded ownership by distributing vouchers to the public for buying stock and by setting up mutual funds and other institutional investors.
The Prime Minister said he hoped that Poland would be accepted into the European Community by the end of the century.

HEADLINE: Frohnmayer Approves Environmental Project

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts has announced that he has changed his mind and will approve a $10,000 grant to an artist for an environmental project.
The grant to the artist, Mel Chin, had been recommended by both the endowment's grant-making panel and by the National Council for the Arts, but the chairman, John E. Frohnmayer, said in November that he would overrule the two groups. 
 Unlike other grants that have roiled the endowment for the past year and a half, Mr. Chin's proposal does not involve sexuality or nudity. Instead, he proposes to collaborate with a Department of Agriculture research agronomist on a project using plants that absorb toxic metals to clean a waste site.
Mr. Frohnmayer's reversal was made known on Saturday at a meeting of the National Council for the Arts, which is appointed by the President to advise the endowment, as it returned to its customary low profile this weekend to discuss council policy and review almost 1,000 grant recommendations.
 
Respite From the Turmoil
 Over the past 18 months the council's quarterly meetings have been the scenes of emotional debate as members wrestled with how they could insure the future of the arts agency and comply with legislative restrictions on Federal financing of the arts.
But this two-day gathering was more a time for philosophical reflection and inquiry, as 18 council members discussed new Congressional requirements and approved $27 million worth of grants in the fields of arts education, design, visual arts, folk arts, music, dance, theater, museum and media arts.
At its last meeting, panel members expressed disappointment that Mr. Frohnmayer had not consulted with them before rejecting their recommendation of Mr. Chin's project. In reversing his decision, the chairman said that he originally felt the application "didn't adequately articulate what the project was about," and had asked that it be resubmitted.
"It's important that an application be written in a way that clearly articulates artistic merit and how that artistic merit is going to be accessible to the public," he said.
 
The Dwindling Pie
 In his opening remarks on Friday, Mr. Frohnmayer also spoke of the "severe disconnects in art funding around the country" and pointed to sharp cuts in arts support by many states during the current recession.
Ed Dickey, the endowment's director of states programs, told of recommended cuts of 40 percent in Texas, 56 percent in New York and 75 percent in Virginia and Massachusetts.
"Every one of those dollars represents human aspirations and goals," said a council member, the theater director Lloyd Richards. "The artistry of this country is being affected in a very major way."
Another council member, Roy M. Goodman, the Republican State Senator from Manhattan, said, "We must dispel the illusion that there is a Federal offset for this lost money."
 
Larger Share to the States
 He was referring to the fact that when Congress voted in October to extend the life of the arts endowment for three years, it increased the amount of money the endowment gives to the states to distribute to 27.5 percent from 20 percent. This has meant a decrease of nearly $12 million in grants the endowment itself can award to artists and arts organizations. In fiscal 1992, that figure will rise to 32 percent.
As the council heard reports from representatives of state councils from Ohio, Arizona and South Carolina against the Government's shift of more money to states, council members pressed them to lobby Congress to reverse the redistribution. "You have the political clout to reverse it," said Wendy Luers, a council member. "We don't."
The most provocative discussion was prompted by the painter Helen Frankenthaler after a presentation by the panel on visual arts programs when she questioned whether the demand for cultural diversity and social consciousness in grant giving was subverting the criteria for artistic excellence.
 
The Question of Quality
 "There's a sameness throughout," she said. "What happened to art that isn't video or performance art? Part of our responsibility is to make culture the loftiest ideal for the nation and this other thrust has lost sight of what used to be a major concern."
Roger Mandle, the deputy director of the National Gallery of Art, argued the two were "not mutually exclusive" and during the 40-minute discussion other panel members such as the composer David Baker and the choreographer Arthur Mitchell weighed into what many panelists later described as the most stimulating exchange the council has experienced in months.
"You don't like this work, you disagree with their version of quality and that is O.K.," Harvey Lichtenstein, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, told Miss Frankenthaler, "but I object to the fact that you denigrate the work of these artists and say it is not really quality work when we have a panel and people of stature who agree these artists should get grants."

HEADLINE: Frank Rose, U. of Alabama Chief During Racial Turmoil, Dies at 70

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Frank Anthony Rose, the president of the University of Alabama from 1958 to 1969, the era when it was peacefully desegregated, died Friday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 70 years old and had homes in Washington and Lexington, Ky.
He died of cancer and pneumonia, a family spokesman said. 
 With tact and diplomacy, Dr. Rose acted as the middleman in the June 1963 confrontation between Gov. George C. Wallace and the Justice Department of the Kennedy Administration. The university president, who described himself as neither a segregationist nor an integrationist but a realist, had vowed to help insure obedience to the laws and peace on the campus.
So when the Alabama Governor stood defiantly in front of a campus door and raised a hand against federalized troops, but stepped aside moments later, two black students were enrolled without further incident.
 
Raised Faculty Pay and Morale
 In his 11-year tenure at the university, Dr. Rose increased the faculty and its pay and morale, raised tens of million of dollars in research funds, tightened academic standards, expanded the graduate departments and helped build football teams that won national championships.
A 6-foot-2-inch Mississippian, he excelled as an administrator, fund-raiser and university spokesman rather than as an academician, and was popular with business leaders and politicians. When accused of stressing sports over scholarship, he replied simply, "Character is not built by a losing team."
Dr. Rose left Alabama in 1969 for Washington, where he founded and headed a not-for-profit consulting concern, University Associates, with clients that included black colleges. The company later merged with Cassidy & Associates, a public affairs concern, and he remained a senior consultant.
Frank Anthony Rose was born in Meridian, Miss., on Oct. 16, 1920. His father died when he was 10, and early on he picked cotton at 50 cents a day and later plowed fields and drove soft-drink trucks to earn money to go to Transylvania College in Lexington, Ky., where he earned bachelor's degrees in philosophy and divinity and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
 
A College President at 31
 He taught at the college while preaching as an ordained minister in the Disciples of Christ. At the age of 31, he became president of Transylvania, serving for seven years until he accepted the presidency at Alabama. He was awarded honorary doctorates by more than a dozen universities.
Over the years, Dr. Rose held many advisory posts with groups like the Salk Institute for Biological Studies; the White House committee on education and minority affairs, and the governing boards of Georgetown University and its medical center, the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Christian Church Foundation.
Surviving are his wife of 48 years, Tommye; two daughters, Susan Dabny of Lexington and Elizabeth Rose of Pensacola, Fla.; two sons, Frank Jr., of Mobile, Ala., and Julian, of Dallas; a brother, Ramon, of Dallas, and eight grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Helping Hostile Cultures Touch

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
Richard Sennett is a man who likes to ramble, both intellectually and on foot. In his new book, "The Conscience of the Eye: The Design and Social Life of Cities," the widely published and much-debated New York University sociologist takes the reader on several walks through New York City, commenting along the way on the lack of community, the separation of misery and wealth, and the absence of "a telling moment of talking or touching or connection."
Speaking at his home in Greenwich Village the other day, Mr. Sennett pursued the point. "Americans are particularly good at flight," he said. He had in mind the flight to the suburbs, the resistance to racial integration, the retreat from those who are socially or economically different, the campaign in higher education for cultural separatism, and other evasions that Americans have contrived to avoid the challenge and promise of a genuinely multi-cultural society. 
 These practices, said Mr. Sennett, who is 48 years old, have led to disharmony at home and the tendency "to measure the reality of the world by what we know immediately," a short-sightedness he regards as "disaster for us."
"The Conscience of the Eye" is Mr. Sennett's sixth work of nonfiction (he has also written three novels), and it seems as certain to be as provocative as its predecessors, which include "The Fall of Public Man" (1977) and "Authority" (1980).
 
Profiting From Differences
 In the past, Kenneth Keniston, the Yale professor of psychology who is one of Mr. Sennett's champions, praised him for exhibiting "a refreshing willingness to deal with contemporary American society on its own terms rather than in strained analogies to 19th-century capitalism or to 20th-century colonialism."
On the other hand, the critic Anatole Broyard, who generally admired Mr. Sennett's work, once called him down for being "sometimes lyrical instead of empirical," and J. H. Plumb, the Cambridge University historian, witheringly deplored "The Fall of Public Man" as being filled with "too much fashionable intellectual jargon, too little depth of thought."
"What I'm trying to get at in this book," Mr. Sennett said of "The Conscience of the Eye," "is the way you create a culture in which strangers can live together and profit from their differences. We can't go backward in time. We're an international society. Here in New York, 40 percent of the people who live in the city were not born in the United States. In that way, New York is a microcosm of the world. I tried to make all this very local and particular in terms of New York in the book, but I think the problem is a national one and indeed will become a European problem when the national borders open up in 1992."
 
'No Place to Hide Anymore'
 Mr. Sennett's descriptions of his strolls through the city are accompanied by a discussion of ideas about urban life from a variety of esoteric thinkers: the Renaissance clockmaker Isaak Haprecht and the 17th-century geographer Hickeringill, to name just two. He sweeps back and forth through cultural history and the contemporary scene, using as intellectual springboards such disparate matters as how the development of iron cannonballs affected the growth of cities, how recognition scenes in Dickens and Flaubert express contrasting kinds relationships between strangers, and how a Balanchine ballet and Mark Rothko's chapel in Houston inspire the kind of "turning outward" essential to meaningful city life.
All the while, he is pressing his thesis that the design of modern cities is an expression of the "fear of exposure." In place of that, he argues, the city must come to exemplify what Baudelaire called "the willingness to lose oneself in the world's confusions," in the author's paraphrase.
Asked whether he considered his thesis utopian, Mr. Sennett said: "There's no place to hide anymore. You can't hide in the suburbs because the problems of the city have now caught up with them. Furthermore, when you hide from other people, you deprive yourself of some of the essential experiences that you need to be a human being. The effect of hiding shows up in your failures to cope with the world."
"If we were a province, we could have an individualist culture," he continued, "but we are a superpower. What I think this book tries to do is identify a cultural necessity. The problem of sharing territory in the city reflects that larger necessity: how to share our differences."
 
The New Tribalism
 "Probably what we'll see in the next 20 years is that about 40 percent of the American economy will be foreign-owned," he continued. "That means we're being internationalized, like it or not. There's no way to go back to the world of Ronald Reagan, to a willfully simple society. The thing that bothers me is that I don't think our cultural ideas -- I mean the idea that there's shelter, the idea that culture is something uniform rather than made of mixed parts -- accord with the economic and political realities that we have to deal with."
"Furthermore," he said, "a lot of what we say about multi-culturalism is really a new form of tribalism. Especially on the left, people say, 'We're different from you, so leave us alone.' And that, to me, is more America, more cultural separatism. Teaching multi-culturalism is not just teaching about different cultures, but teaching about where cultures connect. My book tries to imagine how hostile cultures can touch rather than withdraw from each other. And what I would like to see us do in city planning is think about how you bring cultural differences together."
"For me," he said, "this is a kind of hopeful book. I wanted to think about New York not as a sinkhole of poverty and racial conflict, but as a city whose problems are symbolic of all cities. How can people who don't share much share the same territory?"
 
In Arendt and Baldwin
 Mr. Sennett said he considers himself a protege of the political philosopher Hannah Arendt, who died in 1975.
"I met Arendt when I was a student at the University of Chicago," he recalled, "when I came up to her after a class in the history of art and explained that I would have to withdraw from the course. I had my cello with me, and she liked that and convinced me not to withdraw. Then she flunked me. That's how we became friends."
In "The Conscience of the Eye" Mr. Sennett praises Arendt for having recognized impersonality as a positive value, that being a clue to his vision of the future. "She was truly color-blind," he wrote, "as she became in a way blind to religion and to social class."
But the individual who pointed the way to the future most provocatively for Mr. Sennett was the novelist and essayist James Baldwin. "Baldwin's voice," he writes in "The Conscience of the Eye," "is that of someone who has learned how to speak to strangers, not in the polite tones of 18th-century civility, but instead more forcefully and directly." In Mr. Sennett's view, it is this "harsher" tone, exemplified by Baldwin's 1962 essay "The Fire Next Time," that will be the saving grace of the city of the future.

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security
adviser in the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The U.S., the recent victor in the 45-year-long cold war, has just become involved in a regional war. The outcome of that war might well determine whether the U.S. will enjoy the fruits of its global victory. Indeed, the outcome may decide whether the U.S. will be able to shape "the new world order," of which President Bush has spoken so often.
 Had the gulf crisis been resolved peacefully, with Iraq coerced into withdrawing from Kuwait by sanctions applied by the international community, a giant step toward a new world order indeed would have been taken. The rule of law would have been asserted through a collective but nonviolent response. 
But perhaps that was impossible. Even at the very last minute prior to the Jan. 15 deadline, Saddam Hussein spurned a French offer of a compromise (contrary to those, myself included, who thought that he would accept). Moreover, U.S. diplomacy during the crisis often conveyed the impression of being dedicated to the prevention of a diplomatic solution. It is regrettable, for example, that the American-Soviet statement of Jan. 29 was not issued exactly two weeks earlier. Thus we will never know if a nonviolent policy could have worked.
 The recourse to arms means that the ultimate military victory will be largely America's doing. But the parameters and the trajectory of war are inherently unpredictable. War triggers unforeseeable military dynamics and sets off massive political shocks, creating new problems as well as new opportunities.
 Hence, even as the guns still speak, it is not too early to focus on the twin challenges arising out of Mr. Bush's decision to go to war. First, what must be done to minimize the negative costs of the use of force? Second, what can be done to maximize the political benefits of an eventual U.S. military victory?
 Much depends on who exercises strategic control over the conduct of the war. Mr. Hussein's strategy is clear: to prolong and widen the conflict, transforming it into an American-Israeli war against the Arabs. The U.S., therefore, should seek to avoid a bloody ground war, fought for the goal of a total victory over Iraq. We should strive to limit our war aims to those set by the U.N. -- the restoration of Kuwait.
 The pursuit of the more limited aim should enable us to rely on a protracted air campaign designed to isolate Iraqi forces in Kuwait, to erode Iraqi military power and to inflict punishment on Iraqi industrial assets, while softening up the Iraqi defenses in Kuwait. And we should consider our mission accomplished if the Iraqis withdraw from Kuwait or if their forces there, surrounded and beleaguered, surrender.
 To be sure, Mr. Hussein may choose even then to continue to fight from the hinterland. But there is no point seeking to install a new regime in Baghdad. It would be better to subject his remaining forces -- deprived of any offensive capabilities -- to an enduring air harassment and punishment.
 This would leave Saddam Hussein humiliated, politically and militarily defeated on the issue of Kuwait, and with the country's industrial-military facilities in ruins. It would represent the second massive successive failure for his war policies, for his war with Iran produced nothing but suffering for the Iraqis. His political future would be very much in doubt.
 It is also important to remind ourselves that America's capacity to conduct a foreign policy that is responsive to our wider interests depends very much on our ability to avoid becoming deeply entangled as a protagonist in the Middle Eastern problems. The longer the war lasts -- especially if it becomes a ground war deep in Iraq -- the higher the regional and international costs for America.
 These costs can be broadly described as involving the following:
 A rise in regional instability and an intensification in Arab hatred for the U.S. Such feelings could be compounded by a global wave of sympathy for Iraq, which might increasingly be perceived -- particularly in the third world -- as the underdog. Ominous indications of this are surfacing in Egypt and elsewhere.
 Large-scale social disruptions in Iraq, but perhaps in the adjoining countries as well, caused in part by massive migrations of refugees, displaced persons and the homeless. The human suffering will be proportionate to the intensity and duration of the conflict. The transition from war to peace could also prove elusive, and the war could even spread.
 Protracted absorption of American foreign policy by the Persian Gulf and Middle East issue, to the exclusion of other important matters. America could become a bogged-down regional protagonist rather than the region's external mediator or arbiter. Moreover, cynical Europeans, convinced that all of history is derived from either perfidy or conspiracy, are already beginning to whisper about American-Soviet collusion: a free hand for America in the Persian Gulf in exchange for a free Soviet hand to crush the Baltic states. There was, in any case, the appearance of sacrifice of principle in the U.S. solicitation of Chinese and Syrian support for the action against Iraq.
 A decline in domestic support for military action and a rise in bitter domestic divisions. Large casualties will certainly undermine public support for the war. The sense of relief generated by America's victory in the cold war could easily degenerate into ugly recriminations, intensified perhaps by domestic economic difficulties.
 It follows that, even as we wage a controlled war and not a total one, the President should take the lead in articulating an agenda for America that looks beyond this regional war and responds also to the opportunities inherent in our recent victory in the global cold war. He should do so regarding three central issues that deserve national attention.
 First, the President should make more explicit America's longer range role in the Middle East. He should recommit America to a sustained and energetic effort to create a security framework for the region, one which truly takes into account the security needs of all parties. An Israeli-Arab peace settlement has become a necessity, and its attainment must become an explicit objective of American foreign policy, to be sought with the same degree of Presidential commitment with which we rebuffed Mr. Hussein's original aggression.
 An important component of any peace settlement has to be a wide-ranging economic recovery program, designed not only to undo the ravages of war in Iraq and Lebanon but to promote some degree of redistribution of wealth within the region. Otherwise, the spirit of vengeance and intransigence will dominate the Middle East to an even greater extent than ever, and with America now part of the problem and not the solution.
 Second, America must refocus its attention on what is happening in the post-Communist and the still-Communist world. Events there are likely to be more decisive for our future history than the tragic events in the Persian Gulf.
 Nevertheless, the Administration appears to cling to its preoccupation with Mikhail Gorbachev, while appearing to be much less concerned than the Europeans with either the fate of the Baltic countries or the growing difficulties of the post-Communist transition in Eastern European. It could not even bring itself to link the postponement of the summit meeting to the Soviet mistreatment of the Lithuanians and Latvians. There are also some ominous parallels here to the situation that prevailed in 1956 -- when the Anglo-French invasion of Suez diverted attention from Moscow's crushing of the Hungarians.
 Fortunately, the analogy to 1956 falls short in one important respect: This time, genuine political life exists in the Soviet Union. Accordingly, the U.S. should relate more directly to the democratic forces within the Soviet Union, especially the non-Communist governments of several of the non-Russian republics. And it should make some gestures of support, particularly for such political leaders as Boris Yeltsin. It should also place on the international agenda such matters as the Soviet suppression of the Baltic states. All this may temporarily worsen relations with Mr. Gorbachev but, in the long run, will promote democracy where it truly counts.
 Moreover, more of an effort needs to be made to address the conceptual problems in the transition to democracy. Internal tensions in Eastern Europe are likely to mount in the course of 1991, and there is a growing sense that the West, and especially America, are insufficiently responsive to the social and economic costs that the pursuit of freedom entails.
 Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungry are all watching with amazement as America plows tens of billions of dollars into the Persian Gulf war or as rewards for countries that support the American position in that war. Without a more deliberate American, European and Japanese engagement in Eastern Europe's complex transition from totalitarianism to democracy, it is quite likely that the democratic experiment will run into increasing difficulties. Ultimately, it could even fail.
 Third, the time has come for a post-cold war program of domestic renewal of America's socio-economic structure. Even a cursory comparison of many aspects of American life -- from education to roads and bridges, not to speak of crime and social injustice -- with the more advanced countries of Europe yields depressing conclusions. America's victory in the cold war was not without painful social costs.
 It is tragic that the Administration might end up spending as much as $50 billion on a regional war, with perhaps another $10 billion to $20 billion in payoffs to Israel, Egypt, Turkey and others -- and yet is seemingly unable to initiate a comprehensive and ambitious effort to respond to our domestic shortcomings.
 As the war progresses and passions mount, Mr. Bush will be under increasing pressure to shift from limited to total war aims. It would be a bitter historical irony if America thereby were to lose sight of its wider and longerrange interests. The victor in the cold war, instead of shaping a new world order, would thus become the entangled victim of an endless regional conundrum.

HEADLINE: Business Groups Fight Laws In California on Wage Scales

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Several communities in the San Francisco Bay area have enacted what labor lawyers say are the nation's first local laws that specify the wages to be paid to employees of private businesses.
Alarmed business groups, fearing that such laws will become a nationwide trend, are seeking to have them struck down in court. That action has set the stage for a highly emotional battle between the business groups and labor unions, which support the laws and stand to benefit from them. 
 The ordinances require that workers on private construction projects be paid what is called the prevailing wage. That wage, determined by a state agency, is usually close to union wages.
Prevailing-wage laws have been applied to Federal and some state public works projects, starting with the Federal Davis-Bacon Act in 1931. But the ordinances in the Bay Area are the first in the nation to cover private construction projects.
The difference in wages can be striking. A study commissioned by construction unions showed that on one project nonunion workers were paid an average of $12.39 an hour, including benefits, while the average prevailing wage would have been $27.97. And in an affidavit filed in one of the lawsuits challenging the laws, the president of a company that provides maintenance and repair service for industry said that under prevailing wages he would have to pay $25.03 an hour, including benefits, to workers who now receive $11.37.
Supporters of the laws argue that they prevent businesses from using low-paid, poorly trained workers who pose a workplace safety hazard and do construction of poor quality.
"If someone thinks that all you do is hire someone off the street and they know what they are doing, that's not the way it works," said Robert Gilmore, business manager for the Building and Construction Trades Council in San Mateo County, which is immediately south of San Francisco.
Often, he and other supporters say, such workers are brought in from other parts of the country in migrations reminiscent of "The Grapes of Wrath," overloading local schools and hospitals and hurting the local economy.
Union officials concede that the laws help the unions. While the ordinances do not require union labor, the fact that high wages must be paid removes a big incentive for private businesses to use nonunion workers.
 
Business Groups' Argument
 Business groups argue that the laws, in addition to raising their labor costs, represent an unwarranted and unconstitutional intrusion into private businesses by local governments.
They fear that the ordinances might become an important new tool for labor unions, which can enlist the help of sympathetic local politicians to insure more employment for union workers.
"It's really a use by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. of the political process to attempt to force what they cannot gain through collective bargaining," said Rosemary M. Collyer, a Washington lawyer representing the United States Chamber of Commerce, a business lobbying group.
 
Size of Projects a Factor
 Prevailing-wage laws affecting private projects have been passed in the last two years by San Mateo County and by three cities in that county -- South San Francisco, San Bruno and Belmont. These laws apply to residential, commercial and industrial construction projects above $250,000, although residential developments of four homes or less are exempted. In August, Contra Costa County, across the bay from San Francisco passed a law that applies to industrial construction projects of $500,000 or more.
Now, other communities in California are considering such ordinances, and business groups fear the laws will spread to other states. In Dade County, in Florida, a prevailing-wage law took effect in January that applies only to public projects but that business groups see as an unfavorable precedent.
"It looked like it was beginning to snowball and we needed to take it on," said Willie Washington, manager of human resources for the California Manufacturers Association, a lobbying group.
 
Court Challenges
 The association, along with two business groups in Contra Costa County, filed suit in state court against the Contra Costa ordinance, arguing that the state minimum-wage law prohibited localities from regulating wages. The Chamber of Commerce group has filed a suit in Federal District Court in San Francisco against the same ordinance.
The San Mateo, San Bruno and South San Francisco ordinances are being challenged in court by the Golden Gate Chapter of the Associated Builders and Contractors Inc., a trade group representing mainly nonunionized building contractors.
The business groups argue that there is no evidence that lower-paid workers have more accidents or do shoddier work. They also say the laws are pre-empted by Federal laws, like the National Labor Relations Act, that specify terms for collective bargaining and worker benefits.
 
Lobbying Group's Statement
 "The ordinance would not only frustrate collective bargaining; it would emasculate it," the Chamber of Commerce group said in papers filed in the case. "By dictating wage levels and employer payments for health benefits, welfare benefits, pensions, travel time, vacation, subsistence pay and apprenticeship contributions, the ordinance will nullify the terms of any contrary collective bargaining agreements."
The Shell Oil Company and the Unocal Corporation, both of which have refineries in Contra Costa County that are affected by the ordinance, say that the law would cause widespread confusion by forcing them to pay their employees two different wages. Their workers, who are represented by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, would get their usual wage when they were running the refinery and the prevailing wage when they were doing maintenance or construction work.
In its suit, the building contractors' association asserts that by placing unreasonable restrictions on developers, the laws represent an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.
Supporters of the laws argue that local government has a legitimate claim to such regulation. "Our basic position is that protection of health and safety and protection of the quality of construction are traditional areas of local regulation," said Thomas R. Adams, a San Mateo lawyer representing the construction unions.
Mr. Adams said prevailing-wage laws were appearing now because localities in California, and to some extent in the rest of the nation, were asserting greater control over local development. These controls include requiring developers to provide amenities like parks and child care centers in their projects.
 
Round Won by Law's Supporters
 While the Federal cases have not yet been decided, the unions have won a round in state court. In November, a Superior Court judge, James J. Marchiano, upheld the Contra Costa ordinance, saying state law does not specifically bar a locality from passing wage laws.
The Contra Costa ordinance has attracted the most attention because unlike San Mateo, Contra Costa has many large industrial plants including a steel mill, refineries, petrochemical plants and pulp and paper companies. The plants' owners -- among them Chevron, Dow Chemical and Gaylord Container -- have considerable political and economic influence.
Despite that, the companies were powerless to derail the ordinance, which was pushed through by local unions that capitalized on a public furor incited by USS-Posco Industries, one of the large companies.
In 1987, USS-Posco, a joint venture of the USX Corporation and the Pohang Iron and Steel Company of South Korea, began a $400 million renovation of an aging steel mill near the city of Pittsburg, Calif., using a nonunion contractor.
 
Deaths on the Job Fuel Campaign
 Confronted with one of the largest nonunion projects in the state's history, unions began a fierce campaign. When two construction workers died on the job, the unions quickly charged that the project was using untrained workers, resulting in unsafe conditions.
Another factor also played into the hands of the unions. The contractor, a joint venture whose main partner was BE& K Construction of Birmingham, Ala., brought in hundreds of workers from other parts of the country, who sometimes lived in their cars and whose families crowded local schools and hospitals.
"It was kind of like 'The Grapes of Wrath' of the construction industry," said Greg Feere, business manager and secretary-treasurer of the Contra Costa Building and Construction Trades Council, an umbrella group of construction-related unions.
John R. Gibson, director of modernization for USS-Posco, said the construction work was of high quality and that it was only speculation that the fatal accidents would not have happened had higher-paid workers been used. He said the nonunion contractor had been chosen because it bid about $50 million less than the lowest union contractor.
"Had we not made this decision, I'm not sure we would have had a project," he said.

HEADLINE: Europe Has Its Share Of Airline Problems

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Airlines in the United States are not the only ones reeling from the Persian Gulf war. Uncertainty and a fear of terrorism generated by the conflict have also severely depressed the business of European airlines, which like American carriers had already been hit hard when fuel prices soared last year after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Slowing economies in Europe, especially in Britain and Sweden, have also hurt the airline business. All told, major European airlines are reporting that the number of passengers has dropped 10 to 30 percent, and they have been cutting domestic and international service accordingly. 
 According to the 21-member Association of European Airlines, international flights within Europe were only 35 percent full in the last week of January. Lufthansa's planes have been flying 40 percent full on average since the war broke out, down from 60 percent. Late last month, London's two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, reported passenger traffic down 24 and 19 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
Some carriers, including Scandinavian Airlines System and Air France, have announced plans to delay or cancel plane orders, although Air France said it made the decision before the war broke out. S.A.S. has also announced plans to reduce employment by 3,500, or 15.9 percent, by the end of 1992.
Olympic Airways, owned by the Greek Government, said it would have difficulty staying in business if the industry remained depressed for long. "For the time being, we are surviving, but who knows about the future," said Mark Xenakis, Olympic's assistant director general. He said Olympic had lost $67 million since the gulf crisis began in early August.
Besides Olympic, other airlines that might have trouble surviving in their current form include Alitalia of Italy, Sabena of Belgium and Iberia of Spain, said Richard Whitaker, editor of Airline Business, a trade magazine based in Sutton, England.
The European airlines' troubles have raised questions about whether the European Community will slow its program aimed at increasing competition and reducing state subsidies. "That's the big unknown today," said Andrew Chambers, a London-based analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd.
Most of the major European carriers are either completely or partly state-owned, and many were struggling even before the gulf crisis. These include Alitalia, Sabena, Iberia, Air France and, to a lesser extent, Lufthansa of Germany.
While the 21 carriers in the Association of European Airlines earned a total of $1.1 billion in 1989, the group undoubtedly suffered an operating loss in 1990, its first since 1981, said David Henderson, the association's manager of statistical information.
Mr. Whitaker wondered how many governments would be willing to continue to pour money into their national carriers. If the losses become too great, "it may change people's minds as to whether every country should have a flag carrier," he said.
The Belgian Government has already indicated its intention to reduce its stake in Sabena S.A., parent of Sabena Belgian World Airlines, to 26 percent from about 54 percent. The Government wants the company to find outside investors.
 
Sabena Deal Collapsed
 A deal that would have given British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines each a 20 percent stake in the Sabena airline fell apart in December. At that time, Sabena said it expected its airline to lose as much as five billion Belgian francs ($158.3 million) in 1990.
Industry executives and analysts say that if the difficulties persist, some airlines will urge the European Commission, the community's executive branch, to ease its opposition to state subsidies and to permit big carriers to cooperate in ways that might seem anti-competitive.
The community has already taken steps to allow more competition in fares, but some industry executives would undoubtedly like to see delays on other planned actions. These include changes in the system for allocating landing and takeoff rights that could take rights away from big carriers, and opening international and domestic markets to much more competition.
"We don't think there will be any substantial delays or changes" in the deregulation program, said David Burnside, a spokesman for British Airways, which has generally been one of the strongest industry supporters of deregulation.
Carel Paauwe, the Amsterdam-based head of the transportation practice of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, said the pace of deregulation would not slow very much unless the downturn dragged on and threatened the survival of some big airlines. "If one or two were really in danger of going under, then I think governments would have second thoughts," he said.
 
Hiring of Pilots Is an Issue
 Airlines would like to see cuts in airport fees, which are much higher in Europe than in the United States. They have also urged the commission to delay communitywide limits on how many hours pilots can fly and to make it easier for a carrier in one country to hire pilots in other nations where salaries are lower, said Stephen Wheatcroft, a London-based industry consultant and former executive at British Airways.
The major European carriers that have been the most profitable are British Airways, which has been investor-owned since 1987; KLM, which is 38 percent owned by the Netherlands, and Scandinavian Airlines System, which is half-owned by the Governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. But after being stung by the leap in fuel prices and the plunge in the number of passengers, analysts think that even the relatively efficient airlines are operating in the red.
British Airways, Europe's biggest carrier, said it expects to report a loss for the second half of its current fiscal year (the six months that end March 31). In reaction to the sharp downturn in business, it has cut its global service by 10.5 percent on average. The airline had previously announced it was abandoning service between Britain and the Irish Republic, beginning in March.
 
Talk of Layoffs
 Before the war broke out, British Airways had announced plans to cut costs by at least 100 million ($197.7 million) by the end of 1991. While it originally said these plans would not involve large layoffs, reports in British newspapers say the airline now has contingency plans to lay off up to 5,000 workers, or 10 percent of its work force. A spokesman would neither confirm nor deny those figures. The spokesman said no layoffs were imminent but the airline might have to resort to such action.
British Airways has told employees they can take up to three months of unpaid leave. To encourage that, it has offered to give free tickets to employees and their families to anywhere the airline flies if the employee takes at least one month off.
The airline has delayed until spring its plans to order planes to replace its fleet of 25 Lockheed Tristar and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jetliners. It had planned to place the order by the end of last year.
Scandinavian Airlines System aims to cut its costs by three billion kronor ($540.1 million) by the end of 1992. S.A.S., which says the number of passengers has fallen by 20 to 40 percent, depending on the route, is cutting its flights by about 15 percent, said John Herbert, an S.A.S. spokesman. S.A.S. executives have said the airline probably broke even in 1990.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said last week that it would drastically cut service to European and United States destinations. The carrier will cut its capacity within Europe by 20 percent by canceling and combining flights and using smaller aircraft. Nine of KLM's 49 destinations in the United States are being dropped.
 
Cutbacks at Air France
 Air France has cut service in Europe but would not say by how much. In the week of Jan. 15-21, the week the Iraq war started, its traffic was down 16 percent from a year earlier. Even before the war, Air France had imposed a freeze on most hiring and announced plans to reduce or eliminate service on unprofitable routes.
The company, which also owns two smaller French carriers, Air Inter and Union des Transports Ariens, has delayed by one year the delivery of seven long-range Airbus 340's, which it was supposed to receive in the 1994-96 period. It has also delayed the delivery of six other planes it has options to buy and canceled options on seven other planes.
Lufthansa has cut 120 of its 1,000 or so flights to destinations in Europe, mainly within Germany, until at least Feb. 27. While Lufthansa is not contemplating layoffs, it is talking with worker representatives about reducing overtime, encouraging employees to take leftover vacation now and moving up training. Lufthansa executives say the airline will report a small profit for 1990 as a whole because traffic rose sharply in November and December as a result of German reunification.

HEADLINE: Accounting Board Staff Cut

 BODY:
The Financial Accounting Foundation said yesterday that it would shut its two-member Washington office and dismiss four employees at its Norwalk, Conn., headquarters because of cost pressures.
"It is a move made strictly for reasons of economy," said Joseph LaGambina, the foundation's executive vice president, who estimates that the moves will save about $225,000 a year. Though the cuts will not solve the $1.4 million deficit projected for 1991, the foundation has "no plans at this time to make further personnel reductions," he said.
The foundation, which relies heavily on contributions from companies and accounting firms for its financing, runs the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Government Accounting Standards Board. The two groups make most of the accounting rules for the private sector and for state and local government, respectively.
On Jan. 24, Mr. LaGambina disclosed that the foundation expected to report its third consecutive deficit once its 1990 results became final and that the organization would run deficits through 1995 unless its trustees acted to reverse those trends.
Mr. LaGambina said the foundation expected to cover the Washington scene from Connecticut.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Lower in Light Trading; Crude for March at $21.14

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices slipped in light trading yesterday as the market continued to show restraint about war in the Persian Gulf and to react primarily to issues of supply and demand.
"Prices just kind of drifted lower," said Peter C. Beutel, an oil analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. 
 Crude oil for delivery in March settled at $21.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 20 cents from Friday.
"Continuing high levels of Saudi and OPEC production and exports are putting the markets on a bit of the defensive," Mr. Beutel said. He also cited a "lack of shocking news" about the war or other world events for the market's moderation.
"People are continuing to move away from the psychological factors, and back to supply and demand," he said.
In London, North Sea Brent blend crude settled at $19.77 a barrel, down 5 cents a barrel, on the International Petroleum Exchange.
Mr. Beutel said the prices for March delivery of heating oil and natural gas slumped as unseasonably warm weather covered much of the central and Northeast portions of the nation.
Heating oil for March fell 0.48 cent, to 61.72 cents a gallon, although the price rose for contracts for delivery in May and later months.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Government Risk;
To Insure S.& L. and Bank Deposits, $88 Billion

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
A leading element in the $281 billion deficit that the Bush Administration projected today in the budget for the 1992 fiscal year is the $88 billion that planners say may be needed for the insurance that protects depositors in banks and savings and loan associations.
And given the poor state of the economy, what budget experts find even more worrisome is the far greater cost that could result if there was severe trouble in a variety of Federal programs that provide insurance, housing aid, financial assistance and other credit to farmers, veterans, students and many other categories of Americans. 
 Indeed, a large section of the budget issued today was devoted to discussion of the Government's "underwriting risks."
That section notes that among other things, the amount of Federal credit, credit assistance and insurance totaled $6.2 trillion at the end of the last calendar year, an increase of 8 percent from a year earlier and 113 percent from a decade earlier. With the decline of the nation's economy, and with credit remaining tight in many regions, the Government has become increasingly exposed to the risk of large losses from defaults in these programs.
"About half of all non-Federal borrowing," the budget says, "is assisted by Federal credit programs, Government-sponsored enterprises or Federal deposit insurance."
 
Savings and Loan Outlook
 For the savings and loan industry, the Administration has asked Congress to approve $76.1 billion for the 1992 fiscal year, on top of $84.6 billion that has already been spent since the Federal bailout of the industry began in 1989. Of the $76.1 billion to be spent next year, the Government hopes to recover about $47 billion when the assets of failed savings and loan associations now in Government hands are sold.
For banks, the White House estimates that "at least" $25 billion in increased contributions will be needed over the next five years to insure the solvency of the fund that protects deposits. The budget sent to Congress today forecasts that without the start-up of an increase in these contributions, which to this point have come entirely from the banking industry, the bank insurance fund managed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will be in the red by next year.
The Administration continues to hope that the industry can keep financing the fund alone and that a taxpayer bailout can be averted. Government officials have been meeting with bankers to come up with a plan that would completely rely on industry money, but no such plan has yet emerged.
"Reform is urgent," the budget says. Such reform will be proposed on Tuesday, when the Treasury Department announces its long-awaited recommendations for overhauling the banking system. The proposed changes, previously reported, would permit the merger of investment banks and commercial banks, eliminate restrictions on interstate banking and allow industrial enterprises to own banks.

HEADLINE: Spanish Town Is Largely Unmoved by B-52's

DATELINE: MORON DE LA FRONTERA, Spain, Feb. 2

 BODY:
The dark, bristling tails of 15 giant B-52's look strangely out of place against a backdrop of olive groves, green wheat fields and scattered cows. And except when the long-range bombers roar down the runway, the entire area is wrapped in silence.
But the isolation of the Moron air base, 250 miles southwest of Madrid and 15 miles from the nearest town, is apparently one reason why it was chosen by the United States and Spain as a staging post for B-52 bombing missions against Iraq. 
 Although the bombers have reportedly been flying out of here for at least 12 days, it was only three days ago that news of the operation broke in the Spanish press. And the Government still refuses to acknowledge Spain's distant role in the Persian Gulf war.
Reporters are banned from entering the huge air base, which was built here with American money in the 1950's, but a quiet country road comes within half a mile of the runway. At one point, a B-52 took off, the sound of its engine echoing for minutes as it seemed to head east toward the gulf.
The noise of the bombers does not reach the nearby town of Moron de la Frontera, but the increased militaryactivity at the base was soon reported back by the 30 or so locals who work there. They say that the number of military workers at the base has jumped from around 400 to 3,000.
While the presence of the B-52's in Spain produced headlines in Madrid, it has stirred little interest here. "We live mostly with our backs to it," Paco Guardado, the town's Deputy Mayor, said of the base. "We're not linked economically." In contrast, large antiwar demonstrations took place this weekend outside the Torrejon air base near Madrid and the Rota Naval Base on the southern coast, both of which have been used to provide logistical supportfor American forces in the gulf.
Although the United Left coalition is the only party to oppose the drive to evict Iraq from Kuwait, public opinion in Spain is strongly critical of the Government's decision to send three warships to the gulf region to help enforce the trade embargo against Iraq.
The Popular Party, the main conservative opposition party, has also attacked the Government for not making public its decision to allow B-52's to carry out raids on Iraq from here.
In Moron de la Frontera, some residents are beginning to recall the anti-American feelings stirred by the construction of the base over 30 years ago. The complaint then, though, was not political, but rather about the rowdiness of American soldiers who would visit the town.
The town's indirect involvement inthe gulf war, on the other hand, is stirring concerns about Spain's relations with the Arab world, not least because Moron de la Frontera, as a frontier town between Christian Spain and the Muslims who held southern Spain until 1492, became a symbol of coexistence between the two cultures and religions. "There is less sympathy toward the Americans than toward the Arabs today," said Julian Velez, a literature professor.
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, however, has shown no sign of wavering in his decision to allow the B-52's to fly from here. News of the bombing raids prompted the Madrid daily El Mundo to headline an editorial: "They have deceived us. We are at war." But citing "security and efficiency," the Government continued to refuse to discuss the issue publicly.

HEADLINE: Cuomo and Florio Paths Converging on Budgets

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 4

 BODY:
A year ago, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York seemed to be the two faces of Democratic politics.
Mr. Florio was seen as the bold one, jamming sweeping tax increases through a reluctant State Legislature and revamping aid to education. He seemed to act first and worry about the political fallout later. 
 Mr. Cuomo, in contrast, was the careful one. He treated the state's fiscal problems gingerly, searching for ways to avoid both spending cuts and dramatic tax increases. At all times, he seemed keenly aware of the political pitfalls he was facing.
But having traveled in opposite directions for the last year, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio today find themselves, somewhat surprisingly, moving closer together. Last week, when the two Governors presented bad-news budgets to their legislatures for the next fiscal year, some of the similarities between the plans were striking.
 
'In This Soup Together'
 Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio tried to extract substantial savings from state unions. Both sought to sell off state assets to muster much-needed cash. And both stressed the need for streamlining state government and making its operations more efficient in recessionary times.
"To a certain degree, they're both in this soup together now," said George Sternlieb, professor emeritus of urban and regional planning at Rutgers University.
To be sure, the differences between Mr. Cuomo's situation and Mr. Florio's are still stark. New York is facing a budget gap that, by Mr. Cuomo's estimates, totals $6 billion, or more than 20 percent of the tax revenues the state expects to collect.
This gap between expected revenues and spending plans, partly a result of the recession afflicting the entire Northeast, is also a result of policies pursued by Mr. Cuomo during his eight years in office. Last year, for example, the Governor used more than $1.5 billion in "one shot" revenues, including reserve funds, to balance his budget. These "one shots" filled a significant portion of the budget gap for the current fiscal year; somehow they must all be replaced for next year.
New Jersey is facing far less dire fiscal problems; its budget gap for the coming fiscal year is estimated at $800 million, or roughly 6 percent of the state's total revenues. The relatively modest size of the shortfall is largely a result of the enormous tax increases that Mr. Florio imposed last year. These included higher sales taxes and a sharp rise in income-tax rates for wealthier taxpayers.
 
Similar Forces at Work
 "As a straight budget matter, Florio's going to have a much easier go, because he got a head start," said Paul Dickstein, a former budget director of New York City.
Yet despite the fiscal differences, similar political forces are at work in the Empire and Garden States, and they have pulled Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio in similar directions.
"Florio and Cuomo started from different positions," said Steven D. Gold, of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York. "But now we've had a convergence of the two states' tax systems. Right now, both Governors have proposed very serious budget cuts, including large numbers of layoffs."
As a result of the tax increases imposed by Mr. Florio last year, New Jersey, which historically was a low-tax state, has taken substantial steps toward becoming a high-tax state. New York has long had a higher tax burden than the average state, and it has stayed roughly even.
In both states, November's election was widely interpreted as a signal of voters' antipathy toward high taxes. This year, new taxes are regarded on both sides of the Hudson as a political anathema.
Mr. Florio, whose popularity has reached almost record lows, proposed no new taxes in the budget he announced last week, and it is widely agreed that new taxes are politically off limits for New Jersey officials this year.
Mr. Cuomo, fresh from his third gubernatorial victory in November, is not as politically vulnerable as Mr. Florio. In his budget presentation last week, he proposed a 10-cents-a-gallon increase in the gasoline tax and a delay in an income-tax cut scheduled for later this year. But while these tax proposals are substantial, totaling more than $1 billion, their size is dwarfed by the state's tremendous fiscal problems.
Both Governors proposed substantial spending cuts last week. And one of the prime targets was state workers, who are increasingly being portrayed as the enemy of government efficiency.
In New Jersey, Mr. Florio not only proposed laying off 2,400 state workers, but also recommended that the state renege on salary increases already included in current state contracts.
 
'New Kind of Democrat'
 In New York, Mr. Cuomo proposed laying off 7,000 workers, and set aside no money for raises for state workers whose contracts expire in March.
"I think what you're seeing is a new kind of Democrat who casts himself much more as a man of business who is not afraid to stand up to unions," Professor Sternlieb said.
Looking for ways to drum up cash without taxes, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Florio last week both proposed elaborate schemes for selling off state assets. Mr. Cuomo wants to sell Aqueduct race track to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for $208 million. Mr. Florio would like to unload some state roads onto the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in return for a payment of $400 million.
Improved efficiency has become a popular slogan in this time of shrinking government resources, and it was invoked frequently in Trenton and Albany last week. Mr. Florio proposed merging 19 state departments into 16. Mr. Cuomo proposed eliminating dozens of offices and commissions.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S., Allies Join in Buying The Dollar

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve and the central banks of the United States' major economic allies bought dollars in the foreign exchange market yesterday in an apparent effort to support the weakening currency and to signal that economic cooperation among the allies was still in force.
But the exact motivation for the concerted dollar buying was not completely clear. Instead of a primary concern about the dollar, the intervention could have been aimed at weakening the German mark and easing the downward pressure also being exerted on European currencies in the European Monetary System following the increase in German interest rates last week. 
 Or both goals could have figured in the intervention decision, possibly reflecting the first glimmer of a consensus that a continued decline of the dollar and rise of the mark is not good for the long-term health of the world economy.
 
'Restore Credibility'
 Traders were agreed, however, that the dollar buying by 10 central banks, including most European central banks, was an effort to offset the belief among many traders that the United States and its allies were having trouble cooperating economically. This belief was enhanced by the rate increase by Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, on Thursday, a decision that ran against America's economic interest and that of Germany's allies in the European Community.
"I think they were trying to restore credibility to the Group of Seven," said James T. McGroarty, senior vice president of Greenwich Capital markets in Greenwich, Conn., referring to the United States and its six main economic allies, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Joining in the intervention were Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands,
The dollar, which had fallen at the beginning of trading, rallied some after several rounds of dollar buying yesterday, but did not make up the losses. Its course from here will depend on how much longer central banks keep buying dollars and selling marks and what happens to interest rates. Some traders said the dollar buying would have to continue for some time to have any major impact on the dollar and other currencies.
In late trading yesterday, the dollar was at 1.4629 marks, a new post-1948 low but up from the 1.4570 level at which traders said the intervention began. The dollar closed at 1.4680 marks Friday, the previous low for the dollar. Against the yen, the dollar closed at 130.58, up from its daily low of 130.30 but down from 131.50 on Friday.
Some traders and economists said the dollar buying was aimed at preventing a sharp fall of the dollar after the Bundesbank raised two of its key interest rates a half a percentage point Thursday and the Federal Reserve cut its discount rate and moved to push down its Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge for overnight loans, by a similar half a percentage point Friday. It was the first round of major intervention since the central banks moved to stop a dollar rally last March.
Combined, both interest rate moves should weaken the dollar by making it less attractive for foreign investors. Since beginning to fall last summer on the expectations of lower interest rates in the United States, the dollar has already set several new record lows against the German mark and the Swiss franc and moved closer to post-World War II lows against other currencies.
But traders also pointed out that the dollar had not fallen very much on Friday or much more yesterday, when the intervention started.
This fact led some analysts, like Nicholas Sargen, director of bond research for Salomon Brothers in New York, to conclude that the aim of the move was to ease tensions in the European Monetary System, in which nine currencies are basically linked to the mark in set trading ranges.
Because of the strictures of the system, a rise in German rates combined with weakening currencies would make it very difficult for countries like France, England and Italy to lower their interest rates to stimulate their economies. For this reason, French officials, who want to lower rates, have been pushing for cooperation for a stronger dollar.
Mr. Sargen said that if the Bank of Japan, which was closed when the dollar intervention began yesterday, joins the dollar buying, he would think the aim of the effort might be broader.
In this case, the concerted and coordinated intervention shows that the United States and its allies finally may be focusing on some common reasons for stopping the decline of the dollar and the rise of the mark. Such a convergence of purpose, if it emerges, would be similar to the consensus that was finally reached in 1985 and led to the coordinated effort to knock the dollar from its then record highs in an effort to trim the United States trade deficit by encouraging foreign purchases of United States goods.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rally Continues in Treasury Issues

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved higher and interest rates dipped again yesterday, continuing the big rally on Friday. Interest rates on the three-month and six-month securities auctioned yesterday fell to their lowest levels in nearly three years.
A drop in the value of the dollar, which fell to new lows against the German mark despite concerted efforts by major central banks to prop it up, had no visible impact in the credit markets. 
 Despite the firm tone, dealers expressed some caution about the Treasury refunding auctions, especially the $11 billion sale on Thursday of new 30-year bonds.
"The market is in excellent shape, but right now prices are the richest they have been in over a year and we are facing the biggest auctions ever," one government bond trader said.
"It all comes down to distribution," the trader added. "If the Street ends up owning a lot of this paper, especially the bond, the market will go down. And I think that some accounts will balk at buying bonds with a yield of just 8 percent."
While worries linger about the market's ability to absorb longer-term securities, demand for short-term Treasury bills was strong at yesterday's weekly auction.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.97 percent, down sharply from the 6.22 percent average rate a week ago. It is the lowest rate on a three-month bill since the auction of April 25, 1988.
Bids on the new six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 5.94 percent, down from an average rate of 6.28 percent last week. It is the lowest rate on a new six-month bill since the sale on March 14, 1988.
The $34.5 billion refunding auctions begin today, with the sale of $12.5 billion worth of new three-year Treasury notes. On Wednesday, $11 billion of new 10-year notes are expected to be sold.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 3-year notes were offered at a price to yield 7.00 percent. The 10-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 7.82 percent. And the 30-year bonds were offered at a price to yield 8.01 percent.
The extremely weak employment data released on Friday, coupled with moves by the Federal Reserve Board shortly after to cut both the discount rate and the overnight Federal funds rate, virtually insured success for the refunding auctions.
But money managers said that bond yields might have to back up a bit to attract bids.
"A lot of money managers have been sitting on the sidelines, due to the war," said James Kochan, chief of fixed-income money management at R. W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. "I think you will see very good support for the refunding if yields back up. And I don't think it will take much of a retreat to generate support for these issues."
Analysts said the Federal Reserve appeared to confirm that it has moved its target for the Federal funds rate to 6.25 percent, from 6.75 percent.
Yesterday, the Fed drained reserves from the banking system at a time when the funds rate was trading at 6 3/16 percent.
"I looked at the transaction as confirmation they are at 6.25 percent," said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
 
Dow's Rise a Concern
 The rise of one-tenth of a point in January unemployment, to 6.2 percent, re-emphasized the problems facing the economy, but some credit market participants said the stock market's recent rise -- the Dow Jones industrial average rose another 41.59 points yesterday -- was a source of concern. If the downturn is as pronounced as many in the bond market believe, stock prices should be going down, not up, they said.
Elliot Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said there were sound reasons why the stock and bond markets were rallying simultaneously.
"If we are in a mild recession, I don't think it is inappropriate for both markets to be moving together," he said. "Like the bond market, the stock market had been very much undervalued because of the Mideast crisis. And both markets are looking at better inflation prospects."
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 107 30/32 late yesterday, up more than 1/2 point, or more than $5 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.04 percent, down from 8.08 percent late Friday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 104 10/ 32, up 10/32, to yield 7.85 percent. And the 7 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 3/8, up 1/32, to yield 6.79 percent.
Issuance of new corporate debt was heavy again yesterday, following up on Friday's hectic pace, when 17 companies priced issues.
Among the issuers yesterday was the Union Camp Corporation, which offered $125 million worth of 20-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by the First Boston Corporation.
The 9 1/4 percent securities, which mature on Feb. 1, 2021, were priced at $100, or par, 1.22 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
The McKesson Corporation offered $100 million worth of seven-year notes. The 8 5/8 percent notes, which mature on Feb. 1, 1998, were priced at $99.50 to yield 8.721 percent, one percentage point above the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing. Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated A-2 by Moody's and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues rose by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
A late announcement that the General Motors Corporation had slashed its dividend had little impact on prices of outstanding General Motors securities, the traders said.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about 1/4 point, according to market participants.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Bond Rating For New York Holds Steady

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In a sign of confidence in New York City's plans for confronting its fiscal problems, the Standard & Poor's Corporation yesterday removed its "credit watch" on the city's bonds and reaffirmed the city's A- bond rating, which had been in jeopardy since last fall.
But Standard & Poor's, one of the nation's major credit-rating agencies, warned that the city still faced deep economic problems and said the bond rating could yet fall if the Dinkins administration should choose to balance its budgets with a combination of bond refinancing and wage deferrals, which would produce cash now while costing money later. 
 "If that happens, the rating will go down," said Hyman Grossman, a managing director of the rating agency. "The city understands that."
The city has already negotiated wage deferrals with some workers, and has discussed the possibility of refinancing bonds, though warily.
But so far, Mr. Grossman said Mayor David N. Dinkins and other city officials "are in the process of meeting the challenges in the fiscal-balance question in a fairly reasonable fashion" that justified maintaining the current rating.
Mr. Grossman said that "there are very few gimmicks" in the administration's plans to close a budget gap of $500 million for the fiscal year that ends June 30 and more than $2 billion for the following year.
City officials expressed pleasure and relief, since a lowered bond rating would force them to pay more in interest on the money they borrow for long-term projects. The city has been planning a regular bond sale of more than $1 billion for sometime this month, and city officials said the sale would proceed soon. "I think it's great," said First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel. "We're pleased to be recognized for the fiscal prudence we have repeatedly demonstrated."
Standard & Poor's had placed the city on the credit watch Oct. 9, after a tumultuous week of fiscal news, in which Mr. Dinkins announced a 5.5 percent wage settlement with teachers, a major anticrime plan and, finally, the need to lay off as many as 15,000 city workers. Since then, the city has updated its budget, cutting services to cope with growing shortfalls, proposing hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes and holding scores of meetings with the financial community in an effort to keep the bond rating stable.
Though the city has won that battle for the moment, it is facing more problems because of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to cut at least $400 million in state aid.
Mr. Grossman said his agency uses the "credit watch" as a temporary classification for periods from three to six months, while deciding whether to change the rating. He said it had affirmed the rating now as part of its annual review. The other major credit agency, Moody's Investors Service, has not changed its A rating on New York City's bonds.
Standard & Poor's decision to affirm the current rating was a major reward for Mr. Dinkins's efforts, but its warnings for the future were equally clear.
"We're certainly not out of the woods," said the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael. "We know that there's a lot of work in front of us."
Mr. Grossman said the rating agency was willing to accept the possibility of wage deferrals that might be needed to finance the city's labor settlements. But he said it could not tolerate the combined effects of such deferrals and major bond refinancings that could defer borrowing costs into the future.
Mr. Michael and Mr. Steisel said they were aware of Standard & Poor's concerns about bond-refinancing deals under discussion that could produce one-time cash infusions but longer-term costs. Several proposals have been under discussion for some time, but Mr. Michael said the city would approach such a transaction very cautiously.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: Proposals;
Winners and Losers: How Bush's Plan Would Affect Domestic Spending

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Here are President Bush's budget proposals for major domestic programs in the 1992 fiscal year:
 
Health
The President proposes spending of $525 billion, up 8 percent from the level in the 1991 fiscal year. Adjusted for inflation, the increase would be 3 percent. (Other increases listed here are not adjusted to account for inflation.) 
 Health and human service programs account for more than a third of the entire Federal budget, mostly because they finance Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The proposal reflects a cut of at least $23 billion in Medicare, which pays for the health care of 33 million elderly and disabled Americans.
Programs to prevent disease received the most attention in this year's proposals. Increases will be sought for breast cancer screening, immunization for measles and other childhood diseases, infant mortality prevention in the cities where it is highest, screening for lead poisoning, prevention of tuberculosis, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases other than AIDS. For AIDS, almost no extra money will be sought in 1992.
 
Agriculture
Although the overall farm spending request is being held almost flat, around $55 billion, the Administration seeks a substantial increase for the food stamp program, the largest component of the agriculture budget.
The 1992 food stamp proposal is $19.7 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over the 1991 estimate. But with the latest increases in unemployment, even that may be too low. The Administration says it may ask for $200 million to $1.5 billion more; agriculture officials say the decision will be determined by economic circumstances later in the year. The maximum food stamp benefit for a family of four is expected to reach $370 a month, an increase of $18 over the maximum benefit in 1991.
Another major change in the farm budget is a sharp increase in projected spending for export subsidies to fight those of the European Community, which is selling commodities at discounts to get rid of growing food stocks. The budget seeks $1.2 billion in the 1992 fiscal year for the Export Enhancement Program, about $300 million more than projected spending in 1991 and nearly four times what was spent in 1990.
 
Transportation
With a proposed increase of 6 percent over its 1991 budget, to $33.6 billion, the Department of Transportation is seeking its largest increase in spending authority since 1985. Highway spending would rise 4 percent and urban mass transit spending 3 percent.
The Administration wants to broaden the scope of its highway program while shifting some of the costs to the states. Under the budget plan, the Federal Government would maintain an interconnected system of "national highways," 150,000 miles of roads of the greatest significance, including the 43,000-mile Interstate system. Other national highways would be selected after consulting with the states. The idea is to bring those roads up to the standards of the Interstate system.
The department's budget also includes $485 million for Amtrak. This is the first time in seven years that the department has requested an increase for the federally subsidized passenger rail service.
The Federal Aviation Administration would receive $4.5 billion, a 10 percent increase. The new money would permit the hiring of 450 new air traffic controllers and 100 aviation safety inspectors, among other personnel.
 
Education
The Administration proposes spending $29.6 billion for the Education Department, an increase of $2.5 billion, or about 9 percent, over the fiscal year 1991. Most of the new spending would be part of a coming legislative proposal that could be modified by the newly named Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, who awaits Senate confirmation.
One closely watched proposal would set aside $200 million for grants to local school districts and states that provide parents with a choice of schools for their children, including private and parochial schools.
The department also proposed changing the structure of the Federal education scholarships known as Pell Grants to direct them more toward students from poorer families. The maximum grant would increase to $4,200 for students whose families earn less than $20,000 a year; families making more would qualify for lower sums.
 
Cities and States
Total proposed spending by the Department of Housing and Urban Development is down slightly from the 1991 level, to $25.6 billion from $27 billion. Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp said the decrease did not signal less emphasis on public housing, but rather a cut in planned spending for programs like mortgage insurance.
Mr. Kemp said the budget for new housing programs would actually increase, from $15.3 billion to $17.5 billion. Much of the new money would be used to help public housing tenants buy their homes, he said, adding that H.U.D. was also asking for $918 million extra in its 1991 budget for that purpose.
The Administration plans to reduce the Community Development Block Grant program by $300 million, from $3.2 billion, and to channel the grants through the states rather than giving them directly to the cities. Officials of cities have expressed dismay at that idea.
 
Energy
The Administration requested $18.6 billion for the Department of Energy, $900 million more than this year's level.
Programs to improve technical research and education would receive considerably more money. Funds for fundamental scientific research would increase more than 15 percent, to $2.67 billion from $2.31 billion. Much of the increase would go to the Superconducting Supercollider, a giant particle accelerator to be built in Texas. Spending on it would increase from $242.9 million to $533.7 million.
Almost half the Energy Department's budget, $8.1 billion, would go toward the system of production factories, laboratories and testing sites for nuclear weapons. For the first time in decades, the budget for producing nuclear warheads would shrink, to $2.71 billion from $2.88 billion. Similar cuts are proposed in the manufacture of nuclear materials for bombs, dropping the budget in that program to $1.87 billion from $1.95 billion.
 
Space
The Bush Administration continued its support for the space program by seeking $14.7 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, an increase of $1.2 billion that would include starting a new family of rockets to lift heavy payloads.
NASA and the Air Force would be authorized to spend $175 million each to develop a new launching system by the end of the decade. The rocket system, which would take over some of the work of the space shuttle and the current generation of disposable rockets, would eventually cost about $10 billion.
The Administration also proposes almost $2 billion to continue development of a space station. Congress has ordered that the station be redesigned and scaled down before its first elements are put into orbit in 1995. The budget also includes almost $1 billion, a 24 percent increase, for NASA's "Mission to Planet Earth," part of an effort by several agencies to study global environmental change.
 
Environment
Environmental programs fared relatively well in the President's proposal, with the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget rising from $2.1 billion in the fiscal year 1991 to $2.33 billion in 1992.
The plan would provide extra funds for the E.P.A. to carry out the far-reaching amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress last year. The Administration also wants to spend more money to protect ecological systems like the Great Lakes and coastal areas, and to expand its scientific research, particularly into the causes and effects of global warming.
The Interior Department's budget would provide more money for protection and rehabilitation of national wildlife refuges and national parks, with emphasis on preserving Civil War battlegrounds. In all, the department's proposed outlays in 1992 are $8.7 billion, up from an estimated $8.5 billion in 1991.
 
Justice
The Justice Department is seeking a budget of $10.6 billion, a 14 percent increase over 1991. A significant part would go to enforcement of laws on drug trafficking and white-collar crime, notably prosecution of fraud in connection with the savings and loan industry.
Deputy Attorney General William P. Barr said part of the department's drug strategy was to place more resources in smaller cities and rural areas, which he said had not been given enough attention.
The task force of Federal agencies trying to break sophisticated international trafficking organizations would receive an increase of 20 percent, from this year's level of $335 million.
The department is seeking $1.74 billion to operate the nation's prisons. The Federal prison population, which was 25,000 in 1981, is now about 60,000 and is expected to rise to 100,000 by 1995.
 
Arts and Humanities
The Administration proposes to spend $833 million for activities that contribute to "preserving America's heritage." This is an increase of $65 million, or 8.5 percent, over 1991.
Proposed increases include 15.5 percent for the National Gallery of Art and 14.8 percent for the Smithsonian Institution. The only Federal agency whose proposed budget remains unchanged is the National Endowment for the Arts, at $174 million. The President proposes that the National Endowment for the Humanities receive $178 million, an increase of nearly 5 percent, with a special emphasis on the agency's educational programs.
In the past the arts endowment has received more money than the humanities endowment, but the gap has narrowed in recent years. This is the first time the Administration has offered a larger budget for humanities.
The budget request of $357 million for the Smithsonian includes $16.3 million for the new National Museum of the American Indian.
 
Labor
Amid signs of a deepening recession, the Labor Department has requested a $178 million increase for the administration of the unemployment insurance program. The department is also asking Congress for $100 million more in the current fiscal year to run the unemployment benefits program nationwide. Under current budget rules, that $100 million increase would have to be offset by cuts in other domestic programs. The benefits paid to the unemployed are financed by state taxes, but the program's administrative costs are the responsibility of the Federal Government.
 
Research
The Administration is proposing to spend $71.3 billion for research and development, an 8 percent increase, with the greatest amount, more than $42 billion, going to military research. The $71 billion is divided among the budgets of a number of departments, including Defense, Energy and Health and Human Services.
The National Science Foundation, which devotes 70 percent of its budget to nonmedical basic research at colleges and universities, would get a 13 percent increase, to $1.9 billion. The basic research budget of the National Institutes of Health would be increased 6 percent, to $4.6 billion.

HEADLINE: A Proposal To Limit F.D.I.C.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In an apparent slap at the nation's senior banking regulator, L. William Seidman, the Bush Administration will recommend that his agency lose its authority to supervise banks, senior Government officials said today.
The recommendation would strip the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of its role as a regulator of the nation's more than 12,000 banks, but the agency would continue to insure deposits. The recommendation is scheduled to be announced on Tuesday, when the Treasury Department discloses the details of its long-awaited proposal to Congress to overhaul the banking system. 
 It has already been disclosed that the proposed legislation will include a plan that permits the mergers of investment banks and commercial banks, eliminates barriers to interstate banking, alllows industrial enterprises to own banks and imposes some limitations on bank insurance coverage.
 
Political Strength
 Mr. Seidman's strong standing on Capitol Hill as head of the F.D.I.C. was acknowledged less than two years ago when he was named the chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, putting him in charge of the day-to-day administration of the bailout of the savings and loan industry. He continues to enjoy strong support in Congress, which may doom the Administration's proposal to reduce the F.D.I.C.'s power.
Last summer, long-simmering disagreements between Mr. Seidman and some senior officials at the White House led to a move to try to put pressure on him to retire before his term expires in October of this year. Mr. Seidman has said he intends to leave before the end of his term but he has never set a departure date.
The tart-tongued Mr. Seidman had particularly upset the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, when he ridiculed a proposal to have bank customers pay insurance premiums based on the size of their accounts. Mr. Seidman called the idea a reverse-toaster theory, alluding to some banks' practice of giving gifts to new customers.
As chairman of the F.D.I.C., Mr. Seidman has authority over more than 12,000 banks, although the largest ones also fall under the scrutiny of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates bank holding companies, and the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates nationally chartered institutions.
The F.D.I.C. is, however, the sole Federal regulator of about 7,500 state-chartered banks. Under the Treasury Department's plan, the supervision of state-chartered banks receiving Federal insurance coverage would be shifted to the Federal Reserve Board. And the Fed and the Comptroller would share authority over bank holding companies, depending upon whether their subsidiaries are state or federally chartered.
Mr. Seidman said in an interview this evening that he did not want to comment about the proposal until he had a chance to study it. He has long argued for a single independent regulator of the nation's banks and savings and loans.
"If what they are proposing is an insurance agency that has no power to protect the insurance fund, then they're asking for trouble," he said. "But I don't think they are trying to personalize their policy to fit any feelings they may have about me."
 
A Clash Is Expected
 Some industry experts said a battle between Mr. Seidman and the Administration was virtually assured.
"I'd be amazed if Seidman doesn't fight this," said Kenneth Guenther of the Independent Bankers Association, which represents community banks.
The Treasury Department is expected to say on Tuesday that the measure is not intended as a slight to Mr. Seidman but is an effort to reduce the redundant layers of regulation.
 
A Limited Role
 Under the Treasury's proposal, the F.D.I.C. would be relegated to administering the deposit insurance program and protecting its fund from losses. It would have access to the confidential bank reports prepared by examiners and would be able to investigate banks if it received permission from other regulators working under the Treasury Department.
The Treasury Department's plan also calls for the creation of a Federal Banking Agency from the merger of the Comptroller's office and another agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was created by the 1989 bailout legislation to regulate savings associations. The new entity would be a division of the Treasury Department.
In effect, the proposal would have two regulators of banks and savings and loans: the new agency within Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
Most of the ideas presented in the regulatory reorganization to be proposed on Tuesday were initially suggested in 1984 by a task force on the regulation of financial services that was led by George Bush, who was then the Vice President.
 
A Surprise Move
 Mr. Seidman continues to exert considerable influence in Washington, and the decision to try to take away much of his authority comes as something of a surprise.
Last week he scored an important victory when he persuaded Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady not to propose severe restrictions on deposit insurance, which now covers all accounts up to $100,000.
Administration officials had told industry representatives that they were preparing to recommend that coverage be limited to one account per individual of up to $100,000 systemwide, in addition to a second retirement account of up to the same amount. The proposal was opposed by Mr. Seidman, who said it would drive money away from many banks, particularly smaller ones.
Late last week, the F.D.I.C. sent a study to the Treasury Department that estimated that enforcing such a proposal could cost as much as $1 billion annually.
 
Limiting Coverage
 The report was described by Treasury officials as a major factor in persuading Mr. Brady to abandon the strict limitations in favor of a proposal to limit insurance to one account of $100,000, plus one retirement account, at each bank where a depositor has money.
The Administration's plan will call for the elimination of a loophole in the current restrictions that allows an individual to get coverage of more than $100,000 at a single bank by using various types of joint accounts.
Mr. Seidman has been on the defensive in recent weeks, as both the White House and the Congressional Budget Office have issued reports estimating that the F.D.I.C. fund that insures bank deposits will be insolvent within the next two years. Last week, he took issue with those forecasts, predicting that the fund would remain solvent, assuming the recession is mild.

HEADLINE: Productivity Flat Over All In 4th Quarter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The productivity of America's non-farm workers was practically unchanged for the fourth quarter, growing at an annual rate of one-tenth of 1 percent, but for the year it fell eight-tenths of 1 percent, the worst decline since 1982, the Government said today. Coupled with the 1989 drop of seven-tenths of 1 percent, it was the first back-to-back reversal in a decade. These figures are not seasonally adjusted.
Labor costs continued to rise as the tumbling economy forced businesses to trim working hours drastically in the final months of 1990, the Labor Department report showed. 
 "What we have here is the worst of both possible worlds -- the economy was sinking into recession at the same time labor costs were accelerating," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
 
Link to Standard of Living
 Increasing productivity, or getting more worker output per hour on the job, is considered vital to increasing the nation's standard of living without inflation.
But the latest figures, Mr. Jones said, show that the United States is continuing to lose its competitive edge in international markets and threaten a long-term reduction in living standards "unless one of two things happens -- either we sharply improve the quality of our labor force through education, or sharply improve savings and investment in new plants and equipment."
Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company, said: "Our ability to produce more goods and services does determine the pie that's available to us. That pie grew very slowly in 1990 and is going to shrink in 1991."
 
Hours Cut 2.7% in 4th Quarter
 The report showed that during the final three months of 1990, the nation's businesses trimmed the working hours of their employees at an annual rate of 2.7 percent -- the largest falloff since the depths of the 1981-82 recession.
It was the second quarterly decline in the number of hours worked, a normal consequence of recession as businesses trim payrolls.
In the manufacturing sector, productivity declined at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the October-December period -- the largest drop since 1981. Meanwhile, factories trimmed their hours by 6.4 percent.
The decline in manufacturing hours was the steepest since the final quarter of 1982, when hours fell 8.6 percent, the Government said.
For all of 1990, manufacturing productivity increased 3.0 percent and hours worked fell 2.1 percent, the report said.
Meanwhile, unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price inflation, rose 4.3 percent for the year, well above the 3.9 percent increase of 1989. Hourly labor costs rose 3.5 percent for the year, also above the 3.2 percent increase of 1989.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: News Analysis
Tactics and Numbers;
A Budget Intended to Counter an Image Of a White House That Courts the Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In the budget they sent to Congress today, President Bush and his advisers tried to neutralize the strongest political point the Democrats have developed in the Bush Presidency: the argument that this Administration favors the rich at the expense of the poor and the middle class.
Mr. Bush reintroduced his pet proposal to cut the tax on capital gains, a measure that would mostly benefit affluent taxpayers. 
 But in an attempt to knock the Democrats off stride, the President offered several modest proposals to limit the Government subsidies that well-to-do people receive through Medicare, student aid, farm price supports, school lunches and payments to veterans' survivors.
In some instances the money, no more than a few billion dollars a year, would be redirected to the poor; in other cases the proposals would represent overall cuts in programs.
Democrats gained considerable advantage in last fall's budget negotiations by maintaining that a cut in the capital gains tax would result in a windfall for the wealthy. The portrait of the President as a patron of fat cats seemed to take hold to an unusual degree, and Mr. Bush's popularity fell sharply.
 
A Clear Political Goal
 Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, made no secret of the Administration's political goal in a television interview Sunday on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
"It will be somewhat ironic," Mr. Darman said, "if the Democrats, who are expressing concerns about fairness, are reluctant to reduce the subsidies for the wealthiest Americans."
At a news conference today, Mr. Darman conceded that the proposals reducing subsidies to the well-to-do were "relatively modest," noting that they were worth "only a small number of billions" of dollars.
"We thought, nonetheless, it would be valuable to get this issue of principle on the public agenda," Mr. Darman said, "to start the debate, to get at least a toehold here, and then, over time, presumably one could target even better on the poor."
Democrats expressed skepticism about the proposals and the motives, and the chances of enactment of any of them seemed slight given the Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee, accused the President of "wanting to target the wealthy elderly who are ill," while helping others with his cut in the capital gains tax.
 
The Main Proposals
 These are Mr. Bush's main proposals to limit Government subsidies received by upper-income Americans:
*Single Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes above $125,000 and couples with incomes of more that $150,000 would have to pay $63.60 per person more each month in premiums for insurance against doctors' bills and outpatient expenses. The monthly premium is now scheduled to be $31.80 a month next year. About 500,000 beneficiares out of a total of 33 million would be affected.
*Grants and loans to college students would be somewhat redirected so that a larger proportion would go to those from families with incomes of less than $10,000 a year, and the separate loan program for students studying to be health professionals would be rewritten so that only low-income students would be eligible.
*Farmers with nonfarm incomes above $125,000 would no longer be entitled to crop support payments.
*The rules for subsidized school lunches for elementary and high school students would be changed so that those from poor families would get more of a subsidy and those from well-off families would get less.
*The benefits paid to survivors of military personnel who die in the service or as a result of a service-connected injury or illness would be standardized at the level now paid to the survivors of staff sergeants. Under current law, the higher a person's rank the more benefits his survivors receive.
Poor families would get higher subsidies under changes in the student loan and school lunch programs, but changes in the other programs, while limiting subsidies to those with higher incomes, would not improve the benefits to the poor.
The President's capital gains proposal will probably stay on the shelf for most of this year. Mr. Bush virtually guaranteed that when he announced in his State of the Union Message last week that he had asked Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to head a group to study how to calculate the cost and benefits of such a tax cut.
 
The 'Fairness' Issue
 No deadline was given for the group to report its findings. But whatever the Greenspan group says, Democrats will surely resume their attacks around the "fairness" issue if Mr. Bush tries once again to push the capital gains issue in earnest.
Economists disagree over whether a lower capital gains tax -- the tax on profits from investments -- raises or lowers revenue and whether it helps the overall economy. But they agree that most of the direct benefits go to the wealthiest taxpayers, since they hold most of the investments.
The Congressional Joint Tax Committee has calculated that about two-thirds of the benefits of a lower capital gains tax would go to taxpayers with incomes above $200,000, and about four-fifths to those with incomes above $100,000. The average tax bill of someone with an income of more than $200,000 would be cut by $15,000.
The Administration's two other main tax proposals -- tax-free savings accounts and penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts to make the down payment on a first home -- would not be of much benefit to poor families.
But the proposals could put the Democrats on the defensive if they ever came to a vote. Still, given the nature of the Democratic Congress, the chances are remote that the measures will ever reach the stage where votes must be cast.

HEADLINE: Hills Department Stores Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Hills Department Stores Inc., the nation's fifth-largest discount retailer, filed for protection from its creditors yesterday after failing to gain approval from banks and bondholders for a refinancing plan.
Hills, which is based in Canton, Mass., and some of its affiliates made the filing under the Chapter 11 provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. 
 Hills operates more than 200 stores in 14 states, mostly in the Midwest, selling apparel and houshold items. It listed assets and liabilities of about $1 billion each as of Dec. 31, 1990.
The company is profitable on an operating basis but has been struggling to meet debt and interest obligations and has reported losses over the last year. Since 1989, it has undergone a $425 million refinancing, the signing of a $325 million working capital agreement and the acquisition of 33 Gold Circle discount stores in Ohio and New York from Federated Department Stores Inc.
 
Blocked by Creditors
 John C. Brouillard, Hills's president and chief operating officer, said in a telephone interview yesterday that the company had been unable to convince its creditors on a refinancing plan.
"We put forth a number of proposals but they had to meet the requirements of various types of creditors, and that's where we got bogged down," he said. He added that the company was also hurt by the weakened economy, strong price competition in electronics and appliances and disappointing sales at the Gold Circle stores.
"Our sales in those stores were under our plan," Mr. Brouillard said. "They catered to different customers in different markets from us, and we had difficulty adapting to that." As to competition, he added, "The economy was much more difficult than any competition we encountered."
Hills said yesterday that Chemical Bank had agreed to provide $250 million in "debtor in possession" financing. Under such financing, the lender becomes a creditor with high priority for repayment.
Mr. Brouillard said he believed that the loan would cover the company's current operating cash needs and that it would take the focus off the financial restructuring.
Last Nov. 26, Hills reported a 6 percent rise in sales, to $1.5 billion, in the nine months ended Nov. 3 over the corresponding period in 1989. But the company's losses grew to $36.1 million in the period, from a loss of $22.4 million in the comparable nine months of 1989.
That announcement coincided with the resignation of Stephen A. Goldberger as chairman, president and chief executive officer and the promotion to president of Mr. Brouillard, who had been executive vice president and chief financial officer.
Last month, Hills said it would close 28 of its 214 stores and would take a $125 million write-off in the fourth quarter, which ended last month. Yesterday, Mr. Brouillard said the final quarter would probably show an operating profit, but that there would still be a net loss compared with the quarter a year earlier.
 
Banks Owed Millions
 Hills's largest unsecured financial creditors and the sums they are owed are: the Bankers Trust Company, New York, $110 million; the State Street Bank and Trust Company, Boston, $91.9 million, as trustee under 14 1/8 percent senior subordinated debentures, and $51.2 million as trustee under 14 5/8 percent subordinated debentures; the Fleet National Bank, Providence, R.I., $86.6 million, as trustee under 13 1/2 percent senior notes, and the Westinghouse Credit Corporation, Pittsburgh, $50 million.
The two largest unsecured merchandise creditors are the Handleman Company, a supplier of recorded music and books in Troy, Mich., $7.1 million, and Hasbro Inc., a toy maker in Pawtucket, R.I., $3.26 million.
Hills's shares dropped 12.5 cents each, to 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday..
The Hills Chapter 11 filing followed a similar action last April by Ames Department Stores Inc., the country's fourth-largest discounter behind the K Mart Corporation, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and the Target Stores of the Dayton Hudson Corporation. Ames took on high debt and encountered financial difficulties when it purchased 300 Zayre discount stores and found that many were performing under expectations. But Ames recently reported that it had a profitable December.

HEADLINE: G.M. Cuts Dividend Almost 50%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation, citing war and a weak economy, slashed its dividend nearly in half today and announced cost-cutting measures, including reductions in its salaried work force and its capital spending plans.
G.M., the nation's largest car maker, was the first of the Big Three to trim its quarterly payout, dropping it by 46 percent, to 40 cents a share from 75 cents, but analysts predict that Ford and Chrysler will soon follow suit. 
 The domestic auto makers have faced slumping sales for more than a year. But recent falling sales caused by the war, coupled with the need to spend aggressively on new vehicles, have made money tight for all of them.
G.M.'s move is expected to save it about $840 million annually. The company pays about $2 billion a year to holders of its common stock.
 
Stock Down to $35.25
 G.M.'s announcement, after a board meeting in New York, came shortly after the New York Stock Exchange closed. Its shares slipped 87.5 cents each, to $35.25, on a day when many market averages surged to their highest levels so far this year.
Credit rating agencies have warned that they may downgrade the Big Three's debt securities, making it more expensive to borrow money, unless they conserve resources.
"For G.M. to be doing this with interest rates and oil prices on the way down, the company is saying, We're still not competitive with the imports, and this isn't going to be a short recession and business as usual when Saddam Hussein is defeated," said Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San Francisco.
 
Car Sales Off 21.2%
 For the first 20 days of January, G.M. car sales were off 21.2 percent, and some analysts expect G.M. later this month to post a loss of as much as $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter, which would be its biggest operating loss ever.
Robert C. Stempel, G.M.'s chairman, said directors remained confident of the company's "underlying financial strength and future prospects." But he said directors "felt it was imperative at this time to recognize the economic impact that the turmoil in the Middle East and the recession have had on consumer confidence, and on the highly competitive automotive markets, particularly in North America."
Mr. Stempel, stressing the need for General Motors to be more competitive, said he still expected the national economy to start recovering "sometime in 1991," But he said, "We cannot rely on an eventual economic turnaround alone to secure an adequate financial return for our stockholders over the longer term."
 
'Extremely Difficult'
 It was the first time G.M. had reduced a cash dividend since the second quarter of 1980, and only the third time in 35 years; Mr. Stempel called the latest cut "an extremely difficult decision."
G.M. also raised the dividend on its class E shares, representing the Electronic Data Systems Corporation subsidiary, to 16 cents a share from 14 cents; the auto maker retained the 18-cent-a-share dividend on its class H shares, representing its Hughes Aircraft and Delco Electronics unit.
For G.M.'s salaried automotive work force, totaling about 100,000 in North America, Mr. Stempel also had bad news. The company said it planned to cut 15,000 jobs during the next three years -- 6,000 this year and 9,000 in 1992 and 1993.
General Motors said it would try to accomplish the reductions through attrition and retirements "to the greatest extent possible" but did not rule out stronger measures like buyouts or dismissals.
Since 1986, G.M. has reduced its white-collar work force from about 133,000 to its current level.
Another part of G.M.'s cost-saving program will be substantial price reductions on components and materials that the company will be seeking from its suppliers. Robert T. O'Connell, the chief financial officer, said G.M. wanted by 1993 to cut $2 billion annually from component and material expenses that he estimated were $25 billion to $35 billion.
Mr. O'Connell said G.M. would provide engineering expertise to suppliers to help them reduce costs, and thus lower prices. But eventually the auto maker is seeking to deal with fewer suppliers on a longer-term basis, he said.
Harvey Heinbach, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, said, "Before they go out and ask for cuts from suppliers and employes, they are asking shareholders to share in the suffering."
 
Executives to Be Affected
 G.M. executives will not escape either. The company said it would not pay "incentive compensation in the form of restricted stock units" in 1990, the annual bonus that in some cases may exceed regular salary, "except in a few cases where modest awards were made to recognize outstanding results at selected subsidiary units." Mr. O'Connell said the exceptions did not include top executives. G.M. is also trimming its contributions to white-collar stock savings plans.
For the next four years, capital spending will be lowered by about $500 million a year, to about $7 billion annually, G.M. said. But the company said it would try to maintain its outlays on engineering expenses "in recognition of the importance of implementing G.M.'s aggressive forward product program."
But Mr. O'Connell conceded that some "minor programs" might be canceled. In the current year, G.M. plans to introduce nine new car and six new truck models.
 
Seeking More Efficiency
 While General Motors has been closing factories for several years to increase capacity utilization, no shutdowns are anticipated that have not been announced, Mr. O'Connell said. But G.M. will try to utilize its plants 100 percent, he said, and will seek to become more efficient, through such efforts as three-shift operations, an idea being tried in Europe. "We're discussing it with the union and we hope to get there," he said.
Mr. Stempel said G.M. had conducted "an intense review" of business practices and would pursue certain modern manufacturing techniques more aggressively. Among the highest priorities, he said, are "design for manufacture," which reduces cost and raises quality by designing parts that are easier to handle and assemble.

 	 	 		--------------------	 		 	 	
 
Ford Outsold in Europe

 
DETROIT, Feb. 4 (AP) -- For the first time, the General Motors Corporation has outsold the Ford Motor Company in Europe for a full year. G.M. said last week that it sold 1.56 million cars in Europe last year, and Ford said it sold 1.51 million. Some of Ford's problems involved the bumpy European introduction of the new Escort model, hampered by a seven-week strike at Ford of Europe's Halewood assembly plant in England.

HEADLINE: More Banks Cut Prime

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Several more American banks cut their prime lending rates by half a percentage point, to 9 percent, yesterday. They include Chase Manhattan Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Chemical Bank, Bank of New York and Mellon Bank. On Friday several banks, including Citibank, cut their prime to 9 percent minutes after the Federal Reserve dropped its discount rate to 6 percent, from 6 1/2 percent. The discount rate is the interest the Fed charges to member banks. When the rate is lowered, so are the banks' cost of funds, enabling them to trim the interest they charge.

HEADLINE: AMERICAN REVIVAL IN MANUFACTURING SEEN IN U.S. REPORT

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
In the last recession, America's aging industrial heartland was widely considered to be incapable of saving itself. But a Government report issued yesterday suggests that the Rust Belt has staged a renaissance on the factory floor.
Thanks to a wrenching contraction in payrolls and plants, manufacturing productivity -- the measure of output per hours worked -- climbed at a record rate from 1979 to 1990. Industrial productivity growth, which trailed that of the United States' trading partners in the 1970's, rebounded to equal their pace in the 1980's. 
 What is more, factories making everything from chemicals to computers now account for a robust 23.3 percent of the nation's gross national product, or the total cost of goods and services sold. According to the Commerce Department report, that figure is up from 20 percent in 1982, the post-World War II low, and matches the level of output achieved in the 1960's when American factories hummed at a feverish clip.
 
Economists' Differing Views
 "I am not surprised at what Commerce found," said Robert Lawrence, an economist at the Brookings Institution, who has argued that the United States manufacturing base had been revitalized in the late 1980's. "Fears of de-industrialization were overblown."
But Lawrence Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, who is regarded as the economist most responsible for getting the Government to conduct the remeasurement of manufacturing output, said yesterday: "I expected manufacturing's share to have shrunk. These partial revisions have rewritten history, but not as much as I expected. It is still my view that we have a competitiveness problem."
The implications of the Commerce Department report together with an analysis of factory productivity by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are that the nation's industrial base is better able to compete globally and participate fully in a rebound from recession.
Additionally, some analysts suggested that manufacturing never needed to be sheltered with costly subsidies or import protection. Indeed, one of the most striking occurrences in the last half of the 1980's was that the United States' share of exports by industrial countries rebounded. That share is now larger than it was in 1980, the previous peak year.
 
Implication for Trade Deficit
 The change is crucial because most economists agree that the best measure of competitiveness is how well a country's products perform in world markets. It also suggests that the dollar does not have to fall a great deal more for imports to decline and exports to rise and correct the chronic trade deficit.
The Government's report, which will be published in the latest issue of the Commerce Department's Survey of Current Business, remeasured the amount of goods turned out by United States factories during the last decade. It was undertaken in response to a long-simmering debate among some of the nation's leading economists. As the Reagan Administration heralded the recovery in the last half of the 1980's, some Democratic economists insisted that the Government's methods for measuring output yielded inflated results and misleading statistics about factory worker productivity.
Separately yesterday, the Government reported that overall productivity was flat for the fourth quarter of 1990 and down for the full year. Factory productivity, however, dipped in the fourth quarter but was up sharply for the year.
 
Previous Peak Reached in 1966
 The Commerce Department report showed that manufacturing shrank more in the early 1980's than had been estimated at the time but roared back to a level that matched the previous peak, reached in 1966.
A related report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that manufacturing productivity grew at a 3.6 percent rate during the 1980's, almost three times as fast as in the 1970's.
The Commerce report reflects a growing consensus among many economists that the long-term problem in the nation's economy is not dilapidated, inefficient factories but productivity growth among the white-collar serivce sector. Eight out of 10 United States workers are employed outside manufacturing, and stagnant productivity growth in those fields has lowered overall output. White-collar productivity was flat in the last decade..
 
Two Million Fewer Jobs
 Between 1979 and 1989, industrial production rose by more than a third, but the factory work force shrank. There are 19 million manfuacturing workers now, versus 21 million in 1979 before the two back-to-back recessions of the early 1980's.
The stable output share and shrinking employment share reflect the fact that United States factories staged an almost unbelievable productivity revival. United States industrial productivity was dragging along at 1.4 percent of the gross national product in the 1970's, or about a third of the pace at which United States' trading partners were recording gains in hourly worker efficiencies. Now, it is growing at 3.6 percent a year, just as fast as the average pace of United States trading partners.
Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said: "With advances in productvity, flexibility of our market economy and proper economic policies, our economy will come out of recession with sustained growth in the 90's. On balance, manufacturing will do well."
One conclusion from the report is that United States manufacturing is more resilient than many people had thought.
In the 1980's, some economists argued that America's manufacturing base was crumbling. The Reagan Administration pointed to data showing that while there were many fewer workers in factories, manufacturing still held the same share of gross national product that it did in the 1960's -- around 21 percent to 23 percent. They insisted that factory efficiency was growing at a post-World War II record.
 
Challenge by Economists
 Those economists who believed that the nation's industrial base was weakening argued that the Government's statistical techniques for calculating output were overstating the share of G.N.P. produced by the manufacturing sector.
Yesterday's report, the culmination of a two-and-a-half-year effort to come up with better estimates, showed that manufacturing's share of G.N.P. fell from 1979 to 1982, to its post-World War II low, and had not fully recovered by 1987. But by 1988, the share of G.N.P. matched that of 1979, and by 1990 exceeded it.
Further, manufacturing productivity grew even faster than earlier data showed, according to Labor Department calculations. Factory efficiency raced ahead 3.6 percent a year during the last decade, about as fast as the average of United States' trading partners, including Japan, Canada and Western Europe. In the 1970's, by contrast, United States factory productivity grew at only one-third the rate of the nation's biggest trading partners.

HEADLINE: Dow Soars in Heavy Trading to Gain 41.59

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks rose strongly yesterday in hectic trading, with the Dow Jones industrials and other leading averages scoring new highs for the year. One of the nation's most influential Wall Street investment houses said the six-month bear market had ended.
"I think the bear market is over," Steven G. Einhorn, a partner and co-chairman of the investment policy committee of Goldman, Sachs & Company, said in an interview. Only a week ago, Mr. Einhorn had said, "The bear is still growling, but more softly." 
 The Dow surged yesterday by 41.59 points, to 2,772.28. Trading volume soared to 250.8 million shares -- its highest since 318.9 million on Jan. 17, the first trading session after the start of allied air strikes on Iraq.
 
Other Measures Advance
 Showing that the rise was far-reaching, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose the equivalent of 42 Dow points. The smaller Nasdaq stocks, though, jumped 46.5 Dow points, while the American Stock Exchange's market value index of small stocks rose the equivalent of 35.
Mr. Einhorn said that up to now his position was that the market had seen its lows and was not dropping further, just flattening out.
"We now think there's more upside than downside," he said.
Mr. Einhorn urged clients to get out of the market before its collapse in October 1987 and correctly turned bearish again early last year. But he also urged higher cash positions in 1988 and again in the first two months of 1989, thus missing market upturns in both periods.
He said Goldman, Sachs had notified all its clients and branches around the world yesterday that the stock market "will deliver a pleasant return of 12 to 15 percent over the next 12 months."
Asked what the market responded to yesterday, he replied, "There's an ongoing conviction that the Fed will continue to ease" monetary policy, "bringing about lower interest rates and some recovery in economic activity beginning in the summer months."
The Fed touched off heavy trading on Friday after cutting interest rates.
Goldman, Sachs "likes the growth stocks," Mr. Einhorn said, mentioning Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Philip Morris, Abbott Labs, Colgate and Conagra.
 
154 New Highs
 On the Big Board, 1,362 stocks rose and only 359 fell. An impressive 154 stocks -- including Compaq Computer -- reached new highs while only 8 fell to new lows.
The market took off almost from the opening bell. Birinyi Associates said program trading added barely 6.5 points to the Dow, meaning that practically all of the volume came from institutions and individuals.
Short-sellers, who hope to profit by selling borrowed stock and replacing it with shares bought later for less, were forced to jump in now to avoid losing money as stocks continued upward. This in turn pushed stocks even further ahead.
In one example, Wells Fargo, the big West Coast banking concern, jumped 6 3/8, to 69 3/8, in heavy trading. Many bank stocks rose in the wake of declining interest rates, but Campbell Chaney, who watches Wells Fargo for Sutro & Company in San Francisco, said: "A lot is short covering. Wells Fargo was everybody's favorite stock to short."
Mr. Chaney said short covering also helped lift Security Pacific, First Interstate, Citicorp and several others.
Security Pacific rose 2 7/8, to 25; First Interstate 1 1/2, to 32 1/8, and Citicorp 1 3/8, to 15, with 3.6 million shares changing hands.
From Mr. Einhorn's list, Merck rose 2 3/8, to 94 1/2, after a new high of 94 3/4; Bristol-Myers 1 1/4, to 70, after a new high of 70 1/4; Philip Morris 1 1/4, to 58 1/8, after a new high of 58 1/4; Abbott Labs 1/8, to 43 1/8; Colgate 1 7/8, to 72 1/2, and Conagra 1/8, to 39, after a new high of 39 5/8.
Warren E. Buffett, the Omaha billionaire, had a good day. Berkshire Hathaway, his main investment vehicle, rose 225 a share, to 7,800. In addition to a large investment in Wells Fargo, it owns big pieces of Capital Cities/ABC, which rose 4, to 470; Geico, up 2, to 167; Coca-Cola, up 1, to 482; Washington Post, up 6,to 228, and Salomon, up 7/8, to $23 3/4.

Chip Estimate Cut By NEC Officials

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The NEC Corporation, one of Japan's top makers of computers and semiconductors, lowered its estimate for production of its most sophisticated computer chips because of weak demand. NEC officials said the company had expected production of four-megabit dynamic random access memory chips to reach about four million a month by this summer. But they said output was now expected to hover around three million a month.
Company executives explained that an economic slowdown in the United States and Europe had chilled the demand for computers and other advanced electronic products using four-megabit chips, the most sophisticated now available on the market.

HEADLINE: 'Africa Centered' School Plan Is Rooted in 60's Struggles

BYLINE: By M. A. FARBER

 BODY:
For all its currency, the conflict over the proposal to start a small "Africa centered" high school mainly for black boys in New York City has a past that is as old as the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school wars of the late 1960's and the move prompted by that upheaval toward community control of the schools.
It is rooted in years of thought and action about the quality of education for urban minorities, especially blacks, and even about who should provide it. 
 On both sides are people who have proved to be genuinely interested in raising the academic accomplishments and self-esteem of youths who are without skills, often without hope, and some of whom are a danger to themselves and to others.
But in this case, where symbol counts as much as substance and where there hasbeen considerable confusion and misstatement, there is little agreement on how to achieve a desirable end.
Just a few weeks after most of the seven members of the Board of Education publicly endorsed the concept for what has been called the Ujaama Institute, several have privately backtracked, board officials say. The proposal is facing considerable revision amid criticism from integrationists and civil libertarians who say they fear the experimental school would foster racial separation. Ujamaa (pronounced you-JAH-ma) is a Swahili word sometimes translated as family.
A spokesman for Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez said the proposal would be reworked over a period of months by a Medgar Evers College faculty member, assisted by "two or three experts in multicultural education."
"In no way would the school be restrictedto one gender or one race," the spokesman, James S. Vlasto, said in an interview. He said the future role of the proposal's developer, Basir Mchawi, a former high school teacher who is an employee of the Chancellor's office, "is to be determined."
Mr. Mchawi (pronounced ma-CHOW-ee), a graduate of New York University who taught communications briefly at Rutgers University and Empire State College, came to write the Ujamaa proposal after two decades in a changing educational environmentin which many of the city's public schools in effect became segregated.
His career in the public schools began in the late 1960's at Intermediate School 201 in East Harlem, when that school -- like others in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn -- was a demonstration project for community control financed by the Ford Foundation. For five years in the early 1970's, Mr. Mchawi taught at Junior High School 275 in Brownsville.
In 1976 he resigned to become a teacher at Uhuru Sasa, one of a handful of accredited private schools started by black cultural nationalists after occasionally violent confrontations in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville project, some of which precipitated a prolonged, citywide teachers' strike. Uhuru Sasa, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was founded by Leslie Campbell, who now calls himself Jitu Weusi. He is a former Ocean Hill teacher who, in the midst of the community-control battle, was denounced for reading a poem on the radio that was widely regarded as anti-Semitic.
Uhuru Sasa, which closed in the mid-1980's for what Mr. Weusi says was chiefly a lack of financial support, was, by many accounts, an exciting school, stressing pride in the students' African heritage. Like Shule Ya Mapinduzi, a nearby private school that Mr. Mchawi helped run, Uhuru Sasa had a profound impact on Mr. Mchawi, and he began to think of it as an educational model.
In 1986, Mr. Mchawi rejoined the public-school system as an English teacher at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn, where he was described last week by the principal, Frank Mickens, as a "good, satisfactory" teacher.
But two years later, under circumstances that are not entirely clear, Mr. Mchawi left the classroom to become an assistant to Richard R. Green, who had just arrived from Minnesota to become the new schools chancellor.
 
A Meeting Leads To a 'Cabinet' Job
 Carol Gibson, who was executive assistant to Mr. Green, said the Chancellor met Mr. Mchawi at a community meeting at Boys and Girls High School in early 1988 and was "impressed with how articulate Basir was."
"Richard liked to have classroom teachers in his cabinet," Ms. Gibson said. "Richard marched to his own drummer. And he was impressed with those who spoke out."
Others say that Robert (Sonny) Carson, a Brooklyn community organizer whose son and niece attended Boys and Girls High School, pressed for Mr. Mchawi's appointment at Board of Education headquarters. Mr. Carson, who is often at the forefront of racially charged issues and who helped start the continuing boycott of two Korean groceries in Brooklyn, denies a hand in Mr. Mchawi's appointment.
"There was a series of meetings with Green, with community people of different views, and at one of the meetings Green asked Basir if he would be his assistant," Mr. Carson said last week. "We were all surprised."
Mr. Carson says he has not been in touch with Mr. Mchawi since then; Mr. Mchawi says Mr. Carson is an acquaintance but not someone with whom he has ever had a working relationship.
But in his recent book "The Closest of Strangers," Jim Sleeper, an editorial writer for New York Newsday, says Mr. Carson "enlisted the support" of Mr. Mchawi, apparently in late 1988, when Mr. Carson wanted to oust Lester McDowell as principal of Public School 262 in Brooklyn, a school then in turmoil. Mr. Mchawi declined to be interviewed for this article.
 
Parent Complains Of Racial Emphasis
 According to senior school officials, Mr. Mchawi worked as a "troubleshooter" at board headquarters and helped on such projects as the "corridor school program," supported by the Aaron Diamond Foundation, to improve links between elementary and middle schools.
In April 1989 a Brooklyn parent, Norbert A. Pierre, complained to Mr. Green that Mr. Mchawi, speaking as the Chancellor's "representative," had told a community forum that "I work for the Board of Mis-education, and I mean that."
"Don't think that because there are two black men in the Chancellor's office that the revolution has started," the parent quoted Mr. Mchawi. "It hasn't. Nothing's changed."
Mr. Pierre wrote to Mr. Green that while Mr. Mchawi explained how he had been "enlightened through the writings of Malcolm X" and had brought along a rap group -- which had sung about voter registration -- as an example of "positive youth," the Chancellor's aide "undermined confidence in our schools" and "apparently sought to polarize us along racial lines."
Mr. Mchawi should be removed, Mr. Pierre suggested.
Mr. Pierre received a form reply to his letter. Ms. Gibson said that to her knowledge Chancellor Green was never "disenchanted with Basir." She described Mr. Mchawi as "very committed to students, believing in self-esteem as the cornerstone of developing your capacity."
Nonetheless when Mr. Fernandez arrived from Miami in late 1989 to become Chancellor, he asked for Mr. Mchawi's resignation, along with hundreds of similar requests in the school hierarchy. Mr. Mchawi was offered a number of teaching assignments, according to Mr. Vlasto, that did not "pan out." Last April, Mr. Vlasto said, Mr. Mchawi was reassigned to Boys and Girls High School, but did not return there. He came up with his proposal for the Ujamaa Institute.
The idea for the high school drew not only on Mr. Mchawi's experience, but also on the writings of Jawanza Kunjufu, the Chicago author of "Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys."
Also influencing the Ujamaa concept were the "Seven Principles" of Maulana Karenga, a California professor who, in the 1960's, was known as Ron Karenga. He was the leader of a militant black group in Los Angeles known as US, for United Slaves.
 
Curriculum Is Seen As 'Africa Centered'
 The principles for the Ujamaa Institute, Mr. Mchawi wrote, were "synthesized from traditional African values and the contemporary needs of the African-American people" and would sustain what he called a "value-based education." He listed the principles as unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.
Mr. Mchawi's proposal envisioned an academically rigorous but innovative "alternative" school staffed mainly by black men who would serve as both role models and teachers. He saw it as a school that would adhere to state educational regulations but would have a "definite emphasis" in its curriculum and activities on an "Africa centered," rather than "Western civilization," perspective.
The school, with about 300 to 400 "volunteer" students, would be in a converted building in Brooklyn, presumably with Mr. Mchawi as its director. An undated draft -- perhaps not the first -- of Mr. Mchawi's proposal says the school would be "nondiscriminatory" and would include girls, as well as "Latino males."
However, Lee Blake, chief education aide to Mayor David N. Dinkins, recalls that when she saw the proposal last fall, girls were not included and she told Mr. Mchawi that under those circumstances the school could not qualify for state or Federal aid.
For "political momentum," Mr. Mchawi turned in the spring of 1990 to Roger L. Green, a Brooklyn Assemblyman who had been chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus in Albany and who was a protege of Assemblyman Al Vann of Brooklyn. Mr. Vann, with whom Mr. Mchawi also spoke, was head of the African-American Teachers Association during the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school battles.
Assemblyman Green, a former public-school teacher, had his own reasons, some highly personal, for listening carefully to Mr. Mchawi, whom he knew, he said, from "the struggle around decentralization" of the schools. After seeing gang members at a high school during a visit in the fall of 1989 -- "it made my hair stand up on my neck," he said last week -- Mr. Green took some of the members to his home to meet with education officials and community leaders.
"It was clear these kids were engulfed with a tremendous level of alienation," Mr. Green recalled.
In late 1989 and early 1990, Assemblyman Green and some educators convened a series of workshops to find ways of "reclaiming and empowering" youths who were dropping out of school and getting into trouble. He was also worried about his teen-age son, Khalid, who had been assaulted three times and stabbed, the last time in the hand.
"That only reinforced my belief that we needed to begin the process of new educational models," Mr. Green said.
 
'A Convergence Of Interests'
When Mr. Mchawi approached him, seeking support for the Ujamaa Institute, Mr. Green immediately saw "a convergence of interests."
He said he wrote last May to Chancellor Fernandez on behalf of Mr. Mchawi's concept, although Mr. Fernandez's office says it has no record of receiving the letter and Mr. Green's office cannot locate its copy. In July Mr. Fernandez gave Mr. Mchawi, now a $60,000-a-year associate on the staff of the chief executive for instruction, approval to develop the Ujamaa proposal.
Last fall Mr. Mchawi asked the Aaron Diamond Foundation for a planning grant and was supported by Amina Abdur-Rahman, deputy chancellor for external programs and community affairs, who wrote to the foundation's executive director, Vincent McGee.
"We are quite interested in this project," she wrote to Mr. Gee on Oct. 15, noting that it could produce "instructional methodology that might be more effective with black and/or Hispanic male students."
Three days after Ms. Abdur-Rahman's letter, The New York Post said in an article that Mr. Fernandez was considering "a controversial program that would set up special public schools exclusively for young black students." Since then, more heat than light has been shed on the Ujamaa proposal.
Mr. Fernandez -- who had seemed to distance himself from the proposal when it was likened in the fall to a similar Milwaukee plan -- shortly thereafter embraced the Ujamaa idea, or at least his version of it. In a Dec. 13 memorandum to members of the Board of Education, Mr. Fernandez made no mention of Ujamaa's "Africa centered" character, portraying the proposed school as the kind of "multicultural" education favored by the board, his administration and the Mayor's office.
Last month, after a presentation by Assemblyman Green and others, most members of the board waxed enthusiastic over Ujamaa.
But cries of "racism," "separatism" and "sexism" by civil liberties and civil rights organizations, as well as educators like Dr. Kenneth B. Clark, the psychiatrist, who said the proposal would have been "deeply resented if proposed by an education commission of a Southern state," appear to have dampened the ardor of a number of board members.
Mr. Mchawi had originally hoped to see Ujamaa open this month. Now it is problematic whether it will open this year -- or at all.

HEADLINE: Drought Forces Cutoff of Water To Vast Farmlands in California

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The huge water project built a generation ago to protect the fast-growing state against drought cut off all water to farmers today as a result of the worst drought in California history.
While not entirely unexpected, the move is a brutal blow to California's agricultural industry, the nation's largest, with economic conquences far worse than the December freeze. 
 "The freeze was nothing compared to this," said Donald W. Marquez, an engineer with the Kern County Water Agency in Bakersfield, the largest purchaser of state water. "We are looking at losses of billions of dollars in Kern County alone."
The action, by the State Department of Water Resources, the independent agency that operates the project, came as farmers were preparing for their spring planting and irrigation of major crops like cotton and as the lettuce crop was half grown. In anticipation of the cutoff, many had shelved plans to grow alfalfa, cotton and other crops that require much water.
The California State Water Project, a system of dams, reservoirs, aqueducts and canals, provides about 9 percent of the water used annually in California, but nearly all the water used in major farm regions of the Central Valley, the fertile, 300-mile-long plain that fills the central part of the state.
While many farmers and water agencies are trying to find alternative supplies, from wells and transfers from other areas, officials say there is little prospect of replacing more than a fraction of the lost supplies.
Whatever could be found would be used mostly to save permanent crops like almond and fruit trees, rather than producing a marketable harvest, they said.
Farm leaders said today's action was almost certain to raise prices nationwide for cotton and some fruits and vegetables.
Of the 9 million acres of irrigated farmland in the state, 600,000 depend on the water project. The cutoff affects thousands of farms stretching from the San Joaquin Delta south along the western half of the Central Valley. Other regions are served by the larger Federal Central Valley Project, which has also said it expects to cut its deliveries by 65 percent.
The state project has also provided about half the water used by the the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves urban dwellers and industry in Southern California. In all, 19 million people, two-thirds of the state's population, get some or all of their water from the State Water Project.
In normal years, the project delivers 2 million to 2.5 million acre-feet of water from Northern California through the huge California Aqueduct. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, roughly enough to supply two households for a year. About half the water goes to farms.
In December, the state notified agricultural users to expect only 35 percent of their requests. That assumed good precipitation in January, but that month proved dry.
State water officials said today that with reservoirs down to a third of normal or less, they were forced to cut off the farms to preserve essential water in case next year is dry, too. About 85 percent of the water in California is used by farmers, who produce half the fruits and vegetables in the United States and who are almost totally dependent on irrigation using piped-in water.
Nearly all the water comes from snow and rain in the winter. The dry season begins in April, and little precipitation can be expected until November. Therefore, barring unusually heavy precipitation in the next two months, it appears unlikely that deliveries can be restored before next year.
 
No Signs of Relief
 The fierce drought in West, now in its fifth year, is showing no sign of letup. The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which normally provides the spring runoff that feeds the aqueducts supplying California farms and cities with water, stood at only about 13 percent of normal by last week.
State officials said today that there was only a 50-50 chance that the project could deliver the supplies, already cut in half, that were promised urban residents this year.
This is certain to accelerate rationing in major cities, including Los Angeles, where Mayor Tom Bradley called on residents on Friday to reduce water use by 15 percent from 1986 levels or face stiff penalties on their bills.
The cutoff for farmers appeared to presage even broader restrictions on water use expected to be ordered when the State Water Resources Control Board, a powerful agency that controls rights to surface water statewide, meets Thursday in Sacramento. On Friday Gov. Pete Wilson created a task force to advise him on what steps to take, including a possible declaration of a state emergency.
In a letter to the local water agencies that buy the project's water, David N. Kennedy, director of the Department of Water Resources, said the agency would review its capacity to deliver more water during the rest of the rainy season, but he held out little hope in light of the "bleak" situation. He urged all contractors to emphasize conservation and efficiency.
It is hard to predict the full effects of today's action on farms and industries dependent on them.
"This has scared the socks off of everybody," said Fred L. Starrh, a Kern County farmer who canceled his cotton crop and laid off 40 workers even before today's announcement. He said he hoped to get enough water from other sources just to save his 265 acres of almond trees.
Cotton, which accounts for about one-third of the acreage in the six main counties of the Central Valley, is expected to be hit hardest.
"We're sick about it," Cathy Merlo, spokeswoman for Calcot, the state's largest cotton cooperative, told The Associated Press. She said the cooperative expected acreage to drop by 30 percent.
Bob Vice, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation, the largest agricultural organization in the state, said in a statement that the suspension of water deliveries would create much hardship.
 
'The Losses Will Be Large'
 "The financial effect of this action is unknown," he said, "but we know that the losses will be large and the potential exists that consumers will see the result in the marketplace." He urged renewed efforts to develop more water sources, a step resisted by environmentalists.
The principal engineer for the Department of Water Resources, Donald R. Long, said his agency was trying to buy water from other water systems to help keep fruit trees and grapevines from drying up and to supply cities facing health and safety emergencies.
The drought began in 1987. There has been some speculation that California might be undergoing a permanent climatological change, which would radically alter its economy. But water experts point to historical data showing repeated cycles of rain and drought, although no drought as protracted as this one. "It's got to rain some time," Mr. Long said.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING NOTEBOOK;
Filly-Colt Showdown Likely in Triple Crown

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

 BODY:
Is another legendary battle of the sexes taking shape in racing's Triple Crown classics?
Could be. 
 In this corner, you have the champion 2-year-old colt of 1990, Fly So Free, who wasted no time making his 1991 debut a smashing one Saturday when he snatched the Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream Park in the final 60 yards. He is 5 of 7 in his career, and rolling.
In the far corner, the champion 2-year-old filly of 1990, Meadow Star, undefeated in seven starts last year, gathering her oats this year and primed for more.
Both are now 3-year-olds; both are eligible for the racing classics; both are in Florida, perhaps embarked on a collision course. And remember, only three fillies have ever won the Kentucky Derby: Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in 1980 and Winning Colors in 1988.
Many others might have tried, but their owners and trainers decided to keep them competing against fillies and not subject them to the rigors of competing with colts, who tend to be bigger and tougher.
Guess what? The man who trained Genuine Risk in 1980 was Leroy Jolley. The man who trains Meadow Star, a decade later: Leroy Jolley.
But that doesn't necessarily mean he is spoiling for another battle of the sexes. In fact, it's generally believed he did not particularly want Genuine Risk to challenge the colts but was overruled by Bert Firestone, the filly's owner. And now Jolley says the dye has not yet been cast on Meadow Star, either by himself or by the owner, Carl Icahn, the financier.
"She's thrived here and couldn't be doing better," Jolley said the other day from the Payson Park training complex near Indiantown, Fla. "She'll have two races against fillies before we decide whether she'll tackle the colts and point for the Derby."
Jolley is projecting her debut around March 1. But by then, Fly So Free may have added a notch to his belt. His trainer, Scotty Schulhofer, said the colt would roll again Feb. 23 in the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream (at a mile and a sixteenth) and yet again on March 16 in the Florida Derby (at a mile and an eighth). The Kentucky Derby will be run May 4 (at a mile and a quarter).
Why wouldn't they run a filly against anybody if she was unbeaten and unmatched in her class?
Because there are plenty of prizes and bankrolls for fillies who beat other fillies. And the greatest of fillies in our time, Ruffian, competed only once against a colt: in the match race in 1975 against Foolish Pleasure, the colt who had won the Kentucky Derby.
But we will never know how she would have fared. Her right foreleg snapped in the backstretch at Belmont Park, and she did not survive. Ask Leroy Jolley about colts and fillies and tragedy at the races: He was the trainer of Foolish Pleasure.
 
Aqueduct Hangs Tough

Yes, Virginia, there is an Aqueduct race track, and it probably will continue to delight the hearts of railbirds.
Just for how long, though, that is the question. Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is trying to trim New York's budget, proposed last week that the state sell the track to the Port Authority, which reportedly would like to expand Kennedy Airport, the track's neighbor in south Queens.
If so, the state would gain $100 million but lose one of its two major downstate tracks. Could Belmont house, feed and race all those horses by itself?
"Nothing is imminent," said Gerard McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association, which operates Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga. "Talks have been conducted on and off with the Port Authority for several months, but nothing is final or even imminent.
"Before the sale of Aqueduct could be concluded, many serious problems must be solved. Among them are the modification of Belmont Park to allow for a longer racing season; the replacement of Aqueduct's 500 stalls and training facilities; the shortening of the New York metropolitan racing season; the restructuring of the marketing of racing within the state, the protection of racing opportunities for horsemen and the preservation of the state's revenue stream from parimutuel wagering."
He means that Belmont Park would have to be expanded to carry the load of horses and its season would have to be lengthened to give the horses something to do. Belmont operates from May into November (except for the Saratoga season in August); Aqueduct runs through the winter into May.
These things could be worked out, and probably will be. Then the main problem will be financial: Fewer races mean fewer bets and fewer dollars for the state, both at the track and through its Offtrack Betting system. And the whole idea was to add money, in the first place.
 
War, Recession and Football

The racing industry has been reporting a drop in attendance and betting because of the war in the Middle East and the recession. And, said Glenn Mathis of the New York Racing Association, things at Aqueduct got noticeably slower some weekend afternoons in January for another reason.
"The Giants," he reported. "We were down on the Sundays when they were in the playoffs. People just stayed home and watched TV."

HEADLINE: In a Warming World, Who Comes Out Ahead?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN a finding fraught with sensitive political implications, some scientists say that if global warming takes its expected course, some parts of the world could come out winners, even while many others reap disaster.
A few regions, mainly in colder climes, may well benefit, according to computer models of climate change. The computer models merely simulate global climate change and are still being refined. They are therefore a rough guide to what may happen to various regions as the world warms, not an exact forecast. 
 For many other regions, including North America, the computer models predict both pluses and minuses whose overall balance cannot yet be assessed. But for developing countries, scientists say, the general picture is negative: most are more vulnerable to climate change and less able to adapt to it than are the industrialized nations of the cooler latitudes.
The question of whether some countries might gain from global warming has been bubbling just beneath the surface of discussions about climate change.
Some politicians and environmentalists have been reluctant to confront the issue for fear it might disrupt efforts to forge an international agreement to head off global warming from gases being produced by human activity. Others, including some scientists, assert that while there might be some temporary winners, there will be none over the long run, especially if global warming is severe and if it occurs as rapidly as scientists predict. Not least, they say, the natural ecosystems that undergird human life everywhere would not be able to adjust fast enough to escape catastrophe.
The winners-losers issue is becoming more prominent just as delegates met yesterday at Chantilly, Va., outside Washington, in the first of several sessions to negotiate a treaty limiting the emission of "greenhouse" gases, which trap the sun's heat in the atmosphere. Scientists predict that these gases will heat the earth's surface by an 2 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century unless checked.
Some experts note that if any countries gain from global warming, they will probably be the ones that now emit most greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons.
 
Threat to Island Nations
 "In the long run, there are good reasons to believe that those who are responsible are the winners," said Dr. Klaus Meyer-Abich, a physicist and philosopher at Germany's Science Center of Rhine-Westphalia and at the University of Essen. He has served as an expert adviser on climate change to the German parliament and has extensively studied the question of climatic winners and losers.
Whether industrialized countries enjoy absolute gains or not, they stand to increase their already huge overall economic advantage over the third world.
Countries that see themselves as undoubted losers include small island nations that fear a major rise in sea level and more frequent and severe tropical storms, both of which are expected to result from global warming. These nations have formed the Alliance of Small Island States to press their case for stringent controls on greenhouse gas emissions.
They are preparing to demand that the industrialized countries cut their own emissions and also help the island nations adapt to climate change, said Naresh Singh of Castries, St. Lucia, the executive director of the Caribbean Environmental Health Institute, an umbrella organization for 16 English-speaking Caribbean countries. Mr. Singh is a delegate to the Chantilly meeting.
If the level of the oceans rises by more than two feet by the year 2100, as climate experts predict, low-lying nations like the Maldives and some Pacific islands could be inundated. Other places at high risk include Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia, Egypt, coastal China, Louisiana and the southern coast of the North Sea, according to a recent assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a body set up by the United Nations to advise the treaty negotiators and their governments.
In general, populations most vulnerable to global warming "are in developing countries, in the lower income groups, residents of coastal lowlands and islands, populations in semi-arid grasslands and the urban poor in squatter settlements, slums and shantytowns, especially in megacities," says a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
People living in third-world slums are judged more vulnerable because their existence, already precarious, could be made even more so by disrupted food supplies.
Developing countries are more vulnerable because they are more dependent on agriculture, forests and other natural resources for economic health, said Dr. Dennis Tirpak, director of the Environmental Protection Agency's global climate change division, a member of the American negotiating team at Chantilly.
Agriculture in much of the third world is especially susceptible to drought. Global warming is expected to intensify drought in wide areas, and also to cause severe damage to forests and grasslands. On top of this, many third world populations already live on the margins of subsistence, and lack the resources to cope with climatic disruption.
Apart from these broad outlines, the effects of warming appear mixed and quite complicated.
"In some places the climate will get better and in some it will get worse," said Dr. Michael H. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. But beyond that, he said, much remains unknown. Dr. Glantz, a social scientist, heads a group that studies the impact of climate change on societies and has been trying to encourage discussion and inquiry on winners and losers for some time. Last year he organized an international conference in Malta on assessing winners and losers.
 The conference concluded, "There will be advantaged and disadvantaged countries, regions within countries, sectors and populations."
"The identity of those advantaged and disadvantaged will change over time," it said. "There are serious obstacles to their identification."
Dr. Tirpak explained: "It's not a case where you can simply pick a date and have one set of countries that will win forevermore and another that will lose. It is not a very easy thing to characterize."
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nevertheless, has tentatively identified potential gainers and losers. The identification is based on results of mathematical simulations of how the earth's climate would behave under global warming, and is therefore uncertain.
"We should not take these studies literally, as a prognosis that every detail will just come as it is written now," Dr. Meyer-Abich said. But he said the general pattern "will not be changed very much" as more is learned.
 
Effects on Agriculture
 The relative advantages and disadvantages are perhaps most tellingly reflected in the effects of warming on agriculture. This will occur in forms like shifting rainfall patterns, drier soil, increased evaporation of surface water, increased loss of water by crops and reduced snowpacks in the mountains, resulting in lessened runoff in the spring.
But warming would also bring more rainfall to some areas and more warmth and longer growing seasons to regions that are now too cool for maximum agricultural production.
The following examples of possible gains and losses are not all-inclusive, but suggest the variety and range of changes expected:
Northern Europe would become a winner, according to the intergovernmental panel's analysis. Northern Scandinavia "stands to gain more from global warming than perhaps any other region of the world" because it would become warmer and wetter, the panel's report said. The grasslands that feed Iceland's sheep would become more than twice as productive as they are now.
Yields of grass and potatoes would increase in much of Ireland, Britain, the Low Countries and Denmark. A temperature increase of more than 2 degrees would improve the agricultural potential of much of the European part of the Soviet Union. But substantial decreases in productivity could occur in Southern Europe. A warming of 2 to 7 degrees would enable cultivated areas to creep 500 feet to 2,000 feet closer to the summit of the Alps. Northern Japan, including Hokkaido and the northern part of Honshu, would enjoy increased yields of rice, corn and soybeans.
By contrast, drier soils would disrupt food production in regions like Northwest and West Africa, the horn of Africa, southern Africa, western Saudi Arabia, Southeast Asia, Mexico, Central America and parts of eastern Brazil.
 
Prospects for North America
 For North America, the overall climate picture is mixed. Large parts of the northern United States and Canada would enjoy a pleasanter climate and attract more inhabitants, Dr. Meyer-Abich wrote in a recent review. In Europe, too, he said, these "privileged regions" would be extended farther to the north.
Agricultural production in the United States would also shift northward, according to a study by the Environmental Protection Agency, with Minnesota, Wisconsin and northern Michigan being gainers. But 10 to 50 percent of all agricultural acreage in the South might have to be abandoned. Production would probably decrease in the Corn Belt. Drier soil would cut yields of spring wheat in Canada, although there would be a small increase near the northern limit of current production. Yields of corn, barley, soybeans and hay would decline in all of Canada but northern Ontario.
A rise in sea level could inundate coastal wetlands, damaging or destroying spawning grounds that sustain commercial fisheries. Beachfront communities would have to invest billions of dollars in coastal protection, and some settled areas on the coast would probably be inundated.
Northern cities would be spared considerable expense in heating costs, snow removal and road maintenance. But air-conditioning bills would soar in the South and ski resorts could be in deep trouble.
In one sense, national borders are the wrong framework in which to consider global climate change.
"Looking at it on the nation-state level may not be appropriate," said Dan McGraw, a professor of international environmental law at the University of Colorado. "If significant climate change occurs, it's going to be a lot of individuals in the world who are disadvantaged. At one level, it doesn't matter so much which country they're in."
But when it comes to negotiating the treaties to moderate climate change, it is nations that do the negotiating. On that level, Mr. McGraw said, he has detected a reluctance to discuss winners and losers.
"Some folks feel that any discussion of the question will tend to polarize the possible participants in any sort of international solution," he said. The fear, he said, may be that "as countries start focusing on whether they are likely to be a winner or loser, that will influence whether they cooperate."
Temporary advantage aside, all nations are interdependent in the long run, note observers like William Nitze, a former State Department official who coordinated Government policy on global warming until last September. If the third world suffers, the industrialized countries suffer as well, he said, noting: "Developing countries are a tremendous market for us. We have a large stake in their long-term future prosperity."
Senator Al Gore, a Tennessee Democrat who favors strong action to combat global warming, contends that talk of winners and losers "is just another cop-out that people use for not dealing with this threat."
He cited the prospect of waves of "environmental refugees," fleeing ravaged third world economies or low-lying areas and causing "enormous destabilizing pressures" for industrialized countries.
 
Worldwide Refugee Problem
 The number of refugees could amount to 100 million, said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist and expert on global warming at the Environmental Defense Fund, a research and advocacy group. The pressure they may bring on the rest of the world "is enough in itself to make people who think they're going to be winners take notice and reassess," he said.
He concedes that if the world warms by only a degree or two over the next century, then "without question, some people could be labeled winners." But with an eight degree warming, the upper limit predicted by some computer simulations, "the world would be so different at those higher levels that it is very difficult to argue that any significant number of people will find it beneficial," he said. "There will be radical change, in other words."
Scientists predict that the rate of climatic change would be faster than at any other time in the last 10,000 years. "If it happened infinitely slowly," Dr. Oppenheimer said, "society could adjust. In a fast-changing world, there are no winners."

Small Fortunes Two Guys in Pursuit
Of the American Dream
By Edward Zuckerman
296 pages. Viking. $19.95.
 The "Two Guys in Pursuit of the American Dream" that the journalist Edward Zuckerman profiles in his new book are both Texans and they are both entrepreneurs. Both come from modest backgrounds and both dream of using their business skills to invent new lives for themselves. There, however, the similarities apparently end. 
 Pete Binion, as Mr. Zuckerman notes, is "a Texan of the old school." Having grown up on a succession of small Texas farms, he enlisted in the Marines in the late 1960's, went to Vietnam and returned home to study animal husbandry and become a rodeo rider. Now, happily married with three children, he has sunk all his family's money into a ranch, where he hopes to breed Senepol cattle.
 Pete believes that he can introduce the Senepol, an obscure breed developed on the Caribbean island of St. Croix, to Texas and that one day it will rival such long-established breeds as the longhorn and the Brahman. He also plans to use his knowledge of animal science to start a company named Universal Embryonics. (He rejected the name World Embryonics as too limited.) The company, he believes, will operate on the cutting edge of cattle reproduction technology, bringing combined benefits, in Mr. Zuckerman's words, to "world agriculture and Pete Binion and his family."
Mr. Zuckerman's other subject, Jim Teal, has dreams that are considerably less visionary. He simply wants to make a lot of money and have a good time. As described by Mr. Zuckerman, Jim comes across as an obnoxious good old boy. His idea of a good time is golf with topless models or a wild party in his yellow RV.He is not above trying to collect insurance money by goading a drunken driver into running into his car.
 If Jim lacks conventional scruples, however, he's also a hard-working hustler. At age 18, he was a dollar-an-hour chicken breader at a Kentucky Fried Chicken; by 30, he was the owner of a Wendy's hamburger franchise and he had more than a million dollars in Wendy's stock. Since then, he has run a male stripper bar and a hot-tub business, which faltered amid the growing fears about herpes and AIDS. When Mr. Zuckerman first meets Jim, he has started a T-shirt business featuring shirts emblazoned with popular comic-strip characters like Skyler the Bird and Bill the Cat.
 Cutting back and forth in alternating chapters between Jim's story and Pete's story, Mr. Zuckerman creates a compelling and often very funny portrait of these two Texas businessmen, with whom he spent two and a half years. Observant yet nonjudgmental, he is able to give the reader a vivid sense of these two men's lives, as well as an understanding of how their stories fit and don't fit the traditional Horatio Alger mold. He demonstrates how luck and timing and judgment can make or break a small business, how circumstances beyond one's control can exert a profound -- and often devastating -- influence on individual lives. We see how American's suspicion of red meat and cholesterol can have a direct effect on ranchers like Pete Binion and how recession and bank failures can affect a struggling businessman like Jim Teal.
 In addition, Mr. Zuckerman gives the reader a colorful picture of contemporary Texas as glimpsed through the lives of his two heroes and some of those they encounter. He takes us to football games and golf courses, to shopping malls and trade fairs, to barbecues and dances, and he introduces us to a motley group of people, including a woman who persuades her wealthy husband to buy some cattle because she likes their color, a man who specializes in armadillo cartoons and a cowboy who dreams of owning a house with three walls of hard-cover books and a picture window.
 Unfortunately, neither Jim nor Pete prosper with their businesses. Pete is unable to find buyers for his Senepol cattle. He loses his ranch and eventually goes bankrupt. Jim and his partner also go out of business. After years of driving around in limousines, he begins living on his unemployment benefits of $217 a week.
 Both, however, remain incurable optimists. Last seen by Mr. Zuckerman, they are busy working on the second acts in their lives. Jim thinks there is money to be made in getting Federal and city funds to help subsidize mobile home parks for the homeless; Pete has returned to school to prepare for a new career in hazardous-waste management. He writes Mr. Zuckerman that he and his "family, pets and friends are healthy and doing well." He is relieved that he no longer has to worry about a failing business. "Life is a joy," he writes, "I'm living in heaven."

The Bush Administration today opened an international conference on global warming with the declaration that the United States will stabilize its overall production of the gases that have been linked to rising world temperatures.
According to the Administration's plan, introduced in a 22-page "action agenda" prepared by the White House, the United States will hold down the production of gases thought to cause the earth's warming to roughly 2.3 billion tons annually by the year 2000, the same amount produced in 1987. 
 The Administration also said for the first time in an international setting that it believed global warming was a problem.
The White House is proposing no new steps to hold down carbon dioxide or other gases, however, saying it believes that measures already taken will put a cap on greenhouse gases. Environmentalists compare this position unfavorably with that of European nations, which have agreed to cut back carbon dioxide emissions.
"The old White House position was this isn't a problem and we're not going to do anything about it anyway," said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. "The new position is yes, this a problem, but we're still not going to do anything about it."
 
Need to Act Now
 Michael Deland, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, told delegates to the international conference today, "Despite huge uncertainty, the potential threat for climate change justifies taking action now," said .
The Administration's plan and Mr. Deland's call to action came today at the first session of an international meeting to begin work on a treaty to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and several other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, like the glass panes of a greenhouse.
The 10-day meeting, which attracted delegates from 130 nations, is the first of 5 scheduled to culminate in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 with the signing of a treaty to take new economic, environmental and scientific steps to curb the warming.
 
Relief and Derision
 Mr. Deland's remarks and the White House proposal were greeted today with a mixture of relief and derision. Leaders of American environmental groups and some delegates said they indicated a new willingness by the Bush Administration to pursue strategies to reduce the threat of global warming. Other Administration officials, notably William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, have voiced alarm over threatened global warming, but until now the White House position was that the threat had not been proved.
The critics of the Administration also noted that the White House proposals appeared to be more of a public relations move because they did not commit the United States to take any actions to reduce carbon dioxide, the most important of the gases involving in global warming. In fact, under the proposal, the production of carbon dioxide would rise by the year 2000 to 1.5 billion tons a year from 1.3 billion tons in 1987.
Three-quarters of the roughly five billion tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from human activity is produced by the industrialized countries, and the United States is responsible for nearly a quarter of the total.
 
Cut in Chlorofluorocarbons
 The increase in production of carbon dioxide, according to the Bush Administration's plan, would be offset by a reduction in the production of chlorofluorocarbons, a chemical used as a coolant and linked to the destruction of the atmospheric ozone shield. Almost four years ago in Montreal, the United States and other industrialized countries agreed to cut the production of chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent. Last summer, the same nations agreed to phase out the chemical's production by the turn of the century.
Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund said: "This plan does not commit the United States to anything painful that hasn't been done already. But what is important is that we have a specific plan that the Administration says it's committed to. It's conceptually important that for the first time they are accepting targets. It is significant from a political perspective."
Before the conference ends on Feb. 14, delegates are scheduled to designate the members of three or four committees that will draft specific recommendations for reducing the threat of global warming. The committees are expected to consider proposals to reduce greenhouse gases and to preserve forests, which absorb carbon dioxide; ways to help less developed nations conform to a treaty, and the proposed legal text of the treaty.
The United States has proposed that a fourth committee be formed to provide the other committees with the latest research data on global warming.
Officials of other nations, especially the Europeans, oppose the proposal, saying that the best source of data is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 300 of the world's leading climate experts, organized by the United Nations to provide such research data.
 
National Energy Guide
 As part of its new plan for stabilizing the production of the gases that are linked to the changing climate, the White House today said that it was relying on aspects of its long-awaited national energy strategy. Conserving energy would reduce the production of such gases, the White House said.
Among the proposals outlined today was a plan by the White House to press for new standards to make appliances more efficient. Such standards could reduce the consumption of energy 7 to 8 percent by the turn of the century, and 15 percent by the year 2010. Large appliances, the White House said, account for more than two-thirds of the energy used in homes.
The White House also wants to increase its program to train engineers who can audit and improve the consumption patterns of more than 350,000 industrial plants in the United States.
The Federal Government will also be pressed to come up with new programs to reduce the consumption of energy for lighting. A quarter of the Government's energy consumption is for lighting offices, factories, military bases, and other installations, according to the White House. Improving lighting could reduce the production of the gases linked to the greenhouse effect by an amount equivalent to 1.4 million metric tons of carbon.

HEADLINE: Budget Deceit, Punctured;
And This Deficit Is No Demon

 BODY:
The Federal deficit for fiscal 1991 will exceed $300 billion, and next year's won't be much lower. These are chilling facts, enough to make critics belittle last year's budget accord and fear for the health of the economy. 
 The criticism and fear are unwarranted. The deficits projected for this year and next are swollen by factors like war and recession, surely serious but also temporary. They do not threaten the long-term health of the economy. What does matter is the structural deficit, which results from ongoing Federal programs.
By this measure, the budget projections released yesterday by the White House -- like earlier projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office -- show the structural deficit heading steadily downward. That's sound; to cut more during a recession would be reckless.
Much of the fear concerning $300 billion deficits arises from misunderstanding. Much of that astronomical figure is for the war, the bailout of savings and loan institutions and the recession, when tax revenues fall and welfare costs rise. But each of these factors is temporary and poses no grave threat. During recessions, corporate borrowing falls off and is not threatened by an extra $50 billion or so of Federal borrowing. And when the Treasury borrows $100 billion to replenish the bank accounts at insolvent S.& L.'s, the money is put right back into the capital market for corporations to borrow.
Even as the actual deficit continues to rise, the structural deficit continues to fall, primarily because of last fall's $500 billion deficit reduction package. Once the economy recovers in 1995, the Administration's new budget projects the deficit falling to near zero. The Congressional Budget Office thinks it will be more like $100 billion. But even that figure would be less than 1 percent of gross national product for the first time in two decades.
The $500 billion deficit reduction package met Congress's duty to control borrowing for recurring Federal programs. As long as it doesn't renege on the accord, the economy will be well served.

HEADLINE: Budget Deceit, Punctured;
But Defense Still Stands Alone

 BODY:
On the surface, Budget Day in Washington yesterday seemed bland, even boring. In truth it was a remarkable occasion, because for once, the Government avoided its annual plunge into the solemnly ridiculous.
In the usual gavotte, the White House piously presents rosy estimates that make the projected deficit look deceptively small, lessening the need to cut programs or raise taxes. Last year, for instance, Michael Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, estimated that the 1991 deficit would be $100 billion. In fact, it turned out to be over $300 billion. 
 This year is different: no tricks, no exaggeration. Yesterday Mr. Boskin fearlessly projected the 1992 deficit at $280 billion. Why the newfound candor? Because the budget law passed last fall eliminated any incentive for the White House or Congress to dissemble or deceive. The candor is wholeheartedly welcome. Defense spending remains unwisely shielded from debate, but in other respects the new process opens the way for honest fights over issues that matter.
 Until this year, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law required Congress to meet yearly targets for the Federal deficit. That produced an irresistible incentive to pretend the deficit was smaller than it really was. Last year the trickery ballooned beyond disguise, and Congress changed the law. It created a pay-as-you-go regime. If it passes a law that adds to spending or cuts taxes, it must make offsetting changes. But the Government is allowed to tolerate any deficit increase that is not caused by explicit Congressional act.
Thus Mr. Boskin did not need to disguise next year's huge, and growing, deficit because it is caused by external factors: the war, the recession, the cost of the savings and loan bailout and the decision last fall to hold down the first year of deficit cuts to protect a fragile economy.
The new law makes good economic sense. Cutting spending or raising taxes would be lethal in recession. And the recession, like war and the S.& L. bailout, is temporary. These needs do not create a permanent drain.
There is another reason that budget negotiations will now be less shrill. Congress set separate spending ceilings for the military, foreign assistance and domestic discretionary programs. That eliminates a whole dimension of debate. The law contemplates shifting money within each category, but does not allow shifting money between categories -- from the military, say, to education.
By so doing, Congress unwisely ducked the budget issue that counts most: how to apportion between defense and other spending. That glaring mistake aside, the new law insures a clearer budget and a wiser debate.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Jumbo Was a Humbug

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Here's a big development in soap, and big developments in soap must be important for America because if somebody asked, "What does America mean to you?" you wouldn't list very many other items ahead of soap, would you?
 The flag and baseball, yes. Maybe Abraham Lincoln. Those are tops. But after that, soap is right up there, and don't tell me you'd put family and motherhood ahead of soap. Thousands of families, many of them containing mothers, give up in divorce every day. Divorce or no divorce, nobody gives up soap. 
 Without soap there would be no soap opera. Clothing would not be twice as clean and white clothing would not be twice as white. Scalps would not be magically freed of unsightly dandruff without painful scraping which, in severe cases, might require shaving the head bald.
 Without soap, what would Presidential candidates be sold like by political technicians? Ever since President Eisenhower's ad agency boasted it had "sold him like soap," that's how all Presidential candidates have been sold. Like soap. Not all sold well, but neither do all soaps.
 So here is the new soap thing: "downsizing," it's called in American Newspeak. Those gigantic boxes of laundry soap you haul home from the grocery -- it turns out they don't have to be gigantic, after all. They never did. So the soap people are going to make them small.
 Apparently the detergent folks were fluffing up their detergents with filler like sodium carbonate, which has no soap power whatever. They wanted to justify a bigger box so customers would think they were getting more for their money.
 Theirs was the old traditional marketing theory that America was a big country full of big people who wanted big consumer goods. The theory's ultimate product may have been the giant family-size car: 300 horsepower, eight cylinders, eight miles per gallon.
 I once had such a car and loved it because it could be packed for a Maine vacation with wife and husband, three adolescent children, one grandmother, a 10-gallon aquarium tank, two cats and supporting cat-litter box, a three-week luggage supply for everyone, and four collapsible lawn chairs.
 Even then it still had a few feet of empty, unusable space between its bumpers and serious automotive organs front and back. This had been thrown in, like the detergent industry's sodium carbonate, to give me a sense of getting more for my money.
 Germany, Japan and the oil cartel wiped out this car by selling Americans on the dubious principle that less is more. As a result I eventually faced a nasty dilemma: Give up family vacations? Or tell grandmother and the children to tuck the aquarium and cats under arm and start hitchhiking toward Maine?
 The giant family-size car was done in by nasty economics, but that isn't the case with the jumbo detergent box. Sure, shrinking the thing until it's not much bigger than a box of steel-wool scouring pads will free some shelf space for supermarkets, but the soap people say that reducing packaging responds to rising environmental concerns.
 In short, if the public is passionately persuaded that less is more, maybe business will follow. It's said you don't lose any soap power from the small boxes, just the filler. With the smaller package, you use a lot less per laundry. Anyhow, that's the soap industry's story.
 Soap being one of the quintessentials of America, does this shrinkage portend a new age of smallness? It hasn't dawned on supermarket coffee shelves. Most coffee companies have surreptitiously reduced their standard marketing unit from one pound to 12 ounces without shrinking the familiar pound-sized container to a smaller, less-is-more, 12-ounce can.
 In this case perhaps coffee tycoons fear that the more which would result from the less would consist only in complaints about the 25 percent price increase.
 Evidence of romance with shrinkage is rampant, however, in the electronic-appliance industry. For instance, the compact disk, which is smaller than the old phonograph record, reproduces music better than music has ever been reproduced before, provided the music to be reproduced is not on your old phonograph records, in which case it is useless.
 Something similar has happened to personal computers. Old ones worked with 5.25-inch floppy disks. Disk size for new ones has been shrunk to 3.5 inches. The machines using 3.5 disks are superior, unless you need to work on your old 5.25 disks, in which case they are useless.
 Could this be a new law of developing technology: Useless is better?

HEADLINE: But Are There Enough Jobs for the Poor?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your series on poverty in America ("The Missing Agenda: Poverty and Policy," Jan. 27, 28, 29), while hitting most of the issues, missed the biggest one: Are there enough jobs for the poor?
If the number of low-income welfare recipients, unemployed and "discouraged workers" is less than the supply of available jobs, then either the conventional conservative solution (increase motivation by cutting benefits) or the conventional liberal solution (remove barriers to entry such as racial discrimination and lack of job training) may be sound public policy.
If, on the other hand, the number of those whom we expect to work substantially exceeds the supply of available jobs, then neither motivation nor the removal of barriers will do much good. Most of the poor will remain poor -- because there will literally be too few jobs for them to fill.
We don't have a lot of data as to how the number of persons expected to work compares to the supply of unfilled jobs, but such data as do exist all point to the same conclusion: The supply of officially unemployed workers alone exceeds the supply of unfilled jobs.
National studies by Katherine Abraham and Harry Holzer show that -- depending on the official unemployment rate -- the number of officially unemployed consistently exceeds the number of unfilled jobs by ratios ranging from 10:1 to 3:1. When welfare recipients and "discouraged workers" are thrown into the mix, the ratios get worse. In Milwaukee, a forthcoming study by the Social Development Commission will show that, since 1987, the sum of welfare recipients plus unemployed plus discouraged workers has exceeded the estimated supply of unfilled jobs by ratios ranging from 10:1 to 6:1. And this when the official jobless rate was generally below both state and national averages.
As I suggest in my recent book, "The Prisoners of Welfare: Liberating America's Poor from Unemployment and Low Wages," while any individual's poverty in the United States may be the result of inadequate motivation or frustrating barriers to entry, aggregate poverty in this country is the result of two simple shortcomings of the labor market: too few jobs, and too many jobs that pay wages too low.
To eliminate poverty, therefore, it is necessary to correct for these two basic labor market deficiencies. Empowering the poor -- as that concept is defined by Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, i.e., letting the poor choose to enroll in any school, buy public housing units, etc. -- however meritorious, will not work, because empowerment neither creates millions of new extra jobs nor augments the earnings provided by the low-wage jobs at the bottom of the wage structure. More or better social services won't work either, for the same reasons: No new jobs are created and wages are not augmented.
Welfare reform generally won't work either, and again for largely the same reasons. Reform usually does not expand the supply of jobs, and it usually does not function to supplement low wages. To the extent that some welfare reform initiatives do achieve these goals, they suffer from two fundamental flaws. First, welfare reform's efforts to create jobs (by "workfare" or other means) or bolster wages (by letting benefits remain in place after recipients get employment) terminate at some fixed point in time. Second, and worse, welfare reform's attempts to
create jobs or bolster wages help only the relatively small percentage of poor who get welfare in the first place. Welfare reform by its very nature does not help the vast majority of poor -- who aren't on welfare -- to get jobs or augment earnings.
The poor will benefit, of course, from any general expansion of employment in the economy -- the last solution mentioned in your series. It is universally acknowledged, however, that the poor benefit in only a limited way when employment expands across the board. Too many of the new jobs are taken by non-poor competitors (such as teen-agers, college students, second-earners, and the elderly), who always enter and advance quickly in the queue for "untargeted" new jobs when more jobs are created on a general scale. One can hardly begrudge these competitors: while not officially poor, many are far from well-off. They need the money too.
In the final analysis, there are only two practical methods of ending poverty in the United States. Give the poor money -- so much money that they get out of poverty. Or get the poor into jobs -- and then make sure the jobs they then take or already hold (for most poor adults work in the first place) yield an "earnings-related income," consisting of wages and earnings supplements, higher than the poverty line. Only these two approaches correct for the basic problem: the economy's shortage of jobs and its plethora of low-wage jobs.
The first solution, whether it be called the Guaranteed Annual Income or the Negative Income Tax or something else, fell from grace over a decade ago. And for good reason. The poor don't want free money: they want jobs. And the rest of us don't want to give the poor free money: we expect the overwhelming majority of them, who are fit for work, to perform work to earn a living, just like us.
The second solution -- basically, a combination of a revived Civilian Conservation Corps and an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit -- thus emerges as the only practical, justifiable and politically acceptable solution to poverty in the United States. I add politically acceptable with care. Public opinion poll after public opinion poll has confirmed that the great majority of Americans believe that the unemployed poor should be offered community service employment if they cannot secure jobs in the private sector.
A revived C.C.C., an expanded E.I.T.C., and some help (based on ability to pay) with the high cost of child and health care -- financed by eliminating Aid to Families With Dependent Children, Food Stamps, half of Medicaid, and most every other Federal program that deals with the symptoms of poverty -- is the combination of public policies that the United States needs to transform its missing agenda into its rediscovery of justice.

HEADLINE: Employers Favor Student 'Warranty'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We commend Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez's proposal to provide a warranty of employability to high school students. As "A 'Guarantee' for Graduates" (editorial, Jan. 15) points out, New York City employers complain that many graduates often lack the skills and the basic performance standards of the workplace.
In December 1989 we recommended to Mayor David N. Dinkins a strategy for economic growth in the 1990's. That strategy called for a variety of initiatives, including the creation of a curricular work experience program in the city's high schools that would lead to a certificate of employability, testifying that the graduates are ready for the workplace.
An information-intensive economy can be supported only by a work force with strong language, computation, problem-solving, communication and interpersonal skills. A certificate of employability could be a major step toward bridging the skills gap among thousands of unemployed youth in our city and the demands of a modern economy.

HEADLINE: Europe Has Its Share Of Airline Problems

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Airlines in the United States are not the only ones reeling from the Persian Gulf war. Uncertainty and a fear of terrorism generated by the conflict have also severely depressed the business of European airlines, which like American carriers had already been hit hard when fuel prices soared last year after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Slowing economies in Europe, especially in Britain and Sweden, have also hurt the airline business. All told, major European airlines are reporting that the number of passengers has dropped 10 to 30 percent, and they have been cutting domestic and international service accordingly. 
 According to the 21-member Association of European Airlines, international flights within Europe were only 35 percent full in the last week of January. Lufthansa's planes have been flying 40 percent full on average since the war broke out, down from 60 percent. Late last month, London's two biggest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, reported passenger traffic down 24 and 19 percent, respectively, from a year earlier.
Some carriers, including Scandinavian Airlines System and Air France, have announced plans to delay or cancel plane orders, although Air France said it made the decision before the war broke out. S.A.S. has also announced plans to reduce employment by 3,500, or 15.9 percent, by the end of 1992.
Olympic Airways, owned by the Greek Government, said it would have difficulty staying in business if the industry remained depressed for long. "For the time being, we are surviving, but who knows about the future," said Mark Xenakis, Olympic's assistant director general. He said Olympic had lost $67 million since the gulf crisis began in early August.
Besides Olympic, other airlines that might have trouble surviving in their current form include Alitalia of Italy, Sabena of Belgium and Iberia of Spain, said Richard Whitaker, editor of Airline Business, a trade magazine based in Sutton, England.
The European airlines' troubles have raised questions about whether the European Community will slow its program aimed at increasing competition and reducing state subsidies. "That's the big unknown today," said Andrew Chambers, a London-based analyst at Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd.
Most of the major European carriers are either completely or partly state-owned, and many were struggling even before the gulf crisis. These include Alitalia, Sabena, Iberia, Air France and, to a lesser extent, Lufthansa of Germany.
While the 21 carriers in the Association of European Airlines earned a total of $1.1 billion in 1989, the group undoubtedly suffered an operating loss in 1990, its first since 1981, said David Henderson, the association's manager of statistical information.
Mr. Whitaker wondered how many governments would be willing to continue to pour money into their national carriers. If the losses become too great, "it may change people's minds as to whether every country should have a flag carrier," he said.
The Belgian Government has already indicated its intention to reduce its stake in Sabena S.A., parent of Sabena Belgian World Airlines, to 26 percent from about 54 percent. The Government wants the company to find outside investors.
 
Sabena Deal Collapsed
 A deal that would have given British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines each a 20 percent stake in the Sabena airline fell apart in December. At that time, Sabena said it expected its airline to lose as much as five billion Belgian francs ($158.3 million) in 1990.
Industry executives and analysts say that if the difficulties persist, some airlines will urge the European Commission, the community's executive branch, to ease its opposition to state subsidies and to permit big carriers to cooperate in ways that might seem anti-competitive.
The community has already taken steps to allow more competition in fares, but some industry executives would undoubtedly like to see delays on other planned actions. These include changes in the system for allocating landing and takeoff rights that could take rights away from big carriers, and opening international and domestic markets to much more competition.
"We don't think there will be any substantial delays or changes" in the deregulation program, said David Burnside, a spokesman for British Airways, which has generally been one of the strongest industry supporters of deregulation.
Carel Paauwe, the Amsterdam-based head of the transportation practice of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, said the pace of deregulation would not slow very much unless the downturn dragged on and threatened the survival of some big airlines. "If one or two were really in danger of going under, then I think governments would have second thoughts," he said.
 
Hiring of Pilots Is an Issue
 Airlines would like to see cuts in airport fees, which are much higher in Europe than in the United States. They have also urged the commission to delay communitywide limits on how many hours pilots can fly and to make it easier for a carrier in one country to hire pilots in other nations where salaries are lower, said Stephen Wheatcroft, a London-based industry consultant and former executive at British Airways.
The major European carriers that have been the most profitable are British Airways, which has been investor-owned since 1987; KLM, which is 38 percent owned by the Netherlands, and Scandinavian Airlines System, which is half-owned by the Governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway. But after being stung by the leap in fuel prices and the plunge in the number of passengers, analysts think that even the relatively efficient airlines are operating in the red.
British Airways, Europe's biggest carrier, said it expects to report a loss for the second half of its current fiscal year (the six months that end March 31). In reaction to the sharp downturn in business, it has cut its global service by 10.5 percent on average. The airline had previously announced it was abandoning service between Britain and the Irish Republic, beginning in March.
 
Talk of Layoffs
 Before the war broke out, British Airways had announced plans to cut costs by at least 100 million ($197.7 million) by the end of 1991. While it originally said these plans would not involve large layoffs, reports in British newspapers say the airline now has contingency plans to lay off up to 5,000 workers, or 10 percent of its work force. A spokesman would neither confirm nor deny those figures. The spokesman said no layoffs were imminent but the airline might have to resort to such action.
British Airways has told employees they can take up to three months of unpaid leave. To encourage that, it has offered to give free tickets to employees and their families to anywhere the airline flies if the employee takes at least one month off.
The airline has delayed until spring its plans to order planes to replace its fleet of 25 Lockheed Tristar and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jetliners. It had planned to place the order by the end of last year.
Scandinavian Airlines System aims to cut its costs by three billion kronor ($540.1 million) by the end of 1992. S.A.S., which says the number of passengers has fallen by 20 to 40 percent, depending on the route, is cutting its flights by about 15 percent, said John Herbert, an S.A.S. spokesman. S.A.S. executives have said the airline probably broke even in 1990.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said last week that it would drastically cut service to European and United States destinations. The carrier will cut its capacity within Europe by 20 percent by canceling and combining flights and using smaller aircraft. Nine of KLM's 49 destinations in the United States are being dropped.
 
Cutbacks at Air France
 Air France has cut service in Europe but would not say by how much. In the week of Jan. 15-21, the week the Iraq war started, its traffic was down 16 percent from a year earlier. Even before the war, Air France had imposed a freeze on most hiring and announced plans to reduce or eliminate service on unprofitable routes.
The company, which also owns two smaller French carriers, Air Inter and Union des Transports Ariens, has delayed by one year the delivery of seven long-range Airbus 340's, which it was supposed to receive in the 1994-96 period. It has also delayed the delivery of six other planes it has options to buy and canceled options on seven other planes.
Lufthansa has cut 120 of its 1,000 or so flights to destinations in Europe, mainly within Germany, until at least Feb. 27. While Lufthansa is not contemplating layoffs, it is talking with worker representatives about reducing overtime, encouraging employees to take leftover vacation now and moving up training. Lufthansa executives say the airline will report a small profit for 1990 as a whole because traffic rose sharply in November and December as a result of German reunification.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: The Overview;
PRESIDENT SUBMITS SPENDING PACKAGE TIED TO OPTIMISM

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
President Bush today sent Congress a 1992 budget request of $1.45 trillion that admittedly understates the cost of the Persian Gulf war, offers no measures to combat the recession and seeks to redistribute some Federal subsidies that now go to the most affluent.
The President's budget, for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, tries to pull together the strands of his domestic policy into a semblance of a coherent whole, proposing selective increases in money for education, children's health care, highways and scientific research. 
 It also reflects the most comprehensive effort yet to reshape the American military in the face of international political changes, although some significant questions were left unanswered in Mr. Bush's request for the Pentagon. [Page A18.]
 
Growth in Benefits Lamented
 The director of the Office of Management and Budget, Richard G. Darman, echoed remarks made by a predecessor a decade ago as he lamented "explosive growth" in Federal benefit payments to individuals. Mr. Bush's budget would cut $46.6 billion from the projected total of such spending over the next five years, including $25 billion from Medicare and $3.5 billion from veterans' benefits. Mr. Darman's words, in a statement accompanying Mr. Bush's proposals, were reminiscent of those made by David A. Stockman, the first budget director in the Reagan Administration.
Indeed, perhaps the most politically explosive elements of the budget are proposals to curtail benefits that middle- and upper-income families receive through Medicare, farm price supports, the school lunch program and Pell Grants for college students.
The intitial reaction from some leading Congressional Democrats was cool, but they did not reject Mr. Bush's proposals out of hand.
"It's pretty much what we expected," said Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, chairman of the House Budget Committee. Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said Mr. Bush was recycling "hoary old mossback proposals," including Medicare cuts, that had been repeatedly rejected.
 
Byrd and Nunn Comment
 But Senate Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, expressed satisfaction that Mr. Bush was finally showing interest in programs that Mr. Byrd has championed for years. By investing in selected health, education, transportation and research programs, the Bush budget would "start to reverse the trends of past years," said Mr. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat.
And Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Bush's military budget, which would be 1 percent lower than this year's spending, was generally "the right way to proceed," in view of a diminished threat from the Soviet Union.
As the Congressional debate over the budget proceeds in the months ahead, perhaps the biggest fights will deal with the President's proposals to slash benefits to relatively well-off Americans. For instance, for elderly people with incomes over $125,000 a year, Medicare premiums, set at $31.80 a month next year under current law, would nearly triple, and the Agriculture Department would stop paying crop subsidies to farmers who have non-farm income of more than $125,000.
About 550,000 of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries have annual incomes over $125,000. Raising their premiums would save the Government $1.2 billion over five years, the Administration estimated. In recent years, the Government has paid crop subsidies to more than 10,000 people with at least $125,000 of income from sources unrelated to agriculture. The Government says it could save $396 million over five years by eliminating such payments.
 
Focus on College Aid
 Mr. Bush, like President Ronald Reagan before him, said he wanted to "reduce governmental subsidies for those who are not in need." In some cases, the savings would be redistributed to low-income people, as Mr. Bush tries to seize the "fairness" issue from Democrats.
Thus, for example, the maximum Pell Grant, now $2,400, would be increased next year to $3,700, and the rules would be revised so that most of the aid goes to "students from the lowest-income families," meaning those with incomes of less than $10,000 a year.
But the benefits that affluent people lose under Mr. Bush's proposals would be dwarfed by the benefits that some of them receive from his proposal to cut the Federal tax on profits from investments. As a result of this proposal, the capital gains tax would be capped at rates that would depend on the length of time that the sold assets had been held. The lowest rate, for assets held at least three years, would be 19.6 percent.
Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group that favors the strengthening of welfare programs, said, "Large new benefits would be conferred on the wealthiest Americans, primarily through a capital gains tax cut, while no additional support whatsoever is provided to workers who are unemployed and cannot find new jobs."
 
Optimistic on Recession
 Mr. Bush said there was no need for new spending to stimulate the economy because the recession would be over by midyear. Mr. Bush proposed no additional benefits for the unemployed. Indeed, he proposed to eliminate Federal benefits paid to workers who lose their jobs as a result of competition from imports.
Mr. Bush said he foresaw deficits of $318 billion this year and $281 billion next year, far higher than the record of $221 billion set in 1986. Those numbers are almost certainly too optimistic; in addition to its assumption about the recession, Mr. Bush's budget, by his own admission, understates the cost of the Persian Gulf war.
Because the war began after the appropriations bills for the 1991 fiscal year were enacted, it was not until today, with the release of the 1992 budget, that the Administration started taking account of the costs. The budget assumes $8.2 billion for such costs in the current fiscal year and $4.6 billion in 1992.
The war is estimated to cost at least $500 million a day, which far exceeds the budget's assumptions. But Mr. Darman said that foreign contributions are $51 billion to date and that the Administration would send Congress a supplemental request for more money in a few months.
 
Many Programs Are Targets
 Mr. Bush's budget would end 238 domestic programs and 64 military programs, saving $4.6 billion and $7 billion, respectively.
Mr. Bush's military budget envisions a slow, steady decline in Pentagon spending. Mr. Bush would halt the Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the Navy's Trident ballistic missile submarine and the Air Force F-16 fighter jet.
But the President seeks a 58 percent increase in the space-based missile defense system known as "Star Wars," to $4.6 billion next year, a request quickly derided as unrealistic by Democrats.
Interest payments on the Federal debt eat up $206.3 billion, or more than 14 percent of all Federal spending in Mr. Bush's budget for 1992. Federal debt held by the public soared from $785 billion in 1981, when Mr. Reagan took office, to $2.7 trillion this year and will reach nearly $3 trillion next year, Mr. Bush reported.
 
Children's Health Issues
 Mr. Bush said his budget emphasizes investment in preventive health programs, especially those for children. Spending on the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, would rise $223 million, to $2.6 billion next year from $2.4 billion this year.
The President's budget contains some apparent contradictions. While increasing the overall budget of the Education Department, Mr. Bush said he wants to slash Federal grants to public libraries, to $35 million from $84 million this year.
While boasting that his budget would increase spending on selected programs for children like Head Start, Mr. Bush proposes to cut funds for foster care by 16 percent.
Mr. Bush proposes to spend a total of $83 billion over the next five years to build and repair highways and bridges. Annual outlays would rise steadily, from $14.4 billion in 1992 to $17.9 billion in 1996.
Mr. Bush's economic forecast, showing economic growth of nine-tenths of 1 percent this year, after adjustment for inflation, was similar to estimates by private forecasters. But Mr. Darman, like many of his predecessors, offered an optimistic projection of the deficit, saying it would drop to $2.9 billion in 1995.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday summarizing the Bush Administration's domestic spending proposals for the 1992 fiscal year misstated the amount of an increase in spending for the Federal Aviation Administration. Spending would rise 14 percent, to $9.3 billion,not 10 percent, to $4.5 billion. The article also referred incorrectly to a spending proposal for Amtrak. That Administration request, for $485 million, is the first request in seven years for any funds for the passenger rail service, not the first in seven years for an increase.

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Editor of Journal Envisions New Directions and Lighter Tone

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
ON July 1, Dr. Jerome P. Kassirer, a 58-year-old expert in kidney disorders, will become editor of The New England Journal of Medicine and one of the world's most powerful doctors.
For a physician like Dr. Kassirer with a rich background in medical editing and a flair for writing, the prospect of editing a journal that has long been an acknowledged leader in scientific research and opinion would surely seem appealing. 
 Yet six weeks ago, Dr. Kassirer said he would have dismissed as "crazy" any notion that he wanted the job. Indeed, when the journal issued a call for applicants for the post a few months ago, he was uninterested.
But colleagues, including his wife, Sheridan, a hospital administrator, told him he would be a good candidate for the job. And last week the once reluctant candidate said he was "thrilled" to succeed the retiring editor, Dr. Arnold S. Relman, who is 68.
By choosing which research papers to publish and which to reject, the editor can help shape medical practice and strongly influence grants for future research projects and for academic promotions. In recent decades, the journal has emphasized economic and social issues involving health care, and the editor's power to write and select editorials can influence political agendas.
Dr. Relman, for instance, wrote editorials criticizing the medical-industrial complex, medical practiceand social and economic issues that drew praise from many. But they also angered organized medicine, including members of the Massachusetts Medical Society, the journal's owner. By refusing to publish papers if the findings have been previously publicized, the journal has left many researchers unwilling to discuss their work ahead of time. This policy has been criticized for causing delays in applying new treatments and possibly deaths.
Although he said he was "not a power seeker," Dr. Kassirer acknowledged in an interview that his seat was one of the most visible and hottest in medicine and that journal editors had enormous power because of their role as stewards of medical knowledge.
Dr. Kassirer said that he had been assured of independence from the medical society and that he intended to speak out on various issues after learning his new job. His first task will be to take a fresh look at every page of the journal and its policies.
"Medical journals shouldn't be static " he said. "They should change. What directions we'll go in are up for grabs."
 Founded in Boston in 1812, The New England Journal of Medicine describes itself as the oldest continually published medical journal in the world. Dr. Kassirer will be its 38th editor.
He told the committee that selected him that he hoped to lighten the tone of the journal and improve its readability. An experienced medical columnist, he writes in a chatty style with a light touch and has a knack for catchier headlines than those in most scientific journals.
Although he will be editing a journal for doctors, one eye will be on the public. "Increasingly the general public are the readers of the journal," he said, because reports of new advances affect medical practice and health policy and the contents are transmitted to the public through news organizations.
The medical society said it chose Dr. Kassirer after a worldwide search. Yet, like all previous searches, the latest came back for an editor who had worked in Boston.
There, Dr. Kassirer is associate physician-in-chief of the New England Medical Center. For 32 years, he has also taught and done research at Tufts University School of Medicine. His team has pioneered in developing mathematical methods to analyze the way doctors make decisions about diagnosing and treating patients, particularly those with difficult problems.
He has long advocated the idea that doctors should help patients participate in decisions about their own care, saying doctors must not abdicate their responsibility in informing patients about the medical facts in their cases.
In his research, Dr. Kassirer has fed chunks of data to clinicians who are asked to think aloud as they try to solve a clinical problem. The researchers record the doctors' comments and later trace the thought processes.
Dr. Kassirer has been a critic of the teaching and practice that leads doctors to order excessive numbers of costly and sometimes dangerous tests in a stubborn quest for diagnostic certainty that often outweighs common sense. He has called for further study to determine how much, if any, quality would be lost if the number of tests was cut.
Many tests are carried out merely to confirm a diagnosis that is virtually certain, and there is need to weed out tests and procedures that are ineffective or superfluous, Dr. Kassirer said. He traces part of the problem to medical textbooks that he says "are rife with absolutes."
For six years, Dr. Kassirer has written a popular column on clinical decision making for Hospital Practice, which HP Publishing Company publishes in New York City. In one column he analyzed how a doctor made the right diagnosis for the wrong reasons. In another, he described how a doctor made the wrong diagnosis, ordered the wrong tests and prescribed the wrong treatment.
Dr. Kassirer has also helped edit a section of Kidney International, a monthly specialty journal published by Springer-Verlag in New York City. He said that he had learned "how poorly many supposedly distinguished researchers and clinicians write" and that "many times I have had to take their papers apart and put them back together again."
 Although he did not intend to become a medical journalist, he said he has had ideal training for his new job.
"If I had to ask myself 15 years ago what would I do to best prepare myself to be editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, I would have done what I did," he said. "But I would never have dreamed that any of that would have led me there."
Dr. Kassirer regularly reads Science and Annals of Internal Medicine as closely as The New England Journal of Medicine. As he began to focus on the nature of the scientific journalism world he was about to enter, Dr. Kassirer said he was dismayed to read an article in Science last week about the increasingly fierce competition among such journals as Nature, Cell and Science to be the first to publish major results.
"In trying to make themselves look the best, the journals overlooked the real reason for doing research, which is to advance science and medicine," Dr. Kassirer said, adding that he "would not have wanted to be one of the editors" cited.
Dr. Kassirer has been an official of the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia but said he never joined the American Medical Association.
"Systemic reforms are needed" in controlling the costs of medical care, making access to care more equitable and reducing the bureaucracy that has built up around health care, he said. But he expressed strong reservations about a Government-run national health insurance plan.
"The Government doesn't always do things particularly well, and since national health insurance involves the Government I am not convinced that would be the best way to go," he said.
With 220,000 subscribers, The New England Journal of Medicine says it has the largest paid circulation of any medical journal. Its profits have soared in recent years. But Dr. Kassirer said the Massachusetts Medical Society cited only the quality of the journal and not its economics as a criterion for renewing his contract when it expires in three years. But he said he would consider a fall in circulation a personal failure.

HEADLINE: Gorbachev to Disregard Lithuanian Vote

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VILNIUS, Lithuania, Feb. 5

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev decreed today that a plebiscite on Lithuanian independence scheduled for Saturday is "without legal foundation," once again challenging the Baltic republic's efforts to break free of the Soviet Union.
"With this poll, the Lithuanian leaders are trying to generate support for their separatist aim," the Soviet press agency Tass said, quoting from the presidential decree. 
 Most Lithuanian officials in the Parliament building, which has been barricaded against Soviet troops since they attacked Lithuanian sites last month, interpreted Mr. Gorbachev's statement as an advance signal that Moscow will not recognize the outcome of the vote, which is expected to be an overwhelming endorsement of independence. They noted that the decree carried no explicit threat, and that Mr. Gorbachev's phrasing was short of declaring the vote illegal.
The Lithuanian President, Vytautas Landsbergis, denounced Mr. Gorbachev's decree as "impermissible political interference in the affairs of the sovereign Lithuanian state."
In a statement issued by his press office, Mr. Landsbergis said, "The decree of the U.S.S.R. President on the Lithuanian citizens' nationwide poll reflects an old tradition of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, according to which law and government derive not from the will of the people expressed by free votes, but are formed by the decree of autocratic rulers."
 
A Proposition Simply Worded
 The sole question Lithuanians will be asked to answer on Saturday is whether they support Lithuania's becoming "an independent democratic republic." Mr. Landsbergis' government has termed called the plebiscite a "public opinion poll," evidently to distinguish it from a more binding referendum.
The question is expected to get an overwhelming "yes" from people of Lithuanian heritage, who account for akmost 80 percent of the republic's population. The response of people of Russian and Polish heritage, who account for much of the rest of the population, is less certain.
Mr. Gorbachev's decree invalidating the Lithuanian plebiscite joined an increasing arsenal that the Kremlin has mobilized to fight a Lithuanian move to leave the Soviet Union. The most dramatic of these were the tanks used by the Soviet Army to storm the television tower on Jan. 12, with the loss of 14 lives. The central Government has also imposed an economic blockade against Lithuania for five months, and has tried a variety of lesser measures and intimidations.
Mr. Gorbachev's latest sally came as Moscow appeared to be floating some conciliatory signals on Lithuania. Last week, the Soviet President appointed a standing commission to negotiate with the Lithuanians, which is expected to arrive in Vilnius on Friday. The Lithuanian authorities, however, say they have yet to receive formal notification of the delegation, and has suggested that the announcement was intended more to placate Western critics.
Other conciliatory signs have included an announcement that the Committee of National Salvation, in whose name Soviet tanks rolled, has been disbanded, and the suspension of nighttime military patrols on Vilnius streets.
 
Stamps Undelivered
 In addition, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunication, Kostas Birulis, said Moscow had agreed to recognize Lithuanian postage stamps -- of which the first batch, printed in Leipzig, Germany, was confiscated at the Lithuanian border.
Mr. Birulis also said that officials from the national radio and television board in Moscow had sounded him out about lifting the military occupation of the Vilnius television tower in exchange for a guarantee of two hours' air time for pro-Moscow programs.
The conciliatory gestures were viewed to some degree as a recognition in the Kremlin that the military raid had done serious damage to Moscow's standing abroad, and in the Soviet Union had only served to fan Lithuanian nationalism, rally support for the Lithuanians' cause in other republics and further undermine Mr. Gorbachev's fading political stature.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Close Nuclear Sub Base in Scotland in '92

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The United States nuclear submarine base at Holy Loch, Scotland, which opened despite strong antiwar protests and British Government misgivings in the early 1960's, will close sometime next year, Defense Secretary Tom King told the House of Commons today.
As eight-engine American B-52 aircraft began flying today into the Royal Air Force base at Fairford, England, to carry out raids against Iraq, Mr. King also said the American F-111 aircraft based in Britain of the type that bombed targets in Libya in 1986 wouldbe replaced beginning in 1992 by a smaller number of more advanced American nuclear-capable F-15E's. 
 The moves made clear that despite the war in the Persian Gulf, the end of the cold war with the Soviet Union still means significant military cutbacks in American and British forces.
A Scottish Labor Party Member of Parliament, Brian Wilson, who took part in the protests against the Holy Loch base when it was set up, said: "I have always been opposed to the American presence there, and I would view their withdrawal with unmitigated enthusiasm. There would obviously be a period of economic adjustment, butthat is going to come some time, and better sooner than later."
Secret British Cabinet papers made public last month showed that Prime Minister Harold Macmillan had tried and failed to persuade President Dwight D. Eisenhower to site the submarine base further away from Glasgow, where 755,000 people now live.
"It would surely be a mistake to put down what will become a major nuclear target so near to the third largest and the most overcrowded city in this country," Mr. Macmillan wrote in a letter to the President in June 1960, when the United States was proposing to locate the base at Gare Loch, about 10miles east of where it eventually was.
The British proposed a much further north and more isolated site at Loch Linnhe, near Fort William, but the United States rejected it as being too far from social amenities and posed unacceptable navigation problems. Britain also tried in vain to get the United States to agree to some form of partial British control over the base and the nuclear weapons that would be carried aboard the submarines, according to the Cabinet papers.
President Eisenhower made little concession, but finally wrote to Mr. Macmillan on Oct. 27, 1960, "In the event of an emergency, such as increased tension or the threat of war, the U.S. will take every possible step to consult with Britain and other allies," according to the British archives. Prime Minister Macmillan announcedthe plan to open the base at Holy Loch on Nov. 1, and the first Polaris submarine sailed in on March 8, 1961.
The announcement that the base would be closed was welcomed today by groups supporting owners of Scottish fishing vessels that have mysteriously vanished without trace in the area, reportedly after submarines running beneath the surface snagged their fishing nets and dragged them under.
Mr. King said the United States Navy would no longer need the base at Holy Loch by the end of this year because it was replacing the obsolete Poseidon missile submarines that used it for repairs and service with bigger Trident boats, four of which are also being bought by the British Navy.
Holy Loch now houses 2,000 American personnel, 1,600 dependents, and employs about 150 Scottish workers.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Surprising Profits Of Futures Funds

BYLINE: By H. J. Maidenberg

 BODY:
SPECULATORS in commodity futures are a curious lot. They make contracts either to buy goods they do not want or to sell goods they have no intention of delivering.
In either case, the overwhelming majority of individual speculators in commodity futures share a common experience: despite the large profit potential in their highly leveraged trading, they lose money. The leverage results because the initial cash outlay required to buy or sell a futures contract is less than 10 percent. 
 Despite these dismal odds, many futures speculators are reluctant to invest in commodity funds because the record of those funds is even more abysmal than the experiences of individuals.
While all this is hardly news to the commodity trading fraternity, many people have been surprised by the uncommonly large profits many publicly offered commodity funds made last year.
Based on the Norwood Index, the most respected measure of such funds' performance, the 135 publicly offered funds produced an aggregate profit of 17.7 percent in 1990, compared with a loss of 5 percent in 1989. In dollar terms, 1990 ended with a gain of $395 million on total equity of $3 billion. There are many other commodity funds, however; the Norwood Index surveys only those that agree to full disclosure of operating results.
"The results for 1990 have been astounding, given the past track record of commodity funds," said Daniel B. Stark, who heads a research firm bearing his name in Palatine, Ill. Mr. Stark now monitors the Norwood Index, which was createdyears ago as a research project by Jay Klopfenstein, who still heads the Norwood Securities Corporation of Chicago, a brokerage house that has never been involved in commodity trading.
Mr. Stark attributed the gains to profits that most funds made from trading currency futures in a year when the dollar was under pressure. "From our study of the trading records, it also seems that the trend followers did quite well," he said.
The big trend in futures in 1990, one that has continued this year, was the steady erosion of prices of both farm and industrial commodities, because of the growing worldwide recession. As the recession became pronounced last fall, interest rates began to decline steadily, which continues to benefit the followers of the trend in financial futures.
In any case, the profits of the monitored funds in 1990 stand in sharp contrast to the results of past years. For many years, transaction costs and other expenses chewed up whatever profits the funds made. The best shareholders could hope for was the common practice of dissolving a fund once it lost 50 percent of its assets, distributing what was left to shareholders.
The poor overall performance of commodity funds, as compared with stock mutual funds, has led many in the industry to experiment with all kinds of trading practices. Perhaps the most successful to date has been that developed through trial and error by the Commodities CorporationU.S.A. of Princeton, N.J., in 1969.
As a result, Robert G. Easton, president and chief executive of the Commodities Corporation, expects the management of commodity funds to undergo a complete change in coming years as more funds and managed accounts emulate his company's system.
"The basic problem was just as apparent in 1969 as it is now," Mr. Easton said. "Those who trade commodity futures, as well as those who invest in funds, have the cards stacked against them. Why? For one, the average futures broker depends on commissions for the bulk of his income." Another, more recent problem, he said, is that research departments have been cut back, "the first casualty of the brokerage industry's drive to cut overhead at a time of shrinking profits."
The founders of the Commodities Corporation, who include Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economics who is still active in the company, believed that a different breed of futures broker had to be developed, along with a new set of trading controls and practices.
The Commodities Corporation, for example, uses more than 160 independent traders to trade futures for its public funds, which are distributed through various brokerage houses. It also manages the accounts of wealthy individual speculators, and it services insurance companies, pension funds and other institutions that increasingly hedge their investments in the futures market.
"We don't care if the trader we use operates from a yacht on the French Riviera or from a cabin in Alaska or from the floor of one of the commodity exchanges," said Barry I. Bregman, vice president-human resources of the Commodities Corporation. "All we are interested in is the trading profits -- not commissions -- they produce for our various funds and clients."

HEADLINE: Orders to Factories Showed No Change in December

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Despite huge purchases of military goods and commercial aircraft, the overall level of orders to factories was unchanged in December, helping depress the increase for all of 1990 to a meager 1.4 percent, the Government reported today.
Some analysts said the report, which showed the worst performance in four years, was an indication that the recession may not be as mild as predicted. 
 "The economy very clearly is in trouble," said Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Company in New York. "This is going to be a very typical-to-severe recession."
 
Job Losses Cited
 Elliott Platt, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, agreed that the recession "may be more severe than we originally thought," in light of the recent data, including a huge loss of jobs in January.
The Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable and nondurable goods totaled $235.6 billion in December. For the year, orders edged up 1.4 percent, to $2.9 trillion, the smallest gain since 1986, when orders fell 1.2 percent.
The report also said orders plunged a revised 5.8 percent in November, the largest drop since a 7 percent decline in December 1974. The November decline was first estimated at 5.9 percent.
December figures reported earlier by the Labor Department showed that factory payrolls fell by 33,000 that month, bringing to nearly 600,000 the number of manufacturing jobs lost since December 1989. Last week, in its report for January, the Labor Department said the unemployment rate had climbed to 6.2 percent, the highest since 1987, and that another 69,000 factory jobs had been lost.
The Commerce Department report today said orders for durable goods -- expensive items expected to last more than three years -- advanced 3.4 percent, to $120.3 billion, even slower than the 4.4 percent gain first reported last week. But that failed to make up for a 10.1 percent drop a month earlier.
The report said that the increase was concentrated in military and commercial aircraft orders and that excluding those categories, orders fell 4.7 percent in December.
 
'Erratic Movements'
 The overall durable goods increase was offset by a 3.4 percent decline in nondurable goods, to $115.3 billion. The decline, the second consecutive monthly drop, reflected "erratic movements in the petroleum, chemicals and tobacco industries," the department said.
In the durables category, the transportation sector posted a 13.6 percent gain, to $32 billion, after falling 25.3 percent in November. Military orders and commercial aircraft bookings more than offset a large decline in motor vehicle orders. But excluding transportation, orders fell 1.9 percent.
Military orders were up 59.8 percent, to $8.4 billion. Analysts attributed it to the military buildup in the Persian Gulf. Excluding the military sector, factory orders fell 1.4 percent. Military orders had fallen 26.9 percent in November.
Orders for electrical machinery increased 12.6 percent, to $20.8 billion, rebounding from a 7.2 percent loss a month earlier. Most of the gain was attributed to communications equipment. But nonelectrical machinery orders fell 6.9 percent, to $20.6 billion. The decline was the third straight drop, including a fall of five-tenths of 1 percent in November.

HEADLINE: As Many Fall, Project's Survivors Struggle On

SERIES: Life in The Towers: Home In a Hard Place - Last of three articles.

BYLINE: By DON TERRY

 BODY:
On a crisp winter afternoon, a half-dozen middle-aged black men huddled around a chess table in the shadow of the Martin Luther King Jr. Towers in Harlem.
The men grew up together in the project. Back then they didn't play much chess. When they were teen-agers, they called themselves the 115th Street Boys or the Imperial Knights, a rumble-ready gang of lean, tough youths from the ghetto. 
 Thirty years later, still hanging out together in the project when work and family allow, they call themselves the Survivors.
 
'So Many Brothers Never Made It'
 Many of their friends and dreams died young long, long ago. But these men -- Vic, Walt, Rog and the other "brothers" -- have made it through the hard times, the gang fights, the closed factories and the bitter disappointments that have fallen on them and theirs like a harsh rain.
"I'm lucky to be alive," said Victor Buford, a 48-year-old former boxer who fought for as little as $50 a night before things really got bad. "So many brothers never made it. I'm a survivor."
King Towers, in the words of Walter Drayton, another regular at the chess table, "is full of survivors." Like many of New York's working-poor neighborhoods, these three city blocks framed by Fifth and Lenox Avenues, 112th and 115th Streets, are a place of considerable permanence and continuity amid adversity, where the average tenant spends 21 years and many stay for generations.
Some of these survivors have moved up to the middle class and away; they have fulfilled the promise of the projects but still return. Others are growing old at King Towers and lack the money, the hope or even the inclination to live anywhere else. Others still dream of escape.
To talk to them all is to talk of life in a hard place, getting harder. The surrounding neighborhood has been punched and kicked by crime, homelessness and numbing poverty for years. Now the blows are beginning to pile up, staggering even the most traditionally stable sections of Harlem, including King Towers.
"Growing up, there were black-owned stores in the neighborhood," Mr. Buford said. "We had role models, people to look up to. That's all gone now. The community has been dismantled. Drugs are killing us."
"So many politicians have their hands in the till," said Roger Shepherd, a 37-year-old kitchen aide at a state hospital. "Cops, too. Now they want to blame the poor for New York falling. It's crazy."
Still, they are survivors.
"Why do we stay?" asked Mr. Drayton, who is 42. "Did you hear that, Victor? He wants to know why we stay. We stay because this is home. This is where we were raised and where we raised our kids. This is where we know everybody and everybody knows us.
"And, there ain't nowhere else to go. The system has us in a jar with the lid on tight."
In King Towers, home is both castle and prison.
 
Hard Times
Hold Onto a Job With Both Hands
A few days later, a gypsy cab pulled into King Towers. In Harlem, yellow cabs are like buffalo -- rare.
The driver jumped out and helped a frail old woman climb slowly down to the street. He carried her grocery bags to the sidewalk and then called out to a young woman walking along the street with a child.
"Will you help her inside her house?" the driver asked.
"No," the woman said. "Why don't you?"
"I can't leave my car out here," he said. "I hope you drop dead."
The cabby drove off, leaving the old woman looking scared on the curb. Then Mr. Shepherd, who had been standing nearby, stepped forward and carried the woman's bags to her apartment.
"I never come out this late," the woman said.
It was 5 P.M.
 
'Relieve the Pressure'
 Mr. Shepherd grew up in King Towers. He and Mr. Buford are cousins. And though he now lives in the Bronx, he stops by the project almost every day to see his friends and his family.
"Times are real hard," Mr. Shepherd said. "The job I have now, I'm holding onto with both hands."
Mr. Shepherd walked slowly around the project and paused in front of the Two Way Market, a grocery and liquor store on 115th Street.
"They got as many liquor stores around here as churches," he said. "When you got so much tension you got to do something to relieve the pressure. That's where the liquor stores come in."
He continued walking toward the corner of 115th and Lenox Avenue, a popular hangout for the project's young people, some of them waiting to buy or sell drugs.
"They," Mr. Shepherd said, meaning the government, "want us to settle for a little piece of nothing, like the Indians on the reservation. They got us fighting and killing each other for crumbs."
He sighed deeply. "In a way, the ones in jail are like political prisoners because they refused to settle for less."
 
The Success
Come Back To Give Back
Charles Williams, a 40-year-old administrator at Harlem Hospital, spent most of his first 25 years in King Towers. He earned a master's degree in social work and a ticket out of the projects.
But while he lives in the Bronx now, he has not forgotten his roots. He holds onto them tightly, proudly, sadly. He is president of the advisory board of the King Towers community center. "This will always be home," he said.
Mr. Williams is constantly on the telephone trying to convince other former residents "who have made it" -- police officers, teachers, a Federal drug agent -- to return and become role models for the development's young people, many of whom are being pushed and dragged by circumstance and misguided choice toward a life and premature death in the streets.
"Those of us who have made it must come back and give back to the community," he said. "Basically, we've got to change what's happening in King Towers, the way we treat each other."
Four nights after Christmas, the Survivors held a reunion dance in a recreation center a few blocks from King Towers.
"None of us have ever left each other," said Robert J. Truesdale, a member of the 115th Street Boys who grew up to serve in Vietnam, move to the Riverdale section of the Bronx, work as an area manager for Paine Webber and send his daughter to Princeton.
"A lot of us got killed over the years, but the rest of us make a point to get together," Mr. Truesdale said. "We've been best men at each other's weddings, godfathers to each other's children. We've been there for each other. I can remember a time when we had holes in our pockets. There are a lot of guys in here making $60,000 a year now. We've been to hell and back."
They have also been to too many funerals to remember.
 
3 Funerals in One Week
 During one week in November, they gathered to bury three men from King Towers, all in their mid-40's. One man overdosed on drugs; another died of cirrhosis. No one at the dance knew what had killed the third man.
"The streets are eating up everybody," said Richard Finney, 42.
Mr. Buford, one of the organizers of the reunion dance, was himself almost devoured by the streets.
He had tried his fortunes as a fighter after returning home from the Army in the mid-60's. But he was lucky to make more than $100 a fight, while some of his friends were "getting rich selling drugs."
"I started dealing, and that was my downfall," he said. "I had money, clothes, women. But you lose your soul being a drug dealer." Not only did he sell drugs, he used them and became heavily addicted. It took him five or six tries to kick his habit.
 
'I've Helped Destroy My People'
 "Then I said to myself and the Almighty, 'Thank God, I'm still alive,' " he said. "I said, 'I know I've helped destroy my people and I'm sorry.'
"I feel God kept me alive to do something more than that -- to help my people, especially these young brothers on the corner."
Mr. Buford and the other Survivors are hoping to raise enough money to buy a building and turn it into a community center.
"We want to help these young kids coming up," Mr. Drayton said. "Unless the men of the community stand up and give these kids some direction, we're finished. We're in a war, fighting for our youth."
"There are so many talented people here," Mr. Buford added. "But that talent isn't brought out because everybody is struggling. The pace is very fast. Kids grow up too fast. They don't have time for a childhood. I think it's designed to have our young people on the street. If you kill the youth, you kill a generation."
The city's Housing Authority already operates a youth center at King Towers, but it is underfinanced and understaffed. After paying staff salaries, the center can spend about $1,400 a year.
The center's director, Dianne Henderson, insists that "I'm pretty good with money." In her few months at King Towers, she has been searching for volunteers and role models to run recreational, educational and cultural programs. So far, many have promised to help, but few have stepped forward.
Ms. Henderson has found that talk is as cheap as a Saturday night special.
 
The Pioneer
'My Son Died Instantly'
For 40 years, Louise Vails has watched the ebb and flow of life at King Towers from a window of her first-floor apartment. She and her husband raised 10 children in the project, including their youngest, Nelson, who went on to win a silver medal for cycling in the 1984 Olympics.
"He made all of America feel proud that year," Mrs. Vails said. A framed photograph of her son standing between Ronald and Nancy Reagan hangs on her living-room wall.
Mrs. Vails was eight months pregnant with Nelson when one of her children, 18-year-old Albert, was killed on the stoop of her building. He was returning home from his job at a purse factory when a young man came up behind him and shot him in the head. They had had a dispute at a party a few days before.
"My son died instantly," Mrs. Vails said. "I never thought about moving. It was just one of those things. It could have happened anywhere."
Mrs. Vails, who is 72 years old, is both a survivor and a pioneer.
 
On Welfare, Then Off
 When she and her family moved into the project in 1951, only 2 of the 10 rust-colored high-rise buildings were completed, and the development was known as the Stephen Foster Houses. The name was changed shortly after the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Her husband, Robert, drove a cab and worked in a hospital laundry room. He died in 1986. Mrs. Vails was a nurse's aide for 22 years. For a short time in the early 50's, while only Mr. Vails was working, the family received some welfare assistance. But "we got off of it as soon as I started working," Mrs. Vails said.
"Everything around here is, I'd say, 100 percent better than in the past 20 years," she said. "A lot of the young fellas who used to do bad things have grown up. They got married. They have families. They have jobs. Even the grounds are cleaner.
"The only reason people I know move out of the projects is to buy a house. But other than that, I never heard no one say the projects was bad. I myself wouldn't live anywhere else. Two of my children were born here."
One of Mrs. Vails's sons is a retired cowboy, another an Army recruiter. One daughter is a head nurse at a hospital in San Francisco; another is a secretary at a college. She has a son who is a printer, another who is a supervisor at a drug-rehabilitation center and another who is a retired correction officer. She has 19 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
"There is a lot of good in these projects that people don't hear about," she said. "You got good and bad people everywhere. There are bad people in the Waldorf.
"My children didn't have the best of everything, but we gave them the best we could. It's not where you live; it's how you bring your children up. This apartment isn't a mansion, but it's a home full of love."
 
The Future?
'These Kids Aren't Listening'
There is a lot of talk at King Towers about the young people and their future. More often than not, one way or another, it is mixed with talk about drugs.
At the chess table one day, a sad-faced man named George Brown spoke in a voice just above a whisper.
"These kids aren't listening to us," he said. "We ain't selling no drugs, so we ain't no role models."
He looked away from his friends. His voice was laced with shame.
"My son said to me, 'Dad, I'll be glad when you get a job.' He's 12 years old. That hurt me. I'm trying."
So is Michael Smalls. It was 11:30 in the morning, and Mr. Smalls, a husky man of 35 with a pair of dark glasses perched on the end of his nose, was doing what he does most mornings, afternoons and nights: hanging out in front of his building in King Towers.
"Another one of my friends got killed last night," said Mr. Smalls, who is unemployed and trying to get a job with the Housing Authority. "I'm out here trying to put together the bits and pieces."
A young man approached, his baseball cap pulled down against a brisk wind.
"Did you hear about Kenny?" Mr. Smalls asked the man.
"Yeah, I heard he got killed," the man said. "He got shot in the back of the head on 126th Street."
 
'This Is My Reward'
 Mr. Smalls said his friend Kenny had been involved with drugs for years but had a good heart and a family that loved him.
"I wish we could make people take a chill pill and stop all this killing," he said. "I hate it around here. I guess it's really a self-pity thing.
"I had the talent to play myself out of here with basketball, but I messed up in school. This is my reward."
In a sixth-floor hallway a few buildings away, a man lay sprawled in the dim afternoon light.
"He's a crackhead," a neighbor explained. "That's where he sleeps during the day. His mother lives there. She puts him out in the morning when she goes to work and lets him back in when she comes home at night.
"She's afraid he'll sell everything in the apartment for crack. A crackhead will do anything for a dime."
 
Epilogue
'I Call It A Development'
Marguerite Ryner, the vice president of the tenant association, has raised three children and mourned two husbands in her 36 years in King Towers. By now, most of her long-time friends and neighbors have either moved out or been chased out.
Mrs. Ryner, though, wears her ambivalence about King Towers like a gas mask, putting it on and taking it off, depending on the assaults of the day. One day she is disillusioned and bitter, ready to move out with the dawn. The next, she is determined and firm about staying and fighting to "make King Towers a decent place to live again."
"I don't like to call it the projects," she explained. "I call it a development, because that's what we're doing, developing this place into a community."
Mrs. Ryner was standing in the hallway just outside her apartment on the 10th floor of her building on Fifth Avenue. She is extremely proud of this hallway: Six years ago, she and a group of neighbors painted a mural over every inch of its institutional, off-white walls. They covered the walls in dark reds, browns and yellows. They painted pictures of karate fighters, couples eating dinner, flowers and comic-book superheroes.
But what they really painted was a declaration: This is our home.
Mrs. Ryner tapped the floor with her cane and ran her other hand over the mural. "We've got to do it over again," she said sadly. 'As you can see, the graffiti people have been here."
 
What Life Has Become
 Mrs. Ryner, who is 65 years old, moved into the development in 1954, the year it was completed. She had been living in one room of a boarding house with her husband, a railroad cook. Their family was growing. They needed more space. She has three grown children, two daughters and a son.
"The development was beautiful," Mrs. Ryner said. "Everybody got along. We kept our development clean. No graffiti. No robbing. No stealing. No drugs."
Mrs. Ryner shook her head at what life has become at King Towers.
"This drug nonsense doesn't stem from the poor people, the lower-echelon group," she said. "This stems from above. The Federal Government sanctioned Noriega. In order to clear out this drug situation, you got to clear out the Federal Government in Washington."
Even a walk to the corner newsstand can be dangerous. One early morning when she was out walking her dog, Christmas, Mrs. Ryner saw a 35-year-old man she had known all his life shooting at another man across the street.
When the man saw her, he yanked the gun behind his back and said, "Mrs. Ryner, I didn't mean for you to see that."
"I still love it here," Mrs. Ryner said, frowning at the memory of those early-morning gunshots. "But I don't love it enough to stay here and be miserable. Working people have a heck of time trying to survive."

"It was just one of those things. It could have happened anywhere."; Marguerite Ryner, the vice president of the tenant association, has raised three children and mourned two husbands in King Towers, which she doesn't call a project. "I call it a development," Mrs. Ryner said. "We're developing this place into a community. (Photographs by Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times) (pg. B2)

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
2d Day of Buying by Fed Moderates the Dollar's Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined moderately against major foreign currencies yesterday, with a second day of dollar-buying by the Federal Reserve protecting the United States currency from a steeper fall, traders said.
Gold prices also posted moderate losses in New York, where bullion fell by $2.20 a troy ounce, to $366.40, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank earlier quoted a late bid of $365.65 an ounce, down $2.45 from late Monday's quote. 
 The dollar headed lower in early trading, threatening to extend further the sharp losses it had suffered since Friday's grim jobless report prompted the Federal Reserve to lower the discount rate, a key lending rate. Several major banks have since lowered their prime rates.
The dollar, like all currencies, is supported by higher interest rates.
 
3 Buying Forays
 In a concerted and coordinated effort to soften the dollar's slide, the Fed and major allies bought dollars on Monday, helping to lift the currency somewhat off its daily lows. And yesterday, the Fed entered foreign exchange markets three times to buy dollars against the German mark, traders said.
Each time, the dollar, which was threatening to touch another new low against the mark, staged a moderate advance before declining again.
Traders said that without the Fed intervention yesterday, the dollar may have slipped even lower than the historic low of 1.456 German marks reached Monday in New York. Instead, the dollar recorded a trading low of 1.4565 marks in New York.
By day's end in New York, the currency closed at 1.4577 marks, down from late Monday's 1.4629 marks. Earlier, in Europe, the dollar finished at 1.4635 marks.
The Fed's solo attempts yesterday to shore up the dollar were not considered as effective as the coordinated intervention on Monday, which included dollar-buying by the Bank of England and the German Bundesbank.
The dollar also fell yesterday against most other major currencies in moderately active European trading.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 130.05 Japanese yen, from 131.28 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 129.66 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 129.48 yen, down from late Monday's 130.58 yen.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.984, from $1.9777 late Monday. In New York, sterling strengthened to $1.992, from late Monday's $1.9810.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's prices, included: 1.243 Swiss francs, down from 1.251; 4.9625 French francs, down from 4.981; 1,095.75 Italian lire, down from 1,100.5, and 1.1583 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1596.

HEADLINE: COMPANY EARNINGS;
Goodrich's Earnings Off By 48 Percent

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The B. F. Goodrich Company, a producer of plastic resins, specialty chemicals and aerospace components, said yesterday that its net income fell nearly 48 percent in the fourth quarter, as sales from some specialty chemical products were hurt by higher costs for petrochemical-based raw materials.
Goodrich said that its net income dropped to $14.1 million, or 47 cents a share, from $27 million, or 98 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1989. Sales for the quarter were up slightly, to $575.8 million, from $573.7 million in the period a year earlier. 
 The company, which is based in Akron, Ohio, said that its net income for all of last year dropped nearly 21 percent, to $136.3 million, or $4.95 a share, from $172.4 million, or $6.27 a share, in 1989. Sales for the year were up slightly, to $2.43 billion, from $2.42 billion in 1989.
 
PVC Sales Drop
 Goodrich is North America's largest producer of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, plastics, which are widely used in pipes and tubing. The company said that it had reached record levels in specialty chemicals and areospace products but PVC sales for the quarter were down, to $256 million, from $265 million in the period last year, and profits from PVC plastics have deteriorated as a result of growing industry capacity.
"The economic slowdown in the United States and Canada negatively affected several important operations during the quarter," said John D. Ong, Goodrich's chairman. "The specialty chemicals and aerospace businesses will continue to expand," he said, adding that even if the plastics business improves the other areas will become the most significant contributors to the company's earnings.
The company said that its earnings were affected by higher crude oil prices, which have pushed up the costs of propane and ethylene, two chemicals used to make plastic products.
 
Growing Aerospace Business
 Goodrich, which sold its tire business in 1988, has moved to decrease its dependence on its plastics business. In the fourth quarter, the company acquired Hercules Inc.'s aircraft and electronics group, which will increase the company's aerospace sales by about 40 percent.
Most analysts said the results were in line with expectations.
On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Goodrich's stock was down $1.25, closing at $42.

$138 Million in Bonds Priced By M.A.C. in a Refunding

 BODY:
The Municipal Assistance Corporation for the City of New York yesterday priced $138 million in bonds to refund other debt sold when interest rates were higher.
Goldman, Sachs & Company, lead manager for the underwriting group, said the offering went well and initial indications were that the bonds were well received by retail and institutional investors.
The maximum yield offered is 6.90 percent for an issue due in 2008, while yields on the short-term serial bonds range from 5.30 percent in 1992 to 6.10 percent in 1996, to 6.65 percent in 2001 and 6.80 percent in 2003.
The refunding bonds are rated A by Moody's Investors Service, A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, and AA by Fitch Investors Service Inc. Traders outside the underwriting group said the sale of these bonds could give a good indication of how well the credit markets would respond if the corporation should have to borrow again on the city's behalf.

HEADLINE: Canada to Join U.S. and Mexico in Talks on Free Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The United States, Canada and Mexico announced today that they would open talks, probably starting this summer, to create a North American free trade zone that would be one of the world's largest open markets,with 360 million consumers and annual output of $6 trillion.
The announcement, which was widely anticipated, means that Canada, with which the United States has a two-year-old free trade pact, will join as a full participant in talks at which the United States and Mexico intend to try to reduce trade barriers at the Rio Grande. 
 The negotiations are likely to be highly contentious in all three countries, where many domestic industries share a fear of greater competition and are expected to try to preserve tariff walls.
 
Far-Reaching Idea
 The official announcements were upbeat. President Bush said at a news conference before a joint communique was issued in the three capitals that he had spoken with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, who said the pact would link the three economies "in bold and far-reaching ways."
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said in an interview that she thought the three-way negotiations might be concluded by the end of this year.
Among the opposition in the United States, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., worried about a flood of low-wage Mexican products affecting not only imports but also wage levels, has made its opposition to fighting the pact its No. 1 legislative goal.
 
Environmental Concerns
 American environmental groups are also urging that the Bush Administration seek greater commitments from the Salinas administration on improving air and water standards before any agreement is concluded.
But multinational business organizations, which could enjoy greater economies of scale from a market even larger than that of the 12-nation European Community, are ready to back the talks.
Should the Mexican pact follow what was negotiated after 18 months of often bitter talks with Canada in the late 1980's, tariffs and other barriers would be progressively cut over a 10-year transition period.
The Canadian-American pact has pleased the industries and Governments of both countries so much that tariff-cutting schedules for a number of industry sectors are being accelerated. But that pact still remains highly controversial in Canada, where a number of groups say it has aggravated plant closings in the current recession.
 
Benefits for Canada
 A study published today by the Royal Bank of Canada found that the pact had not contributed to the current difficulties experienced by some industries in Canada and that it might have moderated the impact of the recession through higher levels of investment.
By March 1, the Bush Administration is expected to ask Congress for a two-year extension of so-called fast-track authority to permit Congress to approve the agreement without amendments.
Such authority, which expires May 31, is considered essential for the trade pact to go forward.
The negotiations are not expected to begin until this summer to give the two Congressional committees charged with overseeing trade matters time to register any possible dissent.
 
Expected Fight in Congress
 But the fight in Congress is expected to be more over the Administration's request to seek the fast-track authority, which it would use both for the Mexico negotiations and for the now stalled global trade talks known as the Uruguay Round.
Separately, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Lloyd Bentsen, Democrat of Texas, released a report by the International Trade Commission, a Federal agency that analyzes trade issues for the Government, that concluded that a free trade agreement with Mexico would benefit the United States economy over all.
But it said the benefits were likely to be small at least over the next few years because of the relatively small size of the Mexican economy and because a sizable share of United States imports from Mexico already enters the United States duty free. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 		 	 	
 
Caution in Canada
 TORONTO, Feb. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Canada's Trade Minister said today that while the Government saw little risk to Canada's manufacturing industries from the agreement to hold free-trade negotiations among the United States, Mexico and Canada, Canada reserved the right to pull out of the talks if they took a turn that threatened Canadian interests.
John Crosbie, the Canadian Trade Minister, told reporters in Ottawa after the agreement was announced that official projections suggested Canadian industries could hold their own against low-wage plants in Mexico. Because Canadian industries are increasingly shifting to high-technology production, Mr. Crosbie said, their real competition in Canada's domestic market came from Japan and Western Europe, not Mexico.
During the preliminary discussions, Canadian labor unions made it clear they would oppose any broadening of the free trade pact between Canada and the United States, dating from Jan. 1, 1989, to include Mexico. Shirley Carr, president of the Canadian Labor Congress, the country's biggest labor organization, said today that Canada had already lost 200,000 jobs from the two-nation pact.
Although Mexico is Canada's largest trading partner in Latin America, two-way trade between the countries in 1990 totaled less than $2.2 billion, compared with more than $150 billion in trade between Canada and the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Of Vehicles Drop 31.5%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Sales of American-made vehicles dropped 31.5 percent in late January, closing a month of drastic sales declines for auto makers buffeted by war and a weak economy.
The latest drop is a stark reminder that domestic and foreign auto makers confront the most serious slump in demand for cars and trucks in the United States since the last recession ended in 1982. Since August, consumer confidence has been stuck at its lowest level in a decade, according to recent surveys conducted by the University of Michigan.
 
'Prospects Are too Uncertain'
"Rather than telling us that car price discounts aren't big enough or that interest rates are too high, people are saying their economic prospects are too uncertain," said Richard T. Curtin, the director of the survey. "A lot of consumers have put off even looking for new cars and trucks." 
 The 10 leading manufacturers sold 185,049 domestically produced cars in the January 21-31 period, a decline of 27.9 percent. Sales of pickups, mini-vans and four-wheel drive vehicles were down 37.4 percent, to 97,263.
Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.4 million, well behind the sales rate of 7.4 million in the same period last year. There were 10 selling days in the period this year, and 9 last year.
 
Pace of Sales Slows
 The pace of sales has slowed considerably in recent weeks; during the last 60 days, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.3 million.
For the month, car sales including imports were down by 25.2 percent, and light truck sales plunged 32.8 percent.
Sales of imported cars and trucks also suffered in January, declining by 28.6 percent, compared with a drop of 29.3 percent for the Big Three domestic auto makers. The seven Japanese manufacturers with plants in the United States posted a sales drop of 9.3 percent in January.
The poor prospects for a quick recovery and the pressing need to conserve cash spurred General Motors on Monday to cut its dividend nearly in half and announce cost-cutting plans, including a 15 percent reduction in its salaried work force.
Analysts say the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation will cut their dividends as well. And the Big Three shut down 24 car and truck assembly plants this week, temporarily idling more than 62,000 workers because of a shortage of dealer orders.
 
Difficult Year Ahead
 "It's clear that 1991 is going to be a difficult year for all manufacturers," said J.B. Fitzpatrick, G.M. vice president for marketing.
G.M. sold 79,116 domestically produced cars in late January, a drop of 30.4 percent. G.M.'s light truck sales were down 40.7 percent, to 33,004 vehicles.
Ford sold 44,933 cars, a drop of 35.1 percent, while Ford's light truck sales dropped 33.5 percent, to 31,219 vehicles.
Chrysler sold 29,966 cars, a drop of 1.7 percent. The figure is based on estimates provided by Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry newsletter. Sales of Chrysler's mini-vans, Jeeps and pickups fell by 43 percent, to 28,067 vehicles.
 
Chrysler Under Fire
 Chrysler's profitable mini-vans came under fire last week, when Consumer Reports warned that faulty transmissions made them unreliable. Chrysler's chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, asked dealers this week to counter the criticism with an all-out sales and service drive to keep customers from fleeing. Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that the impact of the article could be disastrous for Chrysler.
Dealers report that many buyers still visiting showrooms are taking a harder line in negotiating the price of a new vehicle. That has meant lower profits on each sale for the dealers, and more legwork for customers, who are shopping broadly for new cars and trucks and comparing more models and brands before committing themselves.
"Most people are more frugal in what they buy now," said Frank DeBartolo, sales manager at Celozzi-Ettelson Chevrolet in Elmhurst, Illinois. "It's not that they are buying cheaper cars, but they are negotiating harder. In normal times, a customer might wind up paying $200 more than he wanted to pay. Now he negotiates harder to cut $100 here or there."
 
Toyota Sales Drop
 Toyota Motor Corporation sold 10,249 domestically produced cars in late January, down 18.7 percent. Honda Motor Company's car sales fell 52.6 percent, to 10,263 vehicles. Nissan Motor Company sold 3,650 cars made in the United States, a gain of 27.2 percent, and sold 4,034 light trucks, a gain of 15.8 percent.
For the month of January, Toyota's imported car and truck sales fell 7.8 percent, Nissan's sales of imported vehicles declined 34.7 percent, and Honda's sales of imported cars were down 11.3 percent.
The major European importers suffered, too. Volkswagen posted a decline of 18.9 percent in sales of its cars in the United States. Mercedes was down 27.4 percent, while Volvo's sales fell by 40.6 percent.
In terms of United States market share, the big losers in January were Ford, Chrysler and Mitsubishi. Ford dropped to 20.9 percent of the car and truck market, from 24.3 percent last year. Chrysler's share fell to 14.1 percent, from 15.7 percent last year. And Mitsubishi's share declined to 1.5 percent, from 2.3 percent last January.
General Motors increased its market share to 35.5 percent, from 34.7 percent last year. Toyota raised its share to 7.7 percent of the vehicle market, from 6.4 percent last year. And Nissan rose to 4.4 percent, from 3.6 percent.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: THE OVERVIEW;
Darman Greeted Politely in Cautious Foray to Hill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Chastened by his brawl with Congress last year, President Bush's budget director appeared on Capitol Hill today for the first time since then, gave a low-key, polite defense of the President's 1992 budget, confessed earlier errors and charmed at least a few senators who had been put off by his cocky self-assurance in the past.
Testifying at a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee, the official, Richard G. Darman, did not win support for all the proposals in the budget, which the President delivered to Congress on Monday. But he was applauded for giving a candid assessment of policy options and realistic estimates of the deficit for both this year and next. 
 The budget director was "clearly not as contentious and not as defensive" as in the past, said Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, the Democrat who serves as chairman of the Budget Committee. "The Administration honestly estimated the amount of the deficit this year, a staggering $318 billion, so he doesn't have to defend an unrealistic rosy scenario, as he did last year."
 
View From a Farm State
 Senator J. James Exon said that he did not agree with all Mr. Bush's proposals but that this was "as honest a budget presentation as we've ever had."
Mr. Exon, a Democrat from the farm state of Nebraska, said he could live with Mr. Bush's proposal to halt crop subsidy payments to farmers who have nonfarm income of more than $125,000 a year. The idea seems to be "not only fair but workable," he said.
Another farm state Senator, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said he too was willing to consider "putting a lid on farm susbidies," because he believes that they should be directed more to people who truly need such assistance.
Mr. Darman also made peace with Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, a leader of conservatives who denounced the Administration for accepting tax increases as part of last fall's landmark budget agreement, which provided the framework for deficit reduction over five years.
 
Sununu's Remarks Recalled
 John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said at the time that Mr. Lott was "an insignificant figure" in budget negotiations, and that the Mississippi Republican could "find something wrong" with any proposal.
Today, in a gesture of conciliation, Mr. Darman welcomed Mr. Lott to the Budget Committee, which he is joining this year, and offered him sympathy for having to do the thankless work of writing a budget and for "having to deal with me -- I know how difficult a burden that can be."
Mr. Darman gave details of foreign contributions to the cost of United States military operations in the Persian Gulf, including pledges of $9.7 billion last year and $41.8 billion in the first quarter of this year. Among the chief contributors, he said, Saudi Arabia has pledged a total of $16.8 billion, Kuwait $16 billion, Japan $10.7 billion and Germany $6.6 billion.
The budget director said he was confident that these countries would meet their commitments, although he acknowledged that so far the United States had received less than $8 billion. At the White House today, Mr. Bush said the war might cost the United States no more than $15 billion if other countries made contributions as promised.
 
Questions on Benefits
 Turning to the domestic side of Mr. Bush's budget, Mr. Darman acknowledged that the Administration was proposing $46.6 billion of cutbacks in Medicare and other benefit programs over five years, beyond what was required by last fall's budget agreement.
Under intense questioning from Democrats, Mr. Darman conceded that the Administration might find a little more money to run the unemployment insurance program during the current recession. Because of inadequate funds to administer the program, jobless workers have had to wait as long as seven weeks to get the insurance benefits to which they are legally entitled.
Senator Exon pressed Mr. Darman to admit that he was in error when he estimated in January 1990 that the Federal budget deficit would be $63 billion in the current fiscal year, about one-fifth of the $318 billion now estimated. "If your point is that I was wrong, you are right," Mr. Darman said.
If Mr. Darman and some lawmakers are less combative this year, the reason may be the budget agreement of last year. As a result of that deal, which placed caps on each of three broad categories of discretionary spending, the focus now is not on how much should be spent but on how to spend what is available, and savings in the military budget are no longer available to expand social welfare programs.
 
'Honesty of the Numbers'
 Senator Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, told Mr. Darman, "I appreciate the honesty of the numbers" in the President's new budget. He also commended Mr. Darman for proposing a 13 percent increase in Federal support for scientific research and development, to $75.6 billion next year.
The atmosphere of amity may not last long. Mr. Bush's proposals to slash Medicare payments to urban teaching hospitals and to triple Medicare premiums for elderly people with incomes of more than $125,000 a year elicited no visible support on Capitol Hill.
Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said that Mr. Bush's proposal to slice an additional $25 billion from Medicare over the next five years "breaks faith with the budget deal" approved last year. That agreement reduced Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals by $32 billion over five years and required beneficiaries to pay a total of $10 billion in additional premiums over the same period.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, who has led many successful efforts to expand Medicaid coverage of low-income women and children, was even harsher in judging the President's budget.
"It doesn't do anything to help the states meet the burden of Medicaid spending or the millions of poor people who can't get Medicaid services," said Mr. Waxman, a California Democrat who is chairman of the the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health. .
Mr. Waxman also complained that the Administration was not seeking enough money to deal with the AIDS epidemic. Under Mr. Bush's 1992 budget, the Public Health Service would get $1.95 billion for research, prevention and treatment activities related to the disease, an increase of $65 million over spending this year.

HEADLINE: THE FEDERAL BUDGET: NEW YORK;
Dinkins and Other Officials Assail Bush's Budget Over Spending Cuts

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
New York City and state officials and a Brooklyn Congressman reacted today with varying degrees of scorn and disappointment over President Bush's budget.
Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said in a statement issued by the city's lobbying office here that the proposed budget would cost New York $100 million in transit aid alone, and many millions more in health care, housing, community improvement and community-based services to the poor. 
 He said that the budget would deal "a crushing blow" to health care, housing, education and transportation.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's chief Washington lobbyist, Brad C. Johnson, said the President's proposal to funnel block grant aid to cities through the states threatened to pit cities and states against each other in pursuit of Federal dollars. This, he said, amounted to a "diversion" that distracted attention from what he termed the Bush Administration's failure to deal with a declining economy.
 
Cuts in Medicare Assailed
 And Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said the budget's effect on job training would be "stagnant at best," and called its impact on energy assistance "short sighted" and the cuts in Medicare "devastating."
Mayor Dinkins, perhaps the harshest critic of the budget, said, "The President's failure to offer any clear domestic policy is bitter medicine for state and local governments, which must continue to bear the burden of Draconian budget cuts and rapidly growing social problems."
The Mayor also accused Mr. Bush of treating mass transit as "expendable" and of giving short shrift to housing, day care and services for low-income families, the homeless and the elderly.
Judy Chesser, the Mayor's representative in Washington, said city officials were wary of the President's plan to funnel Community Development Block Grants through the state, rather than channeling the money directly to the cities. The grants amount to $2.9 billion nationally and $183 million for New York City. "We're concerned," she said, "whether the cities will ever get the money through the state."
Mr. Johnson said that the concerns of cities were "justified," but added that guidelines could be drafted to make sure the money gets to the areas of greatest need.
He also said the plan to channel grants through the states occupied "the attention of the governors when the real problems are the recession, universal access to health care and quality education."

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Excerpts From Talk By Bush on Gulf War

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference at the White House today:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
This morning I spoke with President Salinas and Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada, and together we intend to pursue a trilateral free-trade agreement that would link our three economies in bold and far-reaching ways. A successful conclusion of the free-trade agreement will expand market opportunities, increase prosperity, and help our three countries meet the economic challenges of the future. A free-trade area encompassing all three countries would create a North American market of 360 million people with annual production of more than $6 trillion. This agreement would be a dramatic first step toward the realization of a hemispheric free-trade zone stretching from Point Barrow in Alaska to the Straits of Magellan.
I've informed the Congress of this decision and notified them of my intent to use the fast-track procedure for this North American free-trade zone. . . .
I am very pleased at the generally constructive reception that our budget is receiving, and in particular am pleased at the positive receptions that the governors gave yesterday concerning our budget proposal for transferring $15 billion worth of Government programs to the states, fully funded, I might add.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	This morning, I also spoke with President Ozal of Turkey regarding the coalition efforts in the Persian Gulf. We're nearing the end of the third week of Operation Desert Storm, almost 21 -- 21 days to the hour. And I'm pleased to report that we remain on course, and on schedule.
U.S. and coalition forces continue to perform their assigned missions with great professionalism, and thankfully, with only modest casualties on our side. And I'd like to emphasize that we are going to extraordinary, and I would venture to say, unprecedented length, to avoid damage to civilians and holy places.
 
Unchanged Goals in Gulf
 We do not seek Iraq's destruction, nor do we seek to punish the Iraqi people for the decisions and policies of their leaders. In addition, we are doing everything possible and with great success to minimize collateral damage, despite the fact that Saddam is now relocating some military functions, such as command and control headquarters, in civilian areas such as schools.
I would also emphasize that our goals have not changed. We continue to seek Iraq's full compliance with the 12 relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. And our soldiers have performed with courage and bravery that should make all Americans proud.
And I believe our country is giving them the support that they need and deserve.
As we move into the fourth week of this conflict, I ask all Americans to continue their prayers for our valiant men and women in the gulf. And let me just end with this. I asked Dick Cheney, the Secretary of Defense, and General Powell, to travel to Saudi Arabia late this week to meet directly with Norm Schwarzkopf and his staff. The purpose of this trip, which will be a short one, will be for them to get a firsthand status report. And I would then look forward to their returning here quickly and meeting with me and my other senior advisers.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Mr. President, your new budget contains relatively little money for the Persian Gulf war, which some analysts say could cost as high as $1 billion a day if it goes into a ground conflict. If the war goes on for months, how will you pay for it with an economy that's in a recession and a deficit that's combing past $300 billion?
A. Well, I think that in the budget some $15 billion is included, and I think what people that are concerned about this have realized is that we are getting significant support committed from overseas. And I'm confident that what we have in there will take care of it. There will be testimony on this up on the Hill. But we're talking about having commitments of close to -- I think it's $50 billion or $51 billion from others. Added to the $15 billion that we have budgeted, that's $66 billion and we believe it should be sufficient.
Q. Would you, under any circumstances, consider a surtax to pay for the war if it goes on?
A. Too hypothetical, but I can see no reason for a war surtax. I don't think it's necessary and I've heard very little call for that, as a matter of fact, because I think people realize that these cost estimates are pretty accurate.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Ground-War Decision
 Q. Mr. President, does the Cheney-Powell visit over there signal that a decision is at hand on the commencement of a ground war?
A. No, it doesn't signal that.
 
Anti-U.S. Sentiment
 Q. Let me follow by asking you, there is a perceptible increase in anti-American sentiment in the streets of a number of capitals in the Middle East. Does this add to the pressure on you to wrap this war up and get it over with?
A. No, it doesn't. Because what we overlook when we see the demonstrations on the television is the fact that there's strong support in many Arab countries. And I'm staying in very close touch with our coalition partners, and I'm always encouraged when I talk to them about the support in their countries and in other parts of the Arab world for what we're doing.
Yes, it's divided. And yes, we've seen -- I've seen the demonstrations in Amman. I've seen some of the demonstrations in the Mahgreb. But I don't -- to get back to your question, they will not influence my decision-making on the timing involved, say for the use of ground forces.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Iran's Peace Proposal
 Q. Both the White House and the State Department were cool, even indifferent, to the Iranian peace initiative. Why so? Why would you not encourage an initiative which called for the full withdrawal from Kuwait?
A. Well, I don't that there was an initial -- I don't think that there is an Iranian proposal, John. I have not seen it. I just hung up talking to Ozal -- President Ozal of Turkey, and he doesn't think there is a specific Iranian proposal, because -- and I think the reason is that people realize that this man has to comply with these resolutions without equivocation, that he has to go forward, no concession, no compromise, and do what the world has called on him to do. And at that point, then, there can be some cessation of hostilities.
But I have not seen a specific five-point program out of Teheran.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Saddam Hussein's Fate
 Q. The problem seems to be, sir, an impression is being given that you will be disappointed if the war ends with Saddam Hussein still in power.
A. Well, I see. No, I don't think that's the case. But the war will not end with Saddam Hussein standing with his view that he will not withdraw from Kuwait. . . .
There's nothing to negotiate about. There's nothing to be conciliatory about, when you have a person who is steadfast in his refusal to comply with the fundamental purpose, and that is to get him out of Kuwait. But we haven't shifted our objectives on this.
Now, would I weep? Would I mourn, if somehow the -- Saddam Hussein did not remain as -- as head of his country? I thought Prime Minister Major spoke very well about it, spoke very convincingly about it, and he reflected my view that there would be no sorrow if he's not there. . . .
In fact it would be a lot easier to see a successful conclusion because I don't believe anybody other than Saddam Hussein is want to -- is going to want to continue to submit, to subject his army to the pounding they are taking, or his people to the pounding that is going on. . . .
Q. Mr. President, back on the planning of this ground offensive, you said last week at Fort Stewart, Ga., and again here today that the United States and its allies and not Saddam Hussein would determine that. Three weeks into the war, what are the prospects for avoiding ground warfare in [inaudible] in the gulf?
A. Well, I'd -- I think one of the things that I look forward to hearing from General Powell and Dick Cheney is the answer to that question as to -- and I guess you could rephrase it and say would air power alone get the job done. And I -- my own view is I'm somewhat skeptical that it would, but I'm very interested to hear from our Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Hussein's Strategy
 Q. You just mentioned the pounding that these Iraqi troops are taking, and I wondered how you have approached the decision where you obviously, if you continue this aerial bombardment like this, run the chance of slaughtering, literally, tens of thousands of Iraqi troops. A two-part question is, first, do you make any conclusion -- draw any conclusion that Saddam is either out of control of that decision or lost his senses?
A. On what decision?
Q. On allowing the United States basically to pound his troops who are virtually defenseless from the air?
A. I'm not sure he has the full -- I've never known for fact certain how much he's told. You mentioned Khafji. The question was raised. I don't know whether -- how much information he has about what happened there in spite of the full coverage that takes place. But let me be very clear. What concerns me are the lives of our troops. What concerns me are the lives of our coalition forces, the Saudi and the Qatar forces that went into Khafji, very courageously, and my first worries are about them and Saddam Hussein should be concerned about the Iraqi forces. But how concerned he is I don't know cause when you shove people into the people, pushing them from behind, to be defeated, clearly and surely, or when you send your airplanes up and the score is totally one-sided -- in fact every engagement in the air the Iraqi planes and pilots have gone down -- you have to wonder how he looks at -- at what you're asking about, how he feels about that.
But here's a man that used chemical weapons on his own people, here's a man that gassed the Kurds, here's a man who has no hesitancy to throw, recklessly throw city-busting Scuds, population-killing Scuds into Israel or into Saudi Arabia. Here's a man that brutally parades prisoners of war, here's a man that has launched environmental terrorism. I can't figure out what he's thinking and neither do the coalition partners with whom I am in touch. Neither can they figure it out.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
P.O.W.'s Fate
 Q. Mr. President, I'm wondering if you can tell us the latest you've heard from the International Red Cross or anyone else that's trying to find out the fate of the P.O.W.'s -- the personnel who are missing there?
A. So far all I've heard is a frustrating silence of his willingness to permit people to do what should be done, and that is to inspect and talk to the people involved. That's all I've heard.
 
 
 
Kinship With Pilots
 Q. Sir, as a follow up. Do you, following your experience in World War II, feel any personal kinship with the pilots who were shot down?
A. Well, it doesn't have anything to do with my experience, particularly, many, many years ago. It has a lot to do with the fact that they are courageous Americans and the answer to your question is yes. I feel -- and I feel very strongly about it, and I had a chance to say that to some of the spouses, and -- but it's not some kind of a psychological tie-in to the fact that 50 years ago I was flying airplanes. It's the fact that -- just -- you see that, and you see these prisoners paraded, and it just turns my stomach. It just says something about the brutality of this person, and that's what really motivates me.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Use of Chemical Arms
 Q. Mr. President, Saddam Hussein has not yet used chemical weapons on the battlefield, but some analysts believe that may be something that we would face in the future. Have you made a decision on what the U.S. response would be if he does turn to chemical weapons? Have you ruled out the idea that the United States might in turn use weapons of mass destruction?
A. Well, I think it's better to never say what option you may be considering or may or may not do. But yes, he has used chemical weapons on his own people, so the only way -- I would like to take the opportunity, in responding to your question to say he ought to think very carefully about doing that. Very, very carefully. And I will leave that up to a very fuzzy interpretation because I would like to have every possible chance that he decides not to do this.
You talk about turning world opinion further against this brutal man. That would do it. But how we will respond or something, I would wait for recommendations and I would not discuss options ahead of time one way or another.
Q. I understand that you're not going to tell us what you would do, but have you in your own mind made a decision on what you would do in ----
A. No.
 
Stance on the Draft
Q. Mr. President, can you say with a 100 percent Presidential guarantee that you will not reinstate the draft?
A. I have absolutely no intention of reinstating the draft.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	
 
Ground War's Timing
 Q. There seems to be an increasing feeling on the Hill, among Republicans as well as Democrats, that we should wait longer, some say even up until June. What's the downside of waiting that long and continuing to pound away?
A. Well, I would simply say that we want to let this be determined by people that understand the military plan and that are prepared to implement it.
And I remember before Jan. 16 there was the same feeling -- please let the sanctions work. I mean I can understand the feeling on the Hill. I can understand those who say, let air power do it alone.
But I'm going to make these calls. These are the responsibilities of the Commander in Chief, that kind of decision, and I will make that decision after full consultation with these -- the chief out there and the two main military people upon whom I depend here, Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Chiefs.
So it's -- I'm not trying to say it's not -- wouldn't be a difficult decision. But I am saying, one, I'm prepared to make it, and two, I have total confidence that this decision will not be recommended to me unless these people that I just mentioned know that it's the right thing to do.

HEADLINE: Bank Plan's Gains Are All Long Term

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The broad changes in the banking system proposed today by the Bush Administration would not solve the nation's current economic woes, but they could have important long-term benefits for the economy.
 It will take Congress at least a year to deal with such comprehensive legislation and even longer for new laws to go into effect. If the recession is not over and the scarcity of credit is not more or less resolved by then, the economy will be so sick that it will need much stronger medicine than changes in the banking laws. 
 But the Administration argues that measures to make the banks more secure and more profitable would ultimately strengthen the economy, and economists generally agree that the proposals released today would indeed make the financial system healthier.
"A weak banking system hurts the economy, particularly during difficult economic times," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said at a news conference this morning. "Weak banks are forced to pull back just when their good customers need them most. Businesses must be able to count on banks in bad times as well as good times."
 
Changing Circumstances
 No one disputes that the existing banking laws, enacted mostly during the Depression, are anachronistic. In the decades since the laws were put on the books, credit cards, computers, automated teller machines, money market mutual funds and variable interest rates have changed banking the way air-conditioning changed life in the Sun Belt and jet engines changed overseas travel.
The question, of course, is how to change the outmoded laws. In Congress, that will depend as much on lobbying and regional interests as it does on what is best for the economy.
The most urgent goal for the Administration and Congress is to strengthen the banks' deposit insurance system. The economy could not tolerate a flood of bank failures, and taxpayers would not tolerate another bailout like the costly one involving the savings and loan associations. Congress may not approve today's proposal to limit the number of insured accounts a depositor can hold or the method of financing that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is expected to offer in the next few weeks. But most experts expect that the deposit-insurance question will be resolved in some way this year.
For long-run economic growth, the most significant proposal today probably was the one to allow banks to open branches nationwide.
The measure has been sharply attacked by lobbyists for small community banks, who fear being swallowed up by the giants from New York, Chicago and San Francisco. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, the populist Democrat from Texas who heads the House Banking Committee, indicated today that he was solidly on the side of the small bankers. But among economists, the idea of nationwide banking has widespread support.
Weak, poorly capitalized small banks would indeed be endangered, economists say, but their survival is problematic anyway, and strong community banks would flourish.
"Sure, it increases the competition to local bankers," said Verne S. Atwater, a professor of finance at the Pace University Graduate School of Business. "But most of them ought to be able to compete successfully because they know their customers and local conditions better."
 
Big Savings Potential
 Mr. Brady said he had been told by banking consultants that the efficiencies involved, like banks in several states being connected by a single computer network, would save the industry $5 billion to $10 billion a year, a hefty sum considering that the total profits of American banks last year was about $20 billion.
Banks would be able to lend this additional money many times over. In theory, it would be invested, and the entire economy would grow.
Interstate banking, now prohibited in many states and restricted in others, would also make the larger banks less likely to pull in their reins during bad times and thus be a further drag on an already slow economy. "Branching would allow a bank that had losses in the Northeast real estate market, for example, to have a counterbalance with a stronger geographic region," said Richard J. Herring, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 
International Competition
 Allowing banks into new lines of business like securities, mutual funds and insurance is important mainly because it would allow American banks to be more internationally competitive. That is especially important because of the investment opportunities with the economic unification of Europe next year.
Banks in Europe are allowed to engage in a full range of businesses. The Europeans are telling Americans that if they want to operate banks in Europe, then Europeans must be allowed to operate here with the same opportunities for business diversity they have at home.
What Congress will want to know is whether the Administration's proposals would help or harm consumers and small businesses. They have much more lobbying strength than do the large banks that would be the direct beneficiaries of the new laws.
Some small-business executives are already making waves, saying that they prefer dealing with their familiar local bankers, bond underwriters and insurance agents and not with some faceless international conglomerate. The Administration and its supporters respond that the new laws would give everyone a wider range of services and opportunities.
On the first day out of the gate, the Administration seems to be on sound footing economically with its banking proposals. But the political race is going to be long and arduous.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 16.09, to 2,788.37 in Heavy Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices kept rising yesterday in exceptionally heavy trading as money managers and individuals alike jumped into the market.
Over-the-counter stocks continued to lead the parade, although dozens of small stocks on both the New York and American exchanges also made impressive new gains. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which jumped 41.59 points on Monday, rose 16.09 more yesterday, to 2,788.37.
Trading soared to 290.6 million shares, the highest since the day after the allied attacks against Iraq and the fifth consecutive session over 200 million.
The hefty volume -- coupled with declining interest rates -- gave investment houses a lift. Morgan Stanley, for example, jumped 3 1/8, to 65 1/2.
The Nasdaq composite index, bolstered by strong technology and financial stocks, jumped the equivalent of 48 Dow points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks advanced 23 Dow points.
In a measure of the market's breadth, 1,151 Big Board stocks moved ahead while 517 fell, for a ratio of more than 2 to 1.
Pointing to what he called "the breadth stampede," Ronald J. Hill, investment strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman, said, "We've now got confirmation of the bull market."
For the last 10 days, he explained, the ratio of advances to declines has been above 1.95 to 1. Such a 10-day streak has occurred only 14 times in a little more than 40 years, and each time the market has jumped 10 percent before "a meaningful correction."
"The broad market far exceeded the Dow," said Dennis E. Jarrett, market analyst for Kidder, Peabody & Company. He attributed the Dow's relative weakness to the decline in General Motors after its surprise dividend cut late Monday.
 
Heavy Market Activity
 Commenting on the heavy market activity, he said: "You have a buying panic -- fear of missing the upside. It has to be cash coming off the sidelines."
Asked what investors were buying, he replied, "When you have 1,151 issues up, it's across the board."
Noting that the Dow had jumped an astounding 280 points since the attack on Iraq, one trader said some investors had pulled back when the index rose during the day beyond 2,800, to 2,805.20. But Mr. Jarrett argued that 2,800 is "nothing significant, just a round number." Even so, he said, yesterday was the fifth day of 1,000 or more advancing Big Board stocks and "some traders were itching to take profits."
Precisely how much money is flowing into the stock market is difficult to gauge but seemed to be running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Investment Company Institute, which reports monthly the amount of cash available to buy stock, said less than a week ago that $29.6 billion was available as of Nov. 30, but that by Dec. 31 the amount had dropped to $28 billion, suggesting that $1.6 billion had moved into the market in December.
Since the outlook for the economy has improved considerably since then, the movement of cash into the market since December should have been strong.
Indata, a weekly service of Gordon, Haskett & Company in Stamford, Conn., said its 1,200 clients held nearly $12 billion in cash for investment in stock as of Jan. 25, or about $57 million less than the week before.
 
Money Waiting for Investment
 By either measure a huge amount of money is still waiting for investment.
In yet another sign that investors are skittish, General Motors ended the day on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday at 37 3/8, up 1 1/4, but subsequently fell 2 1/4, to 35 1/4, after announcing it was slashing the dividend.
Instinet, the after-hours electronic trading service, said 260,000 G.M. shares traded between Monday evening and yesterday morning before the market opened, with the price gradually dropping to 35 5/8.
Scott F. Merlis, auto analyst for Morgan Stanley, said he had upgraded G.M. and Ford to "buys" because lower interest rates and oil prices were positive for car sales.
G.M. fell 1/4, to 35. It was the second-most-active stock, with 5.1 million shares changing hands. Ford Motor fell 1/4, to 29 3/8, on 1.8 million shares, while Chrysler rose 1/4, to 12 5/8.
Wells Fargo, which rose 6 3/8 Monday, fell 3/8, to 69, but climbed as high as 72 5/8. Robert Albertson, bank analyst for Goldman, Sachs, said that yesterday's second day of strength in financial stocks "says this is going to be more than a flash in the pan" for the group.

HEADLINE: WAR IN THE GULF: WAR SHORTAGES;
Iraq Suspending Fuel Sales, As Raids Widen Shortages

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Iraq announced the suspension of all fuel sales today, bringing further deprivation to a wintry land suffering from shortages of food, water, electricity and gasoline after allied bombers have hammered its refineries and distribution networks.
The Baghdad radio offered no explanation for the suspension, which, it said today, went into effect Monday and would remain "until further notice." The announcement gave Iraqis no time to stockpile the fuels they need for transportion, cooking and heat. 
 "For organizational purposes," the radio said, the authorities would "suspend the provision of fuel to citizens as of 4th February until further notice."
The decison meant a halt in the supply of cooking gas, gasoline and fuel oil, used for heating homes in this season when overnight temperatures drop below freezing. It seemed a clear acknowledgement of significant disruption after more than two weeks of sustained bombing.
 
Allies Hit Oil Refineries
 Western spokesmen have said allied bombs have destroyed 80 percent of Iraq's pre-war oil-refining capability of around 500,000 barrels per day, forcing the authorities to choose between civilian and military priorities.
Western diplomats in Amman said the United States and its allies were seeking to weaken Iraq's will to fight and to demoralize the country's 17 million people.
According to news reports and comments by travelers from Baghdad, Iraq has already been forced to ration drinking water, and gasoline sales to private citizens had been limited to 7 gallons every 15 days. Travelers have also spoken of rationing coupons for food, and electric power is severed in many places.
Refugees from Iraq have reported seeing allied air attacks on oil refineries throughout the country -- in Basra, Baghdad and Kirkuk -- suggesting that Iraq needs to channel its stocks of refined products to the military.
 
Civilian Casualties Reported
 In a letter to Iraqi newspapers, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said 108 civilians had been killed and 249 wounded in air raids on residential areas between Jan. 26 and Sunday. The figures brought to 428 dead and 650 wounded Iraq's estimate of the number of civilian casualties in the war.
Amid the growing hardships, the Baghdad radio seemed to increase the volume of its already strident invective against the United States and its allies massed in Saudi Arabia.
"Let George Bush and other scoundrels taking part in this aggression learn that our reckoning with them will be harsh and our vengeance crushing," the radio declared. It reported 373 allied air attacks on "peaceful civilian women and children, commercial businesses and homes" and claimed the downing of four allied airplanes.
Other accounts also suggested widespread bombing. The Iranian press agency reported overnight bombing of the southern Iraqi towns of Fao, Basra, Abul Khasib and Zuhair. Jordanian officials said allied air strikes had been reported again Monday on a highway in western Iraq that has been pounded by warplanes trying to keep Iraq from launching missiles toward Israel.
 
Jordan Rebuts the U.S.
 Today, Jordan formally denied Washington's assertions that its fuel supply trucks from Baghdad were mingling with military supply convoys on the highway.
The American assertions, made Monday by the State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, were the latest in a series that have persuaded some Jordanians that Washington wants to destabilize Jordan or punish it for tilting toward Baghdad in the gulf crisis.
Iraq is now Jordan's only supplier of crude oil, which is brought in tanker trucks from Baghdad. Allied air attacks on the highway, Jordanian officials said today, have killed 8 Jordanian truck drivers and crippled more than 30 trucks. Last week, Foreign Minister Taher el-Masri accused the coalition of deliberately aiming at Jordanian civilian traffic on the highway.
Information Minister Ibrahim Izzedine told reporters today, "We can categorically deny that our nationals involve themselves in any military activities in Iraq."
 
U.S. Embassy Staff Is Cut
 The United States has also surprised Jordanians by ordering its embassy staff here reduced further and by urging Americans to leave the country as soon as possible. Washington has not explained the move. It has also challenged what Jordan calls the "tacit agreement" by which it breaks United Nations sanctions on Iraq with its oil imports. Mr. Izzedine said Jordan was negotiating to buy oil from Syria.
United States officials here declined to comment on the widespread perception of American hostility toward Jordan, which has deepened an already profound anti-Americanism among a population, more than half Palestinian, that sympathizes with Iraq.
West European diplomats suggested that the anti-American climate may have persuaded the United States that it is only a matter of time before its officials or installations here become the target of terrorist assault.

 	 	 		--------------------	 		 	 	
 
Iraq Assails U.N. Chief
 UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Iraq has attacked Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar again for not opposing the bombing of Iraq.
As the letter was made public, officials said the World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens Fund were planning to send a joint mission to Baghdad next week carrying medicines and other medical supplies.
The new Iraqi letter, addressed to Mr. Perez de Cuellar and received Monday, was signed by Foreign Minister Aziz. It accuses the Secretary General of "keeping silent" about "crimes against Iraqi citizens."
Mr. Perez de Cuellar has on several occasions expressed concern over damage to civilian targets and loss of life, most recently over reports that Jordanian truck drivers had been bombed by allied warplanes in Iraq.
In a letter last month, Iraq also criticized the Secretary General for doing nothing about the raids.

Polaroid Earnings Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Polaroid Corporation said today that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 18 percent, but the company warned that its profits will be squeezed this year by the recession and investments in new products. Polaroid's net income for the quarter was $55 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with $46.5 million, or 72 cents a share in the 1989 period. Sales rose 11 percent, to $596.2 million, from $538.1 million. The company said its results were bolstered by strong overseas sales of instant cameras and conventional film.

HEADLINE: Drought May Alter Face Of California as It Spurs Showdown Over Water

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Once it seemed that there would always be plenty of water for Fred Starrh to irrigate the rich soil in Kern County on the western slopes of California's Central Valley. Come February, he would normally plow and irrigate for the cotton crop and water the alfalfa.
But the state system of dams and reservoirs on which he has long depended cut off water to him and thousands of other farmers on Monday as drought tightened its grip on California. So he will not be growing any cotton, and maybe only one crop of alfalfa. 
 "This is the worst in 40 years we've been farming," he said recently on his farm in Shafter in Kern County. "To just come up all of a sudden and say you are not going to get any water -- I never thought we'd end up like this."
 
Another Threatened Cut
 In Sacramento today, Federal officials said the drought might force them to cut water to growers from the other main water project in the state, the federally owned Central Valley Project, by up to 75 percent.
Critics of the water policy say that it is just as well that farmers like Mr. Starrh are being forced to stop growing crops like cotton and alfalfa. For years, they maintain, the economics of farming and the low rates charged for water have led farmers to waste water on high water-demanding crops of comparatively low value. Some of the crops, like rice and cotton, are subsidized by the Federal Government.
Farmers use 85 percent of all available water in California. Over the last two generations California built vast water projects to channel water from the mountains and streams of northern California to create the nation's largest farm industry in the Central Valley and huge sprawling cities in arid Southern California. For a long time, it seemed that there was enough water for both.
 
Titanic Political Struggle
 But the drought, now in its fifth year and the worst in the state's history, and relentless population growth are forcing a titanic political struggle that could well change the face of the largest state. Officials in major cities, now imposing unpopular rationing on urban dwellers, are looking for ways to divert water from farms to cities.
The water rights of the farmers were established decades ago when agriculture was the dominant industry of the state, and even as the population growth shifted the economic power to industrialized cities, the farmers retained their water rights. State officials have said there is only a 50-50 chance that they will be able to deliver half of the amount of water that urban and industrial users are expecting.
Alfalfa alone, which is sold mainly as hay for cattle and horses and requires more water per acre than any major crop except rice, uses more water than the combined household needs of 30 million Californians each year. Last year, more than 20 percent of farmland was planted with alfalfa, which used 16 percent of all available water. Cotton took another 16 percent of acreage and 8 percent of the water.
"A lot of these crops are low value," said John Krautkraemer, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund in Oakland, which has been arguing for economic incentives to encourage farmers to sell some of their water rights to urban users. "This would not be taking place if we did not have subsidies or water rights that were decided a long time ago. If alfalfa is really that valuable to farmers, then they should be willing to pay more for water. It makes sense when you have a valuable resource like water not to be giving it away."
 
Farmers Defend Their Crops
 Farm interests defend the growing of hay, which brought receipts of $869 million to farmers in 1989. It is essential to the states's $2 billion dairy industry, second only to Wisconsin's, said Mary-Ann Warmerdam, director of natural resources for the 83,000-member California Farm Bureau Federation. It would not be economical to import hay from distant states, she said, adding that alfalfa, as a nitrogen-fixing legume, was an important rotational crop that replenished soil.
"Strangely enough, cows who eat hay make milk for kids in Los Angeles," said Mr. Starrh, who usually grows 2,900 acres of alfalfa. "I don't think we're growing something the public doesn't want."
Nowhere are these issues more pointed than here in Kern County, one of the nation's richest farm areas, with 856,059 irrigated acres of grapes, cotton, almonds, carrots, potatos, sugar beats and alfalfa among the crops.
The chief supplier of water here is the Kern County Water Agency, the second largest user of water from the state's system of dams and reservoirs, known as the State Water Project. Last year it took 21 percent of all the project's water, which was 557,000 acre-feet. This year, the agency expects to see its allotment cut to about 35,000 acre-feet. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons, enough to supply two average households for a year.
This spells economic calamity for the county, according to the agency, which estimates total direct revenue losses will be $4.1 billion. That includes $1.6 billion in lost income, with 7,700 farm workers and 3,900 people in support industries put of work.
Skeptics dispute these dire forecasts, saying that farm output has not declined during the first four years of drought, despite substantial cutbacks in water, because farmers have managed to find substitute supplies, mainly by drilling for water.
 
Lack of Underground Water
 But that is not an option for many, including Mr. Starrh, who like most of his neighbors is entirely dependent on the state water because there is no water under the ground. In addition to alfalfa and cotton, he grows almonds on his farm, 23 miles west of his home here. The hilly land sits just above the mighty aqueduct that carries water south to Los Angeles, but this year he cannot have a drop of it.
Normally, he hires up to 100 men to help move the heavy irrigation lines through the crops. But what little work there is now is done by his two sons, Fred Jr. and Larry, and two sons-in-law, Jay Kroeker and Mike Brown. Even before Monday's cutoff by the state, Mr. Starrh had decided to abandon his cotton crop and to cut back his alfalfa harvest to just one cutting instead of seven.
In the past, he paid the local water district $75 an acre-foot for his water, and spent another $17 an acre-foot to pump it. Thus water accounted for 40 percent of his cost of raising alfalfa and 30 percent for cotton.
The farmers who depend on water from the Central Valley Project, who are mainly along the eastern half of the Central Valley, pay only about $15 an acre-foot for water.
"California is reaping what it has sewn," Mr. Starrh said. "There has been no new water development for 15 years and the state has grown from 20 million to 30 million people. Now they come to agriculture and say, 'You do something to get more water for these people.' "
But others believe the drought will accelerate a transformation in California that will be every bit as powerful and wrenching as that wrought by the first irrigation projects decades ago, when wheat farmers were driven out by cotton and rice and vegetable growers and by the thrist of Los Angeles and other spreading cities.
"The days of super-rich Federal subsidies for water and crops is coming to an end," said Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg, a Democrat from Sacramento, who a member of the State Assembly's Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee. The time has come, said, for urban users to offer to help farmers financially to convert to more efficient irrigation and new crops in exchange for some of their water rights.

HEADLINE: U.S. Acts to End Monopolies In New York Trash Hauling

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
The United States Justice Department is negotiating to sell commercial garbage-collection routes in New York City to some of the nation's biggest waste-disposal companies, a move that could open the way to more competition in a business widely viewed as controlled by organized crime.
To encourage entrants into the market, the city would consider buying back the routes if the original purchasers wished to sell because of intimidation, the city's Consumer Affairs Commissioner said yesterday. The Justice Department confiscated the routes from private haulers who did not pay criminal fines for illegal dumping. 
 For years, Government officials and local businesses have dreamed of infusing more competition into the city's private garbage-hauling industry and of wresting it from the hands of organized crime.
City officials say restricted competition has raised the cost of doing business in New York City, where commercial enterprises must contract with private haulers to remove trash.
What has made other haulers reluctant to enter the New York market is fear that their equipment will be damaged and employees harmed by entrenched haulers, some controlled by organized crime, government officials say.
 
Many Earlier Investigations
 The private hauling industry has been a subject of many largely unproductive Federal, state and city investigations into charges of racketeering and anti-competitive criminal behavior.
The biggest garbage-hauling companies have long sought a piece of the lucrative New York market, estimated by city officials at $1 billion a year. But "this is a very, very vicious situation," an industry executive said.
The Justice Department has scheduled a meeting on Feb. 20 with several companies, including Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston and Laidlaw Inc. of Burlington, Ontario, said Mark Green, the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, whose department licenses private haulers.
The meeting was confirmed by Marc Holloway, a court-appointed monitor of the seized garbage companies. He is with the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche.
Mark Hellerer, chief of the major crimes unit for the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said he could neither confirm nor deny the scheduling of the meeting, but he said the routes were for sale.
The Justice Department took over the routes when it confiscated assets of four private-hauling companies whose two owners were sentenced to prison in October for illegal dumping on Staten Island. The companies have more than 2,000 customers in Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan and on Staten Island, putting them among the city's bigger operators.
The owners -- Angelo Paccione, 51 years old, and Anthony Vulpis, 39, who are serving 12-year terms -- failed to pay $22 million in fines. The Government is trying to recover the amount by selling the hauling companies, now operated by a trustee appointed by Judge Constance Baker Motley in Federal Court.
 
Department Licenses Haulers
 Laidlaw, a publicly held Canadian company that operates a waste-disposal subsidiary in many states, cannot confirm negotiations with the Justice Department, said a spokesman, T. A .G. Watson. Telephone calls to Browning-Ferris were not returned.
New York City has about 450 private garbage-hauling companies, ranging in size from one-truck operations to fleets with dozens of trucks. The Department of Consumer Affairs licenses the haulers and sets the rate they can charge the city's 250,000 businesses. Haulers own the garbage routes, which are regularly bought and sold. The city's Sanitation Department is responsible for picking up residential garbage.
"The private carting industry in New York City does not govern itself by the rules of the marketplace, but by the restraint of trade characterized by cartels," the Consumer Affairs Department said recently in a public statement. It said "carters violate the rules of economics by not competitively bidding for business."
"Instead, according to law-enforcement authorities, customers and routes are divided among haulers in the industry," the statement said.
Businesses that solicit competitive bids for removing their waste "nearly invariably" find that other haulers will not bid for new customers, the department said. Both businesses that try to switch haulers and new haulers who try to enter the market have faced threats, Commissioner Green said.
Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime Task Force, said his agency had been trying to increase competition by encouraging the bigger national companies to enter the New York market.
 
'Violence Wouldn't Pay Off'
 To address concerns of intimidation by entrenched haulers, the city may become the hauler "of last resort" for the routes up for sale and buy them back from a company that wanted to get out, Commissioner Green said. Such a pledge "would be sufficient to deter any violence, since it would mean that violence wouldn't pay off for the intimidating carter," he said.
If the city became the hauler of last resort, the Sanitation Department would be responsible for pickups.
A spokesman for private haulers said they did not do business through intimidation. "It's a myth," said Salvatore Spinelli, a lawyer for the Council of Trade Waste Associations, which represents many private haulers. "There are customers that change carters, and nothing has happened to them."
The reason why bigger companies are not interested in New York City is lagging profitability, Mr. Spinelli said. "The collection end is no longer as glamorous or profitable as it had been 20 years ago," he said. In addition, he said, the bigger companies are put off by the "tough market."
"Can you imagine these Harvard business types dealing with the merchants on 14th Street?" he said.

HEADLINE: Proposal Has Supporters, But Many Raise Objections

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Treasury's proposal to overhaul the banking system was applauded yesterday by executives of some of the nation's largest banks, but it provoked objections from competing financial companies and from smaller banks.
Although the latest Treasury suggestions have the backing of the President, bankers remain cautious because many earlier efforts to change the banking laws have failed. A key issue in the minds of many bankers is whether heavy losses in the federally guaranteed deposit insurance program will be seen as a reason to control banks more tightly rather than grant them the power to enter new businesses. 
 "If we bankers are going to bear the burden of financing Federal deposit insurance, it is important that we get some quid pro quo in the form of changes in regulations that allow us to compete in the modern world," said John Rau, president of LaSalle National Bank in Chicago. "I'm worried that the people in Congress will want us to shoulder the losses of the F.D.I.C. but then say it is too risky to let banks broaden their activities."
 
'Sound, Sensible Package'
 Richard L. Huber, vice chairman of the Continental Bank Corporation in Chicago, said, "The Treasury has presented a sound, sensible package, but I would not bet a great deal of my personal money on it becoming law."
Patrick Forte, director of the Association of Financial Services Holding Companies, a group that represents large banking and other financial companies, was more optimistic about prospects for the plan. "Legislators in Washington are not particularly proud of the mess we are in," he said, "and I think this package will become law."
He said the most likely amendments would preserve more of the regulatory powers of state authorities and reduce the Treasury's oversight of banks.
Many Treasury proposals, like allowing a full range of securities sales and trading, conveying more power to sell insurance products, and developing a nationwide network of branches, have long been strongly backed by large banks. The chairmen of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan all issued statements yesterday supporting the proposals.
 
2 Groups Speak Up
 But among smaller banks, and at firms whose businesses would become more open to competition from banks, the Treasury proposal was criticized. The small banks that make up the Independent Bankers Association of America, for example, do not like the idea of allowing nationwide branches. And the Securities Industry Association, which represents Wall Street firms, again warned that bank activities financed with insured deposits should be kept separate from securities trading.
Some of the strongest complaints of bankers concerned a proposal to limit a customer's insured deposits at a single bank to $100,000 for ordinary accounts and to $100,000 for an Individual Retirement Account.
Thomas E. Hales, chief executive of the Union State Bank in Nanuet, N.Y., warned that the proposal "is going to kill the small banks." "Even before this gets to Congress," he said, large depositors at small banks will begin shifting funds to Treasury securities or to larger banks, "which will still be perceived as too big to fail."
Jeffrey Gerhart, president of the First National Bank of Newman Grove, Neb., also said deposit insurance limits should not be narrowed. "People want to put their money where they live and feel safe about it."
Edward Yingling, the top lobbyist for the American Bankers Association, said he expected the Treasury proposals to be supported by banks of all sizes. "We are getting rid of the idea that some banks are too big to fail," he said.
 
Opposition From Insurers
 The Treasury sugggested that Federal prohibitions on the sale of insurance by banks be removed and that states be allowed to set rules for such sales.
Insurance agents, who have long fought to prevent banks from entering their business, are sure to fight the Treasury proposal. Banks have long sought a bigger piece of the brokerage fees and commissions paid to insurance agents for property and casualty insurance, which amounted to more than $23 billion in 1989, saying it is a low-risk business that is a natural extension of banking activities. Life insurance products like annuities are also incresingly attractive to banks, because they are an alternative to ordinary savings accounts or certificates of deposit.
The Treasury proposal to allow industrial companies to own banks drew criticism even before the Treasury study was issued.
E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said late last week that he doubted whether Federal regulators could keep a tight rein on potentially abusive practices if a banking company was controlled by a nonfinancial corporation, and questioned the accuracy of claims that the banking industry needs access to the capital of these companies.

HEADLINE: Administration Presents Its Plan For Broad Overhaul of Banking

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Bush Administration today formally presented its plan for the most sweeping overhaul of the nation's banking system since the Great Depression.
The proposal, the broad outlines of which had been widely known here for weeks, offers the nation's commercial banking system a competitive landscape unrestrained by many of the barriers and regulations that were installed by the Government after the national banking crisis in the 1930's. 
 The most important elements of the plan would allow commercial and investment banks to merge and would push down the barriers to interstate banking. It would also permit industrial companies to own banks.
 
A Search for Security
 The Administration's aim, which reflects both political and regulatory realities, is to brace the nation's banking system by offering it new avenues for profits that would ultimately enhance the safety and the security of the system and in the long run benefit the economy. [Page D6.]
But in a bow to the likely barrage of opposition from the insurance and real estate lobbies, the Administration stopped short of recommending that Congress allow banks to engage in the real estate business through direct investment. Also, the plan would permit insurance ventures only if a banking company's home state allows banks to sell insurance.
In a news conference, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that the Adminstration had two main goals: to strengthen a banking system that is under stress and to make banks more competitive internationally.
"We must modernize our banking laws to deal with the reality of the marketplace," he said, emphasizing the point several times during the news conference. "We now have one United States bank in the top 30 internationally. Twenty years ago, we had 9 banks in the top 30."
The proposal represents only the starting process for months of debate in Congress. The plan received a tepid, and in some instances hostile, response from some lawmakers today. Several of them warned that the Administration's plan harked back to the Reagan Administration's ill-fated effort to help the savings and loan industry in the early 1980's by allowing savings institutions to plunge into previously forbidden ventures.
For months, officials have stressed the need to address the shakiness of the banking system. Heightening the urgency, reports in recent days by both the White House and the Congressional Budget Office said the fund that insures bank deposits might need a taxpayer bailout within two years. Today's plan did not specifically address how to shore up the deposit insurance fund.
These are the major features of the Administration's plan:
*Industrial companies would be permitted to own banks, but in such arrangements insured deposits would be held in a separate affiliate to prevent their use in speculative ventures.
*Banks would be able to open branches in other states without restrictions, to buy banks in other states, to sell mutual funds and to enter investment banking activities like underwriting corporate securities..
*Banks would be permitted to sell insurance if that is allowed in the states where they operate or are chartered. Sixteen states now permit banks to sell insurance.
*The regulation of banks and savings and loans, which is now shared by four agencies, would be consolidated. The Federal Reserve Board would regulate state-chartered banks; a new agency under the Treasury Department, called the Federal Banking Agency, would oversee nationally chartered banks and savings associations.
*Loopholes in the laws on deposit insurance would be closed. An individual could have only two insured accounts in any one bank: a regular account, with insurance coverage limited to $100,000, and a retirement account, also with a limit of $100,000. Large depositors could still get broader coverage by having accounts at more than one bank.
*There would be a continuation of the policy of protecting all deposits, no matter how large, at those banks considered "too big to fail." Enforcement would be taken out of the hands of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and shared between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.
The plan, which had been supported by large banks but worried smaller institutions, rewards financially strong banks by giving them the authority to enter into new businesses, like investment banking.The amount of capital, or long-term investment, that a bank has is the criterion for determining financial strength, and those institutions that are deemed poorly capitalized would be put under tighter control of the Government.
Mr. Brady said in an interview that he had initially been reluctant to endorse industrial ownership of banks, but that he was now convinced that adequate safeguards could be established to prevent a financial services conglomerate from squandering insured deposits.
In exchange for the right to own a bank, the industrial company would come under increased supervision from Washington. Regulators would have the authority to order a reduction in the parent company's dividends or the outright sale of some or all of its ownership in the bank if it is unable to comply with Federal standards on its financial health.
Under the plan, commercial banks would be permitted to lend to affiliated investment banks or other businesses, but only if the transaction meets the bank's usual standards and the loan is fully collateralized.
The main targets of the proposal are laws that were intended to curb speculative excesses that led to the collapse of the banking industry in the 1930's. These include the McFadden Act of 1927, which sharply limited interstate banking; the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which restricted the mergers of investment banks and commercial banks, and the Bank Holding Act of 1956, which prevented industrial companies from owning banks.
Over the years, there has been some erosion of these barriers. The Federal Reserve Board last September took a significant bite out of the Glass-Steagall restrictions when it gave permission to J. P. Morgan & Company to engage in securities underwriting, although with numerous limitations. Since then, three other banks have received similar permission. But the Federal Reserve does not have the authority to remove many of the remaining barriers.
For more than two decades, politicians have sought to overhaul the banking system. Indeed, many of today's proposals, particularly those aimed at changing the structure of the regulatory agencies, were recommended by a task force in 1984 that was headed by George Bush when he was Vice President. For the most part, that report had negligible impact on Congress.
 
Some Reasons for Worry
 But Treasury officials are hoping that today's plan stands a greater chance of passage because of the rapidly declining health of many of the nation's banks and the increasing concerns that taxpayers' money may be needed to bail out the industry.
One of the most urgent aspects of the plan, the reorganization of the fund that insures banks, is still being formulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and bankers. Mr. Brady insisted again today that taxpayer money would not be needed to rescue the insurance fund.
The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Henry B. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, indicated that he would oppose many elements of the proposal, including those aspects that give banks broader powers and change the regulatory structure.
"This is the same 'cart before the horse' mentality which plagued the deregulation of the savings and loan industry in the early 1980's," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Let's set the speed limits and train the policemen before we open a new super-expressway for financial institutions."
 
Matter of Priorities
 The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said Congress would probably first address the issue of the health of the bank insurance fund before it turned to overhauling the banking structure.
"Interstate banking is an issue whose time has probably come," Mr. Riegle said. "But we have to be addressing the most urgent concerns first."
John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said he would oppose the measure.
"Wall Street is a dry hole today, and even in the best of times it is an extremely risky business," Mr. Dingell said. "Allowing weak banks into the securities field or into insurance, which has solvency problems, will simply compound the problems of both."
 
Considering the Opposition
 Treasury officials said this week that they had sought to tailor the plan to remove much of the potential opposition, even if such changes would make the proposal fall short of their ideal.
In an interview in his office on Monday, Mr. Brady said he had decided early on not to challenge too many industries and interest groups for fear that it would doom the legislation.
"Don't wreck your chances of getting the three or four most important things done," Mr. Brady said he had told his staff. "Instead, leave that for a later day."
He said one provision of the plan, regarding the ability of banks to sell insurance, was strongly influenced by his days as a Senator from New Jersey when he saw the power of the insurance industry. In 1982, he introduced an amendment that would have expanded the power of banks to sell insurance. The proposal received virtually no support, and Mr. Brady had to quickly withdraw it.
The plan's drafters also decided to propose that banks be prohibited from making direct investments in real estate out of concern that otherwise the real estate lobby would seriously threaten passage of the plan.
 
A Much-Disputed Issue
 Perhaps the most politically charged issue is the limitations that would be imposed on insurance of bank deposits.
Late last week, senior Treasury officials were telling members of Congress that the Administration was going to recommend that an individual be allowed to have no more than two $100,000 insured accounts in the entire banking system.
But after facing a groundswell of complaints from bankers, who argued that such restrictions would lead to bank runs, the Treasury Department retreated from that position. Instead, it recommended that the limits be imposed on a per-bank basis instead of systemwide.
But the plan kept a proposal to limit the protection of institutional investors, like pension funds and securities firms, that break huge deposits into amounts of $100,000 to obtain complete insurance coverage. Under the Tresury plan, such deposits would no longer be protected.
Mr. Brady said the Treasury Department had initially considered creating one super-regulatory body that would supervise all banks and savings associations. But that idea was scrapped when the department concluded that it did not want to give up its authority to an independent regulator and that Congress would be unlikely to approve any plan in which all regulators would be part of the Administration.
"We split the baby down the middle," Mr. Brady said. "We wound up with a proposal that does a good part of what's needed, but doesn't go all the way and shake up the system when it can least afford it."

HEADLINE: High-Tech Takes On Truffles

BYLINE: By DENA KLEIMAN

DATELINE: CAHORS, France

 BODY:
DARIUS, an unusually well-mannered Labrador, has had a productive life here in the Quercy region of south-central France. At this time of year, he scratched around the earth, picked up the scent of truffles and found them for his master, in exchange for cookies.
But now Darius, along with the rest of the dogs -- and trained pigs -- that work the fields of France may be out of a job. 
 As scientists unlock the secrets around the prized black Perigord truffle, they are revolutionizing the way that truffle is grown, where it is found and even how it may be defined. They are also developing technology that could make it possible to hunt truffles with a machine.
"We don't have it yet, but we will," said Jacques Pebeyre, one of France's largest truffle merchants, who has helped finance the research for such a device.
This is one of the more dramatic new ventures under way in the hunt for the lusty black truffle -- Tuber melanosporum -- which is currently at the height of its harvest here in France and elsewhere. The ventures, including a synthetic that offers a chemical replica of the truffle's aroma, are raising questions about the truffle industry and where it is headed.
"Can you imagine a machine to find truffles?," said Richard Tarlov, director of product development for Balducci 's in New York, which is selling fresh black truffles these days for $1.25 a gram or $560 a pound. "It takes the soul out of the hunt. To me, it takes away from the aura of the item."
Truffle production has been on the decline in France and elsewhere for decades. At the turn of the century an estimated 1,000 tons were produced in France, but the average yield today is only about 50 tons.
But world demand for the pungent fungus -- which grows underground, looks like a piece of coal, smells not unlike old socks and has sold, retail, for as much as $650 a pound -- remains high, and incentives to increase production are strong.
While truffles represent only a small piece of the economy of the Query region, they are nevertheless a $50 million- to $100 million-a-year business.
Any changes in the industry could have a significant effect not only on the individuals who hunt them and the entrepreneurs who distribute them worldwide, but also on the gourmet shops and retail shops that sell truffles directly to consumers.
Because the truffle is a fungus that grows in the root systems of oak and hazelnut trees, much of the research revolves around developing special techniques of irrigation, fertilization and temperature control to enhance its growth.
Truffles sprout on the roots of trees, but eventually separate from the roots and grow in the earth on their own. It is known is that truffles require a temperate climate, an alkaline soil and a rather eccentric pattern of rainfall. Underground, they are undetectable to the human nose.
Truffles first develop in late March but are not ready for harvest until November to early April. Trees once had to be at least 20 years old before their roots produced truffles, but modern techniques have made it possible to harvest truffles from trees as young as four years. Truffle scientists say a tree can produce truffles until it is about 60. The hope is that as an increasing number of newly planted trees reach maturity, the harvest of truffles will soar.
"We are interested in anything that will enhance truffle production," said Paul Bonnet, a truffle producer in Carpentras, who recently started a clearinghouse for scientific information involving truffle research.
But these changes continue to meet with resistance in the Quercy region, where pigs and dogs still dig and root in the fields, and farmers hawk their bounty at a weekly truffle market. Some people suspect the precision of science when it comes to something as mysterious as the truffle. Others fear that all this objectivity will jeopardize the romance and lore intrinsic to truffles.
"People here don't want to talk about yield per acre," said Michel Kulifag, a biologist on the faculty of Paul Sabatie University in Toulouse and a truffle consultant. "They prefer that truffles remain mysterious." Dr. Kulifag said he had explained the optimum conditions for the truffle and specified irrigation schedules to the farmers, but many ignored them.
"It's anathema to say that truffles can be grown like corn," said Pierre Sourzat, a specialist in truffles on the faculty of the Lycee Agricole in Cahors. He also says that one day it may be possible to do so.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pebeyre, whose family has been selling truffles since 1897, finds himself in a nettlesome situation. He is a staunch promoter of the authentic black Perigord truffle and has spent tens of thousands of dollars on trying to find out all there is to know about the fungus. Not long ago scientists at Paul Sabatie University who worked under his financing told him they had just unmasked the 15 chemical compounds that make up the truffle's haunting aroma. Then they explained that they could manufacture a synthetic equivalent.
"That was the worst day of my life," Mr. Pebeyre said, adding that he told them not to produce the substance. But after they told him that they felt compelled to publish their results and that if he would not do the manufacturing someone else would, he gave them the go-ahead.
He now holds the patent for the process and has started marketing the synthetic substance, infused in safflower oil for use in omelets and salads. A small tin -- enough for about eight omelets -- is about $6. At the moment it is available only to chefs in France, but Mr. Pebeyre says he hopes to make it available to a wider market soon.
On a recent afternoon truffle hunt, Darius the Labrador stopped in his tracks: his master had surreptitiously poured synthetic-truffle liquid on the ground. Darius pawed madly at the earth, to find nothing. That led scientists to envision a machine that could hunt truffles. The machine, under study by chemists at Paul Sabatie, would be a kind of electronic nose or Geiger counter that would scan the earth for the chemical compounds that create the truffle's aroma. Pigs and dogs are thought to miss up to 80 percent of the truffles they hunt. The industry, Mr. Pebeyre said, envisions a machine small enough to carry on the shoulder and inexpensive enough to compare with the upkeep of a dog.
But new technology is not the only force shaping the truffle market or fueling fears about its future. Many people in the industry say the reputation of the black truffle itself is being eroded, largely because of public misunderstanding and fraud.
The public is frequently confused, people in the industry say, between the real black Perigord truffle and the much inferior "summer truffle."
The black Perigord truffle, which actually is more common in other parts of France, Italy and Spain than to Perigord, is a winter truffle and can only be bought fresh at this time of year. The summer truffle, Tuber aestivum, is black outside but white inside, has comparatively little flavor, costs about a tenth the price of a black truffles and can be bought fresh only in summer.
In the past several months the French Government has accused several major distributors of dying summer truffles black; dying truffles without disclosing the fact is illegal.
Confusion can arise when truffles are bought canned. If consumers simply ask for "truffles" without specifying which kind, they may not receive the authentic all-black variety.
Leon Pinto, president of La Compagnie Gourmand in Washington, which produces truffles in Europe and imports them to the United States, said there is a market for dyed summer truffles among caterers and others "who would like to feature truffles on their menu but don't have the money for the real stuff." Mr. Pinto said the summer truffle is inferior and gives the Perigord variety a bad name.
"It's definitely misleading," said Mr. Pinto, adding that until the name truffle is internationally regulated and applies only to Tuber melanosporum, spotting fakes will be difficult.
While the clamor over truffle fraud builds, just about every afternoon, the south-central French farmers, wicker basket in hand, trusty dog or pig in tow, try their luck.
Recently Pierre La Rinaudie, 63 years old, showed up in Mr. Pebeyre's office here in Cahors with one large truffle and two small pieces that he had just unearthed. The treasures were covered with dirt.
Mr. La Rinaudie said he had been walking along the highway with his dog when he found the prize. Mr. Pebeyre, who usually deals in deliveries of several hundred pounds at a clip, nevertheless inspected the bounty, placed it on the scale, and pronounced the truffles "good." Then he handed over 220 francs, the equivalent of about $44. Not bad change for an afternoon stroll.
Mr. La Rinaudie said he had never heard of a machine that could find truffles. It didn't seem to interest him much. But then, he confided, he never eats truffles.

Honest, Earthy Clothes for Men

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
WHEN designers make more clothes for the woods than for the nightclub, something is up. Burliness, honesty, naturalness and integrity -- these are the qualities American men's wear designers celebrated in their fall showings last week.
The new ideals were embodied in the reverse chic of a plaid hunter's jacket, the zippered workingman's sweater or the salesman's reversible balmacaan raincoat. In men's fashion, the predatory elegance of the white-collar criminal has had its day. 
 Amid the uncertainty of war and recession, quiet, quality clothes are the thing. Preening is probably out, although Robert Forsythe, the Perry Ellis designer, made a case for it with cashmere tuxedos, in bright colors, and Joseph Abboud slipped elaborately embroidered vests under his evening jackets.
Isaac Mizrahi , whose instinct for the fabulous injected some life into men's wear last year, said recently that henceforth he would design only the kind of men's clothes he would wear himself. This is a bit like Attila the Hun saying, "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."
But Mr. Mizrahi, who is fond of gold lame sport jackets in his personal wardrobe, has toned down his act without sacrificing style. His fall collection is very carefully tailored in the English way -- trim shoulders and a suppressed waist -- and very plaid, from its Shetland sport jackets in bold plaids to cashmere-blend blazers in Royal Stewart tartans.
His full-cut camel's hair polo coats, in brown or camel, are as classic as a weekend in Newport. A traditional double-breasted banker's pinstripe gray suit was in a knit fabric (such suits are nearly always woven). By making his knitwear in tailored shapes, Mr. Mizrahi achieves the feel of a sweater but the look of a suit. He has very quickly gotten into the men's wear groove.
The show for Basco (an acronym for Barneys All-American Sportswear Company ) borrowed its theme from southern Italy to portray its version of honest, humble clothes. The lights came up on a group of models sitting on old wooden crates. Not playing dominoes exactly, but that kind of thing. These faux Sicilian homeboys were dressed in relaxed layers: a polo sweater under a cardigan or workman's sweater with patches, charcoal wool or leather jackets, topped by wool caps. Jackets in microfiber -- a velvety polyester -- hooded sweatshirts in wool and track pants in stretch twill combined street looks with better fabrics.
The Basco designer, Lance Karesh, is fluent in men's wear idioms that range from thrift-shop-style Ivy League jackets to workman's clothing, and this translates into clothes not terribly expensive but with a strong element of style.
One designer who is not afraid to be offbeat, but who can produce fine-tailored garments, is Sabato Russo . His workroom above the Strand Bookstore on Lower Broadway is on the same floor as the tailoring factory that makes his clothes. For fall, Mr. Russo showed a complete line of suits, most of which are in untraditional fabrics like alpaca, microfiber and satin gabardine.
While most of his silhouettes were classic, he also experimented with a modified Nehru cut, which he calls a "band collar" jacket, in both overcoats and business suits. Mr. Russo, who designed the men's wear for the Spike Lee film "Mo' Better Blues," makes clothes that have the modishness to suit a musician but are calm enough to be worn for business.
Several designers sought inspiration from workingman and woodsman contexts for their collections. Bill Robinson made zippered suits out of garbadine-twill mechanic's clothes and turned the shadow-plaid hunting coat into a sport jacket.
Mr. Robinson also tightened up his tailored silhouettes and continued to expand on his amazing range of colors for men, from a "leaf mousse" sweater to a "cadmium" corduroy suit.
One thing to note about men's fashion shows: they always seem to want to wrap you up in extra sweaters. At last week's Joseph Abboud show, there were "twin sets" for men and the inevitable sweaters wrapped around the waists and necks on sheepish male models.
Mr. Abboud, who has been named men's wear designer of the year two years in a row by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, is a creative traditionalist. For example, the trousers for his tuxedos were cuffed. For his tailored clothing, the shades were olive, the shapes classic.
But most of Mr. Abboud's show was devoted to rugged outdoors, like something a James Fenimore Cooper character would wear, including shearling-lined wool coats, distressed leather shearlings and hunter's plaid jackets.
The models, with their plaid jackets, lambswool hooded sweatshirts and houndstooth-check wool caps looked less like the urban homeboys of recent seasons and more like Natty Bumppo out for a lark.

HEADLINE: FOOTBALL;
It's Official: Big East to Play Football

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Feb. 5

 BODY:
After decades of futile discussions in which independent Eastern colleges were unable to form a football alliance, eight universities came together this morning to compete under a banner that changed the college sports marketplace in the 1980's.
Syracuse, Boston College and Pittsburgh, which had maintained football independence while competing in other sports within the Big East Conference, and Miami, the league's newest full-time member, will join with four other schools to participate in a Big East football league. Conference play will begin this fall on a limited basis, and the four additional schools -- Rutgers, Temple, West Virginia and Virginia Tech -- will compete in the Big East only in football. 
 The eight-team football league aspires to the same marketing and competitive triumphs that men's basketball programs began to realize when the Big East Conference was founded nearly 12 years ago.
 
Troubling Climate
 The difference between the discussions that have made this idea a success and the longtime frustrations that preceded them is the troubling climate within the industry.
"People want to make it work," said Fred Gruninger, the Rutgers athletic director. "There was no question in my mind that independents have become an endangered species."
"You don't want to get shut out," said William Flynn, the Boston College athletic director emeritus. "If you're not in a league, what independents are there? You just have no one to play."
 
Contract Is Investigated
 The universities sought a sense of security to help endure one of the most volatile periods in the history of college athletics.
The College Football Association's television agreement is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Conference affiliations have been uncertain since Penn State was accepted last year to join the Big Ten. The bowl-game structure is vulnerable to proposals for a national playoff. And the decision of Sunkist this week to end its sponsorship of the Fiesta Bowl is the latest example of economic instability threatening the foundations of the sport.
The eight schools have responded because of a proven formula. The sight of a Big East emblem on a football and a helmet might seem out of place in the winter of 1991, but the machinery that helped transform Seton Hall and Connecticut from floundering basketball programs into nationally ranked championship contenders is already working to achieve the same sort of success in football.
 
Basketball Is Unaffected
 "I believe that by the end of 1991," said Mike Tranghese, the conference commissioner, "people will be sick and tired of hearing about us."
The new football arrangement will not have any effect on the basketball league, which Tranghese said would remain at nine teams.
Each football program has agreed to play at least five conference opponents no later than the 1995 season, although a Big East champion will be declared next fall, based on criteria not yet been determined.
The league's television network plans to syndicate a game of the week next season, in addition to seeking national network and cable appearances to be arranged under the C.F.A. agreement. A finance committee will oversee a revenue-sharing plan.
 
A Standard of Success
 The beginning of the Big East football league, symbolically if unofficially, came with Miami's decision last month to wear the conference emblem on its jerseys during its penalty-marred Cotton Bowl victory over Texas. Miami provides the league a standard of success represented by three unofficial national championships in the last eight years. Syracuse and West Virginia also played bowl games in recent seasons with the prospect of earning the top rank in the news-agency polls.
But most significant, the Big East football league will be able to claim at least 25 percent of the television households in the nation, and 5 of the top 16 markets, in the negotiations that will define its future.
"It gives us another dimension to what we are individually," said Jake Crouthamel, the Syracuse athletic director. "It gives us a forum to express ourselves as one. It gives us an opportunity to have access to things. Information. Keeping on top of situations. We had to do that individually before. Now we do it collectively."

HEADLINE: Everyone but Oil Companies Is for Cleaner Gas;
What Is Spilled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez spill two years ago, I heard oil referred to as the lifeblood of the United States economy. That image has more than one troubling implication when applied to two front-page headlines on Jan. 27: "Oil Spill, Growing Rapidly, Heads for Vital Saudi Sites" and "Hickel Wants Alaska to Go Prospecting Again."
An oil spill is never a purely accidental act. The Exxon Valdez was not accidentally carrying oil to a country accidentally craving it. No more or less accidental than the slick spreading over the Persian Gulf or a United States soldier losing blood as a result of a combat wound. Each is an extension of our national thirst for oil.
Gov. Walter J. Hickel of Alaska called in his State of the State address last week for oil drilling in North America's largest wildlife preserve, the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve. He also proposed an expansion of big state-funded projects, to be financed by a projected $2 billion surplus from Alaska's windfall from higher oil prices.
You quote him as saying, "Our goose that laid the golden egg, the North Slope oil, is running out, so we've got to build more geese." Unfortunately, it is too late to rebuild the casualties of our dependence on oil: the real geese and sea otters of Alaska, the oil-soaked cormorants of the Persian Gulf.
We must remember the troubling costs of continued dependence on foreign and domestic oil as lifeblood; for ourselves, our soldiers and the planet. The call on the Bush Administration to formulate a realistic energy policy for an oil-thirsty country must be loud and clear, and the debates in Congress and the Alaskan legislature over the future of the Arctic refuge should be taken as seriously as the debate over war.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Rodman & Renshaw Names a New President

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group Inc., a financial services concern in Chicago that has been expanding for two and a half years, yesterday named Norman E. Mains president and chief operating officer.
Mr. Mains, who is 47, is currently executive vice president of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, an investment firm in Los Angeles. He succeeds Howard B. Silverman, 52, who resigned Jan. 22 after about a year in the post. 
 Rodman & Renshaw's chairman and chief executive, Kurt B. Karmin, worked with Mr. Mains at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment firm that collapsed last year. Indeed, Rodman & Renshaw has hired several people from Drexel, Mr. Karmin said.
He said the company had grown to about $90 million in annual revenues, from about $30 million, during his two-and-a-half-year tenure and had expanded from a regional firm to one with offices in London and Vienna. The company has a fixed-income business and a commodities department, which Mr. Karmin said was started two years ago and now provides 25 percent of revenues.
Mr. Karmin said Mr. Mains would fit in because his background was in both fixed-income investments and in commodities. "He's one of the few people who understand the fixed-income business, the securities business and the commodities business," Mr. Karmin said. "To find a chief operating officer who can pitch in in all of these businesses is rare."
Mr. Mains said Rodman & Renshaw, with its feet in both securities and commodities and with retail and institutional accounts, "is in good shape for the 1990's in what is a relatively hostile environment for securities firms."
Mr. Mains has been at Bateman Eichler for two and a half years and has been responsible for its research, institutional sales, money management and public finance division as well as being its chief economist.
Before that, he was based in Chicago for six years as first vice president and director of research of Drexel's institutional financial futures and options division.
The Drexel post followed seven years with the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, where Mr. Mains was a senior economist and served under Arthur F. Burns, G. William Miller and Paul A. Volcker. He started his career as an economist for the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade association.
He is a graduate of the University of Colorado, where he received bachelor's and master's of arts degrees. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Warwick in England.

Swedes Join Foreign Rush To Build Hotels in Atlanta

BYLINE: By Ford Risley

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
A SWEDISH developer has begun construction of a luxury hotel here, its first project in the United States and one that will add to the city's growing inventory of foreign-owned hotels.
A privately owned development company based in Stockholm, Gullstedt Gruppen, is building a 50-story mixed-use tower that will include a 250-room luxury hotel as well as apartments and office space. 
 The $90 million GLG Tower, named for the company's United States subsidiary, GLG Center Inc., is being built in Midtown, the name that has been given to Atlanta's cultural district. In recent years, Midtown has been the site of increasing office construction. The project is expected to be completed late next year.
Gullstedt Gruppen is solely owned by G. Lars Gullstedt. The company's largest project to date is a 70-acre office and industrial park outside Stockholm, said Hans Tiveus, president of the company.
The hotel will occupy the first 19 floors of the 590,000-square-foot building, Mr. Tiveus said. It will be topped by five floors of office suites and 26 floors of apartments, with the office floors sandwiched between the hotel and the apartments. The project is being financed by Gotabanken, a Swedish bank.
The hotel will be operated by Occidental Hotels, a Spanish company that runs 22 hotels, primarily in Europe and the Caribbean, and will be known as the Occidental Hotel. Occidental's only other United States hotel is the Hotel Riverparc in Miami.
The Occidental is the latest foreign-owned luxury hotel to be built in Atlanta, which has long been dominated by the Hyatt, the Ritz-Carlton and the Western. Rates for the Occidental have not been set, but they are expected to be competitive with those of other prime hotels here.
The Hotel Niko, a joint development of the Japan Development Group and the Prudential Property Group, opened in October. The $80 million project has 440 rooms and rates average $135 a night.
The Swissotel, a $63 million joint development of Swissair and Ackerman & Company, an Atlanta developer, opened in January. The hotel's 358 rooms have an average rate of $145 a night.
A German-owned chain, the Penta Hotel Group, bought an existing Atlanta hotel last year and renovated it. The hotel has 504 rooms with average rates of $100 a night.
Atlanta has attracted hotel developers and investors from foreign countries because of its strong economy and the city's growing popularity as an international destination, said Henry B. Staley, vice president of Landauer Associates Inc., which tracks the hotel industry.
Nevertheless, the addition of so many rooms will probably keep the occupancy rate of luxury hotels at depressed levels for the next few years, Mr. Staley said.
The city's prime hotels had an average occupancy rate of 65.6 percent in 1990, largely unchanged from the year before, according to a survey by Landauer. But with the new rooms and a general economic slowdown, the rate will probably decline this year, he said.
"It's going to take a few years to absorb these rooms," Mr. Staley said. "In the long term, the hotels will be fine. But in the early years of those properties it's going to be tough going."
The Hotel Niko's occupancy rate is currently about 40 percent, said Yasuhiko Hando, the project manager. The rate has been steadily increasing since the hotel opened, however, and executives expect it to rise to 65 percent by the end of the year, he said.
The Swissotel has not been open long enough to gauge the response to it, but officials recognize that rooms will initially be slow to fill, said Janis Cannon, director of marketing. Still, she said, the company is encouraged that more than $2.5 million worth of business has already been reserved.
The Niko and Swissotel are both in Buckhead, a retail and office district north of downtown Atlanta. Buckhead already has several luxury hotels, among them the Ritz-Carlton.
In contrast, Midtown, which is between the Buckhead district and downtown, has fewer luxury hotels, which should give the Occidental Hotel an advantage in the higher-rate market, Mr. Tiveus said. He said he expected the Occidental to benefit from the recent growth of Midtown. I.B.M., A.T.&T. and BellSouth are among the companies that have opened large new offices in Midtown.
Mr. Tiveus said Gullstedt Gruppen had chosen Atlanta for its initial United States project because of the strong development climate and the fact that 60 Swedish businesses already had offices in the city.
GLG Tower was designed by Rabun Hatch & Associates of Atlanta. The rose-colored granite building will have a large arched facade and twin spires.
In addition to the tower site, Gullstedt Gruppen recently acquired three other parcels of land in Midtown, among them a 13-acre tract.
Mr. Tiveus would not comment on the company's plans for the other sites. But he noted that changes in Swedish tax laws last year had made it easier to invest outside the country.

HEADLINE: Germany Says It Seeks to Curb Its Arms Exporters

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced today that it would seek new sanctions against illegal arms exporters, as a result of the growing scandal over German arms exports to Iraq.
Under the proposals, the minimum prison term for those convicted of violating a trade embargo imposed by the United Nations would be increased from six months to one year, with maximum sentences up to 10 years. 
 In addition, an official statemet said, falsifying export reports would "be generally punished as a criminaloffense." The statement also said a export control office would be created in the Office for Trade and Industry.
The proposals are a reaction to intense public pressure for tighter control of weapons exports. Politicians of every stripe have begun calling for new and tighter export controls.
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has promised a Government crackdown on German "merchants of death," and Economics Minister Jurgen Mollemann says he is determined to close "the last loopholes" in German export laws.
Germany is the world's fifth largest arms exporter. Income from the sale ofweapons abroad accounts for about 5 percent of Germany's export earnings.
According to press reports that have been confirmed by the Government, German companies may have helped Iraq improve its Scud missiles and extend their range. Iraq has launched Scuds against Israel and Saudi Arabia since the Persian Gulf war began.
After the first Scud attacks, Israel accused Germany of "almost criminal laxity" in its export policies.
Press reports have also charged that German companies built poison gas plants in Iraq and provided precision timers and other sophisticated equipment to the Iraqi military."The murderers are among us," Peter Glotz, a prominent Social Democratic member of Parliament, said in a recent interview. "They sow death and they bring shame to Germany."
Much of the arms business between Germany and Iraq was conducted in the 1980's, when Western nations including the United States favored Iraq because of its hostility to Iran. Now that President Saddam Hussein has been widely branded as an international outlaw, those who supplied him with arms are coming under sharp criticism.
Government officials say at least nine German companies are under investigation on suspicion of violating export laws. Various government agencies, as well as several groups in Parliament, are preparing legal initiatives.
Some specialists who have beenworking for years to limit German arms exports, however, said today that they were uncertain whether the sudden interest from Bonn would produce substantial results.
"Every time there is a scandal, politicians start talking about changing the laws," said Kerstin Meinhardt, an investigator at the Documentation Center, a research and political action group based in the central city of Idstein. "It's an attempt to appease people. But the whole process gets dragged out over months, and when people have finally calmed down, we are told that the issue has either died in committee or that Parliament could not reach an agreement."
Ms. Meinhardt suggested that if the German authorities were serious about regulating exporters, they could do so under existing law.
 A coalition of consumer groups in Bonn has announced plans for a nationwide consumer boycott of German companies that have helped arm Iraq. Organizers say targets include about a dozen companies, including giants such as Siemens and Daimler-Benz.
German companies are not the only ones implicated in arms sales to Iraq. American and French corporations have sold sophisticated equipment to Iraq. British companies reportedly built army barracks and a military command center in Baghdad, while Belgian and Yugoslav concerns are said to have built reinforced underground hangars for Iraqi warplanes.
German officials could not say whether companies that may have built military installations in Iraq are providing information to the allies about what they had built and where.

HEADLINE: Poor Mothers on Their Own Prompt Gifts to the Neediest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
"I hope this can help another woman who has had to struggle against great odds."
This request accompanied a $750 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the donor, Rhoda Selvin, noted that the gift was in celebration of her victory in a 15-year sex discrimination suit. 
 Ms. Selvin, an assistant vice provost of undergraduate studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said yesterday that last year she received 10 years of back pay from the state university system and that she wished to share it with the Neediest Cases. Since her youth, it has been an annual practice for her to donate to the fund, but this time she more than tripled her previous gift and asked that it be used to help a woman.
"It seemed to be a fitting request," she said. "There are certainly many who need the help."
 
Aiding Seven Charities
 Over the last decade, women have become an increasing percentage of those who live under the poverty line. It is a problem that has concerned many who contribute to the Neediest Cases, and a number of gifts have been designated for single mothers.
The proceeds from the Neediest Cases are distributed to seven charities to aid the sick and the poor. The New York Times pays for the campaign's overhead. Money from the fund has provided a range of services for the elderly, disabled children and unemployed and homeless people, among others.
But while the fund helps a variety of people, a number of donors wrote that they worried most about young women struggling to raise children on their own.
Hope Cobb of Princeton, N.J., sent $350 for single mothers and wrote, "I know from my own experience how difficult this situation is, even if your financial situation is reasonably good." She said that she had been a single mother of two children and that it had been very trying, even without financial difficulties.
A $120 gift from Elizabeth Lipman of Brooklyn was also intended for a single mother. "I am grateful that my husband and I can share the responsibilities of having two children, and I feel for women, especially poor women, who must try to care for their children alone."
There was also $50 from Caroline A. Westerfield of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who asked that the money be used to give a poor teen-age mother some diapers and baby formula.
One donor, Cindy Coopersmith, of New City, N.Y., wrote that the problems of single mothers are sometimes complicated by a history of physical and sexual abuse. "As a woman who was herself abused, I hope I can offer some small measure of comfort to someone who is trying to climb out of the pit of despair and depression that are the consequences of abuse," she wrote.
This was Ms. Coopersmith's first donation to the Neediest Cases, and she said it was inspired by the recent birth of her granddaughter.
"I know the $25 I give can't do much, but I hope it encourages another woman to stand on her own two feet," she said. "I hope that it makes her realize that someone cares."

HEADLINE: Hostility Toward Arabs and Jews Is Found on Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Crimes of hate against Arabs and Jews rose to record levels in 1990, Arab-American and Jewish organizations said in separate reports today.
Arab-American leaders said ethnic animosities against Arabs in the United States had been aggravated by events like the tensions in the Persian Gulf that led to war in January. 
 Jewish leaders cited a complicated mixture of factors, including a worsening economy, anti-Israel attitudes by some Americans and a loosening of social restraints on expressions of hatred, exemplified by the verbal assaults of the comedian Andrew Dice Clay and the graphically violent lyrics of musical groups like 2 Live Crew.
The reports catalogued thousands of acts against Arabs and Jews, from the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York last November to the gunshots fired into the car of a Palestinian family in Kansas City last September.
The groups issuing the reports were the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the largest Arab-American rights organization in the United States, and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, a human rights organization established to combat anti-Semitism.
 
'Sharp Level of Public Hostility'
 The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said that it had logged fewer than five anti-Arab incidents before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but more than 40 complaints by the end of the year.
"The crisis in the Persian Gulf produced a sharp level of public hostility toward Arabs and and Arab-Americans," the report said.
Albert Mokhiber, president of the group, said no clear patterns of harassment have emerged to explain which Arab-Americans are likely to be victimized. "It is as though Arabs are put into one bag and shaken up and one is picked out to be targeted," he said.
The group also released an updated summary of anti-Arab acts since January. It said it logged nearly 60 incidents, including threatening phone calls, assaults and an arson fire at a restaurant in Michigan owned by an Arab-American.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged that it is investigating about 30 civil rights complaints involving Arab-Americans filed since last August. The number of active criminal investigations by the bureau is much smaller than the number of complaints to the anti-discrimination committee, which keeps track of many anti-Arab incidents that may not be considered a Federal crime.
 In its report, the Anti-Defamation League said that its nationwide survey of incidents against Jews rose for the fourth straight year, to 1,685. The report noted a "particularly troubling" increase of bias-related incidents on college campuses.
"Anti-Semitic and racist attacks are particularly troubling when they occur in a university environment devoted to respect for diverse ideas, people and cultures," said Abraham H. Foxman, the league's national director.
The audit, conducted annually since 1979, said there were 927 incidents of anti-Jewish vandalism and 758 acts of harrassment, threats or assaults against Jews or Jewish institutions. The total represented an 18 percent increase over the 1989 total of 1,432 incidents.
On college campuses, the league reported a total of 95 incidents at 56 institutions in 1990 as against 69 incidents at 54 campuses in 1989. The acts were directed against Jewish students and faculty members as well as places of Jewish activity, like Jewish fraternities and sororities.
The report also noted a decrease in one category, anti-Semitic attacks attributed to neo-Nazi skinheads, which declined by 27 percent. The report said that agressive law-enforcement efforts were responsible for discouraging such incidents.
In explaining the reason for the record level of anti-Semitic acts, the report cited "a coarsening of public expression and popular culture" and said this had combined with a deteriorating economy, which has traditionally heightened social frictions.
Grace Flores-Hughes, the director of the Justice Department's Community Relations Service, said today that the department had detected similar patterns of hate violence, in part through such mechanisms as the hate-crime telephone hotline, which was established year to encourage the reporting of hate crimes. Other officials said the department was investigating about 2,000 complaints of civil rights abuses, including an undetermined number of hate crimes against Arabs and Jews.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Down Again Despite Central Bank Efforts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slid to a postwar low against the German mark and a 10-year low against the British pound yesterday, despite attempts by central banks of leading industrial nations to support the currency.
The dollar's fall in recent days has been prompted by the belief that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates even further to stimulate the economy. Lower domestic rates tend to decrease the value of the dollar since dollar-denominated investments earn less interest than investments made in nations with higher interest rates. 
 The Fed on Friday cut its discount rate, the interest it charges on loans to banks, and the action prompted many large banks to reduce their prime lending rate.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said yesterday that he would like to see interest rates fall further.
The Fed's action contrasts sharply with recent moves by the central bank of Germany, the Bundesbank, to raise its interest rates, making the mark more attractive. The interest paid on six-month government securities in Germany is about 2.5 percentage points higher than the comparable United States Treasury note.
Central banks from a number of nations, including the Fed, bought dollars yesterday by selling marks, but that did little to brake the dollar's slide, currency traders said.
The dollar stood at 1.4483 marks in domestic trading at late afternoon, a new postwar low, down from 1.4577 marks on Tuesday. The previous low of 1.4560 marks was set on Monday.
The pound strengthened against the dollar, crossing the $2 level in a rate not seen since 1981. One pound cost $2.0035 in New York yesterday, up from $1.9920 late on Tuesday.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell in New York to 128.13 yen, its lowest level in many months, from 129.48 yen on Tuesday.
On the future direction of the dollar, one trader said he did not think the dollar's fall had been broken.
"The interest-rate differentials will continue to widen, and that will continue to cause the dollar to drop further," said John McCarthy, the chief currency dealer at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York.
But Lawrence A. Kudlow, the chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, said he was not overly concerned by the dollar's decline. The American stock and bond markets "have been rallying very strongly despite the drop in the dollar," he said, "and the reason for that is lower domestic inflation expectations and lower interest rates,"
He said, however, that the situation that prompted the dollar's fall showed the need for better coordination of interest rate policies of the leading industrial nations.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Tuesday, included: 1.2316 Swiss francs, down from 1.2430; 4.9325 French francs, down from 4.9625; 1,088.50 Italian lire, down from 1,095.75, and 1.1575 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1583.
Gold prices, meanwhile, fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold fetched $362.90 an ounce, down $3.50 from Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Welfare Suit Could Hurt Cuomo Budget

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed budget does not plan for the possibility that a judge will order the state to increase its welfare grant this year, a ruling that could add hundreds of millions of dollars to New York's $6 billion budget gap.
A trial in the case, Jiggetts v. Grinker, is to begin on March 4 in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It will determine whether the state's shelter allowance, a component of the welfare grant, is sufficient to prevent homelessness, as is required by state law. 
 The judge, Karla Moskowitz, seemed to signal her inclination in the case when she granted a preliminary injunction in 1988 and wrote that the shelter allowance in New York City was "totally inadequate."
But despite a 1990 Court of Appeals decision affirming Justice Moskowitz's authority to determine the adequacy of the shelter allowance, the Cuomo administration chose not to deal with the issue in its budget for the 1992 fiscal year.
 
Assumptions for Revenue
 The lack of contingency planning for the court ruling reflects one of several risky assumptions that could upset the fragile balance of Mr. Cuomo's $29.15 billion budget, even if the Governor is able to sidestep the many political mines planted in the Legislature.
The budget's revenue forecasts are based on projections that national economic growth will resume after mid-year and that the war in the Persian Gulf will end "within the next six months or so."
It includes no money for raises for state employees in a year when the state must negotiate new contracts with its largest public employee unions. And it relies on $875 million in Medicaid cuts that may be difficult to achieve because the recession is expanding the state's caseload.
The Jiggetts case poses an immediate threat, and Matthew Diller, the Legal Aid Society lawyer representing the welfare recipients who filed the lawsuit, said the Governor had opted for a budgetary stalling tactic by refusing to address it.
 
Cuomo Sees Few Options
 "Trying to prove that $312 is an inadequate rent subsidy for a family of four in New York City is like proving that the sky is blue," he said. "But we'll have this trial, and when they lose they'll appeal and delay it longer."
Mr. Cuomo's press secretary, Anne W. Crowley, said the fiscal reality of the state's budget shortfall left the Governor with few options.
"The alternative would have been to set aside money for a case that we have not conceded when the money is needed for other programs, particularly in these difficult fiscal times," she said.
The potential cost of losing the Jiggetts case is uncertain, but state officials have made rough calculations.
If Justice Moskowitz orders the state to pay 100 percent of the rents currently being paid by the state's 1.3 million welfare recipients, the increase could add between $90 million and $140 million to the state's $3 billion annual welfare expenditures, according to a Cuomo administration source. If she ordered the state to pay average fair-market rents, the cost could be twice as high.
 
30 Welfare Recipients
 A 1935 law says the shelter allowance "shall be adequate" to provide for the proper upbringing of children, but it provides little definition of adequacy. The Court of Appeals ruled that assistance levels have to be high enough to keep families with dependent children from becoming homeless.
The Jiggetts case was filed in 1987 by 30 welfare recipients in New York City, including Barbara Jiggetts, who faced eviction because their shelter allowances did not cover their rents. Many were forced to pay rent with a part of their welfare grant that is intended for food and clothing.
The shelter allowance, which varies by county and by family size, has been raised by the Legislature twice since 1975. But a recent study by the State Communities Aid Association shows that it remains far below average fair-market rents in both urban and rural counties.
The study showed, for instance, that the full welfare grant of $577 for a family of three in New York City, which includes a basic grant, the shelter allowance and two energy grants, would barely cover the city's average fair-market rent of $504, which was calculated by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. The situation is analogous in Suffolk and Westchester Counties, where lawsuits similar to the Jiggetts case have been filed.
One alternative that has been discussed by the Cuomo administration is consolidating the components of the welfare grant into a single payment. But administration officials and social service advocates agree that such a move could be viewed as a cynical legal maneuver unless it was accompanied by a significant increase in the size of the grant.
"You would probably make the lawsuit moot because there wouldn't be a shelter allowance," said one Cuomo aide. "But you wouldn't do anything to help the people out there unless you consolidate it and do an increase."

Pilots at Northwest To Weigh Concessions

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EAGAN, Minn., Feb. 6

 BODY:
The pilots for Northwest Airlines have agreed to negotiate contract concessions because of the carrier's worsening financial condition.
The move by the 5,600-member union came on Tuesday, a day after union officials met with Northwest's chairman, Alfred A. Checchi, and chief executive, John Dasburg, for more than three hours. 
 "Obviously, we realize the company is bleeding," said Peter Dodge, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association's 17-member master executive council at Northwest. The council voted unanimously to provide relief.
Possible areas for concessions include reductions in pay, pensions and benefits and relaxation of work rules.
Neither the comany nor union officials would discuss the extent of the airline's financial problems.
A Northwest spokeswoman said the carrier suffered from the same problems as the whole industry: a sluggish economy, high fuel prices and reduced air travel because of the Persian Gulf war.
"Things are worse than we want to believe they are in terms of cash flow," said Bruce Retrum, secretary-treasurer of Local 2747 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents the airline's 8,600 flight attendants.
Last week, Northwest and the flight attendants' union agreed to a leave-of-absence program that would reduce payroll expenses for the next two months. Mr. Retrum said about 400 flight attendants had signed up.
"We're trying to get people off the payroll on a temporary and voluntary basis," Mr. Retrum said. "Push is going to come to shove if we don't."
Leaders of Northwest's 26,000-member machinists' union also said they were working with the company to trim costs.
